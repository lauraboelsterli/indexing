FILE PHOTO - RC Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal (L) with the mayor of Toulon Hubert Falco, Rugby Union - RC Toulon Press Conference - European Rugby Champions Cup Final Preview - Twickenham Stadium - 1/5/15 Action Images via Reuters / Matthew Childs \n“EPCR is currently investigating comments attributed to RC Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal,” the Champions Cup organisers said in a statement. \n“If EPCR feels that these comments are inappropriate... Mr Boudjellal could face disciplinary action.” \nBastareaud made the comments during a 36-0 Champions Cup victory against Benetton Treviso on Sunday before apologising on social media. \nBoudjellal, however, told French rugby website rugbyrama.fr: “At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question. I am not homophobic but I have already called someone a faggot. It’s become customary, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an altercation.” Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
