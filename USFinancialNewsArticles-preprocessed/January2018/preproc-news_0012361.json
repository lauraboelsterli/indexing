The reserve fund is part of the country’s gold and forex reserves that stood at $432 billion as of Dec. 22. \nThe finance ministry said it will terminate the reserve fund, accumulated over years of high oil prices, from Feb. 1. \nThe ministry also said the National Wealth Fund, which is designed to help balance the pension system, fell to $65.15 billion as of Jan. 1. from $66.94 billion as of Dec. 1.
