    "text": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said on Monday they have charged 1,004 children and young people for sharing video clips of two 15-year-olds having sex, following a tip-off from Facebook.\nThey said it could constitute distribution of child pornography even though the age of consent in Denmark is 15.\nThe two video clips were shared through Facebookâ€™s Messenger chat-platform in the autumn and the company advised the U.S. authorities about it, as it is obliged to.\nThe tip-off was then passed on to Denmark via Interpol.\nMost of the young people charged have only shared the videos a few times whereas as some have shared them several hundred times, police said.\nLIF Reporting by Teis Jensen, editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen/Jeremy Gaunt\n ",
