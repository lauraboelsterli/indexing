Roger brings a special interest and successful background in workforce optimization technologies including workforce management, customer analytics, and other customer experience solutions. Roger has been tasked with building stronger brand awareness, creating differentiated messaging, and helping expand our strategic partnerships to achieve the company’s goals and increase market share. Prior to joining WFMSG, Roger held key marketing positions with Verint Systems and etalk Corporation.\n“After four straight years of over twenty percent revenue growth, we are excited about adding an industry marketing leader to help us achieve our future revenue projections,” said Daryl Gonos, WFMSG Principal. “Building the WFMSG Community brand is paramount to our continued success and we look forward to the experience Roger will bring to help us reach our goals.”\nAs customers look for cloud-based workforce management solutions that are cost effective, easy to implement, and offer a unique set of features, they are shifting away from traditional offerings to alternative solutions.

I couldn’t be happier about joining the WFMSG team and leading the marketing efforts.”\nTo accommodate WFMSG’s expansion plans, the company recently moved its headquarters to a larger office located in Richardson, Texas.
