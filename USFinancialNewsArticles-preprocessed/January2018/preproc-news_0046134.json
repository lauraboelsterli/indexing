    "text": "Gold prices fell Friday, with some investors taking profits after a recent rally sent the precious metal to its highest level since August 2016.\nFront-month gold for January delivery declined 0.8% to $1,351.60 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The dollar falling to its lowest level in more than two years has supported the precious metal of late amid international trade concerns because a weaker dollar makes gold and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for overseas buyers.\n ",
