    "text": " 28 AM / Updated an hour ago CityFibre and Vodafone pick UK's Milton Keynes for fibre push Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Fibre broadband provider CityFibre ( CITYC.L ) said it had picked the English new town of Milton Keynes to launch its gigabit-capable home fibre network in partnership with Vodafone ( VOD.L ). \nCityFibre will invest at least 40 million pounds in building its network in Milton Keynes, the first roll-out in a plan to connect around 12 cities and 1 million premises with fast broadband marketed by Vodafone. \nThe two companies announced their partnership in November, putting pressure on Britain’s biggest network provider, BT’s ( BT.L ) Openreach, which nearly all operators rely on to provide broadband connections in Britain. \n($1 = 0.7241 pounds)",
