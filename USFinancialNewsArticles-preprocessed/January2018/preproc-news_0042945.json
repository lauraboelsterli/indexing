    "text": "CARACAS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Venezuela will relaunch its DICOM exchange rate on Thursday, Vice President Tareck El Aissami said at a press conference.\nHe did not specify the rate. DICOM is the weaker of the governmentâ€™s two official exchange mechanisms, currently at 3,345 bolivars per dollar.\nThe stronger DIPRO rate is at 10 per dollar, a far cry from the black market rate where a dollar buys more than 260,000 bolivars.
