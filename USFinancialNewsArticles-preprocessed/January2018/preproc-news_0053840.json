The S&P 500 lost 8.43 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,864.44 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.14 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,490.63.\nFive-year German bond yields turned positive for the first time since late 2015 and yields across the euro area hit fresh highs after Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot said the ECB should make clear it would end its bond purchases this year.\nKnot said on Sunday the ECB should end its asset purchases after the current bond-buying program ends in September, adding: “There is no reason whatsoever to continue the program.”\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest in more than two-years at 0.625 percent.\nThe rise in government bond rates could stall the equity market rally and lead the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee to raise interest rates faster than expected this year, said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund.\n“If Treasuries cross the psychologically significant 3.0 percent threshold in the coming weeks, I would expect the broader equity markets to begin considering the risk of an acceleration in the pace of FOMC hikes,” Terwilliger said.\nReuters data point to market expectations of about three more Fed rate hikes this year, starting in March, although some analysts, including at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Asset Management, expect the Fed to raise four times.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.7048 percent, up from 2.662 percent late on Friday.\nThe dollar rose against a basket of currencies as bond yields climbed. The dollar index rose 0.4 percent, with the euro down 0.4 percent to $1.2369. The Japanese yen eased 0.34 percent versus the greenback at 109.08.\nOil prices slipped 1.5 percent, pressured by a strengthening dollar and rising U.S. crude output, but prices remained on track for the biggest January increase in five years.\nBrent crude futures were down $1.15 at $69.37 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were 64 cents lower at $65.50 a barrel.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
