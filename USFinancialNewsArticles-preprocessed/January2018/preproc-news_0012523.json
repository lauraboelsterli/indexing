The proposed acquisition was announced on November 16, 2017.\n\"This important milestone brings us one step closer to completing this acquisition, which is part of our post-emergence, inorganic growth strategy,\" said Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Caesars Entertainment. \"In addition to expanding our gaming footprint, Caesars Entertainment has a strong track record of operating gaming facilities with horse tracks as successful integrated operations, which benefit horsemen, local communities and the state at large.
