    "text": "Published: Jan 27, 2018 3:12 p.m. ET Share \nRepublicans moved quickly as Democrats began attacking opponents with Wynn cash Reuters \nBy Rebecca Ballhaus \nRelated: Wynn Resorts shares tank after report of sexual misconduct by owner Steve Wynn \n“Today I accepted Steve Wynn’s resignation as Republican National Committee finance chair,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. \nThe Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that shortly after Wynn opened his flagship Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, a manicurist who worked there told a colleague Mr. Wynn forced her to have sex. The casino billionaire later paid the manicurist a $7.5 million settlement, the Journal reported. \nBeyond that incident, dozens of people the Journal interviewed who have worked at Wynn’s casinos described a pattern of sexual misconduct. \nWynn denied the accusations, saying, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.” A spokesman for Wynn didn’t immediately return a request for comment on his resignation from the RNC.
