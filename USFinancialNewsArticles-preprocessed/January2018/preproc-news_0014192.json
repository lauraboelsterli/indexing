    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told executives from financial services firms on Thursday that they are a priority in the upcoming Brexit talks with the European Union, sources familiar with a meeting held in Downing Street said.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May walks through the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust's (WWT) grounds ahead of a speech to launch the government's environment plan at the London Wetland Centre in west London, Britain, January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Dan Kitwood/Pool “It was an encouraging, positive meeting,” a banker briefed on the talks told Reuters. “It felt like the meeting was about telling the finance industry ‘you are a priority for us’.”\nLast year bankers complained that they were not being listened to by May’s government as Britain prepared for Brexit, which is due to happen in March 2019.\nRelated Coverage Bankers demand more Brexit clarity at meeting with UK PM May\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill.
