    "text": "NOVATO, Calif., Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (NASDAQ:HNNA) today reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, and announced an increased quarterly dividend.\nSummary Highlights\nFully diluted earnings per share of $1.04, an increase of 100% over the prior comparable quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was passed during our first fiscal quarter, required us to re-assess our deferred tax liability to account for the future impact of a lower corporate tax rate. As a result, we recorded a large, one-time adjustment in the quarter, which created a tax benefit of approximately $4 million. Total revenue of $13.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior comparable quarter. Total assets under management increased 5% over the prior comparable quarter. Average assets under management, upon which revenue is earned, increased 3% over the prior comparable quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, an increase of 33%, which will be paid on March 5, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2018. On December 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of two of the three Rainier U.S. Funds.

Read more about this by visiting our website at: http://hennessyadvisors.com/press/RainierClose1-12-18.htm\n\"We expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to favorably impact our net income, earnings per share and cash flows in the future due to a lower corporate tax rate. We are working diligently with our professional advisers to better understand those impacts for this fiscal year and beyond,\" said Neil Hennessy, President, Chairman, and CEO of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. \"In the meantime, we remain committed to our business model of pursuing strategic acquisitions, as evidenced by the recent close of the Rainier U.S. Funds transaction. We also remain committed to our dividend program, now in its fourteenth year, and are very pleased to reward our shareholders by increasing our cash dividend,\" he added.\n\"The U.S. stock market continued its steady rise throughout calendar year 2017. I believe we will see even more pro-business policies enacted and fewer regulations in the coming year, and that these changes coupled with the ingenuity of business leaders in the U.S. will drive our economy and the stock market to another year of solid returns in 2018,\" said Mr. Hennessy.\nHennessy Advisors, Inc.\nFinancial Highlights\nPeriod to Period\nThree Months Ended\nFirst Quarter\nDec. 31, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal Revenue\n$ 13,812,840\n$ 13,294,072\n$ 518,768\n3.9%\nNet Income\n$ 8,186,684\n$ 3,995,598\n$ 4,191,086\n104.9%\nEarnings Per Share (Diluted)\n$ 1.04\n$ 0.52\n$ 0.52\n100.0%\nWeighted Average Number of\nShares Outstanding (Diluted)\n7,842,707\n7,756,053\n86,654\n1.1%\nMutual Fund Average Assets\nUnder Management\n$ 6,756,849,836\n$ 6,539,432,471\n$ 217,417,365\n3.3%\nAt Period Ending Date\nDec. 31, 2017\nDec. 31, 2016\n$ Change\n% Change\nMutual Fund Total Assets\nUnder Management\n$ 6,923,993,186\n$ 6,592,588,760\n$ 331,404,426\n5.0%\nAbout Hennessy Advisors, Inc.\nHennessy Advisors, Inc. is a publicly traded investment manager offering a broad range of domestic equity, multi-asset, and sector and specialty mutual funds.
