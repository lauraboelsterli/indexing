    "text": "Everything in markets seems to be going up, but everything is richly valued. If you still want to buy in, what to do?\nOne way is to ask what has really changed recently in the global economy. The answer: Factories everywhere are now running very hot. Run rates notched post-GFC highs last quarter in the U.S. and the European Union, and a post-2011 high in China. At the same time, commodity prices, though rising, remain far below this decade’s highs: U.S. oil, at $65 barrel now, is still some 43% below its 2011 peak.\n ",
