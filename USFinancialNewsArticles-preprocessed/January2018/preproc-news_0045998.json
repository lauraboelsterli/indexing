    "text": "FREMONT, CA., Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, stated today that William B. Horne, a member of the Board of Directors, has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President for DPW and all its subsidiaries. Mr. Horne will remain a member of the Board of Directors for DPW and replaces Mr. Amos Kohn who served as interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kohn will remain President and a member of the Board of Directors for DPW. The Company filed a report on Form 8-K with the SEC on January 25, 2018 disclosing these changes and other information.\nThe Company was pleased to also report a few changes with its Board of Directors including the addition of its newest independent director, Mr. Jeff Bentz. Mr. Bentz is an experienced businessman who has served since 1994 as President of North Star Terminal & Stevedore Company, a full-service stevedoring company located in Alaska and whose major areas of business include terminal operations and management, stevedore services, and heavy equipment operations. He also has served as a director and advisor to several private companies and agencies. Mr. Bentz said, “I am excited to join the Board of Directors of DPW and look forward to using my many years of varying experience in operating and growing businesses for a company that has opportunities for growth while seeking improvement in its operations as it integrates newly purchased businesses as well as those yet to be acquired. Mr. Bentz replaces Kristine L. Ault who concurrently resigned from the Board of Directors and was thanked by the Company for her service and support for the past year including her leadership in having the company’s largest shareholder provide the necessary funds and other resources so the Company could maintain the standard listing requirement with its national securities exchange, the NYSE American.\n“When Philou Ventures acquired the control position of DPW and replaced the Company’s former Chairman, it became an important task and goal to retain William B. Horne as the CFO for DPW. Although it has taken some time to accomplish, Mr. Horne possesses the skill set, acumen and experience not often seen within the small cap market sector,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the CEO and Chairman of DPW Holdings, Inc. Ault continued, “The Company today continues to acquire multiple subsidiaries and conducts more business than ever before, both domestically and internationally, with complex corporate issues and public financial and segment reporting required. With Mr. Horne’s extensive venture capital background and audit experience with Price Waterhouse LLP, I believe there is no better choice.”\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Fremont, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc., www.DPWHoldings.com , is a diversified holding company that, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Coolisys Technologies, Inc., is dedicated to providing world-class technology-based solutions where innovation is the main driver for mission-critical applications and lifesaving services.
