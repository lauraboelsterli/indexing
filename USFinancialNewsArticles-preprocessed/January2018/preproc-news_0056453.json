    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 9:19 AM / in 40 minutes China FX regulator says no fx derivatives short position at end-Dec, unchanged from Nov Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIJING, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange regulator said on Wednesday that it had no holdings of short foreign currency positions in forwards and futures versus the yuan at the end of December, in line with its November position. \nChina began reporting the data early last year, following speculation the central bank was using currency swaps and other derivatives to intervene in offshore forex markets to prop up the yuan. \nChina’s yuan ended the domestic session at a nearly 2-1/2-year high against the dollar on Wednesday, and is poised for the biggest monthly gain in nearly a quarter of a century.
