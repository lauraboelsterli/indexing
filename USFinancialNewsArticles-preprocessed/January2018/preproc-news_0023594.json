    "text": "January 16, 2018 / 8:37 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Wenger called referee 'a disgrace' and 'not honest' Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said referee Mike Dean was “a disgrace” and “not honest” following December’s Premier League game at West Bromwich Albion, the official said in his report, part of which was published by the FA on Tuesday.

He replied, ‘I maintain what I say, you’re not honest’.
