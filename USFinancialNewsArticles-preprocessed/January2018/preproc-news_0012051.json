This week’s announcement, first reported by People’s Daily, set the date and other details. \nBy Yoko Kubota \nBEIJING—Apple Inc. said it will turn over its cloud operations in China to a state-owned local partner Feb. 28, complying with Chinese law mandating that customer data collected on the mainland be stored here. \nWith the handover, photos, documents and messages uploaded by Apple AAPL, -0.36% users throughout China will be stored at a data center in the southwest province of Guizhou operated by the local partner, Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry Co., Ltd. \nCustomers who log on to the Chinese iCloud service are notified of the change, and informed that they can either keep using iCloud or deactivate it on Feb. 28. \nApple said that over the next seven weeks it will seek to make sure customers know about the coming changes, adding that the company “has strong data-privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems.” \nChina has tightened its cloud-computing oversight, saying it needs to ensure the privacy of its citizens’ data. Late last year, to comply with the new rules, Amazon Inc.’s AMZN, -0.22% Amazon Web Services unit sold computing equipment used for its cloud services in China to its local partner. ",
