    "text": "(Reuters) - Sanofi SA is close to a deal to take over U.S. drug maker Bioverativ Inc for more than $11.5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe potential deal, which could be announced as soon as Monday, would value Bioverativ at about $105 a share, the Journal reported. ( on.wsj.com/2mYJulp )\nThe price represents a 64 percent premium to Bioverativ stockâ€™s close on Friday on the Nasdaq.\nBioverativ, a hemophilia drug maker, was separated from Biogen Inc early last year.\nSanofi has failed to land major deals after losing California-based cancer specialist Medivation to Pfizer Inc in 2016 and Swiss biotech company Actelion to Johnson & Johnson last year.\nEarlier this month, Sanofi said it obtained the right to develop and sell a new hemophilia drug in a restructuring of its partnership with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.\nSanofi and Bioverativ were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.\nReporting by Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru; Editing by Paul Simao and Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
