A 20 percent tariff will apply on the first 1.2 million imported washers in the first year, and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number. A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells and modules above 2.5 gigawatts in the first year. Reporting by David Lawder; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Mohammad Zargham",
