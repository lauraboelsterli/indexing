Strategically located near several major tech employers, including Airbnb and Adobe, Alta Potrero Hill is also just blocks away from public bus lines and a mile from both the 16th Street Bart Station and the 22nd Street Caltrain station.\n\"The Showplace Square District and Potrero Hill align perfectly with our approach to building communities that aim to complement and enhance surrounding neighborhoods,\" said Brian Pianca, Development Director for Wood Partners. \"We're excited to bring Alta Potrero Hill to San Francisco and add to our growing Bay Area portfolio.\"\nThe 172-unit community will consist of over 40 percent family-sized units, that are two bedrooms or bigger, with the average size of the units being 800 square feet. 29 of the units will be below market rate.\nThe seven-story building will include 8,000 square feet of rooftop deck with 360-degree skyline views. There will also be parking spaces for 65 percent of residents and bicycle parking spaces available for each unit.\nAlta Potrero Hill will consist of approximately 6,700 square feet of ground-floor retail and PDR space for artisans and craftsmen. This is the second Wood Partners project in San Francisco and the sixth project in the Bay Area.\nFor more information please visit www.woodpartners.com .\nAbout Wood Partners\nWood Partners is a national real estate development company that acquires, develops, constructs and property manages high density and mixed-use communities.
