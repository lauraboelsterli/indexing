    "text": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remains optimistic about potential agreements with Washington Republicans on the budget and immigration, though she is skeptical that a White House meeting on immigration on Tuesday will produce a breakthrough.\nThe California Democrat told reporters in her Capitol office on Monday that \"we just have to come together and we will\" on a long-delayed budget pact to boost funding for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies, which face a severe budget crunch otherwise.\nShe also said that there's room for compromise on immigration, including protections for young immigrants who were brought into the country illegally, border security and stricter rules sought by Republicans regarding preferential treatment for the relatives of legal immigrants who are seeking to join them in the U.S.",
