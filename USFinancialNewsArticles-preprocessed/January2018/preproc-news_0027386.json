    "text": "(Reuters) - Shari Redstone has discussed adding new directors to the board of CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) as she renews her push to merge the company with Viacom Inc ( VIAB.O ), The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.\nCBS and Viacom are both controlled by ailing Sumner Redstone, 94, and his daughter Shari, through their privately owned movie theatre company, National Amusements Inc. The Redstones attempted to merge the two companies in 2016 but the effort failed.\nShari Redstone has had exploratory conversations with CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves and directors about recombining the companies, sources have told Reuters.\nWhile Moonves is receptive to a combination, he has some reservations, sources have told Reuters.\nA CBS spokesman was not immediately available for comment. A Viacom spokesman declined to comment.\nCBSâ€™s annual shareholder meeting is set for May. CBS is looking to replace several of its directors at that meeting and Shari Redstone is gathering names of possible candidates, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nReporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
