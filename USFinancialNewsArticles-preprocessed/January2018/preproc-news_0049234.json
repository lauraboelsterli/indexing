    "text": "January 28, 2018 / 4:57 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Bailey scores again as Leverkusen are back in second Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Bayer Leverkusen struck twice in the second half to beat Mainz 05 2-0 on Sunday and reclaim second place in the Bundesliga on goal difference from Schalke 04. \nLeon Bailey fired them into the lead with a 20-metre missile three minutes after the restart with the sensational 20-year-old Jamaican taking his goal tally to eight this season. \nWendell added another with a penalty in the 68th as Leverkusen equalled a club record of having scored in their last 25 consecutive Bundesliga matches. \nArgentine Lucas Alario should have grabbed a late goal but keeper Robin Zentner kicked his bouncing close-range header wide. \nThe result lifted them to second place and 34 points, as many as third-placed Schalke 04, and one point ahead of Eintracht Frankfurt. \nLeverkusen have now lost just once in their last 15 league games. \nBayern Munich are on track for a record-extending sixth consecutive Bundesliga title after coming from 2-0 down to crush Hoffenheim 5-2 on Saturday to stay 16 points clear at the top on 50.
