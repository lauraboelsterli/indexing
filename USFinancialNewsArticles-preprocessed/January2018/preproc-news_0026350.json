    "text": "James Patterson \n\n“Some people believe that if something is very popular, it can’t be very good. I don’t agree. When something is popular I’m always curious about it. Harry Potter worked for me. 50 Shades and Twilight didn’t work so well. In general, the rule for success is story, story, story. When I write, I imagine one person sitting across from me. I’m telling a story, and I don’t want them to get up until I finish. If I succeed, then I have a sense that I’ll be popular. Ironically, my popularity actually makes me unpopular...  ",
