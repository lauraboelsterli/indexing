    "text": "January 9, 2018 / 6:16 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago South Africa's Zuma says commission to look into claims of state influence peddling Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday he would set up a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government and state institutions. President of South Africa Jacob Zuma attends the 54th National Conference of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa December 17, 2017. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko \nThe presidentâ€™s move follows a court ruling on Dec. 13 that required a commission to be set up within 30 days to carry out such an inquiry. That order upheld a recommendation in a 2016 report by the then Public Protector, whose role is to protect standards in public life. Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Gareth Jones",
