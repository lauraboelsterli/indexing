    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was \"looking forward\" to being interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's team of prosecutors.\nAs he left the White House en route to Davos, Switzerland, Trump spoke to reporters, and said that according to his lawyers, he expected to talk to Mueller's team in two or three weeks, according to NBC News' Kristen Welker.\n\"I would love to do it, and I would like to do it as soon as possible,\" Trump said. \"I would do it under oath, absolutely.\"\nWhite House lawyer Ty Cobb told The New York Times that the president would be \"guided by the advice of his personal counsel,\" adding that the two sides were in the process of working out arrangements. Cobb said, however, that Trump's remarks were rushed and that the president was not volunteering to testify before a grand jury, the Times reported.\nTrump also said that he did not recall asking Andrew McCabe, Deputy Director of the FBI, who he voted for in the 2016 election.\nThe remarks represent an apparent shift from the president's position on January 10, when he said, \"We'll see what happens,\" when asked about whether he'd be willing to be interviewed by Mueller's team.\nshow chapters Trump: Looking forward to talking to Mueller 20 Hours Ago | 00:21 \"When they have no collusion, and nobody has found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you would even have an interview,\" Trump said at the time.\nTrump also dismissed suggestions on Wednesday that he may have committed obstruction of justice by firing former FBI director James Comey. 'You fight back, [and] 'Oh it's obstruction,'\" Trump said.",
