The artists who have created works include Tracey Emin, Alaa Minawi, Julian Opie and Miguel Chevalier. \n“We’ve basically taken the centre of London and turned it into a giant, outdoor art gallery,” said Helen Marriage, artistic director of Lumiere London. Slideshow (9 Images) \n“There are 58 installations all created by artists working with light in wonderful and extraordinary ways and people are free to wander; it’s free to experience.” \nThe works themselves comprise a range of installations, including a giant desk lamp in King’s Cross, a triangular tunnel of light on the South Bank and one of London’s iconic telephone boxes turned into an illuminated fish tank in Seven Dials. \nLumiere London runs Jan. 18-21.
