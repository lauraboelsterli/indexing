    "text": "ANKARA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The United States needs to withdraw from northern Syriaâ€™s Manbij region immediately, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq, including Manbij - a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.\nSpeaking to reporters, Cavusoglu also said Turkey wanted to see concrete steps by the United States to end its support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.\nAnkara said earlier it had been told by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster that Washington would not provide the YPG with weapons anymore. (Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Mark Potter)\n ",
