    "text": "DETROIT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV vice president Alphons Iacobelli is expected to plead guilty in connection with a U.S. federal investigation into allegations he made at least $1.2 million in improper payments to a former union vice president and his wife, a person briefed on the matter said Tuesday.\nIacobelli, a former Fiat Chrysler vice president of employee relations, was charged in July in U.S. District Court in Detroit with taking part in a conspiracy to pay prohibited money and gifts to United Auto Workers union officials. A not guilty plea was initially entered on his behalf in August but he did not comment when asked by reporters about the case.\nA court notice made public Tuesday said Iacobelli is scheduled to enter a new plea on Jan. 22, but the details of the plea agreement are not known. A lawyer for Iacobelli declined to comment. The U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office in Detroit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
