It surrendered almost all its gains from Tuesday, made after a Reuters report that U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group was in talks to buy a 55 percent stake in the Canadian company's Financial and Risk business. The companies confirmed the report after markets closed on Tuesday. * Base metals company Nevsun Resources was the second-biggest decliner, falling 5.8 percent, after saying it would suspend its dividend and redeploy capital toward growth. * Energy companies Crew Energy , Advantage Oil & Gas , Kelt Exploration , Freehold Royalties and TORC Oil and Gas were also among the top 10 decliners. * U.S. crude futures fell as much as 1.3 percent, but inched 0.2 percent higher to $64.65 a barrel as of 12:09 p.m. EST (1709 GMT). * Gold producer Endeavor Mining was the biggest gainer, rising 4.5 percent, followed by cannabis producer Aphria , with a 4.1 percent gain. * Gold prices rose 0.3 percent to $1,341.75 an ounce.
