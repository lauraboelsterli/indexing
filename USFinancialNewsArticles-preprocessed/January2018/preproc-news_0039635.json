    "text": "HONOLULU, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (NYSE: ALEX)(\"A&B\" or \"Company\") today announced the tax allocations of 2017 dividend distributions on its common shares. The table below, presented on a per share basis, is provided for informational purposes only and should only be used to clarify the information on Form 1099-DIV.\nCommon Shares (CUSIP # 014491104)\nOrdinary Income Taxable in 2017\nReportable in\n2018\nEx-Dividend\nDate\nRecord Date\nPayable Date\nDistribution\nper Share\nTotal\nNon-Qualified\nQualified\nTotal\n2/2/2017\n2/6/2017\n3/2/2017\n$\n0.070000\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n5/4/2017\n5/8/2017\n6/1/2017\n$\n0.070000\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n8/3/2017\n8/7/2017\n9/7/2017\n$\n0.070000\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n$\n0.070000\n$\n—\n11/28/2017\n11/29/2017\n1/23/2018\n$\n15.921945\n$\n15.082859\n$\n0.650705\n$\n14.432154\n$\n0.839086\nTotals\n$\n16.131945\n$\n15.292859\n$\n0.650705\n$\n14.642154\n$\n0.839086\nShareholders of record should expect to receive IRS Form 1099-DIV (\"1099-DIV\") from Computershare, the Company's dividend paying agent. Shareholders of record will receive two 2017 1099-DIVs—one 1099-DIV relating to the Special Distribution paid on January 23, 2018 and an additional 1099-DIV relating to the quarterly dividends paid in 2017 prior to the Special Distribution. \"Street name\" shareholders should expect to receive their 1099-DIVs from their bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee. The amounts indicated on the 2017 1099-DIVs should be reported on shareholders' 2017 federal income tax returns.\nPlease note that a substantial portion of the January 23, 2018 Special Distribution is included in the tax allocations for 2017 and is therefore taxable for the 2017 tax year. Approximately 5.3% of the Special Distribution relates to the 2018 tax year. The final tax allocations for 2018 distributions will be provided in January 2019.\nInvestors are encouraged to seek legal and/or tax professional advice about the specific tax treatment of distributions paid by the Company for the 2017 and 2018 tax years.\nABOUT ALEXANDER & BALDWIN\nAlexander & Baldwin is Hawaii's premier commercial real estate company and the state's largest owner of grocery/drug-anchored retail centers.
