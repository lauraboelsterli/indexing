In 2008, she was promoted to her current role of deputy general counsel, where she helps shape and guide the company's regulatory strategic planning in Ohio and Kentucky. Spiller is also responsible for advancing Duke Energy's rate and regulatory initiatives before the Kentucky Public Service Commission and Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
