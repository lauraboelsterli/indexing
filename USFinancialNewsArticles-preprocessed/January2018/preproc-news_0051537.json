It is scheduled to be set up in February. \nJapan Post Bank senior management director Tokihiko Shimizu will become president of the new company, Japan Post Holdings’ chief executive Masatsugu Nagato told a news conference. \nJapan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance will provide a total of 90 billion yen to the new company as initial investment money, with an additional 30 billion yen expected to be raised from outside investors. \nThe new company will invest in domestic buyout deals and Nagato said it would initially invest in deals jointly with global private equity funds as it builds know-how in the field. \nNagato said Japan Post Bank has already made private equity investments as a limited partnership investor but the new company will make private equity investments as general partner, which can receive fund management fees. \nHe said the new company will have a staff of 30, adding it will also hire from outside of Japan Post companies. \nJapan Post Bank, which manages about 200 trillion yen in investment assets faces diminishing returns amid persistently low interest rate. As a unit of government-owned Japan Post Holdings, it is under strict regulation, including an effective ban on loan operations. \nJapan Post Insurance has an investment portfolio of about 80 trillion yen. $1 = 108.6000 yen Reporting by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Jacqueline Wong",
