At some point, my life as a footballer will come to an end, there will be other testing times, like sickness. \n“But learning not to exist anymore after feeling like you existed after what you had done before, it’s hard.” \nAfter leaving Hull City in January, 2015, Ben Arfa joined Nice for the 2015-16, scoring 17 goals from 34 league matches. \nHe has scored two goals from 15 caps with France between 2007-15.
