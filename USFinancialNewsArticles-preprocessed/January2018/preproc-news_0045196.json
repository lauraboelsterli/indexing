    "text": "FRESNO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Central Valley Community Bancorp (Company) (NASDAQ: CVCY), the parent company of Central Valley Community Bank (Bank), reported today unaudited consolidated net income of $14,026,000, and diluted earnings per common share of $1.10 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $15,182,000 and $1.33 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe Company completed its acquisition of Folsom Lake Bank on October 1, 2017. The Company recorded a one-time deferred tax revaluation expense of $3.54 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of $0.26 in the quarter and $0.28 for the year. Net loans increased $144.6 million or 19.35%, and total assets increased $218.3 million or 15.13% at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Total deposits increased 13.51% to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Total cost of deposits remain at record low levels at 0.08% and 0.09% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital positions remain strong at December 31, 2017 with a 9.71% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio; a 12.90% Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio; a 13.28% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio; and a 14.07% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio. Net loan charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $138,000, compared to net loan recoveries of $27,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company will consolidate two banking offices into branches currently serving the same communities - one in Visalia and one in Folsom.\n“We are pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial metrics. The merger with Folsom Lake Bank was completed on October 1, 2017, which contributed to the Company’s historic highs in Loans, Deposits and Pre-Tax earnings. All aspects of the merger are on target and integration plans are progressing well. The systems conversion is on schedule for early February,” stated James M. Ford, President & CEO of Central Valley Community Bank and Central Valley Community Bancorp.\n“Our expansion in the Greater Sacramento Region has set the stage for continued growth of the Company in 2018 and beyond. Notwithstanding the one-time Deferred Tax Asset write-down as a result of the 2017 tax law changes, the Company’s core business continues to expand, benefiting from our nearly 40-year community bank relationship model that’s consistently delivered throughout our territory,” continued Ford.\n“The strategic plan for 2018 includes consolidating two existing offices into branches in the same communities of Visalia and Folsom during the second quarter, allowing the Company’s cost structure to further improve and providing opportunity to invest in technology and continued growth initiatives throughout California’s San Joaquin Valley and the Greater Sacramento Region,” concluded Ford.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 7.61% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by an increase of $2,876,000 in provision for income taxes which was the result of the one-time non-cash adjustment to deferred taxes of $3,535,000 due to the prospective change in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded an increase in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, and an increase in net interest income, offset by an increase in non-interest expense compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a reverse provision for credit losses of $1,150,000, compared to a $5,850,000 reverse provision during the year ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $56,239,000, compared to $45,580,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $10,659,000 or 23.39%. Approximately $4,303,000 of the increase in net interest income was attributed to the Sierra Vista Bank (SVB) acquisition completed in 2016, $1,349,000 from the Folsom Lake Bank (FLB) acquisition completed in 2017, and approximately $5,007,000 from our continued organic growth. The impact to interest income from the accretion of the loan marks on acquired loans was $1,048,000 and $1,143,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, net interest income before the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 benefited from approximately $1,313,000 in income from prepayment penalties and payoff of loans previously on nonaccrual status, as compared to $586,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding these benefits, net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $9,932,000 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s shareholders’ equity increased $45,526,000, or 27.75%, compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in shareholders’ equity was driven by the issuance of equity in connection with the FLB acquisition, as well as the retention of earnings, net of dividends paid, and an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) securities recorded, net of estimated taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).\nReturn on average equity (ROE) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 7.69%, compared to 9.84% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in ROE was primarily the result of the one-time deferred tax revaluation expense, and the increase in shareholders’ equity. The Company declared and paid $0.24 per share in cash dividends to holders of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Annualized return on average assets (ROA) was 0.94% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 1.15% for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s total assets increased 15.13%, and total liabilities increased 13.51%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nOn October 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of FLB. With the FLB acquisition, the Company added two full service branches, located in Folsom, and Rancho Cordova. The FLB Roseville branch was consolidated with the Company’s Roseville branch in October 2017. The Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the FLB operations beginning October 1, 2017. Assets and liabilities acquired included loans of $117,815,000, net of a preliminary fair value mark of $4,057,000; bank premises and equipment of $561,000; and deposits of $171,948,000. The Company also recorded a core deposit intangible of $1,879,000, a premium on deposits of $132,000, and goodwill of $13,466,000 in the acquisition. The Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.277 million shares of its common stock to FLB shareholders. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 30, 2017 of $22.30 per share, the FLB common shareholders received aggregate merger consideration worth approximately $28.48 million.\nNon-performing assets increased by $403,000, or 15.85%, to $2,945,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $2,542,000 at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $602,000 in net loan recoveries, compared to $5,566,000 in net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net charge-off (recovery) ratio, which reflects annualized net recoveries to average loans, was (0.08)% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to (0.86)% for the same period in 2016. Total non-performing assets were 0.18% of total assets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for credit losses was $8,778,000, compared to $9,326,000 at December 31, 2016, a net decrease of $548,000 reflecting the reverse provision of $1,150,000 and the net recoveries during the period. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.97% at December 31, 2017, and 1.23% at December 31, 2016. Total loans includes loans acquired in the acquisitions of FLB on October 1, 2017, SVB on October 1, 2016 and Visalia Community Bank on July 1, 2013 that, at their respective acquisition dates, were recorded at fair value and did not have a related allowance for credit losses. The recorded value of acquired loans totaled $243,712,000 at December 31, 2017 and $168,296,000 at December 31, 2016. Excluding these acquired loans from the calculation, the allowance for credit losses to total gross loans was 1.34% and 1.59% as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and general reserves associated with non-impaired loans to total non-impaired loans was 1.34% and 1.55%, respectively. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses is adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses within the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was 4.41% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.09% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison resulted primarily from an increase in the effective yield on average investment securities, and an increase in the yield on the Company’s loan portfolio. Net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, also benefited by approximately $1,313,000 and $586,000, respectively, from prepayment penalties and payoff of loans previously on nonaccrual status.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective yield on average total earning assets increased 32 basis points to 4.50% compared to 4.18% for the year ended December 31, 2016, while the cost of average total interest-bearing liabilities decreased slightly to 0.14% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 0.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Over the same periods, the cost of average total deposits decreased to 0.08% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 0.09% for the same period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s average investment securities, including interest-earning deposits in other banks and Federal funds sold, totaled $568,426,000, an increase of $7,566,000, or 1.35%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective yield on average investment securities, including interest earning deposits in other banks and Federal funds sold, increased to 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.84% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal average loans (including nonaccrual), which generally yield higher rates than investment securities, increased $146,770,000, from $646,573,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $793,343,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The majority of the year-over-year loan growth compared to the prior year was due to the acquisitions of SVB in 2016 and FLB in 2017. The effective yield on average loans increased to 5.51% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 5.29% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,491,696,000 compared to $1,321,007,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $170,689,000 or 12.92%. During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average loan-to-deposit ratio was 61.77% and 56.51%, respectively. Total average deposits increased $140,074,000 or 12.24% to $1,284,305,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,144,231,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $57,238,000, or 7.87%, and average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $82,836,000, or 19.86%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s ratio of average non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits was 38.93% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 36.46% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year growth was primarily driven by the SVB and FLB acquisitions which closed on October 1, 2016 and October 1, 2017, respectively.\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1,245,000 to $10,836,000, compared to $9,591,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by an increase of $882,000 in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities. A $204,000 increase in service charge income, and an increase of $294,000 in other income was offset by a decrease in loan placement fees of $377,000 and a $187,000 decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank dividends.\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $5,484,000, or 14.09%, to $44,406,000 compared to $38,922,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net increase year over year was primarily attributable to the SVB and FLB acquisitions, which resulted in increases in salaries and employee benefits of $2,857,000, occupancy and equipment expenses of $432,000, license and maintenance contracts of $287,000, professional services of $251,000, ATM/Debit card expenses of $117,000, amortization of core deposit intangibles of $85,000, advertising expenses of $62,000, data processing expenses of $33,000, acquisition and integration expenses of $46,000, Internet banking expenses of $27,000, directors’ expenses of $67,000, and regulatory assessments of $10,000. Additionally, personnel expense increased $98,000, loan related expenses increased $97,000, donations increased $78,000, and telephone expenses decreased $92,000 in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $9,793,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6,917,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) during the fourth quarter of 2017, the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred taxes was adjusted to reflect the 2018 tax rates (the rates at which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse). The change to the tax rates (including the rate change applied to deferred taxes reflected in other comprehensive income and certain tax-advantaged investments as reflected in other assets) resulted in an increase to the Company’s tax provision of $3,535,000. The Company’s net deferred tax assets consist of temporary differences associated with assets and liabilities that are potentially subject to future valuation adjustments, such as those acquired in business combinations. While the Company has utilized all the information that is currently available in determining the impact to tax expense resulting from the Act, the potential impact of provisional amounts have not been recorded. At this time, management believes that the resolution of these provisional amounts associated with the Act will not have a material impact to the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” which due to the exercise of stock options in the current period, resulted in the recognition of $807,000 in excess tax benefits. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 41.11% compared to 31.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported unaudited consolidated net income of $335,000 and earnings per diluted common share of $0.02, compared to consolidated net income of $2,606,000 and $0.21 per diluted share for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2,572,000, an increase in total non-interest expenses of $2,196,000, and a decrease in non-interest income of $297,000, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $2,794,000. The effective tax rate increased to 92.38% from 36.41% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, primarily due to the one-time adjustment to deferred taxes of $3,535,000 due to the prospective change in the marginal 2018 federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. Net income for the immediately trailing quarter ended September 30, 2017 was $4,494,000, or $0.36 per diluted common share.\nAnnualized return on average equity (ROE) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.64%, compared to 6.19% for the same period of 2016. The decrease in ROE reflects a decrease in net income, and an increase in shareholders’ equity. Annualized return on average assets (ROA) was 0.08% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.72% for the same period in 2016. This decrease is due to a decrease in net income and an increase in average assets. The one-time deferred tax asset revaluation expense of $3.54 million negatively impacted the Company’s ROE and ROA for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016, average total loans increased by $144,924,000, or 19.44%. The majority of the loan growth was due to the FLB acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net loan charge-offs of $138,000 compared to net recoveries of $27,000 for the same period in 2016. The net charge-off (recovery) ratio, which reflects annualized net charge-offs to average loans, was 0.06% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to (0.01)% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $141,099,000 or 11.16% to $1,405,879,000 compared to $1,264,780,000 for the same period of 2016, primarily due to the FLB acquisition. In comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016, average borrowed funds increased $2,922,000 or 56.58% to $8,086,000 compared to $5,164,000.\nThe Company’s net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was 4.38% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 4.20% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income, before provision for credit losses, increased $2,794,000, or 21.87%, to $15,567,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12,773,000 for the same period in 2016. The accretion of the loan marks on acquired loans increased interest income by $242,000 and $924,000 during the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net interest income during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 benefited by approximately $96,000 and $85,000, respectively, from prepayment penalties and payoff of loans previously on nonaccrual status. The net interest margin period-to-period comparisons were impacted by an increase in the yield on the average investment securities and the loan portfolio. Over the same periods, the cost of total deposits decreased to 0.08% from 0.09%. The decrease in cost of total deposits is attributed to the decrease of time certificate deposit with cost yield of 0.24% compared to 0.40% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s average investment securities, including interest-earning deposits in other banks and Federal funds sold, increased by $21,025,000, or 3.60%, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and increased by $73,848,000, or 13.88%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nThe effective yield on average investment securities, including interest earning deposits in other banks and Federal funds sold, increased to 2.91% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.85% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and decreased as compared to 3.15% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Total average loans, which generally yield higher rates than investment securities, increased by $144,924,000 to $890,351,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from $745,427,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and increased by $119,574,000 from $770,777,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The effective yield on average loans was 5.48% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 5.27% and 5.39% for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nTotal average assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $1,644,685,000 compared to $1,454,412,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $1,427,070,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $190,273,000 and $217,615,000, or 13.08% and 15.25%, respectively.\nTotal average deposits increased $141,099,000, or 11.16%, to $1,405,879,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,264,780,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Total average deposits increased $182,954,000, or 14.96%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,222,925,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company’s ratio of average non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits was 40.40% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 37.70% and 39.92% for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nNon-interest income decreased $297,000, or 13.27%, to $1,941,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2,238,000 for the same period in 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, FHLB dividends decreased $195,000, loan placement fees decreased $111,000, and service charge income decreased $27,000, offset by an increase of $59,000 in interchange fees compared to the same period in 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 non-interest income included $6,000 net realized losses on sales and calls of investment securities compared to $84,000 net realized gains for the same period in 2016. Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $613,000 to $1,941,000, compared to $2,554,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease compared to the trailing quarter was primarily due to a $175,000 decrease in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, and a $391,000 decrease in other income, partially offset by a $23,000 increase in FHLB dividends and a $3,000 increase in service charges. The decrease in other income as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2017 was a result of recoveries on favorable legal settlements in the trailing quarter.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $2,196,000, or 20.12%, to $13,109,000 compared to $10,913,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The net increase quarter over quarter was a result of an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $1,298,000, a $118,000 increase in professional services, a $85,000 increase in license and maintenance contract expense, an increase in directors’ expenses of $49,000, an increase in personnel expenses of $63,000, and an increase of $46,000 in amortization of core deposit intangibles, partially offset by a decrease in data processing expenses of $72,000, a decrease in acquisition and integration expenses of $56,000, and a decrease of $3,000 in regulatory assessments.\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by $2,715,000 compared to $10,394,000 for the trailing quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase compared to the trailing quarter was primarily due to a $1,048,000 increase in acquisition and integration expenses, a $885,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $224,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense, a $40,000 increase in license and maintenance contracts, and a $9,000 increase in regulatory assessment expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $30,000 in directors’ expenses.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $4,064,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,492,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act during the fourth quarter of 2017, the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred taxes was adjusted to reflect the 2018 tax rates (the rates at which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse). The change to the tax rates (including the rate change applied to deferred taxes reflected in other comprehensive income) resulted in an increase to the Company’s tax provision of $3,535,000. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” which due to the exercise of stock options in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, resulted in the recognition of $703,000 in excess tax benefits.
