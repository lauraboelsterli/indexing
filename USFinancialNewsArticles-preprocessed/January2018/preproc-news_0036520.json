    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 2:40 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG plant suffers outage -market sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON/SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Production at Cheniere Energyâ€™s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Louisiana is running well below capacity, resulting in disruption to cargo loadings, trade sources said. \nFeed gas supply into the liquefaction plant plunged sharply during the weekend, data on the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal showed. \nFlows fell to 630 million cubic feet/day on Jan. 19 from 3.2 billion cubic feet/day on Jan. 15. \nFreezing weather may have disrupted water supply to Sabine Pass, market sources said. \nSeveral production units, or trains, are estimated to be offline, potentially delaying cargo loadings and deliveries to Asian markets in February and March, they said. \nCheniere Energy was not immediately available to comment.
