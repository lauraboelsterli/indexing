    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 1:00 PM / Updated an hour ago London zoo names newborn Okapi after Meghan Markle Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Meghan Markle, the American actress who is engaged to Britain’s Prince Harry, has a new namesake after London zoo named a just-born Okapi after her in honour of her wedding in May. \nMeghan the Okapi was born on Saturday to Oni, in a roughly 30-minute labour captured on camera by zoo keepers. \nOkapis are members of the giraffe family - though they do not have the long neck. Native to the Democratic Republic of Congo, they are notable for zebra-like stripes on their hind quarters and upper legs.

Oni is being very attentive, making sure she regularly licks her clean and keeping a watchful eye over Meghan as she sleeps,” zookeeper Gemma Metcalf said in a statement. \nOkapis are listed as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Researchers cited by the San Diego Zoo estimate that around 25,000 Okapis remain in the wild. \nMarkle is due to wed Prince Harry, fifth in line to the British throne, in May of 2018.
