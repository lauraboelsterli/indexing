    "text": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Dark horse David Goffinâ€™s Australian Open hopes went up in smoke as he fell to a 1-6 7-6(5) 6-1 7-6(4) to French veteran Julien Benneteau in round two on Thursday.\nThe Belgian seventh seed dominated the opening set in ferocious conditions but the match changed direction after 36-year-old Benneteau won the second set on a tiebreak.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Goffin was listless in the third set as Benneteau moved ahead and fell a break down in the fourth, saving a match point on his own serve at 3-5.\nWorld number 59 Benneteau had an attack of the nerves as he tried to close out the match, throwing in a couple of double-faults to allow Goffin to level at 5-5.\nBut he got the job done in the tiebreak to reach the third round of a grand slam for the first time since 2013.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ",
