Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy.\n@realDonaldTrump :\n- Eric Trump on @foxandfriends now! [0804 EST]\n- Today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of Congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend, and true AMERICAN HERO, Bob Dole. #CongressionalGoldMedal [1819 EST]\n- I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States.

Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. [1836 EST] ( bit.ly/2DeqNkw )\n- And the FAKE NEWS winners are... ( bit.ly/2BaIShG ) [2000 EST]\n- Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of! [2005 EST]\n- ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!
