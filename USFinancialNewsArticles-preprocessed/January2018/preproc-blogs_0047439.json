    "text": "Can't wait for President Oprah Winfrey ? Keep waiting.\nWinfrey might have laid rumors of a possible presidential bid to rest in an interview for the cover story of InStyle magazin e's March issue .\n\"It's not something that interests me,\" Winfrey said. \"I don't have the DNA for it.\"\nHowever, the interview was conducted three weeks before Winfrey's rousing speech at the 75th annual Golden Globes. The ubiquitous television personality and entrepreneur provoked intense speculation about running for office with her address, which was steeped in the politics of gender and identity.\nAlmost immediately after the Jan. 7 speech, the hashtag #Oprah2020 went viral on social media.\nCNN's Brian Stelter cited sources as saying Winfrey was \"actively thinking\" about a 2020 run; longtime friend and CBS anchor Gayle King said Winfrey was \" intrigued ,\" though \"not actively considering\" running.\nStelter tweet\nStedman Graham, Winfrey's partner of over three decades, added more fuel to the fire. \"She would absolutely do it,\" Graham told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the speech.\nA recent Rasmussen poll found that Winfrey would have a 10-point spread over President Donald Trump if the election were held the day of the survey.\nBut after being offered help starting a campaign, Winfrey told InStyle \"that's not for me.\"\nRead the full interview at InStyle.",
