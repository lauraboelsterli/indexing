    "text": " 23 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Brazil commission to negotiate transfer of rights with Petrobras Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nRIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government on Wednesday created a commission to negotiate the terms of a so-called “transfer of rights” program with state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras). \nThe commission will work for 60 days to reach a final agreement on terms between the government and Petrobras and the form of payment. \nThe commission will include members from the energy, finance and planning ministries, according to a decree published in the official gazette. \nAfter months of talks, a dispute between the government and Petrobras over a 2010 contract has not yet been settled.
