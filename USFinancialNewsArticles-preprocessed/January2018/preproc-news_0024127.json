    "text": "Britain's Carillion Has Collapsed After Lenders Cut Off Lifeline Cranes stand on a Carillion construction site in central London, Britain on Jan. 14, 2018. Simon Dawson—Reuters By Reuters 3:06 AM EST \nBritish construction and services company Carillion (cioif) collapsed on Monday when its lenders refused to provide any further financial support, forcing it to enter compulsory liquidation. \nThe company, which employs 43,000 people including 20,000 in Britain, provides services in defense, education, health and transport. It said the government would provide the necessary funding to maintain the public services carried out by its staff. \n“In recent days we have been unable to secure the funding to support our business plan and it is therefore with the deepest regret that we have arrived at this decision,” Chairman Philip Green said. \nTensions around the 200-year-old company have been ratcheting up for weeks, forcing the government to hold a string of crisis meetings to discuss how they should respond. \nFor more on the U.K., watch Fortune’s video: \nOne of many private companies to run public services in Britain, Carillion has been hit by costly contract delays and a downturn in new business that prompted a string of profit warnings and a first-half loss of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion). \nIts has debt and liabilities of 1.5 billion pounds.
