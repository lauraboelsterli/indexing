Sloan, the company’s president and CEO. “From the financial crisis in 2008, to the company’s merger with Wachovia, to the many economic and credit cycles we have navigated, Mike has demonstrated leadership and a commitment to all our stakeholders, especially our customers, in one of our company’s most critical roles, and for that we are grateful.”\nA direct report of Sloan’s serving on the company’s Operating Committee, Loughlin has been Wells Fargo’s chief risk officer since 2008, overseeing key risk-oriented activities at the company, including credit, market risk, operational risk, compliance, and information security (including cyber risk). Over the past two years, Loughlin also has led efforts to centralize many of the company’s risk functions to provide more comprehensive oversight of the company’s risks.\n“It has been a great privilege to serve an American institution as important and as valued as Wells Fargo,” Loughlin said. “I am preparing for retirement with enthusiasm for Wells Fargo’s future, confidence in the work its leaders will continue, and gratitude for the many customers and colleagues I have had the great pleasure to know.”\nLoughlin joined Wells Fargo in 1986, following the company’s acquisition of Crocker Bank.
