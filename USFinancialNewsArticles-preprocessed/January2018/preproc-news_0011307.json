KuRunData's company founders, Mr. Pan Hao, and Mr. Wang Changwei will remain Chairman and CEO of KuRunData.\nKuRunData has the largest, and most well-profiled online and mobile panels of more than 5 million registered members. Kurun couples this with a robust survey platform to deliver unrivalled access to insight into the Chinese market. The acquisition of KuRunData supports Toluna's growing success in the region by expanding Toluna's operations into mainland China, supports the company's ever-growing APAC presence, and deepens Toluna's already vast respondent reach in APAC. Toluna launched operations in APAC in 2011, and currently has offices in Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sydney.\n\"The APAC market is exciting and dynamic, and we've found great success with the suite of real-time, digital survey solutions we offer. Toluna has a unique position in the market, and this is a strategic move that enables us to offer local capabilities in China, servicing international and local clients,\" says Frederic-Charles Petit, Toluna CEO. \"Our expansion into China is testament to our strong growth in the APAC territory over the past 5 years.

Our clients have adopted these new methods, and look at Toluna as a leader in the region and we're thrilled to continue to grow within the APAC region,\" says Ludovic Milet, Managing Director, Toluna Asia Pacific. \"The expertise of the KuRun team is unrivaled.\"\nMr. Wang Changwei as Chairman of KuRunData states that \"Toluna is a player that is gaining significant momentum in the region.
