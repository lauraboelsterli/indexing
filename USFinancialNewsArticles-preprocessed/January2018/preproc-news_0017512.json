(OTC-Pink:LBCP), the holding company for BankLiberty, and Dr. Stephen McCray, Chairman of Lawson Financial Corp., reported an agreement whereby Liberty Bancorp, Inc. will purchase all the stock of Lawson Financial Corp.

Lawson Bank had total assets of $125.5 million as of September 30, 2017.\n“The decision to sell was not an easy one but I am pleased that our customers will continue to be served by a community bank that shares our passion for helping local households and businesses,” said McCray.\nEstablished in 1955, BankLiberty is a community bank with existing branches in Kansas City, Parkville, Liberty, North Kansas City, Riverside, Gladstone, Claycomo, Platte City, and Independence.\nBrent Giles, President and CEO of BankLiberty, stated, “BankLiberty is excited to be able to provide Lawson Bank’s customers with the friendly community bank service they expect along with cutting-edge services that make business and life easier.
