    "text": "HAMBURG, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Evans Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE American: EVBN), a community financial services company serving Western New York since 1920, announced that John R. O’Brien has informed the Company’s Board of Directors of his intention to retire as Chairman of the Board and as a member of the Board of Directors effective March 31, 2018. This is in advance of the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders, scheduled for April 26, 2018. Mr. O’Brien indicated he will not seek re-election to the Board of Directors in April, as he wishes to spend more time with family and pursue personal interests.\nMr. O’Brien has been a director of the Company since 2003 and has served on all committees of the Board and as Vice-Chairman before being named Chairman in April 2012. He was previously the Executive Director of Financial Administration for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, New York, retiring in June 2004. Mr. O’Brien also previously served for 20 years as an audit partner with KPMG, LLP, a national accounting and consulting firm.\nDuring his tenure on the Board, the Company has experienced unprecedented growth. The number of financial centers have nearly doubled to 14, assets and deposits both crossed the one billion mark, and a total of ten insurance agencies were acquired by the Evans Agency, more than doubling its size.\n“John has made monumental contributions to the Company while serving on and leading our Board,” stated David J. Nasca, President & CEO of Evans. “His vision, insight and compassion have created a legacy which will have a long-lasting, positive impact on the Company, as well as the community. John leaves us in a very strong position as Evans continues its evolution as a leading Western New York financial institution.”\nAs part of its succession planning and governance protocols, a successor Board Chair will be appointed by the Board of Directors prior to the Company’s Annual Meeting.\nAbout Evans Bancorp, Inc.\nEvans Bancorp, Inc. is a financial holding company and the parent company of Evans Bank, N.A., a commercial bank with $1.2 billion in assets and $1.0 billion in deposits at September 30, 2017.
