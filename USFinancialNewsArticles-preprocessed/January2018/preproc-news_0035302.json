    "text": "TORONTO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index edged lower on Monday as railroad and materials shares declined, offsetting gains for the energy group, which was supported by higher oil prices.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed down 5.48 points, or 0.03 percent, at 16,347.98. Just four of the index’s 10 main groups ended lower. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Peter Cooney)\n ",
