    "text": " 10 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Maryland man indicted in 2017 workplace shooting that killed three Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Maryland man accused in a 2017 workplace shooting that left three co-workers dead at a kitchen countertop company was indicted on first-degree murder charges on Tuesday, prosecutors said. \nA Harford County grand jury indicted Radee Prince, 38, on three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, as well as firearms charges, for the October attack near Baltimore, county prosecutor Joseph Cassillyâ€™s office said in a statement. \nPrince is accused of shooting to death three co-workers and wounding two others at the Edgewood, Maryland, company before fleeing in a vehicle. \nA surveillance camera inside the business captured the shootings, the statement said. \nProsecutors said Prince did not have an attorney. \nPrince, of Elkton, remains jailed in Wilmington, Delaware, for a shooting that took place there hours after the deadly attack in Maryland. He faces a charge of attempted first-degree murder stemming from the shooting of a man at an auto shop. \nPolice have said Prince has a lengthy criminal record, including 15 felony convictions, and was associated with all six victims in the October shootings.
