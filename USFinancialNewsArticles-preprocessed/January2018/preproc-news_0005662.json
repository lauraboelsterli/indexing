    "text": "— $125 million financing will enable JH Capital to purchase $1 billion face value of consumer debt receivables beginning in the first quarter of 2018 —\nLOS ANGELES & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Easterly Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: EACQ) and JH Capital Group Holdings, LLC (“JH Capital”) today announced that global credit investor Fortress Credit Corp. (“Fortress”), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, led a $125 million financing to support JH Capital’s acquisition of defaulted consumer receivables from a diversified group of 10 lenders. JH Capital experienced a surge in the supply of defaulted receivables in the fourth quarter of 2017 and expects to invest much of this new cash during the first quarter of 2018.\nJH Capital is a national leader in purchasing charged-off consumer debt from major financial institutions. JH Capital’s other businesses include a national debt settlement service, consumer and commercial loan origination platforms as well as a captive collections agency. In June 2017, Easterly Acquisition announced a planned business combination with JH Capital under which it will acquire JH Capital and rename the company JH Capital Group Holdings, Inc. (“JH Capital Inc.”). This acquisition is expected to enhance JH Capital Inc.’s competitive position significantly, accelerate its strategic development and cement its long-term growth in providing end-to-end solutions throughout the defaulted consumer credit lifecycle. The combination is expected to be completed by March 31, 2018.\nThe $125 million financing led by Fortress closed on December 28, 2017 and will enable JH Capital to take advantage of growing purchasing opportunities in the debt marketplace, including the purchase of approximately $1 billion face value of consumer receivables from the closing date of the financing beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Historically, JH Capital has collected defaulted receivables valued at more than 2.4 times the amount of its original investment.\nJH Capital recently estimated it would complete $140 million in portfolio purchases during 2017. JH Capital exceeded its 2017 plan with $149 million in purchases and, with this additional purchasing capacity, now expects purchases of $75 million during the first quarter of 2018 alone. This purchase volume is ahead of the $52 million in first quarter 2018 purchases previously announced.\nThe financing also provides additional financial strength to enter into future forward flow agreements, through which JH Capital is able to acquire debt from lenders at contractually agreed prices. These forward flow agreements provide JH Capital with a guaranteed source of debt purchases over time, providing financial institutions the ability to dispose of charge-offs more efficiently.\n“The investment by Fortress reflects our belief that credit normalization and the growth of net charge-offs will dramatically increase market opportunities during the next three months. Fortress acted quickly and allowed us to take advantage of larger-than-expected opportunities as they arise in the marketplace,” said Glenn Corey, Chief Financial Officer of JH Capital.\nAs part of the agreement, Fortress will receive warrants for 888,000 shares of JH Capital Inc.’s common stock following the close of the business combination between Easterly Acquisition and JH Capital. The Fortress warrants will be non-dilutive to Easterly Acquisition shareholders.\n“JH Capital has the capital it needs to continue to deliver on its business plan,” said Darrell Crate, Chairman of the Board of Easterly Acquisition. “The improving fundamentals in this sector will continue to attract more capital and provide attractive returns to investors. JH Capital is well positioned to capture their share of this growth.”\nAbout JH Capital\nJH Capital is a specialty finance business that offers end-to-end solutions to customers at every stage of the distressed credit cycle, from default to rehabilitation.
