    "text": "David Liam Kyle | NBAE | Getty Images LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers \nPublic transportation, while not the most glamorous form of travel, is cheap and often efficient. That's why so many Americans rely on a bus, train or subway to commute to and from work. \nBut public transportation isn't just for regular joes. Anyone can use it, including the rich and famous. And sometimes they do. \nHere are a handful of pro athletes who make millions but who you could still maybe find on the subway platform waiting for the train. Marshawn Lynch rode the BART after a Chiefs-Raiders game \nAfter being ejected from a division rivalry game against the Kansas City Chiefs earlier this year, Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders didn't go into hiding: The running back, who earns an average salary of $4.5 million , did what thousands of Oakland natives do and took the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) home . \nHis good friend Marcus Peters, cornerback for Chiefs, joined him: tweet 2 LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavs took a $2.75 NYC subway ride \nWhen the Cleveland Cavaliers were in New York City for a game against the Knicks, they traveled like true New Yorkers: on the subway . \nA video posted to Twitter by the NBA showed the team, including four-time MVP LeBron James, waiting for a train at Penn Station after practice. \n\"It's my first time getting on [the subway] in New York,\" says James, who earned a $31 million salary in 2016-17 . \nHere's a second video, filmed by James and posted by Uninterrupted, James's media platform: tweet 4 The U.S. men's basketball team used public transport in London \nLast year may have been the first time James took the New York subway, but he's not new to public transportation. He, Kobe Bryant and the rest of the U.S. Olympic basketball team opted to get around via the Tube, buses and trains while in London for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. \nIf you were wondering, they took home the gold medal that year.
