    "text": "TORONTO, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Avicanna Inc., (\" Avicanna \") is pleased to announce the completion of its second non-brokered private placement offering (the \" Offering \") for units in Avicanna (each a \" Unit \"). Each Unit consists of one common share in the capital of Avicanna (a \" Common Share \") and one half of one Common Share purchase warrant (a \" Warrant \") with each whole Warrant entitling the holders thereof to purchase one Common Share in the capital of the Corporation (a \" Warrant Share \") at a price of $2.50 per Common Share. The Warrants must be exercised on the earlier of eighteen (18) months after the closing of the Offering and three (3) months after the date that Avicanna completes an initial public offering and listing on a recognized stock exchange in Canada.\nAvicanna sought to raise $2 million. Due to significant interest in the Offering, Avicanna oversubscribed resulting in a $4.75 million closing. Avicanna intends to use the proceeds of the Offering for the purposes of continuing research and development, clinical development of existing and future product lines, and to fund its phase one build-out of a production facility in Santa Marta, Colombia. Avicanna will also allocate some of the funds raised to build-out product licensing and sales models in both Canada and the United States of America.\n\"We are thrilled to see the level of support and interest that we have received from our subscribers, and we are equally excited to develop meaningful and prosperous relationships with our new strategic shareholders. The funds raised will allow Avicanna to continue to excel and provides our team with the opportunity to focus on the execution of our multi-vertical business model in Canada and around the world.\"\n-Aras Azadian, CEO\nThe oversubscription comes well received by Avicanna as it opened the doors to accept new strategic investors such as a top Canadian Financial Institution and other key individual investors.
