    "text": "The New York Daily News tweeted its latest front page featuring an illustration of President Donald Trump and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as birds engaged in a cockfight.\nThe headline, \"Cuck Fight,\" was emblazoned across the front. \"Cuck\" is a pejorative term used by the so-called alt-right for a man who has no self-respect, or more broadly for politically liberal males.\nAugust 2017: \"I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service.\" January 2018: \"When (Steve Bannon) was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.\" \nThe cover also references Trump's retort to quotes from Bannon in Michael Wolff's upcoming tell-all book about the Trump administration â€” titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\"\nIn the book, Bannon is quoted as saying a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer in 2016 was \"treasonous,\" The Guardian reported. \nIn his reply, Trump said the Breitbart News executive chairman \"lost his mind\" when he \"lost his job\" at the White House.\nThe White House says Bannon's departure last August had been a mutual decision between chief of staff John Kelly and himself.",
