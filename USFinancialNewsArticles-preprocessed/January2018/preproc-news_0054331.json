He will continue mentoring and leading the creative team at greenlight, as well as dedicate time to talent acquisition.\n“To be a great creative leader, you have to have a clear vision for the future; you need to be able to inspire big thinking and you must forever be exploring ‘what’s next.’ Todd has delivered on all three since the day he joined our agency,” Cole said.\nHerskind added, “He’s attracted best-in-class-talent, and continues a relentless pursuit to deliver great work for our clients. We’re thrilled to see him take on this new role.”\nTodd has been an essential part of greenlight’s move into more experience-focused and creative branding work for clients including Gold’s Gym, La Quinta Returns and La Quinta’s Military Initiative, La Cantera Resort & Spa, Dallas’ Café Momentum, The Statler and Oregon’s Inn at Arch Cape.\nAdditionally Lancaster will pursue creative opportunities for HOWDO, an inspired meeting venue founded by greenlight.
