This information is, where applicable, based on estimates, assumptions and analysis that ConvergeOne believes, as of the date hereof, provide a reasonable basis for the information contained herein. Forward‐looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward‐looking words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"aim\", \"estimate\", \"target\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"guidance\" or other similar words, and include statements regarding ConvergeOne's plans, strategies, objectives, targets and expected financial performance. These forward‐looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of Forum, ConvergeOne and their respective officers, employees, agents or associates. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement and the proposed Business Combination contemplated thereby; (2) the inability to complete the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of Forum or other conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement; (3) the inability to meet the minimum cash requirements of the Merger Agreement due to the inability to consummate the concurrent pipe financing or the amount of cash available following any redemptions by Forum stockholders; (4) the ability to meet national exchange listing standards following the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (5) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of ConvergeOne as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transaction described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (7) costs related to the proposed Business Combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that ConvergeOne may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (10) ConvergeOne's ability to identify and integrate acquisition; and (11) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the final proxy statement/prospectus of Forum, including those under \"Risk Factors\" therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") by Forum.\nActual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and forward‐looking statements and the assumptions on which those vary from forward‐looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward‐looking statements as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information, cost savings, synergies and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information herein speaks only as of (1) the date hereof, in the case of information about ConvergeOne, or (2) the date of such information, in the case of information from persons other than ConvergeOne. ConvergeOne undertakes no duty to update or revise the information contained herein. Forecasts and estimates regarding ConvergeOne's industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part.\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis announcement is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, subscribe for or buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer or securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nParticipants in the Solicitation\nForum and ConvergeOne and their respective directors, executive officers, other members of management, and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of Forum's stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction.
