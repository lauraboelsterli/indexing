    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. spy satellite that was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX rocket on Sunday failed to reach orbit and is assumed to be a total loss, two U.S. officials briefed on the mission said on Monday.\nThe classified intelligence satellite, built by Northrop Grumman Corp, failed to separate from the second stage of the Falcon 9 rocket and is assumed to have broken up or plunged into the sea, said the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe satellite is assumed to be “a write-off,” one of the officials said.\nReporting by John Walcott; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh\n ",
