    "text": "In the latest sign that sexual harassment isn't always career-ending, the DJ who groped Taylor Swift has landed a new job. \nJust six months after a jury sided with Taylor Swift, DJ David Mueller has been named the new co-host of the morning show Jackson & Jonbob at a Mississippi radio station. The station's CEO Larry Fuss has defended the decision, while admitting that \"maybe a tiny bit\" of the hiring decision came from a desire for publicity. \nRead: Melinda Gates on Stopping Harassment in Tech: ‘We Need LPs to Step Up’ \nSwift had alleged that Mueller groped her bare butt following a 2013 meet and greet at a Denver radio station. Mueller sued the artist for $3 million, claiming defamation and blaming her for his firing from the station. Swift countersued for a symbolic $1 to show other women \" you can always say no ,\" claiming assault and battery. She won a civil trial by jury. \nYet despite the highly public nature of the case, Mueller has escaped relatively unscathed. And Mueller isn't the only man involved in a sexual abuse or harassment case who has landed on his feet--at least temporarily--in recent months. \nRead: Wynn Resorts Loses $3.5 Billion After Sexual Harassment Allegations Surface About Steve Wynn \nAs recently as this week, news has emerged that a Reuters editor was able to get a senior position at Newsweek months after a subordinate at Reuters filed a complaint accusing him of sexually harassing her (he was subsequently put on leave from Newsweek when the Reuters case came to light) . The Red Cross, too, reportedly forced an executive out after he was accused of sexual harassment--and then failed to disclose that information when he went on to get a job at Save the Children . ",
