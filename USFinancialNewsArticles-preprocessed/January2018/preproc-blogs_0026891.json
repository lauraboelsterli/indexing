The finalists were whittled down from a pool of 238 proposals. M ayors and elected officials of the remaining locations are making their pitch. 3 Hours Ago | 00:31 \nAmazon has whittled down the list of finalists for its second headquarters to 20 metro areas , from a pool of 238 proposals. \nThe contenders aren't too surprising, as the front-runners identified by a CNBC analysis are still in the mix. Mayors and elected officials from the finalist cities are making their pitch. \nHere's how representatives for some of the 20 contenders have responded: Atlanta Dennis Macdonald | Photolibrary | Getty Images Interstate 75 in downtown Atlanta \n\"Atlanta's spot on this list is a testament to our city's assets, including the strong working relationship between the City and the State,\" Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. \"I am excited to move forward into this next phase of the process, and I look forward to continuing to work with Governor Deal, Commissioner Wilson, and all of our stakeholders to make sure Atlanta puts forth the strongest, most competitive bid possible.\" Austin, TX David Sucsy | Getty Images Austin, Texas \n\"We are pleased that the Austin region has advanced to the second round,\" said Mike Berman, a spokesman for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. \"We look forward to presenting the best of what our region has to offer and how we can partner with Amazon.\" Boston Peter Unger | Getty Images Shopping streets in Boston, MA. \n\"I am proud that Boston is on Amazon's shortlist for its second North American headquarters,\" Mayor Marty Walsh said. \"As a thriving city with a talented and diverse workforce, culture of innovation and opportunity for all, I see no better city than Boston for Amazon to call their second home.\" Chicago Henryk Sadura | Getty Images Chicago skyline. \n\"Today's news makes clear that Amazon recognizes Chicago's great strengths — access to talent, transportation, higher education, affordability and quality of life, which are the keys to growth and prosperity,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. \"We are prepared to compete at the next level and the next level after that.\" Dallas Dallas, Texas. \nMayor Mike Rawlings tweeted: Thrilled to be in the next round of @amazon HQ2 process. There’s much work left to be done but I want to thank my fellow mayors, @DRChamber , @FTWChamber and all our citizens for making @CityOfDallas and DFW such a desirable place to be! — Mike Rawlings (@Mike_Rawlings) January 18, 2018 Denver Bridget Calip | Getty Image Denver, Colorado \n\"It's great to be on Amazon's list of finalists as they consider the location of their second headquarters,\" said Governor John Hickenlooper. \"Colorado is one of the most business-friendly states in America and we believe the Denver region would be a great choice for Amazon.\" Indianapolis Education Images | UIG | Getty Images Downtown Indianapolis \nMayor Joe Hogsett tweeted: \"I am proud that Central Indiana’s unique combination of connectivity, quality of life, and affordable living has once again put us on the global stage.\" Read Mayor Joe's full statement on #Indy making the @amazon HQ2 shortlist. pic.twitter.com/4jUHwKIVKd — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) January 18, 2018 Los Angeles Jean-Pierre Lescourret | Getty Images Downtown Los Angeles at sunset. \n\"We've got rockets and rock stars, more engineers and more sunshine,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \"The Olympics, two NFL teams, and George Lucas all know L.A. is the future — so should Amazon. And we love that Jeff Bezos already has a home here.\" Miami Scott B. Smith | Getty Images Miami, Florida \n\"My mayorship reflects a generational change that is perfect for receiving a tech company like Amazon. We need to usher in the knowledge-based economy to our city and ensure that it filters down to every resident,\" said Mayor Francis Suarez. \"I put a call into Jeff Bezos and said I would be willing to fly to Seattle and make a personal pitch. He is from Miami so we would love nothing more for him to have his second HQ in his hometown.\" Montgomery County, MD Denis Tangney Jr. | Getty Images Rockville is a city located in the central region of Montgomery County, Maryland. \n\"I am extremely pleased and proud that Amazon selected Montgomery County, Md. to enter into future discussions regarding locating their second headquarters,\" Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett said. \"As the only County in the country on the short list, having the ability to move forward for further consideration is a real honor.\" Nashville, TN Nashville, Tennessee \nMayor Megan Barry tweeted: We are excited to have made Amazon’s top 20 list for a second headquarters. Over the coming weeks and months, we look forward to working more closely with @amazon to show them why Music City would be the perfect fit for their company. — Megan Barry (@MayorMeganBarry) January 18, 2018 Newark, NJ Emile Wamsteker | Bloomberg | Getty Images The downtown Newark skyline. \n\"Amazon's decision to place Newark on its short list of 20 municipalities to host its new headquarters is by itself a great victory for our city,\" Mayor Ras Baraka said. \"This is how we get things done in Newark. We come together as a city and our skill in collaboration is itself something that will enormously benefit Amazon.\" New York City",
