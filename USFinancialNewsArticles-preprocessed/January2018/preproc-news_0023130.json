Butler had five rebounds and four assists, Towns grabbed 11 rebounds and Teague dished out eight assists for the Timberwolves, who shot .544 on the way to their fifth straight win.\nDamian Lillard scored 21 points and CJ McCollum and Pat Connaughton added 18 apiece for the Trail Blazers, who lost their third straight game as they finished a four-game road trip 1-3.\nThe Timberwolves enjoyed a big advantage at the free-throw line, sinking 27 of 33 attempts to only 14 of 17 for the Blazers.\nMinnesota outscored Portland 26-10 in the second quarter to take a 57-43 lead into the half. Teague and Gibson each scored 10 points for the Timberwolves.\nThe Wolves extended their advantage to 79-55 midway through the third quarter.
