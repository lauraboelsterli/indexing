We successfully expanded our footprint and continued to reinforce the strength of our product launch strategy. From an industry perspective, we created additional exposure at industry conferences and within communities that not only recognized our leadership in the CBD space but also our commitment in setting the standards for high-quality therapeutic value for our customers. We plan on providing over 40 SKUs of various categories, over the next fiscal year, with the goal of making CBD Unlimited a recognizable brand for delivering the best CBD hemp oil and CBD infused products. In November 2017, we acquired Holistic Earth Remedies LLC, a therapeutic topical delivery systems company, to immediately capture 20% increase in revenues. This revenue producing acquisition has generated $85-90K annually in each of the past two years and will continue to add to our top line growth going forward. Heading into fiscal year 2018 we also expect to continue growing even more aggressively, through the quality of our relationships, networks, distributor and partners, and to build long-term shareholder value.”\nAbout Endexx\nEndexx, with its collaborative partners and consultants, develops and distributes two consumable product lines derived from industrial hemp, which is organic and naturally rich in phytocannabinoids. Phyto-Bites®, is its CBD-infused soft chews for dogs. The dog treats are formulated to promote health and support the reduction of separation anxiety, pain and inflammation. The company also has two technology products and services that launched in 2014 -- the M3hub and the Autospense™. Both products provide essential solutions to promote regulatory compliance and full accountability through \"seed to sale\" inventory management and, an \"End of Sale\" technology integration. Based on principles developed by the pharmacological industry, the m3hub platform is the first standardized software solution for tracking pharmaceutical grade products that maintains compliance with federal, state and local regulations. It is intended to provide a smooth transition to eventual federal mandates. The Autospense™ is a commercial grade inventory control and dispensing device that provides up-to-the-minute accounting details and ensures both product and patient security. By automating the dispensing process, Autospense™ increases productivity and reduces shrink and costs for retailers, while enhancing their service quality by reducing transaction time for customers.
