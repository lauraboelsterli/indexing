    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 8:43 AM / in an hour Nadal mows down Mayer to reach third round Ian Ransom 1 Min Read \nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Top seed Rafa Nadal continued his marauding path through the Australian Open, hammering Argentine Leonardo Mayer 6-3 6-4 7-6 (4) to reach the third round on Wednesday. \nChannelling his early years with a sleeveless shirt, the muscular Mallorcan threw Mayer like a rag-doll around the Rod Laver Arena court for two hours and 38 minutes, pounding the world number 52 with a barrage of top-spin bombs. Slideshow (9 Images) \nA masterful performance was blighted only by a late wobble, when Nadal was broken serving for the match at 5-4 in the decider. \nBut the Spaniard found an extra gear in the tiebreak, wrapping up the match with a monster serve to the corner that Mayer battled to get a racket to. \nNadalâ€™s bid for a 17th grand slam title continues against Bosnian 28th seed Damir Dzumhur.
