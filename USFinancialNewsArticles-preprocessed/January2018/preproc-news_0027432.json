Schultz has over 30 years of restaurant industry experience, most recently with MOD Pizza serving as the company’s Senior Vice President of Operations. During his tenure, he helped steward the company from one to over 300 locations worldwide. Prior to MOD, Schultz spent 13 years at Starbucks Coffee Company as an operational advisor to the senior executive team as the company expanded domestically and internationally. At Voodoo, Schultz will call upon his experience to focus on growth of the brand, strengthening the culture, entering new markets and staying connected to the communities that we operate in.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Creators of the Bacon Maple Bar, Portland Cream and Memphis Mafia doughnuts, Voodoo has earned a cult following worldwide for its unique take on the classic doughnut shop. Founders Kenneth “Cat Daddy” Pogson and Tres Shannon built their “little doughnut shop that could” into a dynamic fun zone in front of and behind the counter.\nSaid Schultz, “Voodoo has all the ingredients to go from ‘the little company that could’ to the next big thing. We will be retaining all that’s wonderful to make sure the Voodoo that’s done so well isn’t lost as we introduce ourselves to new customers, communities and employees.”\nSchultz succeeds Robin “Lobster” Ludwig in the role of CEO. Ludwig tragically lost his battle with brain cancer in 2015.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180117006372/en/\nVoodoo Doughnut\nSara Heise, 503-546-9666\nSarat3@voodoodoughnut.com\n@VoodooDoughnut\nSource: Voodoo Doughnut",
