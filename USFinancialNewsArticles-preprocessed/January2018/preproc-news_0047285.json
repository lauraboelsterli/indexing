    "text": "EL PASO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hunt Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) announced today that it priced $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) at an issue price of 100.000%. The offering was upsized from the previously announced $550 million aggregate principal amount. The offering is expected to close on February 2, 2018 subject to customary closing conditions. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2026.\nThe Notes are being offered by the initial purchasers only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to persons outside of the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement, an applicable exemption from registration requirements or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of its 9.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 and the repayment of its existing revolving credit facility, as well as related fees and expenses. The Company intends to use any remaining amount of net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nThis announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor will there be any sales of the Notes in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Hunt Companies, Inc.\nFounded in 1947, Hunt Companies, Inc. is today a holding company that invests in businesses focused in the real estate and infrastructure markets.
