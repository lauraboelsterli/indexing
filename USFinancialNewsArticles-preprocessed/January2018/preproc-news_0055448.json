    "text": "(Adds Unilever, Leclerc; updates Fujifilm)\nJan 31 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1400 GMT on Wednesday:\n** Privately held French supermarket operator Leclerc said it planned to launch a food delivery service in Paris this year, in the face of competition from Amazon.\n** Unilever has agreed to buy Betty Ice, the largest ice cream brand in Romania, as the consumer goods giant bulks up what is already the world’s largest ice cream business.\n** Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings is set to take over Xerox Corp in a $6.1 billion deal, combining the U.S. company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs amid declining demand for office printing.\n** Fujitsu Ltd said it had agreed to sell a majority stake in its wholly-owned mobile phone unit to investment fund Polaris Capital Group, as it sharpens focus on its main IT services business.\n** Japan’s Line Corp said that it had entered an agreement with SoftBank Group Corp to give the telecoms and technology firm a majority stake in Line’s mobile unit.\n** Finland’s Wartsila said it will take a look at Rolls-Royce’s loss-making marine business which the British company is reviewing for possible sale.\n** China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), China’s No. 2 nuclear power producer, will take over the country’s top nuclear power plant builder to create a company worth almost $100 billion, the latest state-orchestrated marriage in the nation’s vast power sector.\n** Royal Dutch Shell said that it will sell its stake in the Bongkot gas field and adjoining acreage offshore Thailand to PTT Exploration & Production PCL for $750 million before tax.\n** U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in advanced talks to buy a minority stake in India’s leading homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper said.
