Handball - Men's EHF European Handball Championship - semi-final - Denmark v Sweden - Arena Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia - January 26, 2018. Sweden's team reacts after the match. REUTERS/Marko Djurica \nSpain appeared to have wrapped up the match when they carved out a staggering 23-14 lead midway through the second half, but France then produced their best spell of the contest as they scored six unanswered goals. \nSpain held their nerve in the closing stages though and romped into the final on the back of seven goals from right wing Ferran Sole and six from center back Raul Entrerrios. Slideshow (4 Images) \nSweden prevailed in an epic Scandinavian derby after taking a body blow on the buzzer, when livewire Denmark winger Lasse Svan netted to force extra time and seemingly shift the momentum his team’s way. \nSweden had led throughout regular time and showed remarkable composure to regain the advantage in the additional 10 minutes, with Palicka frustrating the Danes whenever they looked likely to turn the tide. \nDenmark’s backs Mikkel Hansen and Rasmus Lauge topped the scoring with 12 and 11 goals respectively, but their valiant effort fells short against a more balanced Swedish outfit.
