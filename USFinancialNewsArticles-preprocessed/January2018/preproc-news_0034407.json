Company investments are seen rising by 4 percent to 41.2 billion euros while state spending on roads and bridges is forecast to increase by 4 percent to 32.9 billion euros.\nWith construction prices expected to rise by 3.5 percent this year, however, overall sales in real terms are likely to grow by only 0.5 percent to reach 98 billion euros ($120 billion), the associations added.\nEmployment in construction is expected to rise by 15,000 to 820,000 people, although a growing number of companies are struggling to find skilled workers, they added.\n“There are now two vacancies for every unemployed construction engineer,” Huebner said. “At some point we won’t find any unemployed engineers at all; we’ll have full employment here.”\nConstruction was one of the main growth drivers in Germany last year when the euro zone’s largest economy expanded by a calendar-adjusted 2.5 percent, the strongest since 2011. For 2018, the Ifo institute has forecast 2.6 percent growth. ($1 = 0.8185 euros) (Additional reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Gareth Jones and Angus MacSwan)\n ",
