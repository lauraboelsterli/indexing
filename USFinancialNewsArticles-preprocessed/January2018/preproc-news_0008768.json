    "text": "U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Tuesday, boosted by the positive trading sentiment seen in international markets.\nDow Jones industrial average futures rose 43 points, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 1.5 points and 5.25 points, respectively.\nInternational stocks rose overnight, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 climbing 0.6 percent and the Hang Seng index advancing 0.4 percent.\nThe move higher in Japanese stocks came after the Bank of Japan trimmed its long-dated government bonds purchases, raising speculation the central bank could start unwinding its stimulative policy this year. The yen also rose following the decision; it traded 0.4 percent higher against the dollar.\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. European stocks also rose, with the Stoxx 600 index gaining nearly half a percent. The French CAC 40 index outperformed among major European indexes, advancing 0.6 percent.\nOn the second trading week of 2018, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite finished Monday's trade at all-time highs , as markets remained optimistic on the state of the U.S. economy.\nU.S. stocks are off to a roaring start to the new year, with the major indexes hitting record highs. Sentiment remains positive in the U.S. as economic data continues to be positive while Wall Street looks for companies to get a boost from lower corporate taxes.\nPresident Donald Trump had signed a bill in December to cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent.\nIn economic news Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), set to come out at 10 a.m. ET.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is expected to attend a Q&A moderated discussion at Cargill Headquarters in Minnesota.\nIn corporate news, Target shares popped more than 4 percent in the premarket after reporting stronger-than-expected holiday sales.",
