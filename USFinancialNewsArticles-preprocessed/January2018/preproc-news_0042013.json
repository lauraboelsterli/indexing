Handball - Men's EHF European Handball Championship - main round Group II - Germany v Spain - Arena Varazdin, Varazdin, Croatia - January 24, 2018. Maximilian Janke of Germany in action. REUTERS/Antonio Bronic \nHaving seen Sweden slip up against Norway, Croatia needed only a draw to join France in the medal rounds but fell behind 20-13 early in the second half after making a bright start. \nRoared on by their faithful fans, the Croatians slashed the deficit to two goals in the closing stages but ran out of steam and time as France closed out the match thanks to six goals from Nedim Remili and five from Kentin Mahe. Slideshow (9 Images) \nGermany held their own against Spain in a balanced first half but could not keep up with the pace after the interval as Ferran Sole and Alex Dujshebaev netted five goals each for the winners. \nDenmark, who qualified on Tuesday without throwing a ball as other results went their way, made sure they finished top of their group with a 31-20 drubbing of Macedonia. \nThe semi-finals are on Friday and the final on Sunday.
