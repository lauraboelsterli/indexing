(NYSE: SOI) (“Solaris” or the “Company”) today announced that the Company has entered into a new credit agreement with certain lenders. The credit facility has a term of four years, is composed of a $20 million revolver and a $50 million delayed draw term loan and is undrawn. Solaris currently has more than $120 million of liquidity, including availability under the credit facility.\nSolaris’ Chief Financial Officer Kyle Ramachandran commented, “The increased borrowing capacity, combined with our cash balance, provides ample liquidity to not only fund the expansion of our rental fleet and finance the completion of phase one of the Kingfisher Facility, but also enhanced flexibility to execute on additional opportunities we may identify in the market.”\nThe credit facility syndicate is composed of Woodforest National Bank (“Woodforest”), Cadence Bank, N.A., Community Bank of Texas, N.A. and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch. Woodforest will serve as the administrative agent for the new Credit Facility. For further information regarding the credit facility, please refer to the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\nOperational Update\nEarlier this month, Solaris commenced commercial operations at its Kingfisher Facility when it took delivery of its first rail shipment of proppant for its anchor tenant under a seven-year contract previously announced on August 2, 2017. Simultaneously, Solaris has completed the first phase of integration between its Railtronix and PropView™ inventory management systems, providing our customer full visibility from the mine to well site. Solaris announced the acquisition of Railtronix on December 11, 2017. Construction of the Kingfisher phase one build-out, including 30,000 tons of silo storage, is on budget and on track for completion by mid-2018.\nSolaris’ Chief Executive Officer Greg Lanham commented, “We are very excited about the progress we have made on the Kingfisher terminal. Our team is focused on providing exceptional service at the facility and ensuring phase one is completed on time and on or below budget.”\nSolaris ended 2017 with 77 mobile proppant management systems in the fleet, exceeding the previously provided forecast. Solaris currently has 81 systems in the rental fleet, all of which are deployed to customers, and expects to end first quarter 2018 with 96 to 98 systems in the fleet. Solaris has entered into 2018 term pricing and capacity arrangements with several customers and has secured take-or-pay arrangements on more than 40% of Solaris’ current fleet through 2018.\nLanham continued, “Our current backlog for 2018 is very strong. Driven by increased proppant loading levels and pad drilling activity, along with the execution and supply-chain logistics benefits that our systems provide to our customers, we are seeing rising demand, including for our 12-pack configuration. We have increased demand from our long-term customers, as well as a robust pipeline of orders from new customers, as we increase our total addressable market. Our operations team has once again stepped up to the challenge, increasing our manufacturing capacity from six systems per month to eight.”\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results Conference Call\nSolaris will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time).
