    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 12:52 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Asia shares take a breather, dollar takes a dive Wayne Cole 5 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian share markets took a time out on Wednesday as investors were left breathless at the breakneck pace of recent gains, while a fresh burst of speculative selling took the U.S. dollar to three-year lows on the euro. \nMost Asian stock indices are up anywhere from 5 to 10 percent since the start of the year with many at all-time highs. \n“These markets are absolutely flying and have had seemingly one-way moves since late December,” noted Chris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG. \n“There has clearly been a wall of capital hitting these markets, as is the case with many Asian currencies,” he added. “One simply can’t rule out further upside here, even if there are growing risks of buyers’ fatigue kicking in.” \nEarly Wednesday, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS eased 0.2 percent, having jumped 1.2 percent on Tuesday to an all-time peak. \nJapan's Nikkei .N225 lost 0.8 percent as the yen strengthened, though that was from a 26-year top. \nFigures out of Japan showed exports growing for a 13th straight month, led by record demand from China and Asia as a whole, while manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years. \nInvestors looked to have largely shaken off worries about a trade war, sparked when U.S. President Donald Trump’s slapped steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in a move condemned by China and South Korea. \nKorea's main index .KS11 was flat, while China's blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 dipped 0.1 percent. The latter is still up more than 8 percent on the year so far and near its highest since mid-2015. \nOn Wall Street, a 10 percent surge in Netflix ( NFLX.O ) led gains across the tech sector as it became just the latest to top market forecasts. So far, 82 percent of reporting companies have beaten estimates. \nThe Nasdaq .IXIC ended Tuesday with gains of 0.71 percent and the S&P 500 .SPX 0.22 percent, while the Dow .DJI edged down a tiny 0.01 percent. EUROPE ON A ROLL \nIn currency markets, the dollar remained under fire as investors wagered the Federal Reserve would be far from the only central bank to tighten this year as growth spread more widely. \nThe sea change has been greatest in Europe where a survey of consumers overnight showed confidence jumped to a 17-year high in January. \n“Both investors and consumers in Europe have started 2018 in a cheery mood, as the rotation away from the U.S. as the epicentre of global growth continues,” said ANZ analyst Richard Yetsenga in a note to clients. \nThe upbeat data only reinforced speculation the European Central Bank might take a step toward an eventual tightening at its policy meeting on Thursday. \nThat helped lift to euro to another three-year top at $1.2335 EUR= , and it was last trading at $1.2320. The dollar made a matching trough against a basket of major currencies at 89.917 .DXY. \nIt also ran into selling against the yen even though the Bank of Japan tried hard on Tuesday to quash talk it might curb its massive asset buying campaign anytime soon. \nThe dollar was last down 0.36 percent at 109.90 JPY= , having breached support at 110.00 for the first time since September. \nThe British pound GBP= powered up as far as $1.4048, its highest since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, aided by optimism around Britain's chances of securing a favourable Brexit deal. [GBP/] \nThe dollar’s decline has been a boon to commodities priced in the currency, with gold edging up to $1,341.26 an ounce XAU=. \nOil prices were consolidating after jumping more than 1 percent on Tuesday, with benchmark Brent crude hitting $70 a barrel for the first time in a week. \nBrent futures LCOc1 were off 14 cents at $69.82, still not far from the three-year high of $70.37 reached on Jan. 15, while U.S. crude CLc1 eased 4 cents to $64.43 a barrel.
