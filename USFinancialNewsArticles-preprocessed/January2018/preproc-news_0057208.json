(CNBC)\n* No pivot: Trump's first SOTU address didn't change a thing (CNBC)\n* Here are the policy areas where Trump is urging Democrats to work with him (CNBC)\nIN THE NEWS TODAY Trump said he would \"100 percent\" allow the public release of a GOP-drafted memo alleging surveillance abuses by the FBI and Justice Department. Officials have warned that releasing the memo could set a dangerous precedent. (Washington Post)\nTrump has been talking to his friends about possibly asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute special counsel Robert Mueller, NBC News reports. It's unclear what charges Mueller could possibly face in such a situation.\nHillary Clinton said she should have fired an aide in her 2008 presidential campaign that was accused of sexual harassment. She posted a lengthy statement last night on Facebook (FB) before Trump's State of the Union address. (NY Times)\nLarry Nassar, the doctor accused of sexually assaulting more than 150 women and girls, will be confronted again by victims as he faces another sentence. The event could unfold the same as a hearing last week that ended with Nassar getting sentenced to up to 175 years. (AP)\nAmazon (AMZN) told employees its new health-care partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P.

The new entity will be known as Fuji Xerox and keep its New York Stock Exchange Listing. Current Xerox shareholders will receive $9.80 per share in cash in the form of a special dividend.\nElectronic Arts (EA) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.18 per share, missing estimates by a penny, with the videogame publisher's revenue also slightly below estimates. However, the company also gave stronger than expected guidance for the current quarter, with the launch of its \"UFC 3\" game set for later this week.\nFoot Locker (FL) was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"perform\" at Oppenheimer, which cites a cheap valuation for the athletic footwear and apparel retailer's shares and the likelihood of increased sales momentum from new Nike (NKE) offerings.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) beat estimates by 3 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 8 cents per share. The chip maker's revenue also topped forecasts, as did its current quarter guidance.\nAlign Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.19 per share, well above the 96 cent consensus estimate, and the maker of Invisalign dental braces also saw revenue beat forecasts\nWATERCOOLER Music service Spotify quietly released a new standalone app for Android that's dedicated to quick, easy playlist and station listening.
