    "text": "Tax impact - $3.35 bln gain \nHelped by - One-time gain related to the new tax law \nHurt by - Higher-than-expected non-interest expenses for 2017; $58.48 bln vs est $54.62 bln \nExecutive comment: “The only piece of that pro-growth agenda people can really sink their teeth into is that tax reform that just occurred ... I see a lot to like in it” CEO Tim Sloan \nAnalyst’s take: \nRBC - (rating: “outperform,” PT: $60) Although there were many moving parts in WFC’s Q4, overall revenue performance was underwhelming and suggests co has yet to fully move past its sales practice issues \nBarclays - (rating: “overweight,” PT: $75) WFC’s 2018 expense guidance was “okay” ($53.5 bln-$54.5 bln vs. consensus at $53.7 bln) \nBMO - (rating: “market perform” PT: $62) Despite WFC’s 6 pct cost-driven Q4 miss, its forward estimates are essentially unchanged; broker remains bullish on banks \nEvercore - (rating: “outperform,” PT: $65) WFC’s expectations for 2018 expenses in a range of $53.5 bln-$54.5 bln is positively below its estimate of $55 bln \nCitigroup Inc \nAdj. EPS (beat) - $1.28 vs est $1.19 \nRev (beat) - $17.26 bln vs est $ 17.22 bln \nTax impact - $22 bln charge \nHelped by - Growth in consumer banking, especially in Asia and Mexico \nHurt by – Charges related to the new U.S. tax law \nExecutive comment: “Tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders,” - CEO Michael Corbat \nAnalysts’ take: \nCredit Suisse - (rating: “outperform”, PT: $86) Citi’s Q4 results “solid” relative to expectations, where fundamentals were just fine with revenue modestly above forecast in the Global Consumer Banking segment \nInstinet - (rating: “buy”, PT: $86) Despite mixed results overall, sees modest share outperformance given low expectations for Q4 2017 and better-than-expected Consumer credit trends. While tax guidance did not surprise and capital hit was slightly greater than anticipated, results prove “good enough” this quarter \nRBC - (ratings: “outperform,” PT: $79) Although significant non-cash charges related to tax reform obfuscated Q4 performance, underlying trends were generally “strong” and core results exceeded estimates \nBernstein - (rating: “outperform,” PT: $84) Citi reported a messy Q4 results but its core trends came in a touch better. Modest upward inflection in Global Consumer growth (Mexico better) was a positive for Q4 \nBank of America Corp \nAdj. EPS (beat) - 47 cents vs est. 44 cents \nRev (miss) - $20.4 bln vs est. $21.53 bln \nTax impact - $2.9 bln charge \nHelped by - 11 percent rise in net interest income to $11.46 billion \nHurt by - Tax-related charges, lower trading revenue compared with a year earlier, $292 million charge related to troubled South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International \nExecutive comment: Some tax savings would be funneled into technology investments but the bulk of the windfall would be returned to investors - CEO Brian Moynihan \nAnalysts’ take: \nMoody’s analyst David Fanger - We consider BAC’s results to be credit positive and consistent \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc \nAdj. EPS (beat)- $5.68 vs est. $4.91 \nRev (beat)- $7.83 bln vs est. $7.61 bln \nTax impact - $4.4 bln charge \nHelped by: Investment banking revenue due to strong debt and equity underwriting \nHurt by: One-time charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul, a slump in trading revenue \nExecutive comment: “We are working intensely to achieve our $5 billion in strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns” - CFO Marty Chavez \nAnalyst’s take: \nCredit Suisse - (rating: “neutral,” PT: $267) GS’ earnings were a mix of positives and negatives with investment banking and investing & lending both stronger and more than offsetting weakness in trading \nInstinet - (rating: “neutral,” PT: $238) Investment bank results surprised “positively”. However disappointment on trading/continued share loss, coupled with lower-quality sources of earnings strength will result in share underperformance \nJPMorgan - (rating: “overweight,” PT: $278) GS’ overall trading results disappointing, mainly in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution, even in light of known low volatility levels. Expects GS to operate with headwinds in Q1 (like Q4) compared to peers due to its business and client mix \nJMP - (rating: “market perform”) GS’ core results were modestly better than expectation but not close to the magnitude of the headline beat \nMorgan Stanley \nAdj. EPS (beat)- 84 cents vs est. 77 cents \nRev (beat)- $9.5 bln vs est. $9.2 bln \nTax impact - $1.2 billion charge \nHelped by: Underwriting revenue; Wealth management \nHurt by: Tax provision; Trading revenue \nExecutive comment: Morgan Stanley has met or exceeded all the goals laid out in early 2016 - CEO James Gorman \nMorgan Stanley’s bond trading revenue plunged 45 percent in the quarter, the business still delivered more than $1 billion in average quarterly revenue for the full year. Gorman has said the business needs to generate at least that much to be sustainable. \nAnalyst’s take: \nArgus Research - Investments in wealth management business and favorable equity market are helping MS lower earnings volatility, which should aid stock’s valuation over time \nCredit Suisse - (rating: “outperform,” PT: $59) MS reported “solidly positive” Q4 results. MS’ medium-term targets and 2018/2019 financial targets, which include wealth management pre-tax margin of 26-28 pct and expense efficiency ratio of <73 pct should be well-received \nCompass Point - (rating: “sell,” PT: $49) MS’ reported a “beat” on both top and bottom line, driven by gains in investment banking and wealth management businesses \nNomura - (rating: “buy,” PT: $64) Despite some pockets of revenue weakness, Q4 results showed key tenets of MS bull case. In the backdrop of difficult trading, MS’ results are impressive and expect strategic review to reinforce the bull case Compiled by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Edited by Maju Samuel",
