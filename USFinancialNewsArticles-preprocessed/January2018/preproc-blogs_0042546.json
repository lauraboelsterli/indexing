    "text": "Shares of Starbucks fell 3 percent on Thursday after the company posted same-store sales growth and revenue that missed analyst expectations.\nSame-store sales came up short in all of the company's regions. However, growth in China was robust, with same-store sales rising 6 percent on the back of a 6 percent increase in transactions.\nIn the quarter ended Dec. 31, Starbucks said net income rose to $2.25 billion, or $1.57 per share, from $751.8 million, or 51 cents per share, a year ago.\nExcluding items, Starbucks earned 58 cents per share in the latest period, which was a penny better than analysts were expected. Not included in that number is a 7 cents per share benefit from changes in the U.S. tax law.\nAdjusted EPS: 58 cents ex. items vs. 57 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $6.07 billion compared to $6.18 billion projected, according to Thomson Reuters Overall same-store sales: Up 2 percent vs 3 percent growth projected, according to StreetAccount The company said that global same-store sales rose 2 percent in the quarter, however forecasts called for same-store sales to be up 3 percent, according to StreetAccount.\nThis is the fifth quarter in a row that global same-store sales have been positive, but the company has missed analyst expectations in this metric by 70 basis points or more.",
