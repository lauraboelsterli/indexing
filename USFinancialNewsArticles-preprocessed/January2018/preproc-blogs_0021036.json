    "text": "If you don't know Phil Rosenthal's name, you probably know his work. He was the creator of the critically acclaimed CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond which aired for 9 seasons and won more than 70 Emmys.\nRosenthal's new show Somebody Feed Phil, available on Netflix, said the idea came from Ray Romano's real-life lack of interest in travel.\n\"It started on Raymond, it started when we went to Italy with the show,\" Rosenthal told CNBC's On the Money in an interview.\n\"Ray had never been to Europe ,\" he added.\nNot only that, but Rosenthal said Romano didn't really want to go. However, Romano's perspective changed after filming the episode in Italy.\n\"That's when the light bulb went off, because I got such a high seeing it happen to him, I thought what if I can do this for other people?\"\nSomebody Feed Phil showcases 6 cities: Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Mexico City, Saigon, and New Orleans where he eats an assortment of food from high-end restaurants to street vendors.\nOne of the chefs featured is Jay Fai, a street vendor in Bangkok, who prepared a crab omelet that Rosenthal deemed \"one of the best things you'll ever eat.\"\nAnd he's not alone in his opinion. After filming the episode, Fai earned a Michelin star , the first ever in Bangkok. \nSo how does Rosenthal pick which cities to feature?\nHe said he wants to start with \"Earth's greatest hits, the best, most accessible places to go.\"\nBangkok may not seem like an obvious choice to many, but Rosenthal disagreed.\n\"Everyone speaks English, it's a big modern city, all the conveniences, you're going to have a hotel, you're going to have a bedâ€¦the food is unbelievable,\" Rosenthal explained.\nIn his New Orleans episode, Rosenthal says you'll see beignets, jambalaya, as well as a few unexpected surprises such as an Israeli restaurant called Shaya, as well as a \"veggie reuben\" made with collard greens instead of meat.\nThis isn't Rosenthal's first travel show. I'll Have What Phil's Having was produced by PBS and ran in 2015. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, the show was too expensive to make . \nNetflix , which is spending billions on original content , picked up the show under a new title.\nOn working with Netflix, Rosenthal said the company gives him a lot of creative freedom.\nHe added, \"You don't worry about competition because it's like you go into a store, and everything's there on the shelf for you. You already bought an all-you-can-eat buffet.\"\nOn the Money airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.",
