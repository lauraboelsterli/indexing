    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, expressed opposition on Tuesday to a bipartisan Senate immigration deal set to be unveiled on Wednesday.\nLujan Grisham said in a hallway interview that the Senate measure would make parents of “Dreamers” - people brought illegally to the country as children - “second-class citizens” and had other problems “that would give me both as a member (of Congress) and as the chairwoman of the caucus heartburn.”\nLujan Grisham has thrown her weight behind a bipartisan bill being introduced in the House of Representatives that is narrower than the Senate bill and would not address all the immigration issues being sought by the White House.\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
