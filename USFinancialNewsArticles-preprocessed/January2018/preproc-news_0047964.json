    "text": "TREVOSE, Pa., Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- StoneMor Partners L.P. (NYSE:STON) (“StoneMor” or the “Partnership”) today announced it has reported financial results for the third quarter 2017. Investors are encouraged to read the Partnership's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which contains additional details, and can be found at www.stonemor.com .\nTHIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nRevenues were $84.0 million, an increase of $3.3 million over the prior year period. Year-to-date (nine month period ending September 30, 2017) revenues were $252.9 million, an increase of $15.0 million over the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increases in the sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services partially offset by a decrease in investment and other income. Year-to-date cash from operations were $24.7 million, an increase of $6.2 million over the prior year period, primarily due to the Partnerships continued focus on constructive delivery of pre-need merchandise. Net loss was $9.6 million, a decrease of $0.3 million from the prior year period. Year-to-date net loss was $29.7 million, an increase of $5.2 million over the prior year period. The increase was largely due to an increase in professional fees, litigation costs, and recruiting costs resulting from the delayed filing of our 10-K and various changes in our senior management. Losses were also impacted by increased costs associated with serviced marker orders, amortization of cemetery property as well as increases in selling expenses associated with the increase in cemetery merchandise revenues. Merchandise Trust value at September 30, 2017 reached $512.2 million, an increase of $5.1 million over the $507.1 million reported at December 31, 2016. Deferred revenue at September 30, 2017 reached $903.9 million, an increase of $37.3 million over the $866.6 million reported at December 31, 2016. The increase in deferred revenues mostly reflected increases in deferred contract revenues and deferred merchandise trust revenues.\nEXECUTIVE COMMENTARY\nPaul Grady, StoneMor’s President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are pleased that we are now current with SEC filings after spending 2017 focused on efforts to complete our accounting review, make the related restatement, and bring our filings current. We appreciate the patience demonstrated by our unitholders as we worked through this process. In 2017, we also needed to address the issues that adversely impacted revenues and cash flow and ultimately resulted in the Board’s decision to not pay a distribution for the second and third quarters of 2017, and we focused on improving operations across the organization and continuing with efforts to grow the salesforce. While there is still work to do across the organization and with the salesforce, encouragingly, we are seeing signs of stabilization.”\nRobert B. Hellman, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the General Partner, commented, “Eliminating the distribution for the second and third quarters of 2017 was, as we’ve said, a very difficult decision, but one we felt was necessary to preserve liquidity for the longer term health and stability of the business. We are now living within the four corners of the balance sheet, meaning all working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions must come out of operating cash flow. We came into 2017 with leverage a little higher and tighter than we’d like, and as the year progressed, we encountered significant non-recurring costs. The result was that our leverage was increasing modestly as the year progressed. So we took the prudent course of action.\"\nContinued Hellman, “We understand the importance of distributions to our unitholders, but distributions need to be made from a strong foundation, and we have more work to do to get there. Looking forward, we believe we should have at least $25 million of availability on our credit facility, which would translate into a leverage ratio of about 3.75. Getting to there from our current position may require a few more quarters in which we preserve our operating cash and manage our leverage by not making distributions, but we believe the long-term benefits of the added liquidity outweigh the benefits of paying a reduced distribution today.”\nTHIRD QUARTER OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nCemetery Operations\nCemetery revenues were $69.5 million, an increase of $2.8 million over the prior year period. Year-to-date revenues were $205.8 million, an increase of $13.0 million over the prior year period. Operating income was $8.6 million, a $1.6 million increase over the prior year period. Year-to-date cemetery operating income was $26.2 million, a $2.8 million increase over the prior year period. Preneed cemetery contracts sold were 10,411 compared to 12,795 in prior year period. Year-to-date contracts sold were 33,934 compared to 36,955 in the prior year period. The decline in preneed contracts in the third quarter and year-to-date periods were due to promotions run in the third quarter of 2016 that were not repeated in 2017. At-need cemetery contracts sold were relatively flat at 14,211 compared to 14,609 in prior year. Year-to-date at-need contracts sold were 45,070 compared to 44,845 in the prior year.\nFuneral Home Operations\nFuneral home revenues were $14.5 million, a $0.4 million increase over the prior year period. Year-to-date revenues were $47.1 million, a $1.9 million increase over the prior year period. Funeral home operating income was $1.2 million, a $1.6 million increase over the prior year period. Year-to-date, operating income was $7.3 million, a $4.9 million increase over the prior year period. Funeral calls for the third quarter were 3,902, a decline of 83 from the prior year period. Year-to-date funeral calls were 12,244, a decline of 505 from the prior year period.\nCORPORATE EXPENSES, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nCorporate overhead expenses for the third quarter 2017 were $11.9 million compared to $10.1 million in the prior year period, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $39.1 million compared to $30.1 million in the prior year period. The increase was largely due to an increase in professional fees, litigation costs, and recruiting costs resulting from the delayed filing of our 10-K and various changes in our senior management. Interest expense was $6.9 million in the third quarter 2017 compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 interest expense was $20.4 million compare to $17.4 million in the prior year period. The increase was due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance and the weighted average interest rate on the line of credit balance outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to prior year periods. As of September 30, 2017, the Partnership had $8.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $307.7 million of total debt, including $142.9 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility. StoneMor’s leverage ratio pursuant to its Credit Agreement for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, was approximately 4.46 compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 4.5.\nEARNINGS CALL\nAs previously announced, StoneMor will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2017 financial results on January 29, 2018 at 10:00 AM ET.
