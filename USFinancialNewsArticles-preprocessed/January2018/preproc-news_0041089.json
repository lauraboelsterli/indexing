JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both were up 1.3 percent and Goldman Sachs gained 1.5 percent, helping the S&P banking index rise more than 1 percent.\nCaterpillar climbed about 1 percent after reporting higher monthly machine retail sales\nUnited Technologies was up 1 percent and General Dynamics rose 3.10 percent following results.\nAbbott Laboratories jumped 4 percent after quarterly profit and 2018 adjusted earnings forecast beat estimates.\n“The favorable market bias continued to be supported by earnings reports,” said Wiegand.\nUnited Continental tumbled 10 percent after the airline said it plans to increase capacity, likely threatening its profit margin. American Airlines fell 5.3 percent while Delta Air Lines dropped 5 percent.\nTexas Instruments fell 5.4 percent after the company posted its slowest revenue growth in four quarters.\nThe Dow Jones AirLines index fell 5.2 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,601 to 1,120. On the Nasdaq, 1,507 issues rose and 1,203 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Herb Lash in New York.; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
