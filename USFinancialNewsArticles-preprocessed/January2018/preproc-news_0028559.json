    "text": "LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Greeceâ€™s five-year government bond yield fell to its lowest level since late September on Wednesday, extending a downward move on upbeat sentiment as Greece is seen heading towards exiting its bailout programme this year.\nGreece wants to create a cash buffer of up to 19 billion euros ($23 billion) to cover debt repayments after it exits its current bailout programme and plans three new bond issues by August, government officials told Reuters on Tuesday.\nThe yields on five-year Greek bonds fell to 3-1/2 month lows at 2.856 pct, down 10 bps on the day. Other Greek bond yields were 2-5 basis points lower on the day. (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan)\n ",
