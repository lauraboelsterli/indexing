    "text": "Carson City, NV & Hong Kong, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 12 ReTech Corporation (OTC: RETC) released an update to its shareholders about the latest Company activities.\nDear Shareholders,\nAfter a busy and productive 2017, I want to provide a synopsis of our ongoing projects and discuss what the future holds for our Company in 2018.\nFirst, regarding the Letters of Intent signed with Active Fashion Group and The J. Peterman Company, our team has been working hard to close these transactions. We believed that we would have these transactions completed by year end 2017, however the holiday season got in the way and we were unable to get all the parties together until after the holidays were over. We are looking forward to an announcement in the near future on both of these important acquisition projects.\nSecond, we will be attending the upcoming National Retail Federation’s Big Show at the Javits Center in NYC from January 14 to 16, 2018. We are hosting a dinner with the NRF on Monday evening (January 15) where we will be in front of many of the most important global retailers. In addition, we will be present in the show with our friends from Zivelo, Inc. on the exhibition floor. Most importantly, we will be showing our technology in a hospitality suite at the Cachet Boutique Hotel near Javits Center where we will be able to demonstrate our technology to American and international retail management teams during the duration of the show.\nThird, we have signed another LOI and we are also close to acquiring NYC based Krazy Larry, Inc. d/b/a Krazy Larry Pants® from its owners, Larry Palnick and Jacob Golob. The transaction was structured as a stock for stock exchange for 100% of the equity interests of the two owners for 12 Retech common equity.\nKrazy Larry Pants is a rapidly growing branded apparel company offering pants, skirts, jackets and blouses to the female shopper primarily within the borders of the United States. They sell their products wholesale to boutiques and in 2017 reached $7.4 million in sales with approximately $1.6 million in EBITDA. Sales growth has been robust over the past five years and averages 20% compounded. All Krazy Larry management team will be retained and incentivized to further grow their operations.\nOn the Unified Commerce, omni-channel technology side of our business, we have announced projects with several prominent retailers.\nTwo pilot projects to deploy appropriate pieces of our 12 Technology Suite with the Hudson Group from the US and Manor AG from Switzerland are slated to begin in the first quarter of 2018.\nWe have also entered the last phase of development of the 12 Sconti mobile application for Swiss shoppers, which will feature Wüst Bäckerei & Konditorei A.G., a Swiss bakery group with 12 locations, and Fresh A.G. a grocery produce wholesaler who has thousands of grocery stores as clients. Meanwhile, we are busy recruiting additional merchants in the same geography to make our 12 Sconti application valuable to shoppers in Switzerland.\nOver the past six months, we have been getting warm receptions from the retailers that we have been in front of so far. In 2018, we will be accelerating the pace of introducing and deploying our 12 Technology Suite offerings with prominent retailers in Asia, Europe and North America.\nAlso, we are seeing a lot of interest from the micro-brand community. We are also expecting to accelerate the pace at which we find synergistic micro-brand acquisition opportunities as the word spreads to others from what we have accomplished so far.\nOn a different front, we want you to know that 12 ReTech Corporation has applied to the OTC Markets Group for up listing to the OTCQB market. As of this date, the application is pending approval.\nOur company has accomplished a lot in the 6 months of being public since June 2017. We have ambitious goals for 2018 and look forward to a bright future. Thank you for being a shareholder and rest assured that all of us will continue to be work hard to enhance the value of your holdings in the upcoming year and beyond.\nSincerely,\nAngelo Ponzetta\nChief Executive Officer\n12 ReTech Corporation (OTC: RETC)\nAbout 12 ReTech Corporation:\n12 ReTech Corporation (OTC : RETC) Leading the Profitable Convergence of Traditional and Online Retail C ommerce Through Technology — The Omni-Channel Solution.\nWe are a publicly listed holding company whose operating subsidiaries develop, improve, acquire and/or license technologies designed to bridge the convergence between real world \"Brick and Mortar\" stores with effective Online retailing, creating a new, fun and exciting way of transacting Commerce.
