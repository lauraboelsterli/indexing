BHP Billiton was among the biggest boosts to the index, climbing 1.2 percent to its highest since May, 2015. \nBHP is on track for its ninth straight positive session, and will likely finish the first week of the new year up more than 3 percent. \nSouth32 Ltd posted a 2.5 percent gain, touching its highest in over nine weeks. \n“Growth has been hard to come by domestically ... global cyclical exposures have provided some access to growth,” said Hennessy. \nOil rose to its highest since May, 2015, on concerns that unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories could hit supply. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index drew back from record highs hit in the previous session to fall 0.3 percent, its biggest intraday percentage drop since mid-December. \nThe index is, however, headed for an eighth straight weekly gain. \nTelecom stocks dominated the losses, with Spark New Zealand Ltd slipping 1.6 percent to a four-week trough.
