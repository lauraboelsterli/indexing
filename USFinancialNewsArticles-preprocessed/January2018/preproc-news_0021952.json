    "text": "AMSTERDAM & DUIVENDRECHT, Netherlands--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nKiadis Pharma N.V. (“Kiadis Pharma” or the “Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam and Brussels: KDS) , a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative T-cell therapy products to make bone marrow transplantations safer and more effective for patients, today announces that at its next General Meeting of Shareholders, the Kiadis Pharma Supervisory Board will nominate Subhanu Saxena to be appointed as a new member of the Supervisory Board.\nSubhanu Saxena is currently a Regional Director with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as well as partner New Rhein Healthcare and Senior Advisor to Bain Capital. He was, until recently, the Managing Director and Global Chief Executive Officer of Cipla, a publicly listed, leading Indian pharmaceutical and biotech company with global operations and around 25,000 employees. During Mr. Saxena’s leadership Cipla was transformed into a more international and agile company. Prior to joining Cipla, Mr. Saxena was Head of Global Product Strategy and Commercialization and member of the Executive Committee at Novartis. Before that, Mr. Saxena was CEO of Novartis UK and held various leadership roles in business development. Prior to joining the pharma industry Mr. Saxena worked with leading global companies including Citicorp, the Boston Consulting Group and PepsiCo across markets in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. Mr. Saxena holds a Graduate degree in Engineering from Oxford University and an MBA from INSEAD, France.\nArthur Lahr, CEO of Kiadis Pharma, commented: “I am delighted Subhanu has decided to join our Supervisory Board. As we continue to professionalize our company and prepare for the potential European commercial launch of ATIR101™ in H2 2019, Subhanu’s vast leadership experience in building and transforming a wide variety of organizations will be of immense value for Kiadis Pharma and help us tremendously to make ATIR101™ widely available to patients.’’\nSubhanu Saxena added: “I am very pleased to join the Kiadis Pharma Supervisory Board and am impressed by the Company’s investigational product and technology platform, which I am convinced can serve patients with a safer and more effective bone marrow transplantation. I look forward to support the further maturing of Kiadis Pharma.’’\nMark Wegter, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Kiadis Pharma, commented: “We are very happy to welcome Subhanu to our Supervisory Board. His wealth of global strategic and commercial experience will be invaluable to Kiadis Pharma in the next stages of its growth and continued transformation into a successful commercial stage company.”\nAbout Kiadis Pharma\nKiadis Pharma’s allodepleted T-cell immunotherapy product can make haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) safer and more effective. Single dose Phase 2 data with lead product ATIR101™ given after a HSCT in patients with blood cancer shows a strong and clinically very relevant improvement over literature for the Baltimore protocol, without the risk of severe chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD). Based on the positive results from the Phase 2 trial, the Company submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2017, for approval of ATIR101™ across the EU as an adjunctive treatment in HSCT for malignant disease. Kiadis Pharma received Day 120 questions in September 2017 and is on track for potential (conditional) approval in Q4 2018 and launch in H2 2019. Kiadis Pharma is conducting a Phase 3 trial with ATIR101™ across Europe and North America (head to head against the Baltimore protocol). The first patient was enrolled in December 2017.\nIn September 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ATIR101™ the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. ATIR101™ has been granted Orphan Drug Designations both in the US and Europe.\nThe Company’s shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Brussels under the ticker KDS.\nWebsite: www.kiadis.com\nCompany presentation: http://www.kiadis.com/company-presentation/\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements, beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking, which reflect Kiadis Pharma’s or, as appropriate, Kiadis Pharma’s directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
