    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 10:01 AM / in 3 hours Finnish industrial workers to strike against unemployment benefit cuts Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nHELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Finnish industrial workers will go on a one-day strike on Feb. 2 to protest against the centre-right government’s cuts to unemployment benefits, Finland’s largest industry union said on Friday. \nThe strike will occur on the same day that SAK, the central organisation for blue-collar unions, is holding a mass demonstration against the cuts in Helsinki. \nThe unions are protesting against a law that reduces monthly unemployment benefit by 4.6 percent if claimants fail to do 18 hours’ work in three months and actively seek new employment. \nFinnish transportation and construction workers announced similar strikes on Tuesday. \nThe Industrial Union has over 225,000 members and is estimated to represent around 75 percent of Finnish export industry.
