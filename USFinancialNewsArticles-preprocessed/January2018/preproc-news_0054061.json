We continue to strengthen our portfolio through our innovative and disciplined investment activities that will allow us to continue to deliver cash flow and FFO per share growth.\"\nU.S. Malls and Premium Outlets Operating Statistics\nOccupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2017. Base minimum rent per square foot was $53.11 at December 31, 2017, an increase of 2.9% compared to the prior year period. Leasing spread per square foot for the trailing 12-months ended December 31, 2017 was $7.42, an increase of 11.4%.\nPortfolio Net Operating Income (\"NOI\") and Comparable Property NOI\nTotal portfolio NOI growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 4.5%.

Comparable property NOI growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 3.2%.\nDividends\nToday, Simon's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.95 per share. This is an 11.4% increase year-over-year. The dividend will be payable on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2018.\nSimon's Board of Directors also declared the quarterly dividend on its 8 3/8% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE: SPGPrJ) of $1.046875 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 16, 2018.\nDevelopment Activity\nDuring the quarter, the Company announced plans to create the Southeast's premier mixed-use development at Atlanta's Phipps Plaza, headlined by the arrival of a new Nobu Hotel and Nobu Atlanta Restaurant. Additional elements of this exciting new development call for a unique, curated dining experience, a 90,000 square-foot Life Time® Athletic healthy living and entertainment destination, and a 12-story Class A office building, complete with a three-story lower level parking garage. Construction is slated to commence in 2018 with a phased opening beginning in spring 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we started construction on two new development projects scheduled to open in 2018, including:\nMalaga Designer Outlet (Malaga, Spain); scheduled to open in November. Simon owns a 46% interest in this project. Queretaro Premium Outlets (Queretaro, Mexico); scheduled to open in December. Simon owns a 50% interest in this project.\nConstruction continues on two new development projects scheduled to open in 2018, including:\nPremium Outlet Collection Edmonton IA (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada); scheduled to open in May.

The two new notes offerings had a weighted average coupon rate approximately 60 basis points lower than the notes that were retired.\nThe Company also amended and extended its $4.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, which reduced pricing to LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points and extended the term to June 30, 2022.\nWith regard to secured debt activity, we closed or committed on 20 mortgage loans totaling approximately $2.9 billion, (U.S. dollar equivalent), of which Simon's share is $1.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate and weighted average term on these loans is 3.37% and 6.7 years, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Simon had approximately $8.0 billion of liquidity consisting of cash on hand, including its share of joint venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company currently estimates net income to be within a range of $6.90 to $7.02 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2018 and that FFO will be within a range of $11.90 to $12.02 per diluted share.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation for the expected range of estimated net income available to common stockholders per diluted share to estimated FFO per diluted share:\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018\nLow\nHigh\nEnd\nEnd\nEstimated net income available to common stockholders\nper diluted share\n$6.90\n$7.02\nDepreciation and amortization including Simon's share\nof unconsolidated entities\n5.00\n5.00\nEstimated FFO per diluted share\n$11.90\n$12.02\nConference Call\nSimon will hold a conference call to discuss the quarterly financial results today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, Wednesday, January 31, 2018.

Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K.\n(C)\nThis report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO, FFO per share, comparable FFO per share and comparable EPS. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.\nWe determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\n(D)\nIncludes our share of:\n-\nGains on land sales of $2.2 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $12.3 million and $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nStraight-line adjustments increased income by $7.4 million and $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $34.5 million and $56.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nAmortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.4 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $6.0 million and $9.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n-\nDebt premium amortization of $0.0 million and $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $0.2 million and $19.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(E)\nGain upon acquisition of controlling interests and sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $8.1 million and $84.6 million, respectively.
