    "text": "TORONTO, Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Currency Exchange International, Corp. (the “Company”) (TSX:CXI) (OTCBB:CURN), is pleased to announce its financial results and present management's discussion and analysis (\" MD&A \") for the three month period and year ended October 31, 2017 (all figures are in U.S. dollars except where otherwise indicated). The complete financial statements and MD&A can be found on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.\nFinancial Highlights for the Year Ended October 31, 2017 compared to the Year Ended October 31, 2016:\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2017, transactional activity between the Company and its customers increased 38.3% to 974,000 transactions from 704,000 for the year ended October 31, 2016. Since October 31, 2016, the Company has added 49 new wholesale banknote relationships representing 1,423 new transacting locations as well as three new branch locations;\nRevenues increased 21% or $5.6 million to $32.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $26.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2016;\nNet operating income increased 15% or $1 million to $7.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $6.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2016. The increase in net operating income is attributable to an increase in the number of customer transactions resulting from the addition of three new CXI branches as well as 10% growth in wholesale banknote transacting locations since October 31, 2016; and\nNet income increased 5% or $180,000 to $3.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 from $3.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2016. The lower rate of growth in net income compared to net operating income is attributable to a 56% increase in income tax expense that arose because of a change in the mix of income between the Company’s Canadian and US based operations.\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2017 compared to the Three Month Period Ended October 31, 2016:\nDuring the three month period ended October 31, 2017, transactional activity between the Company and its customers increased 31% to 278,000 transactions from 211,000 for the three month period ended October 31, 2016;\nRevenues increased 22% or $1.7 million to $9.4 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2017 from $7.7 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2016;\nNet operating income increased 18% or $390,000 to $2.6 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2017 from $2.2 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2016. The increase in net operating income was primarily due to an increase in the number of customer transactions resulting from the addition of three new CXI branches as well as 10% growth in wholesale banknote transacting locations since October 31, 2016; and\nNet income decreased 3% or $42,000 to $1.3 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2017 from $1.4 million for the three month period ended October 31, 2016. The decrease in net income is primarily due to increased income tax expense in the quarter.\nSelected Financial Data\nThree-months\nending Revenue Net operating\nincome Net income\n(loss) Total assets Total equity Earnings per\nshare (diluted) $ $ $ $ $ $ 10/31/2017 9,355,315 2,609,517 1,337,947 63,968,227 56,492,618 $0.21 7/31/2017 9,862,335 3,597,678 1,944,247 71,348,901 55,545,083 $0.31 4/30/2017 7,172,429 1,424,291 625,052 66,875,712 52,111,070 $0.09 1/31/2017 6,087,142 290,024 (85,776 ) 60,399,965 51,438,703 ($0.01 ) 10/31/2016* 7,692,144 2,219,101 1,379,937 62,196,008 50,752,352 0.22 7/31/2016* 7,708,332 2,603,843 1,484,257 71,027,239 49,568,941 0.24 4/30/2016* 5,854,925 1,160,181 479,540 57,181,863 48,527,966 0.08 1/31/2016* 5,572,055 894,364 298,377 50,313,593 46,308,790 0.05 * Restatement made in Fiscal Year 2015 to correct the presentation of a gain on foreign exchange along with its corresponding income tax impact which was required to be presented under IFRS as other income.
