The legislation should be \"declared dead on arrival\" and does not meet White House requirements on border security, Sanders said. Published 7 Mins Ago SHARES Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump, right, listens while Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, speaks during a meeting with bipartisan members of Congress on immigration in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. \nPresident Donald Trump is rejecting a proposed bipartisan immigration bill. \nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the legislation brought forth by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois is \"unacceptable\" to Trump. \nSanders adds that the legislation should be \"declared dead on arrival\" and does not meet White House requirements on border security. \nThe failure to reach an immigration deal earlier this month was the driving force behind the recent, brief federal government shutdown. \nThe White House had indicated that it would not re-open negotiations on immigration until the shutdown ended.",
