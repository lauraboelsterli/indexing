    "text": "VERNON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Highlands Bancorp, Inc. (OTCPink:HSBK), parent company of Highlands State Bank, reported a fourth quarter net loss of $19,000 in 2017 compared to net income of $501,000 for the same period of 2016. The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a one-time, non-cash charge of $658,000 reflected in the tax expense line, associated with the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform), and is related to the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax asset (DTA) arising from a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. Fourth quarter net loss available to common stockholders was $21,000 or $.01 per diluted share in 2017 compared to net income available to common stockholders of $499,000 or $.26 per diluted share for the same period in 2016. Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $313,000 to $1,957,000 or $.71 per diluted share, when compared to $1,644,000 or $.88 per diluted share for the year of 2016. Without the impact of Tax Reform, net income available to common stockholders increased $138,000 or 27.7% to $637,000 or $.23 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and increased $971,000 or 59.1% to $2,615,000 or $.94 per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income increased by $547,000 to $3,517,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net interest income of $2,970,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $1,686,000 to $13,223,000 from $11,537,000 for 2016 primarily as a result of loan portfolio growth. The provision for loan losses was $217,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $764,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2016, the Company’s provision totaled $87,000 and $522,000 for the fourth quarter and year respectively. The provision for loan losses reflects management’s continued assessment of the reserves maintained on non-performing loans. Charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $57,000 compared to charge-offs of $397,000 in 2016. Recoveries of previously charged off loans totaled $2,000 in 2017, and $86,000 in 2016. The ratio of non-performing loans and performing TDRs to total loans was .96% at year-end 2017, compared to .86% at year-end 2016.\nNon-interest income was $861,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1,177,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income was $3,188,000 decreasing $902,000 from $4,090,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases for 2017 were the result of lower gains on sales of mortgage loans, which were down $276,000 for the quarter and $742,000 for the year, and reduced loan fees which reflected declines of $14,000 for the quarter and $157,000 for the year. In addition, the Company had losses on the sale of securities during 2017 of $39,000 for the quarter and $11,000 for the year. Non-interest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 declined $140,000 to $3,138,000, compared to $3,278,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016, and decreased $776,000 to $11,507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12,283,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of decreased expenses for compensation and benefits, rent, and professional fees. These declines were partially offset by the write-off in the fourth quarter of a $175,000 mortgage license intangible asset which arose from the purchase of Secure Lending Solutions, Inc. in 2014.\nTotal assets were $449.0 million on December 31, 2017, an increase of $54.0 million or 13.7% from $395.0 million on December 31, 2016. Deposits increased $46.3 million or 13.5% from $342.8 million on December 31, 2016 to $389.1 million on December 31, 2017. Net loans outstanding, including loans held for sale, increased $65.2 million or 19.4% to $401.8 million as of December 31, 2017 from $336.6 million the previous year end. Total equity was $28.5 million on December 31, 2017, increasing $1.8 million or 6.7% from $26.7 million on December 31, 2016.\nForward-Looking Statements: This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, either expressed or implied, which are provided to assist the reader in understanding anticipated future financial performance.
