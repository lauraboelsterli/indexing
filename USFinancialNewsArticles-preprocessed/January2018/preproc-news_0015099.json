    "text": " 39 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago Wheelchair-bound athlete honoured for climbing up mountain Pak Yiu 2 Min Read \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - A car accident seven years ago stripped professional Hong Kong rock climber Lai Chi-wai of his ability to walk, but this did not stop him climbing up a mountain that is roughly the height of New York’s Empire State Building. Wheelchair-bound Lai Chi-wai climbs the Lion Rock in Hong Kong, China December 9, 2016. Bylson Wong/Handout via REUTERS \nThe 35-year-old, who is paralysed from the hip down, recently became the first Chinese athlete to be nominated for the Laureus World’s Best Sporting Moment of the month after he successfully scaled Lion Rock - a 495 metre tall (1624 feet)mountain which symbolizes a “Hong Kong spirit” of persistence, resilience and unity. \nThe Laureus World Sports Award honours the best sportsmen and sportswomen of the year, as well as sporting moments of the month. The awards organisation was founded by Swiss-based luxury goods firm Richemont and German carmaker Daimler. \nLai lost the December award to a viral video which showed a packed sports stadium of 70,000 people in Iowa turning and waving to children in an adjacent hospital. \nBut he said he was surprised he was nominated to begin with, and hoped his story could inspire Chinese people and athletes with disabilities. \n“To me climbing to the top was accomplishing a dream of mine,” Lai said. \n“It also - by climbing the mountain - meant that I could show to my friends and supporters that I have overcome one of the lowest points in life: even though I’m in a wheelchair I can challenge other sports and still be able to do what I love most.” \nA four-time champion of the Asian Rock Climbing Championships and the world’s first Chinese winner of the X-Game’s extreme sports, Lai climbed up Lion Rock on December 9, 2016, upon the 5th anniversary of the car accident.
