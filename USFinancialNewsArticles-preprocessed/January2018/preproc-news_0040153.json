Investec has a “hold” rating on the stock.\nThe Wolverhampton-based company, which brews ales such as Lancaster Bomber, Brakspear and Mansfield, said own-brewed volumes rose 33 percent in the period.\nMarston’s said margins fell slightly from last year due to cost increases, but were in line with expectations.\nLike other operators in the British pub sector, Marston’s has also been battling increased costs, most notably from wage inflation, rising property costs and unfavourable currency exchange rates.\nMarston’s said it remained on target to open 15 pub restaurants and bars and six lodges this year.\nShares in the company were down 4.6 percent at 109.3 pence at 0917 GMT.
