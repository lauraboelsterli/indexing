He struggled for consistency for the majority of the campaign. \nHis best performance in Melbourne came four years ago, when he beat Robin Haase and Andreas Seppi to reach the third round. \nHEAD-TO-HEAD (Djokovic 2 - Young 0) \nJune 2017 - Djokovic d Young 6-2 7-6(9) (Eastbourne, outdoor grass) \nAug. 2006 - Djokovic d Young 4-6 6-3 6-0 6-1 (U.S. Open, outdoor hard) (Compiled by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond)",
