    "text": "NEW YORK, NY, Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tauriga Sciences, Inc. (OTC PINK:TAUG) (\"Tauriga\" or the \"Company\"), engaged in building its business through the development, distribution, and licensing of proprietary products as well as the evaluation of potential acquisition opportunities and equity investments, today announced that the Company has established a wholly-owned subsidiary to acquire interest(s) in patents and other intellectual property pertaining to Blockchain technology (“Blockchain”). The Company’s Board of Directors has decided to fund up to $300,000 towards this corporate initiative; these funds will come from the Company’s available cash position.\nWhile Tauriga has already disclosed one relatively small diversification into a specific cryptocurrency (Groestlcoin), the Company believes that the acquisition of patents or interests in intellectual property relating to Blockchain, with an aim towards commercialization, provides shareholders with the best opportunity for long-term and accretive exposure to this market sector. The Company has yet to definitively identify any specific patents or technologies that may qualify for investment from the above-mentioned initiative. There can also be no guarantees that the Company will determine that any intellectual property under evaluation is worthy of acquisition or investment, or that the Company will ultimately acquire Blockchain technologies at all.\nTauriga’s Chief Executive Officer, Seth M. Shaw, expressed, “The Company believes that there is a potentially significant opportunity for its shareholders in acquiring patent interests that cover certain aspects of Blockchain technology. The Company has worked hard the past 2 ½ years and built the financial strength to execute on these compelling types of potential opportunities. A rigorous due diligence process would precede any future prospective investment(s). Tauriga is pleased to have available, as much as $300,000 in cash to put towards meaningful exposure to this burgeoning field.”\nThe Subsidiary has been named “Tauriga IP Acquisition Corp.” and the initial legal work will be completed by the international law firm of Nixon Peabody LLP. This new subsidiary has been incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nLastly, the Board of Directors of the Company voted unanimously in favor of the formation of the above-referenced corporate initiative.\nABOUT TAURIGA SCIENCES, INC.\nTauriga Sciences, Inc. (OTC PINK:TAUG) is engaged in building business through the development, distribution, and licensing of proprietary products as well as the evaluation of potential acquisition opportunities/equity investments. The Company is presently focused on its upcoming contemplated launch of a Cupacu Butter based lip balm product branded under the name: Herman. The Company believes that one of its most important strengths is its access to and relationships with potentially substantial distribution systems and networks.
