    "text": " 42 AM / a few seconds ago German Ifo business morale improves unexpectedly in January Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - German business confidence rose unexpectedly in January, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting that Europe’s biggest continued to fire on all cylinders at the beginning of 2018. \nThe Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 117.6 in January from 117.2 in December. \nThe January reading beat expectations in a Reuters consensus forecast of analysts who had forecast a dip to 117.1. \n“The German economy made a dynamic start to the year,” Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
