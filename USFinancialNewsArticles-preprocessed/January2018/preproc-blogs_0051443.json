    "text": "Published: Jan 25, 2018 6:28 a.m. ET Share \nLeaders are expected to discuss the nearly seven-year conflict in Syria, the Iran nuclear deal and denuclearization in North Korea Reuters Theresa May is expected to tread a careful path during her meeting with President Donald Trump in Davos on Thursday. Above, May and Trump last appeared together last September in New York. \nBy Jenny Gross \nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is set to meet President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum on Thursday for a discussion clouded by public strain between their two countries. \nThe meeting in Davos, Switzerland, their first since Trump abruptly called off a planned trip to London earlier this month, puts the British leader in a tight spot. She needs Trump’s support as the U.K. leaves the European Union and seeks to build economic relations with the U.S. But she also has publicly admonished him and sought to avoid the political fallout of appearing too close to a leader who is unpopular in her home country, including within her Conservative Party. \nThe U.K. leader is expected to tread a careful path. In her speech in Davos last year, May implicitly rebuked Trump with a strong defense of globalization and free trade. This year, May is instead expected to urge technology companies to do more to crack down on extremist material, according to excerpts of her speech sent by her office. ‘It’s a special relationship not only in words, but it’s how we work together, really, on every issue. It is very, very hard to find any place where our interests don’t overlap almost completely with those of the United Kingdom.’ -White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster \nDowning Street has said the special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. is long and enduring. White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster earlier this week sought to play down tensions, emphasizing the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. remains “special” and that the president was prioritizing his meeting with May, the first of his four bilateral meetings with foreign leaders in Davos. \nRead: British pound sets course for $1.40, with no end to rally in sight, strategists say \nTrump was one of the few world leaders to support Brexit, and May wants to secure a quick and favorable trade deal with the U.S. to show that Britain can make up for the costs of leaving the bloc’s free trade zone.",
