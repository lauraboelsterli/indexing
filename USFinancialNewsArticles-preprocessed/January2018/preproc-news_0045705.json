    "text": "Quarterly Revenues of $146 Million\nEarnings Per Share Increase to $0.19\nQuarterly Dividend of $0.20 Per Share Continued\nHUNT VALLEY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TESSCO TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED (NASDAQ: TESS) , today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2018, ended December 24, 2017.\nThird-Quarter Highlights:\nRevenue of $146.3 million Revenue growth in government, value-added reseller and private system operator markets Overall expense management contributed to operating margin of 1.5%, compared with 1.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Recorded benefit from new federal tax law of approximately $0.3 million $0.19 EPS and $0.38 EBITDA per diluted share* Company expects a profitable fourth quarter for the first time in three years, with year-over-year double-digit fourth-quarter revenue growth Declared quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share\nThird Quarter\nFY 2018\nThird Quarter\nFY 2017\nSecond Quarter\nFY 2018\nRevenue $146.3M $147.2M $145.1M Earnings per diluted share $0.19 $0.15 $0.21 EBITDA per diluted share* $0.38 $0.38 $0.51 Operating margin 1.5% 1.4% 2.2% Cash balance $0.0M $8.4M $0.2M Line of credit balance outstanding\n$5.9M $0.0M $13.3M * EBITDA per diluted share and EBITDA (on which EBITDA per diluted share is based) are Non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures indicated by an asterisk (*) either in the above chart or in the text of this press release are so indicated as a means to direct the reader to the discussion of Non-GAAP Information below and the reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP results included as an exhibit to this press release.\nThird-Quarter Revenue by Market:\nYear over Year\nQ3 FY 2018 vs.\nQ3 FY 2017\nSequential\nQ3 FY 2018 vs.\nQ2 FY 2018\nPublic Carrier (12)% (17)% Value-Added Resellers 8% (4)% Government 29% (3)% Private System Operators 8% 3% Retail (8)% 15% Total (1)% 1% “We executed well on our strategic initiatives during the third quarter, putting us on pace to finish the year with revenue growth and a significant increase in profitability,” said Murray Wright, President and Chief Executive Officer. “On the top line, sales were slightly down primarily due to the timing of orders in the carrier ecosystem. We expect this decline will be more than offset by increased sales in the fourth quarter, as the pipeline for this market is very strong. Outside of the carrier market, sales were up in the government, value-added reseller and private system operator markets. Our bottom-line growth was a direct result of improved operating leverage due to our successful productivity enhancements, as well as a lower effective tax rate resulting from the new tax law.\n“As we approach the finish of the 2018 fiscal year, we are confident we will continue to execute our strategic plan,” Wright continued. “We are focused on balancing the implementation of our go-to-market strategy with improved operating efficiency. Our emphasis on improving the customer experience is generating increased opportunities. We are leveraging a strong value proposition, and we expect double-digit, year-over-year revenue growth in our fourth quarter. Unlike the previous two fourth quarters, we expect positive bottom-line earnings.”\nThird-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nFor the fiscal 2018 third quarter, revenues totaled $146.3 million, compared with $147.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Increases in sales to the Company’s government, value-added reseller and private system operator markets were offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the public carrier and retail markets.\nGross profit was $29.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $30.0 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The slight decline in third quarter gross profit year over year was primarily the result of the decline in total sales. Gross margin was 20.2% of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 20.4% for last year’s third quarter.\nAs a result of the Company’s ongoing expense control initiatives and productivity enhancements, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by $0.4 million to $27.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, from $27.9 million in the same quarter of the prior year.\nPrimarily as a result of the new tax law, the Company’s provision for income taxes declined from $0.8 million in last year’s third quarter to $0.5 million in this year’s third quarter.\nNet income and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.6 million and $0.19, respectively, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with net income and EPS of $1.2 million and $0.15, respectively, for the prior-year third quarter.\nYear to date, net income and earnings per share were $4.0 million and $0.48, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $0.28 in the same period of fiscal 2017. Revenue and gross profit increased 5% and 3%, respectively, over the same period.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nAs of December 24, 2017, the outstanding balance on the Company’s line of credit was $5.9 million. Cash flow used in operations was $7.3 million during the first nine months of the 2018 fiscal year, primarily due to increases in inventory and accounts receivable. Inventory increased by $2.5 million during the first nine months of the fiscal year to $66.5 million as of December 24, 2017. Trade accounts receivable increased $20.3 million in the first nine months of the year to $85.0 million. During the third quarter, inventory and trade accounts receivable both decreased sequentially, resulting in cash provided by operations for the quarter of $9.5 million. The Company expects inventory and the balance on its line of credit to grow during the fourth quarter as it continues to implement new strategic programs with significant carrier customers while also building inventory for the spring building season.\nCash Dividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share payable on February 28, 2018 to common stockholders of record on February 14, 2018. Any future declaration of dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, is subject to future determinations of the Board of Directors.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company currently anticipates double-digit year-over-year revenue growth and to be profitable in its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter.\nForecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. The nature of the business is that TESSCO typically ships products within several days after booking orders. The lack of an order backlog makes it even more difficult to forecast future results. The Business Outlook published in this press release reflects only the company’s current best estimate and it assumes no obligation to update the information contained in this press release, including the Business Outlook, at any time.\nThird-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss third quarter 2018 results tomorrow, Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

All participants should call or access the website approximately 10 minutes before the conference begins.\nA telephone replay of the conference call will be available from 11:30 a.m. ET on January 24, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. ET on January 31, 2018 by calling 855-859-2056 (domestic) or 404-537-3406 (international) and entering confirmation #6563009. An archived replay of the conference call will also be available on the Company's website .\nNon-GAAP Information\nEBITDA and EBITDA per diluted share are measures used by management to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations, and to provide a general indicator of the Company's operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges). EBITDA is defined as income from operations, plus interest expense, net of interest income, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA per diluted share is defined as EBITDA divided by Tessco’s diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nManagement believes EBITDA and EBITDA per share are useful to investors because they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA per diluted share is a recognized term under GAAP, and EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, neither EBITDA nor EBITDA per diluted share is intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as certain cash requirements, such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements, are not reflected.\nA reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP results is included as an exhibit to this release.\nAbout TESSCO Technologies Incorporated (NASDAQ: TESS)\nTESSCO Technologies Incorporated (NASDAQ: TESS) is a value-added technology distributor, manufacturer and solutions provider.
