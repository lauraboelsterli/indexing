It’s a pleasure to be a part of and I‘m really excited about what we can achieve in the coming years.” \nThe 26-year-old has been instrumental in helping Pep Guardiola’s side lead the Premier League by 12 points. His eight goals and 13 assists in all competitions has also contributed to City reaching the last-16 of the Champions League, the semi-finals of the League Cup and the FA Cup fourth round. \n“Kevin’s new deal is great news for our Club. He has shown this season how important he is to the team and has been integral in everything we’ve done so far,” City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain said.
