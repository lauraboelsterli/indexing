They got off to the worst possible start in the fifth minute when Brighton’s Anthony Knockaert rounded off a flowing move by squeezing the ball in at the far post for his second goal of the season. \nThe goal was Brighton’s fastest ever in the Premier League. However, it was far from one-way traffic and both keepers were kept busy before Steve Cook equalised against the club where he began his career with a clever back-flick header from a corner on 33 minutes. \nGlenn Murray also scored against his former side to restore Brighton’s lead at the start of the second half and the home side should have had a third when Jose Izquierdo shot instead of passing to Davy Propper, who was perfectly placed to score. \nBournemouth took full advantage and, after Jordan Ibe hit a post, equalised for the second time after a protracted scramble in the area from another corner. The ball eventually fell to Callum Wilson who stuck out a boot to divert the ball into the net. Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
