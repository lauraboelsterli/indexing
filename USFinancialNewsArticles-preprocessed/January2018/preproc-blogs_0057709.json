    "text": "Top News \nSamsung Stock Split Boosts Shares \nSamsung Electronics shares popped by 4.3% on the Korea Exchange after the company announced a 50:1 stock split. Samsung’s board approved the move, designed to make shareholders happy and more numerous, earlier Wednesday. Samsung, which also gave shareholders about half its free cash flow in dividends, said: “The split is…expected to add both liquidity and marketability to the company’s stock, which may contribute to enhancing corporate value in the long term.” Financial Times \nBlackstone Buys Thomson Reuters Data Unit Majority \nBlackstone Group and a handful of co-investors—Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore’s GIC Pte—are buying a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ financial and risk unit. The deal gives the business a valuation of $20 billion. Blackstone private equity chief Joe Baratta called the deal a “landmark transaction.” Bloomberg \nTalk of Big Correction \nJulius Baer CEO Bernhard Hodler reckons there will be a big market correction this year. “Generally I think we will see sooner or later a correction—hopefully it will be like a 5%, 10%, 15% correction, another very large one, but I think that will happen sometime in 2018,” he said, not sounding particularly worried about the prospect. CNBC \nXerox Independence Fades \nXerox Corp. reportedly aims to merge with a joint venture the company already has with Japan’s Fujifilm. The deal would leave Xerox’s U.S. shareholders with just under half of the merged company, if it goes through. Xerox shares would apparently continue to trade. Wall Street Journal Around the Water Cooler \nU.K. Wants China Free Trade Deal \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, who is flying off to China, says she wants a future free trade deal with the country. Negotiations cannot start until the U.K. leaves the EU, though, as EU countries can only negotiate trade deals as a bloc. In the meantime, May said, work can be done to help British companies do business in China. Channel NewsAsia \nTechnology’s Addictive Nature \nSocial media age limits should be enforced, according to Jean M. Twenge, a psychology professor who is among almost 100 child health advocates calling on Facebook to discontinue its Messenger Kids product. Twenge also says smartphone manufacturers should be subject to more regulation that helps parents more effectively restrict their children’s usage. Fortune \nCar-Sharing Hack \nAustralia’s largest car-sharing network, GoGet, has revealed that a hacker accessed its systems and its customers’ personal data seven months ago. New South Wales Police have reportedly identified the hacker, but are still trying to figure out how the suspect broke into the systems. Interestingly, given the current focus on swift breach notifications, the company said the police told it not to notify customers of the hack until now, in order to not jeopardize the investigation. IT News \nEmotional-Support Peacock \nA United Airlines passenger tried to bring a peacock on board at Newark Liberty International for emotional support, but the carrier turned the bird away for size and weight reasons. “We explained this to the customer on three separate occasions before they arrived at the airport,” United said in a statement.
