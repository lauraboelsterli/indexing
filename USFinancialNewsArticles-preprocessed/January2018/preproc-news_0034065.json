    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 8:35 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago British bookmakers' shares fall on fears of govt clampdown Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Shares in British gambling companies William Hill ( WMH.L ) and Ladbrokes Coral ( LCL.L ), which run retail betting shops, fell by more than 12 percent on Monday on reports that Britain is set to lower the limit on betting shop terminals to 2 pounds from 100 pounds in a move that could hit their revenue. \nThe move is being taken to help tackle the issue of problem gambling, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, citing an ally of new culture secretary Matt Hancock. \nThe government said in October it would reduce the top stake on the machines to between 2 and 50 pounds from 100 pounds depending on the outcome of a consultation which ends on Tuesday.
