Changes will take time to flow through to results,” Jefferies said. \nShares of Countrywide lost about 32 percent of their value in 2017. The shares on Thursday were on track for their worst single day since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. \nCountrywide expects full-year EBITDA to be around 65 million pounds ($89.98 million), 10 percent below Jefferies’ estimate, prompting the brokerage to cut its price target on the stock to 125 pence from 145 pence. \nIncome in the UK business is expected to fall 17 percent to about 205 million pounds for the year ended Dec. 31, with profit from London expected to drop 10 percent, the company said. \nTotal income in the sales and lettings business is expected to decline 14 percent for the full year, reflecting a weak fourth quarter. \nCountrywide now expects total group income for the full year to fall to 672 million pounds from 737 million pounds a year earlier. \nIn August, the company said its Chief Executive Officer Alison Platt would take on more responsibilities as it executes a new organisational structure $1 = 0.7224 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri, Bernard Orr",
