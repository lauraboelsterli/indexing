He leads the Pac-12 with 7.6 assists a game.\nBoatwright had five rebounds and Metu had four, as the Trojans had a 36-26 edge on the boards.\nBoatwright made four of the Trojans’ seven 3-pointers and Mathews had two. Mathews has eight 3-pointers in the last three games after moving into a reserve role.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
