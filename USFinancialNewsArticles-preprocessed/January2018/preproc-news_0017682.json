New Mountain acquired majority control of ACA in December 2013. ACA is the leading provider of risk management and technology solutions to the financial services industry in the U.S. and Europe.\n“Since taking a majority stake in ACA four years ago, New Mountain exceeded my expectations for partnership and value-creation,” said Robert L. Stype, CEO of ACA and one of ACA’s founders. “This is an exciting time for ACA as we enter our next phase of growth with our new partnership with Starr Investment Holdings. We have enjoyed working with the New Mountain team and thank them for helping us to significantly expand and solidify our leading industry position. We look forward to building upon this momentum with Starr.”\nFounded in 2002 by former SEC examiners and a state regulator, ACA services and develops its products with a team comprised of former SEC, FINRA, FSA, FCA, NYSE, CFTC, NFA, and state regulators, as well as former senior in-house compliance professionals and technologists from prominent financial institutions.

The company also has made substantial investments into new capabilities and product solutions to drive additional value for its customers and enable continued growth well into the future.\n“We are proud of our successful partnership with ACA. We saw great potential in ACA when we began our partnership four years ago, and have been continuously impressed with its management team and talented employees,” said Peter Masucci, Chairman of the Board of ACA and Managing Director at New Mountain. “We implemented a number of strategic initiatives to accelerate ACA’s growth and global potential, and look forward to seeing ACA continue to thrive moving forward. This new partnership will create significant value for all ACA stakeholders and we are confident that ACA is well positioned to continue on its impressive trajectory with Starr.”\n“ACA’s more than fourfold growth in enterprise value since 2013 demonstrates New Mountain’s commitment to partnership and business building through organic growth and acquisitions,” said Robert Mulcare, Managing Director at New Mountain. “We thank the founding partners, as well as ACA’s leadership and employees, for their tremendous efforts and collaboration over the past four years.”\nACA Compliance Group is receiving legal counsel from DLA Piper.
