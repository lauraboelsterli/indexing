FILE PHOTO: A woman exits the Viacom Inc. headquarters in New York, U.S. on April 30, 2013. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo \nCBS and Viacom are both controlled by ailing Sumner Redstone, 94, and his daughter Shari, through their privately owned movie theatre company, National Amusements Inc. \nSumner Redstone split Viacom and CBS into separate companies a decade ago. He and his daughter attempted to merge the two in 2016, but the effort failed. \nNational Amusements, CBS and Viacom declined to comment. Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Jonathan Oatis",
