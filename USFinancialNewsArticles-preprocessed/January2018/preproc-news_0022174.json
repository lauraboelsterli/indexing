Yet with the support of my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in California’s 49th District,” he said in a statement.Issa is from one of the 23 congressional districts won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election that are currently held by Republicans, who are now considered vulnerable in November congressional elections.
