    "text": " 06 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago Czech PM Babis to ask lawmakers to lift his parliamentary immunity Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday he would ask lawmakers lift his parliamentary immunity to face allegations of EU subsidy fraud. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis attends a parliamentary session during a confidence vote for the newly appointed government he leads, in Prague, Czech Republic January 10, 2018. REUTERS/David W Cerny \nPolice are investigating whether he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy a decade ago by hiding ownership of a farm and conference centre. Babis denies wrongdoing. \nBabis was speaking before a parliamentary committee meets on Tuesday to make a recommendation on whether to lift Babisâ€™s immunity from prosecution that he is granted as an elected member of the chamber.
