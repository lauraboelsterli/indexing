    "text": "SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s LG Display Co Ltd said on Tuesday its annual operating profit for 2017 reached 2.5 trillion won ($2.34 billion), up 88 percent from the previous year.\nThe increase was due to rising prices for large liquid crystal display (LCD) panels during the first half of the year as well as a more diversified product lineup, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.\nThe Apple supplier said its 2017 sales reached 27.8 trillion won, up 4.9 percent from the previous year. ($1 = 1,068.4800 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Tom Brown)\n ",
