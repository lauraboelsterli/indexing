(“Sun Capital”), a leading private investment firm specializing in leveraged buyouts and investments in market-leading companies, today announced that its affiliate has entered into an agreement to sell Robertshaw Controls Company (“Robertshaw” or “the Company”), a global leader in thermal, flow, and control management products and solutions.
