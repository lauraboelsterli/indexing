    "text": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce and technology company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and U.S. grocer Kroger Co have had early discussions on working together, including a meeting in which U.S. executives traveled to China, a source familiar with the matter said.\nThe business development talks are at an initial stage, and it is not clear if they will lead to any cooperation, the person said, declining to be named.\nThe discussions come as U.S. e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expanding aggressively into groceries with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market.\nSpokespeople for Kroger in the United States and Alibaba in China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
