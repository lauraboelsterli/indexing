In order to be able to fully be able to contribute in the board of SDS, Klevbo has chosen to avoid any risk of future conflict of interest by resigning from Invuo's Board.\n\"Tomas Klevbo has made critical contributions as a member of Invuo's Board. By resigning from Invuo's Board, and thereby eliminating any risk of conflict of interest, Tomas Klevbo will able to fully participate in the important work as member of SDS' Board,\" says Tomas Jalling.\nFor further information, please contact:\nMartin Schedin, CFO\nmartin.schedin@invuo.com\n+46 8 564 878 00\nThis information is such that Invuo Technologies AB (publ) is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
