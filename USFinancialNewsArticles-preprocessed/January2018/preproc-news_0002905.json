FILE PHOTO - Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz \nAthens has blocked the ex-Yugoslav republic’s attempts to join NATO and objects to its EU membership bid because it says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece’s own northerly region of that name. \n“I think 2018 will be the year when foreign policy issues that have been stuck in the mud for decades will be resolved,” Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias told reporters after a meeting of the inner cabinet. \n“We will all contribute to the wellbeing of all the Balkans,” he said. \nThe small ex-Yugoslav republic of about 2 million people declared independence in 1991, avoiding the violence that accompanied much of the breakup of Yugoslavia. \nBut Greece is withholding support for Macedonia’s further integration into international bodies, including NATO, until it agrees to change its name. \nAthens has only agreed that the country can be referred to in international venues as the “Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, as an interim measure until the dispute is resolved. \n“On the name issue, the government is negotiating and supports a compound name that will be comprehensively used throughout,” Kotzias said on Thursday, without elaborating Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
