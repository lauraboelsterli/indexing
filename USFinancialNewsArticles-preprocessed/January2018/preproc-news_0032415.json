    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 8:35 PM / Updated an hour ago Israel puts tunnel dug under Gaza border on display Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli military brought journalists on Thursday to film a 2 km (1.25 mile) tunnel dug by militants from the Gaza Strip to Israel, saying it was putting the construction on display to show the continuing threat it faces from the territory. \nThe Islamic Jihad militant group has claimed responsibility for building the tunnel, saying its aim was to use it to attack Israel in the next armed confrontation. \nTwelve Gaza militants, most of them from Islamic Jihad, were killed in the destruction of the tunnel and in rescue efforts when Israel destroyed the underground passage on October 30. Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe tunnel, around the height and width of an upright person, was lined with concrete slabs. It was discovered about 120 metres inside Israel near Kissufim, about six metres below ground, as tunnellers burrowed towards the surface looking to build an exit, the Israeli military said. \n“The tunnel that we see here is one of three tunnels that have been destroyed over the last two months,” Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, said. “The threat has not passed and the terror from Hamas has not passed.” \nPalestinian tunnel diggers have long operated in border areas of the Gaza Strip, using the underground passageways to bypass tight border restrictions imposed by Israel and Egypt on the movement of goods and people, and to smuggle weapons. \nIsrael captured Gaza in a 1967 war. It is home to two million Palestinians, who complain that the blockade has left the enclave isolated and impoverished. Israel cites security concerns for the restrictions, tightened after the Islamist militant group Hamas took power in Gaza more than a decade ago.
