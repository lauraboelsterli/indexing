This acquisition of Pennant Foods, from funds managed by Brockway Moran & Partners, is the third WKS transaction in which CapitalSpring has served as a financing partner.\nIn addition to CapitalSpring, the Company’s existing senior lenders, led by Wintrust Franchise Finance, served as co-lenders on the deal. Wintrust Franchise Finance is a division of Lake Forest Bank & Trust Company, N.A., a Wintrust Community Bank.\n\"We are very excited to work with the WKS team again and to support their initial acquisition in the Wendy's system,\" said Tee Isenhour, Principal at CapitalSpring. \"WKS has a long history of growth and operational excellence across multiple concepts and geographies, and we look forward to future opportunities together across their brand portfolio.\"\n“CapitalSpring brought a unique financing solution to the table that was tailor-made for this acquisition,” said Roland Spongberg, CEO of WKS. “We have enjoyed a relationship with the firm since 2011, and their consistent ability to leverage creative financing solutions to meet the needs of our business and our acquisitions makes them a trusted and reliable partner.
