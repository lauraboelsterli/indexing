The winners are now looking to replicate that success in 2018. Here are the victors, the secrets to their success and what they are expecting this year. 1:31 PM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 | 03:58 \nMorningstar announced its top fund managers on Wednesday. \nThe winners were chosen for their funds' outperformance in 2017, and those managers are now looking to replicate that success in 2018. \nHere are the victors, the secrets to their success and what they are expecting this year. Domestic stock fund manager of the year \nSteven Wymer — Fidelity Growth Company \nThe Fidelity Growth Company grew 36.8 percent last year, with its stakes in tech and biotech helping boost results. \n\"We put together this portfolio over a lot of years. We found some good stocks, and we stuck through them through some tough times and figured out which ones were going to carry the water for us over the years,\" the fund's portfolio manager, Steven Wymer, said in an interview with \" Power Lunch \" on Wednesday. \nFor example, Wymer bought Nvidia back in 2008. The stock rallied 82 percent in 2017. \nIn addition to Nvidia, the fund's top holdings include Apple , Amazon , Alphabet and Facebook . \nWhile the market has had a good runup, Wymer still sees opportunities for growth names this year. \n\"The opportunities should broaden out quite a bit. Not only is the U.S. economy accelerating, but the international economy is a tailwind to the market. Along with the weaker dollar, we're seeing some favorable business results translate back into U.S. earnings,\" he said. International stock fund manager of the year \nSarah Ketterer, Harry Hartford and team — Causeway International Value Morningstar called Causeway International Value 's stock selection \"quite solid,\" particularly in the eurozone and in South Korea. The fund saw a 27.1 percent return in 2017. \nTo find value, the fund's managers look for companies that are in operational distress but not financial distress. For example, the fund built a big stake in Volkswagen during the emissions scandal. The automaker was up more than 40 percent last year. \nThe fund also has a relatively low turnover portfolio of 50 to 60 names. \n\"Concentration means more bang for the buck. So when we have a big weight in Samsung Electronics it really makes a difference,\" said Sarah Ketterer, Causeway's CEO and co-founder. \n\"If you have small weights that means you've got this proliferation of stocks and you've diluted your great ideas,\" she told \"Power Lunch.\" show chapters",
