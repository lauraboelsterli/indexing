    "text": "January 3, 2018 / 4:51 PM / Updated 16 hours ago Rugby - Wales winger North doubtful for Six Nations opener Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Wales winger George North is a doubt for the side’s opening Six Nations fixture against Scotland after sustaining a knee injury while playing for his club Northampton Saints in the Premiership last weekend. Rugby Union - Premiership - Harlequins vs Northampton Saints - Twickenham Stoop, London, Britain - December 30, 2017 Northampton Saints' George North comes out of the tunnel at the start of the second half Action Images/Paul Childs \nNorth returned from a lengthy layoff due to a knee ligament injury, which ruled him out of Wales’ November internationals, as a substitute in Saturday’s 50-21 defeat by Harlequins and picked up another knock to the same area. \nSaints said that the 25-year-old will require up to four weeks of rehabilitation. \n“I‘m sure George will be diligent in his rehab and we all wish him a swift recovery,” Northampton Technical Coaching Consultant Alan Gaffney said on the club’s website (www.northamptonsaints.co.uk). \nNorth, who has 69 caps for Wales, is the latest to join a lengthy injury list for Warren Gatland’s side, with the likes of Taulupe Faletau, Sam Warburton, Jonathan Davies and Dan Lydiate also sidelined. \nWales kick off their Six Nations campaign against Scotland on Feb. 3 in Cardiff.
