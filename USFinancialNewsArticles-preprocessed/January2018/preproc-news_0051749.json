The company also said that Laura Schupbach will continue to report to Mack as head of Wells Fargo Auto (formerly Wells Fargo Dealer Services), which includes direct and indirect auto finance and commercial services. In addition, John Rasmussen will continue to lead the Personal Lending Group, including student lending and personal lending, and report to Community Bank Customer Segments leader Andy Rowe.\n“Michael is a seasoned and respected leader, with deep experience in both mortgage sales and servicing,” stated Mack. “He has demonstrated the ability to manage large, complex operations, and he has a true passion for designing innovative experiences that support our customers’ needs. I am confident that he is the right choice to lead the nation’s premier mortgage lender into a bright future. Under this new structure, Michael, Laura and John will advance our efforts to create an even more holistic approach to delivering retail banking and lending services to our customers and help them succeed financially.”\nDeVito most recently led mortgage production for the company, a post he assumed in October 2015, and before that ran its mortgage servicing operations.
