We are very excited to help grow the TRACE brand not only in Africa but worldwide.”\nTPG Growth’s partnership with TRACE highlights the rich opportunities that exist to invest in companies that have a presence in Africa, but can also operate successfully on a global level.\nTPG Growth has five investments across Africa, which include:\nGro Intelligence, a global agricultural data business.
