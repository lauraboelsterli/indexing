    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bluerock Value Exchange (BVEX) announced the sale of Chace Lake Villas, a 264-unit apartment community located in in Birmingham, Alabama. BVEX acquired the asset for $21.5 million in September 2012 and sold it for $28.3 million in December 2017 following a successful implementation of capital improvements that increased the property's net operating income (NOI) and resale value.\nThe property was acquired by BR Chace Lake, DST, a Delaware Statuary Trust (DST) structured for 1031 like-kind exchanges for accredited investors.
