Founded in 2016 and backed by Frazier Healthcare Partners , United Derm has quickly grown its practice group to 40 providers across 15 clinics, with additional locations in the greater Reno, NV and Austin, TX markets.\n“It is a great pleasure to welcome Renewal Dermatology to our growing family of practices,” said Jay Gunter, Chief Executive Officer at United Derm. “We recognize that administrative burdens place growing demands on our partners’ time and other resources, and look forward to supporting Dr. Kamenetsky and her team so they can focus on patients while maintaining their own quality of life—and still rest assured that the health of the practice is intact.”\nAbout United Derm Partners\nUnited Derm Partners is a Nashville-based physician services organization focused solely on the dermatology space.
