King Vajiralongkorn does not have the same level of devotion. \nThe festival, which will take place at the Royal Plaza, a public square in Bangkok, from February 8 to March 11, will feature exhibitions showcasing the life and work of his late father King Bhumibol and his great grandfather, King Chulalongkorn, who reigned from 1868 to 1910. \nThe festival will include gardens, fountains, and historic-looking structures. \n“The king wants Thai people to be happy by reminiscing about the past, that’s why the festival has a historical theme,” government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told Reuters on Monday.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva/Files \nHe has issued a number of royal decrees in recent months pertaining to the promotion and dismissal of palace officials. \nHe has also been given full control of the agency that manages the multi-billion dollar holdings of the monarchy. \nOutside of the palace, the king has ordered the organisation of public events such as weekend music concerts aimed at “bringing happiness to the people”. \nKing Vajiralongkorn’s formal coronation is expected to take place later this year and could signal the start of politics following a year of mourning and the late king’s funeral. \nThai laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organisations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.
