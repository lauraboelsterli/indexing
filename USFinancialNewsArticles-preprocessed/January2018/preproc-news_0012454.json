FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Arsenal - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - December 31, 2017 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger remonstrates with referee Mike Dean REUTERS/Darren Staples \nWenger, who was aggrieved after West Brom were handed a late penalty to level the match, was charged by the English Football Association for using inappropriate language and behaviour towards the match officials in their changing room after the game. \n“It follows an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today at which the Arsenal manager admitted that his language and behaviour ... was abusive, improper and questioned the integrity of the match referee,” the FA said in a statement. \nThe Frenchman received a four-match ban for misconduct last January for pushing the fourth official after his team’s 2-1 win against Burnley. \nWenger will serve his latest ban at Arsenal’s FA Cup tie against Nottingham Forest on Sunday, the first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Chelsea on Jan. 10 and the league game against Bournemouth on Jan. 14.
