    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 7:47 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Coach tells ex-USA gymnastics doctor Nassar in court to 'go to hell' Brendan McDermid 3 Min Read \nLANSING, Mich. (Reuters) - A coach who sent dozens of young girls for treatment to USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who pleaded guilty to molesting female athletes, told the disgraced physicians on Wednesday to “go to hell” for his crimes. \nThomas Brennan, a youth gymnastics coach, confronted Nassar in a Michigan courtroom on the second day of a sentencing hearing for the former doctor, who pleaded guilty in November to multiple counts of sexual assault. \n“For the record, go to hell,” Brennan said, glowering at Nassar. \nBrennan’s outburst came as he stood next to one of Nassar’s victims, Gwen Anderson, as she recounted the molestation she suffered at the hands of Nassar. \nAt one point during Anderson’s tearful testimony, Brennan barked at Nassar, “look at her.” \nNassar has sat through the proceedings with his head bowed, not making eye contact with the victims. He apologized for his crimes at the November hearing, local media reported. \nBrennan told Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina that he sent more than 100 girls to Nassar, whom he once considered a mentor. \n“The guilt I feel for that is hard to fathom,” he said. Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November 2017 to sexual assault charges, listens to a victim during his sentencing hearing in Lansing, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nMore than 100 victims are providing victim-impact statements during the four-day hearing, prosecutors said. \nThe judge has addressed each victim and repeatedly said she will make certain Nassar gets a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence.
