    "text": "January 9, 2018 / 2:54 AM / in 16 hours U.S. spy satellite believed destroyed after failing to reach orbit: officials Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. spy satellite that was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX rocket on Sunday failed to reach orbit and is assumed to be a total loss, two U.S. officials briefed on the mission said on Monday. \nThe classified intelligence satellite, built by Northrop Grumman Corp, failed to separate from the second stage of the Falcon 9 rocket and is assumed to have broken up or plunged into the sea, said the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe satellite is assumed to be “a write-off,” one of the officials said. \nThe presumed loss of the satellite was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. \nNorthrop Grumman built the multibillion-dollar satellite, code-named Zuma, and was responsible for choosing the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle, both officials said. \nAn investigation is under way, but there is no initial indication of sabotage or other interference, they said. \nSpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said: “We do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally.” \nSpace Exploration Technologies Corp, led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched its first satellite for the U.S. military with its Falcon 9 rocket in May of last year.
