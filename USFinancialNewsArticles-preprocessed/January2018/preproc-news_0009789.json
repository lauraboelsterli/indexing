Garfinkle, who joined Renovate America in 2015 as SVP and Head of Capital Markets, brings over 30 years of experience in financial services, much of it in structured products investment banking, sales & trading and M&A advisory.\nIn announcing the move, Guthrie cited Garfinkle's leadership, commitment to team, and his total focus on maximizing the organization's potential. Guthrie noted that under Garfinkle's leadership, Renovate America's Capital Markets team had become the gold standard among providers of Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing in terms of efficient execution in the structured-finance marketplace.\n\"An excellent CFO is someone who is a great business partner, who leads from up front and pushes from behind to make everyone across the organization better and provides the support necessary for our shared success,\" Guthrie said. \"Based on his track record and the way he has showed up since his arrival, I am confident that Adam will play that role for Renovate America.\n\"Adam's work in building the HERO PACE ABS platform has drawn an ongoing stream of capital into achieving public policy priorities, helping make Renovate America's public-private partnership with more than 700 local governments in three states a significant driver as we upgrade our energy infrastructure,\" Guthrie added.\nGarfinkle, whose new role took effect Friday, Jan. 5, spent 13 years as Head of the Asset Backed & Mortgage Backed Structured Finance Group at Bank of America Securities where he managed a team of more than 125 professionals.
