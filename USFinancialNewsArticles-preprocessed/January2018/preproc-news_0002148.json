Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net Closing snapshot : European shares rebound as oil, dollar and Wall Street rise This is it from us this evening : European shares have recovered from a muted start to the year thanks to the dollar and new records on Wall Street. Let's note that the implementation of MiFID II didn't crash the party. Well at least not today. (Julien Ponthus) MiFID II: I'm doing a middle office job today, trader says (1601 GMT) As MiFID II kicks in, a number of high net worth retail clients are not always compliant with the new rules and have had difficulties getting their trades processed, a sales trader reported. \"It's middle office rather than front today, he said, explaining that much of his day was devoted to sorting out his clients' problems rather than focusing on sales. (Julien Ponthus) ** MiFID II-Are secondary brokers already missing out? (1526 GMT) \"Some clients prefer going through their prime (broker) rather than through us to make sure things go smoothly,\" a trader from a second-tier brokerage told us this afternoon. \"There is less volume for us today,\" he said, adding that some clients were not MiFID II-ready and that trade reporting was proving to be a difficult task. (Julien Ponthus) ** 2017 sees record number of deals worldwide (1435 GMT) Deal making is another theme investors are considering at the beginning of the year, and whether the M&A wagon will continue to roll on in 2018. Last year was another blockbuster year: the number of worldwide deals hit a record in 2017, totaling $3.6 trillion, according to Thomson Reuters data. This was also the fourth year in a row where M&A activity surpassed $3 trillion. Interestingly while European M&A was up 17 percent in 2017, the U.S. saw a decline of 16 percent in the value of deals. Perhaps this is testament to the strength of the European economy, or the fact that debt has been so cheap? Here's a graphic from our Deals Intelligence colleagues: (Kit Rees) ** Gnawing on the bone of European equities: enjoy it while it lasts (1339 GMT) SocGen has repeatedly warned its clients that European equities are close to their historical averages in terms of valuation. Its message today is that there is \"not much meat on the bone\" left, even if today's traders seem to be in a clear \"risk-on\" mood. Strategists reckon \"exit strategies\" will do better this year as central banks start to turn the taps of stimulus off, and recommend holding sovereign bonds over equities. \"Be ready for the end of Goldilocks,\" strategists warn. Here are SocGen's top tips : (Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus) Lunchtime Update: European stocks hold in positive territory (1325 GMT) As we cruise into afternoon trading, European stocks remain positive, with tech the top-gaining sector. Over in the U.S. stocks futures are pointing to Wall St also opening higher, following the S&P 500's record close. Here's your European equity market snapshot: (Kit Rees) Shorting UK retailers, there's your thriller! (1222 GMT) While the first MIFID II trading day is not the action movie some had expected, the return to favour today of the UK retail sector is likely to be a real thriller (and not in a good way) for those short sellers who are betting on its downfall. Data from Astec Short Interest compiled by Helen shows that the amount of Next shares on loan surged in a year, from 2.3 million last January to 4.3 million yesterday. The cost to borrow also rose, indicating demand to short the shares increased. No doubt many of those short sellers are feeling the squeeze today and exiting their trades, helping the stock rise. Next, which had a horrible start in 2017, losing over 17 percent on Jan 4, is currently leading the FTSE with a 7 percent jump, lifting the sector with the likes of Primark owner Associated British Foods. Alasdair has an additional interesting fact for you : out of the 10 most shorted British stocks, 5 are from the retail sector: Debenhams, Ocado, WM Morrison, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury. (Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid) ** Buy-side traders say MiFID II could make it harder to access quality liquidity -survey (1120 GMT) Although the wide-ranging new regulations don't seem to be making huge ripples in trading immediately, some buy-side traders think it could make their jobs more difficult, a survey by trading platform ITG found. While 45 percent of respondents thought MiFID II would have \"no significant impact\" on their ability to access quality liquidity, 37 percent said it would become harder. That's nearly twice the 18 percent who saw the regulation actually helping traders find liquidity. Of course what makes liquidity 'quality' could be subjective, but MiFID II's clampdown on dark pools certainly takes some of the options off the table for traders. The survey also revealed some interesting patterns in the types of venues traders are more likely to transact in post-MiFID. Traditional lit markets were by far the most popular, while traders were more likely to shun electronic market maker and bank SIs. As many traders have been telling us this morning, it'll take a little more adaptation time before we can see for sure who the MiFID winners and losers are. (Helen Reid) ** If MIFID II were a movie, it wouldn't be a thriller (1100 GMT) While there has been some kind of excitement ahead of the implementation today of MIFID II rules, the feedback we're getting from trading floors across the markets is, well, not that exciting at all. \"At 1125, Paris time, after more than two hours of trading, there is nothing in particular to report,\" a major asset manager told us. There is, according to Thomson Reuters data, a drop in activity. Our correspondent Alasdair Pal, who dug the data, reports volumes on the STOXX 600 were down by around 25 percent in the first hour of Wednesday compared with a day previously. Against the first hour of trading on Jan 3 2017, volumes were down by 11 percent. Antoine Lesne, head of SPDR ETF Strategy for EMEA at State Street, told Helen that was to be expected. \"We clearly expect a slightly slower take-off as people are testing the pipes and so on. The expectation is that it (trading) will be slower but I am not sure. It was very slow yesterday as well so I wouldn’t say it’s because of MiFID only\". Maybe City A.M.'s spooky front page was a bit over the top: (Julien Ponthus) Dark pool migration drives December volumes for exchanges -UBS (1022 GMT) On the topic of MiFID II, UBS analysts made an interesting observation about the market share gains traditional European exchanges enjoyed in December 2017: \"We believe the December gains to market share were driven by a migration of volume away from dark venues as the market prepares for the implementation of the Double Volume Caps under MiFID II (starting today).\" Euronext is UBS' top pick and they also rate Deutsche Boerse a \"buy\", while LSE and Flow Traders are \"neutral\" and BME is a \"sell\".
