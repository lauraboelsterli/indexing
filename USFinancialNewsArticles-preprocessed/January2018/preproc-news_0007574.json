    "text": "January 6, 2018 / 1:10 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Brazil police request Temer answer questions in alleged graft probe Lisandra Paraguassu , Ricardo Brito 2 Min Read \nBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian police have requested that President Michel Temer answers 50 questions as part of an investigation into alleged corruption involving a decree regulating the country’s ports, a government spokesman said on Friday. Brazil's President Michel Temer reacts during breakfast with journalists at the Alvorada Palace in Brasilia, Brazil December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo \nPolice are investigating whether Temer took bribes in exchange for shaping the decree in a way that would benefit logistics firm Rodrimar SA, which operates some services in the Port of Santos, Latin America’s busiest container port. \nThe decree, published in May, lengthened the deadline for contracts governing port concessions, benefiting current operators. \nThe investigation adds to several graft allegations that have hammered Temer’s presidency, though he has so far managed to avoid a trial with the backing of Congress. \nTemer has denied any role in the corruption scandals. \nTemer’s attorney Antonio Mariz told Reuters on Friday he would answer the questions even though he is not legally obliged to do so. \nThe spokesman declined to expand on the content of the list of questions. \nAccording to local magazine Época, police have asked whether Temer was offered campaign donations by representatives from the Port of Santos in exchange for fulfilling their demands, among other questions.
