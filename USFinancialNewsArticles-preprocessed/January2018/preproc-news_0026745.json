    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Calif., Jan. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LRAD Corporation (NASDAQ: LRAD) , the world’s leading provider of acoustic hailing devices and advanced mass notification systems, today announced the acquisition of Genasys Holding S.L. (“Genasys”), a leading software provider of advanced location-based mass messaging solutions for emergency warning systems and workforce management.\nGenasys, headquartered in Madrid, Spain, has an experienced group of developers with over 200 man years of software development and a strong, international technical sales, service, and support team. Genasys currently has two main product offerings: news - a reliable solution for sending SMS-based warnings of public safety hazards to affected populations with industry-leading speed; and, haz – a low cost, easy-to-use solution for remotely monitoring employees, planning tasks, and managing workplace incidents.\n“The acquisition of Genasys enables LRAD to significantly enhance its advanced mass notification capabilities and pursue broader geolocation based mass messaging projects and services,” stated Richard S. Danforth, Chief Executive Officer of LRAD Corporation. “Many of the mass notification opportunities we target, including universities, cities, and countries, require an integrated location-based mass messaging service. With this acquisition, LRAD expects to generate revenue on initial installations and recurring revenue from long-term support contracts for updating and maintaining the messaging service over the life of the installations.”\n“I am eager to leverage LRAD’s worldwide sales channels to seek accelerated growth of the Genasys mass notification software solutions,” remarked Pablo Colom, Genasys' Chief Executive Officer. “Genasys has a solid track record of location-based mass messaging integrations and deployments, which include solutions for small workgroups to fully integrated country-wide systems. The synergies of Genasys’ push notification products and LRAD’s award-winning mass notification systems will provide state-of-the-art solutions to communicate potentially lifesaving information to those affected by severe weather, man-made and natural disasters and other emergencies.”\nRevenues for Genasys in calendar 2017 (unaudited) were €1.9 million. Total consideration for the acquisition is €3.1 million, which includes a €1.9 million purchase price and the assumption of €1.2 million of debt.\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the Genasys acquisition on Monday, January 22, 2018, at 12:00 pm U.S. EST.
