(HMN or the Company) (NASDAQ:HMNF), the $723 million holding company for Home Federal Savings Bank (the Bank), today reported net income of $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to net income of $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.08, a decrease of $0.27 from the diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 is due primarily to a $0.6 million increase in income tax expense. The increase is due primarily to the $1.1 million decrease in the Company’s net deferred tax asset as result of the reduction in the corporate federal tax rate in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Net income also decreased because of a $0.2 million decrease in the gain on sales of loans due to a decrease in mortgage loan activity. The loan loss provision also increased $0.5 million due to increased reserves established on certain commercial loans between the periods.\nPresident’s Statement\n“The decrease in the corporate federal tax rate had a negative effect on net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the write down of our deferred tax asset,” said Bradley Krehbiel, President and Chief Executive Officer of HMN. “Even though the corporate income tax rate change negatively impacted the fourth quarter results, we look forward to the positive impact of the lower federal tax rate on our earnings in future periods.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest income was $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.8%, from $6.7 million for the same period in 2016. Interest income increased $0.6 million because of an increase in the average interest-earning assets and a change in the composition of the average interest-earning assets held, which resulted in a 9 basis point increase in the average yields earned between the periods. While the average interest-earning assets increased $45.8 million between the periods, the average interest-earning assets held in higher yielding loans increased $39.4 million and the amount of average interest-earning assets held in lower yielding cash and investments increased $6.4 million between the periods. The increase in the average outstanding loans between the periods was primarily the result of an increase in the commercial loan portfolio which occurred because of an increase in loan originations and a reduction in loan payoffs between the periods. The increase in interest income as a result of these items was entirely offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of recognizing a lower amount of yield enhancements between the periods. Interest income decreased $0.6 million due to a decrease in the amount of yield enhancements recognized from loan prepayment penalties, yield adjustments on purchased loans, and the interest payments received on non-accruing and previously charged off commercial real estate loans. This resulted in a 35 basis point decrease in the average yield between the periods. It is anticipated that the yield enhancements relating to these items will be lower in subsequent periods as the pool of non-accruing and purchased loans continues to decline. The average yield earned on interest-earning assets was 3.89% for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 26 basis points from 4.15% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets is primarily related to the decrease in yield adjustments recognized between the periods on previously charged off commercial real estate loans.\nInterest expense was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2016. The average interest rate paid on non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.27% for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1 basis point from the fourth quarter of 2016. The average non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities increased $37.8 million between the periods, the average amount held in lower rate checking, savings, and money market accounts increased $17.3 million, the average amount held in higher rate premium money market accounts increased $21.4 million, and the average amount held in higher rate borrowings and certificates of deposit decreased $0.5 million between the periods. Net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.64%, a decrease of 25 basis points, compared to 3.89% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin is primarily related to the decrease in yield adjustments recognized between the periods on previously charged off commercial real estate loans.\nA summary of the Company’s net interest margin for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nFor the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Interest-earning assets: Securities available for sale $ 76,154 310 1.62 % $ 76,912 281 1.45 % Loans held for sale 2,030 25 4.89 2,783 27 3.86 Mortgage loans, net 114,808 1,182 4.08 108,133 1,072 3.94 Commercial loans, net 393,823 4,257 4.29 360,355 4,406 4.86 Consumer loans, net 73,964 913 4.90 73,969 900 4.84 Cash equivalents 28,045 76 1.08 20,908 23 0.44 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 818 4 1.94 806 2 0.86 Total interest-earning assets $ 689,642 6,767 3.89 $ 643,866 6,711 4.15 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW accounts $ 86,327 11 0.05 $ 89,864 14 0.06 Savings accounts 75,335 15 0.08 72,896 15 0.08 Money market accounts 192,399 171 0.35 170,475 99 0.23 Certificates 110,884 238 0.85 101,889 147 0.57 Advances and other borrowings 0 0 0.00 9,511 145 6.05 Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 464,945 $ 444,635 Non-interest checking 162,275 144,626 Other non-interest bearing deposits 1,037 1,206 Total interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest\nbearing deposits\n$ 628,257 435 0.27\n$ 590,467 420 0.28 Net interest income 6,332 6,291 Net interest rate spread 3.62 % 3.87 % Net interest margin 3.64 % 3.89 % Provision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.5 million compared to ($0.4) million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The provision for loan losses increased between the periods primarily because of the increase in the reserves required on certain commercial loans due to deterioration of their credit quality in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total non-performing assets were $3.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.1 million from September 30, 2017. Non-performing loans decreased $0.1 million and foreclosed and repossessed assets increased $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nA reconciliation of the allowance for loan losses for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 Balance at September 30, $ 9,277 $ 10,306 Provision 59 (374 ) Charge offs: Commercial (10 ) (80 ) Commercial real estate (50 ) 0 Consumer (25 ) (79 ) Recoveries 60 130 Balance at December 31, $ 9,311 $ 9,903 Allocated to: General allowance $ 8,238 $ 8,915 Specific allowance 1,073 988 $ 9,311 $ 9,903 The following table summarizes the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in the Bank’s portfolio and loan delinquency information as of the end of the two most recently completed quarters and December 31, 2017.\nDecember 31, September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 Non‑Performing Loans: Single family $ 949 $ 800 $ 916 Commercial real estate 1,364 1,666 1,384 Consumer 553 545 630 Commercial 278 297 343 Total 3,144 3,308 3,273 Foreclosed and Repossessed Assets: Commercial real estate 627 414 611 Consumer 0 1 16 Total non‑performing assets $ 3,771 $ 3,723 $ 3,900 Total as a percentage of total assets 0.52 % 0.52 % 0.57 % Total non‑performing loans $ 3,144 $ 3,308 $ 3,273 Total as a percentage of total loans receivable, net 0.54 % 0.57 % 0.59 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 296.11 % 280.45 % 302.56 % Delinquency Data: Delinquencies (1) 30+ days $ 1,789 $ 2,070 $ 917 90+ days 0 0 0 Delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease portfolio (1) 30+ days 0.30 % 0.35 % 0.16 % 90+ days 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % (1) Excludes non-accrual loans.\nNon-Interest Income and Expense\nNon-interest income was $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 10.8%, from $2.2 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in non-interest income is primarily related to the $0.2 million decrease in the gain on sales of loans due to a decrease in single family loan originations and sales between the periods. Fees and service charges decreased slightly between the periods due to a decrease in overdraft fees. Other non-interest income decreased slightly because of a decrease in the sales of uninsured investment products between the periods.\nNon-interest expense was $6.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, the same as the fourth quarter of 2016. Compensation expense decreased $0.1 million between the periods due primarily to a decrease in incentives earned because of the decrease in loan volume and a decrease in the number of employees between the periods. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased $0.1 million because of decrease in the non-capitalized software purchased between the periods. Professional services expense decreased $0.1 million between the periods primarily because of a decrease in legal expenses. These decreases in non-interest expenses were entirely offset by other increases in non-interest expense including a $0.2 million decrease in the gains on real estate owned because there were fewer sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same period of 2016. Other non-interest expense increased $0.1 due primarily to an increase in advertising expenses between the periods.\nIncome tax expense was $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.6 million from $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in income tax expense between the periods is due primarily to the $1.1 million decrease in the Company’s net deferred tax asset as result of the reduction in the corporate federal tax rate in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.\nReturn on Assets and Equity\nReturn on average assets (annualized) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 0.21%, compared to 0.99% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Return on average equity (annualized) was 1.88% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 8.93% for the same period of 2016. Book value per share at December 31, 2017 was $17.97, compared to $16.91 at December 31, 2016.\nAnnual Results\nNet Income\nNet income was $4.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 30.6%, compared to net income of $6.4 million for 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.90, a decrease of $0.44 per share compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.34 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income for 2017 is due primarily to a $0.3 million increase in income tax expense. The increase in income tax expense is due primarily to the $1.1 million decrease in the Company’s net deferred tax asset as result of the reduction in the corporate federal tax rate in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Net income also decreased $0.5 million due to a decrease in the gain on sales of loans because of a decrease in mortgage loans activity, $0.5 million due to a decrease in the gains on real estate owned because of fewer sales, $0.4 million due to an increase in other non-interest expenses primarily related to advertising expenses, $0.2 million because of an increase in compensation and benefits, and $0.1 million due to an increase in the loan loss provision between the periods. These decreases in net income were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $0.1 million between the periods as a result of an increase in the average interest-earning assets and a change in the composition of the average interest-earning assets held between the periods.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $25.9 million for 2017, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.5%, from $25.8 million for the same period of 2016. Interest income was $27.7 million for 2017, an increase of $0.4 million, or 1.2%, from $27.3 million for the same period of 2016. Interest income increased $2.4 million because of an increase in the average interest-earning assets and a change in the composition of the average interest-earning assets held, which resulted in a 6 basis point increase in the average yields earned between the periods. While the average interest-earning assets increased $43.2 million between the periods, the average interest-earning assets held in higher yielding loans increased $58.8 million and the amount of average interest-earning assets held in lower yielding cash and investments decreased $15.6 million between the periods. The increase in the average outstanding loans between the periods was primarily the result of an increase in the commercial loan portfolio, which occurred because of an increase in loan originations and a reduction in loan payoffs between the periods. The increase in interest income as a result of these items was partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of recognizing a lower amount of yield enhancements between the periods. Interest income decreased $2.1 million due to a decrease in the amount of yield enhancements recognized from loan prepayment penalties, yield adjustments on purchased loans, and the interest payments received on non-accruing and previously charged off commercial real estate loans. This resulted in a 29 basis point decrease in the average yield between the periods. It is anticipated that the yield enhancements relating to these items will be lower in subsequent periods as the pool of non-accruing and purchased loans continues to decline. The average yield earned on interest-earning assets was 4.13% for 2017, a decrease of 23 basis points from 4.36% for 2016. The decrease in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets is primarily related to the decrease in yield enhancements recognized between the periods.\nInterest expense was $1.8 million for 2017, an increase of $0.2 million, or 12.8%, compared to $1.6 million for 2016. The average interest rate paid on non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.29% for 2017, an increase of 1 basis point from 0.28% for 2016. The average rate paid increased between the periods due to an increase in the rates paid on certain money market and certificate of deposit accounts that was partially offset by a decrease in the interest paid on other borrowings due to a decrease in the average borrowings outstanding between the periods. The average non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities increased $34.6 million between the periods, the average amount held in lower rate checking, savings, and money market accounts increased $10.4 million, the average amount held in higher rate premium money market accounts increased $22.5 million, and the average amount held in higher rate borrowings and certificates of deposit increased $1.7 million between the periods. Net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets) for 2017 was 3.86%, a decrease of 25 basis points, compared to 4.11% for 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin is primarily related to the decrease in yield enhancements recognized between the periods.\nA summary of the Company’s net interest margin for 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nFor the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Interest-earning assets: Securities available for sale $ 76,559 1,160 1.52 % $ 86,159 1,347 1.56 % Loans held for sale 1,905 94 4.93 3,046 126 4.14 Mortgage loans, net 113,733 4,592 4.04 103,040 4,272 4.15 Commercial loans, net 386,716 18,142 4.69 339,521 18,036 5.31 Consumer loans, net 73,445 3,540 4.82 71,413 3,466 4.85 Cash equivalents 17,214 140 0.81 23,337 96 0.41 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 874 12 1.37 770 6 0.78 Total interest-earning assets $ 670,446 27,680 4.13 $ 627,286 27,349 4.36 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW accounts $ 87,416 77 0.09 $ 85,440 50 0.06 Savings accounts 76,592 63 0.08 71,728 62 0.09 Money market accounts 179,675 560 0.31 164,522 366 0.22 Certificates 106,006 770 0.73 100,942 524 0.52 Advances and other borrowings 6,335 327 5.16 9,374 591 6.30 Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 456,024 $ 432,006 Non-interest checking 156,149 145,450 Other non-interest bearing deposits 1,279 1,434 Total interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest\nbearing deposits\n$ 613,452 1,797 0.29\n$ 578,890 1,593 0.28 Net interest income 25,883 25,756 Net interest rate spread 3.84 % 4.08 % Net interest margin 3.86 % 4.11 % Provision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was ($0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.1 million, from ($0.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses increased between the periods primarily because of the increase in the reserves required on certain commercial loans due to a deterioration of their credit quality between the periods. Total non-performing assets were $3.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 3.3%, from $3.9 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing loans decreased $0.1 million and foreclosed and repossessed assets were the same between the periods.\nA reconciliation of the allowance for loan losses for 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows:\n(in thousands) 2017 2016 Balance beginning of period $ 9,903 $ 9,709 Provision (523 ) (645 ) Charge offs: Commercial (311 ) (180 ) Commercial real estate (50 ) (67 ) Consumer (288 ) (108 ) Single family mortgage (6 ) (66 ) Recoveries 586 1,260 Balance at December 31, $ 9,311 $ 9,903 Non-Interest Income and Expense\nNon-interest income was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 6.7%, from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income is primarily related to the $0.5 million decrease in the gain on sales of loans due to a decrease in single family loan originations and sales between the periods. Fees and service charges decreased $0.1 million between the periods due primarily to a decrease in overdraft fees. Other non-interest income decreased $0.1 million primarily because of a decrease in the revenue earned on the sale of uninsured investment products between the periods. These decreases in non-interest income were partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in loan servicing fees earned between the periods.\nNon-interest expense was $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.2 million, or 4.7%, from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gains on real estate owned decreased $0.5 million between the periods due to fewer sales in 2017 when compared to 2016. Other non-interest expense increased $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in advertising expense between the periods. Compensation expense increased $0.2 million between the periods due to normal annual salary increases between the periods. Occupancy and equipment expense increased slightly because of increased software and equipment expenses. Professional services expense increased slightly primarily due to an increase in legal expenses between the periods. These increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in data processing expense due to a decrease in debit card costs between the periods.\nIncome tax expense was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $0.3 million, from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
