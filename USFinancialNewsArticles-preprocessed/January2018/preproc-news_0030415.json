    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 8:09 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Tennis-Goffin's hopes over as he succumbs to Benneteau Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Dark horse David Goffinâ€™s Australian Open hopes went up in smoke as he fell to a 1-6 7-6(5) 6-1 7-6(4) to French veteran Julien Benneteau in round two on Thursday. \nThe Belgian seventh seed dominated the opening set in ferocious conditions but the match changed direction after 36-year-old Benneteau won the second set on a tiebreak. \nGoffin was listless in the third set as Benneteau moved ahead and fell a break down in the fourth, saving a match point on his own serve at 3-5. \nWorld number 59 Benneteau had an attack of the nerves as he tried to close out the match, throwing in a couple of double-faults to allow Goffin to level at 5-5. \nBut he got the job done in the tiebreak to reach the third round of a grand slam for the first time since 2013.
