    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Glowforge, the Seattle-based creator of the iconic 3D laser printer, has announced that Michelle Mares has joined the company as Head of Marketing. Mares joins the company from Nordstrom Rack, where she served as Director of Marketing. Previously, she spent eight years in the video games industry leading consumer marketing efforts for both Xbox LIVE and Nintendo, including the award-winning “ Wii would like to play ” campaign for the launch of the Nintendo Wii.\nThis press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n“When I first heard about Glowforge and the consumer excitement generated through their crowdfunding campaign, and then saw the amazing things Glowforge customers are creating and sharing organically every day, I knew this product was something I wanted to be involved in,” said Mares. “It’s a marketer’s dream to work on disruptive technology that delights customers and fuels people’s creativity. The 3D laser consumer space is currently unchartered territory and Glowforge is clearly leading the way.”\n“When we think about marketing at Glowforge, we ask ourselves a simple question: how can we serve our amazing customers as we help new people learn about our product?” said Glowforge CEO Dan Shapiro. “We’ve searched around the world for the right marketing leader for our customers, our product, and our company. I knew Michelle could take this to the next level when she recognized immediately what Glowforge is about: not a robot with laser beams, but an opportunity for people to create things in ways they’ve never done before, and change their lives for the better in the process.”\nGlowforge’s launch set the record for the largest 30-day crowdfunding campaign in history with $27.9 million in pre-orders. Glowforge recently announced more than $70 million in total sales and the launch of its Proofgrade™ materials line, offering custom hardwoods, plywoods, veneer, acrylic, and leather with smart coding.\nGlowforge has 70 employees and will hire dozens more in the coming months in roles ranging from computer vision to data science to customer success.

Glowforge's wireless desktop laser makes it simple for designers, artists, and makers to take products directly from digital design to reality.
