    "text": "0 COMMENTS VTech Electronics Ltd. agreed to pay $650,000 to settle U.S. Federal Trade Commission charges it didn’t obtain parental consent before collecting personal data from children who used its toys.\nThe settlement, announced Monday, requires the Hong Kong maker of educational toys, cordless phones and other products to run a data-security program audited by a third party. VTech didn’t admit to any violations of law as part of the settlement.\nThe FTC began investigating VTech after the company disclosed a November 2015 data breach in which a hacker gained access to five million customer accounts. \nThe data included more than 600,000 children’s accounts, many of which included photos and were linked to the physical addresses, according to Jacqueline Connor, a lawyer with the FTC.\nRelated \nTalking Dolls May Spread Children’s Secrets, Privacy Groups Allege VTech Holdings said five million accounts, which included children’s birthdays and photos, were illegally accessed. WSJ’s Brian Fitzgerald discusses how to teach children about tech safe practices. Photo: Reuters (Originally published Dec. 1, 2015) It was the FTC’s first prosecution of an electronic toy maker for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as Coppa, a 1998 law revised in 2012 to require companies to get parents’ approval before collecting children’s data.\nIt may not be the last. In recent years, a large number of security and privacy issues have been discovered in cheap internet-connected devices and appliances. Last year, another toy maker, CloudPets, said its user data may have been accessed by a third party.\nIn a statement, VTech said it has updated its security practices and has taken steps “to address the technical notice and consent issues under COPPA.”\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com",
