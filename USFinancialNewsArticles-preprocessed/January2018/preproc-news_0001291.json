(OTC:AITB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) for the treatment of patients with serious lung infections and pulmonary hypertension, today announced the appointment of Ms. Yoori Lee to its Board of Directors. Ms. Lee will replace Professor Yossef Av-Gay, who is stepping down.\n“We thank Dr. Av-Gay, one of our Founders, for his vision and guidance in getting AIT to this critical juncture, and we are pleased that he will remain with us as a member of our Scientific Advisory Board,” said Steve Lisi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AIT Therapeutics. “Yoori will be a tremendous asset to our Board as she brings to AIT a truly unique perspective on the Life Science industry.

You can identify such forward-looking statements by the words “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “likely,” “goal,” “assumes,” “targets,” “potential,” and similar expressions and/or the use of future tense or conditional constructions (such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “should” and the like) and by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements, including risks related to: our approach to discover and develop novel drugs, which is unproven and may never lead to marketable products; our ability to fund and the results of further pre-clinical and clinical trials; obtaining, maintaining and protecting intellectual property utilized by our products; our ability to enforce our patents against infringers and to defend our patent portfolio against challenges from third parties; our ability to obtain additional funding to support our business activities; our dependence on third parties for development, manufacture, marketing, sales, and distribution of products; the successful development of our product candidates, all of which are in early stages of development; obtaining regulatory approval for products; competition from others using technology similar to ours and others developing products for similar uses; our dependence on collaborators; and our short operating history. We undertake no obligation to update, and we do not have a policy of updating or revising, these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.\nCONTACT\nSteven Lisi, Chief Executive Officer\nAIT Therapeutics, Inc.\nSteve@AIT-Pharm.com\nBob Yedid\nLifeSci Advisors, LLC\nBob@LifeSciAdvisors.com\n(646) 597 6989\nSource:AIT Therapeutics, Inc.",
