    "text": " 18 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago U.N. employees in Gaza hold protest strike over U.S. aid cut Nidal al-Mughrabi 3 Min Read \nGAZA (Reuters) - Schools, clinics and food distribution centres in the Gaza Strip were closed on Monday due to a one-day strike by the 13,000 employees of the United Nations agency that serves the Palestinians. \nThe Palestinian employees have been angered by a U.S. decision to cut its annual contribution towards the running of the United Nations’ Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA), which runs 278 schools in Gaza attended by some 300,000 students. \nThe UNRWA is funded mainly by voluntary contributions from U.N. member states, with the United States by far the largest donor. Washington announced on Jan. 16 it would hold back $65 million - more than half its planned contribution this year - and demanded that the agency make unspecified reforms. \nThose joining Monday’s strike said the U.S. funding cut would worsen hardship in the Gaza Strip, and they marched to the U.N. headquarters in Gaza City waving Palestinian flags and brandishing banners that read “Dignity is priceless”. \n“I have a family of nine and I have never felt afraid for my job like today. U.S. aid cuts will affect the entire community,” said 59-year-old English teacher Ahmed Abu Suleiman. \nUNRWA spokesman Abu Hasna said the agency, which has launched an international appeal for funds, had enough money for three months of operations.

Unemployment in the enclave stands at 46 percent.

General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed the creation of the state of Israel.
