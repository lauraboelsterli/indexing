    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), including purchasers in AMC’s secondary public offering on or about February 8, 2017 of the important March 13, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for AMC investors under the federal securities laws.\nTo join the AMC class action, go to http://rosenlegal.com/cases-1271.html or call Phillip Kim, Esq. or Daniel Sadeh, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or dsadeh@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\nNO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.\nAccording to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the operations of Carmike Cinemas, Inc., a company acquired by AMC, had been experiencing a prolonged period of financial underperformance due to a protracted period of underinvestment in its theaters; (2) Carmike had experienced a significant loss in market share when its loyal patrons migrated to competitors that had renovated and upgraded their theaters; (3) AMC was able to retain only a very small number of Carmike’s loyalty program members after the Carmike acquisition; (4) these issues were having a material adverse effect on Carmike’s operations and theater attendance; and (5) as a result of defendants’ statements and/or omissions, the price of AMC common shares was artificially inflated during the relevant period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 13, 2018. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
