I’m not saying injured because he’s not injured. I think he’s in a moment of trying to feel really ready for the demands of Premier League football.” \nMourinho also gave an update on midfielder Marouane Fellaini, who is free to talk to other clubs as his contract ticks down. \n“He knows I want him and the club wants him and I think that’s very important for him. But then there is a paper to sign but you only sign the paper when you are happy with what’s on the paper,” Mourinho said. \nThe 30-year-old Belgian has been linked with a move to Turkish side Besiktas.
