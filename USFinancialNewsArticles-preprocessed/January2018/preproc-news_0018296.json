    "text": "Published: Jan 14, 2018 4:49 p.m. ET Share \nWhite House cries ‘fake news’ over ‘I’ vs. ‘I’d’ in transcript Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at the White House on Friday. \nBy Louise Radnofsky \nWASHINGTON — The White House disputed that President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Thursday that “I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea,” saying that Trump had instead said “I’d probably have a very good relationship” with the North Korean leader. \nThe Journal stands by what it reported. The Journal and White House agreed before the interview that audiotape taken by White House officials and reporters would be used for transcription purposes only. After the White House challenged the Journal’s transcription and accuracy of the quote in a story, The Journal decided to release the relevant portion of the audio. The White House then released its audio version of the contested segment. \nTrump tweeted Sunday morning, “The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that. I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters…and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!” \nA transcript of the interview created by an independent transcription service for The Journal and posted online by the newspaper Thursday evening also said that Mr. Trump had said “I” rather than “I’d.”",
