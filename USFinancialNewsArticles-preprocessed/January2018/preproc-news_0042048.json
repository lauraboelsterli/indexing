    "text": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc said on Wednesday that it expects U.S. tax reform to result in a one-time hit to earnings of $1.4 billion, but said it would be better off in the long run.\n* In a presentation to analysts, Houston-based Kinder said the negative impact was due to lower tax rates affecting the value of its deferred tax assets.\n* The company said over a 10-year period, it would be better off due to the ability to fully expense capital spending on certain assets, as well as the lower corporate tax rate.\n* Earlier this month, oil company BP said it would take a $1.5 billion charge to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, but expects a long-term boost from corporate-friendly tax rates\n* U.S. tax overhaul is likely to spur spending by refiners and pipeline companies, industry lobbyists and analysts said last month.
