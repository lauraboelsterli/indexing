    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk will continue to hunt for promising assets to refill its blood products business, after losing out to Sanofi in a $4.8 billion fight for Belgian biotech company Ablynx.\n“We are currently active on a couple of initiatives that hopefully will succeed and enable us to bolt activities on to our biopharma franchise in 2018,” Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters.\nFrance’s Sanofi won Ablynx and its prized experimental bleeding disorder drug caplacizumab with a 50 percent-higher bid than an previously rejected offer from Novo Nordisk.\nBrandgaard said his company could not have justified the price Sanofi was paying but he remained hopeful of finding other new medicines in development at rival biotech companies.\n“It’s important for Novo Nordisk shareholders that we stay disciplined on the use of cash in the company,” he said.\nThe Danish group is best known as the world’s biggest insulin maker. While it enjoys good growth in its diabetes and obesity business, which accounts for around 80 percent of sales, the biopharmaceuticals division, which makes up nearly 20 percent of revenue led by haemophilia, is slowing.\nIt stands to lose sales particularly because of new competition from Roche’s haemophilia drug Hemlibra.\nNovo Nordisk logo is seen in Bagsvaerd outside of Copenhagen, Denmark February 1, 2017.
