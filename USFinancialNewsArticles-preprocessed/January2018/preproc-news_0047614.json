    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 10:11 AM / in 7 hours Ruthless Federer makes final as chastened Chung quits Martyn Herman 4 Min Read \nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Ruthless Roger Federer handed wounded Chung Hyeon an old-fashioned schooling before the overwhelmed South Korean quit with foot blisters trailing 6-1 5-2 in a damp squib of an Australian Open semi-final on Friday. \nFederer was detained for only 62 minutes under the Rod Laver Arena roof as he set up a final against big-serving Croat Marin Cilic who pummelled another young gun, Kyle Edmund, on Thursday. \nIt is the sixth time Federer has reached a grand slam final without dropping a set -- the most recent at Wimbledon last year when he beat an injured Cilic in the final. \nAlthough happy to conserve energy for Sunday’s final, and even make it out in time for a spot of dinner, the 36-year-old defending champion said it had been a “bitter sweet” victory. \n”I must admit, you do take the faster matches whenever you can because there’s enough wear and tear on the body,“ Federer told reporters. ”When they happen, you take them. \n”I‘m just happy I‘m in the final, to be honest. That was the goal before the match today. Not under the circumstances I was hoping to (reach the final)... \n“He struggled clearly with his movement. I was able to take advantage of that. I wish him a good recovery.” \nIt was an anti-climactic end for Chung, who played superbly to beat fourth seed Alexander Zverev in five sets in round three and even better in a straight sets win over six-times champion Novak Djokovic in the round of 16. \nThe 21-year-old was joined by his agent Stuart Duguid in the post-match news conference who explained what had happened. \n“It’s worse than regular blisters. Over the last few days, it was blister under blister under blister,” he said. RED RAW Tennis - Australian Open - Semifinals - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 26, 2018.

They tried injections to see if it numbed the pain. It didn’t work.” \n“I really hurt. I can’t walk no more,” Chung added. \nFederer admitted after his quarter-final victory over Tomas Berdych that he knew little about Chung’s counter-punching game, having never faced him before. \nHe had obviously done some homework though as he swarmed all over the world number 58 from the first game, feasting on Chung’s powder puff serve to break immediately after choosing to receive first having won the coin toss.
