    "text": "SAO PAULO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Companhia Docas do Estado de São Paulo, the state-run company known as Codesp that operates Brazil’s Santos port, said it will suspend shipments of live animals at Latin America’s largest port, according to a letter sent by the company to a congressman.\nThe letter, dated January 11 and seen by Reuters, was sent by Codesp’s logistics operations director Carlos Henrique Poço to Congressman Ricardo Izar. A press officer said on Friday that the letter is authentic, and added more details would be provided in a statement later in the day. (Reporting by Ana Mano)\n ",
