They were down 3.1 percent by 1248 GMT at 11.84 euros. \nFor 2018, CNH Industrial expects sales of industrial activities of between $27-28 billion and a 30 percent rise in adjusted diluted EPS to between $0.63-0.67.Net industrial debt is seen at between $0.8-1.0 billion from 0.9 billion at the end of December.
