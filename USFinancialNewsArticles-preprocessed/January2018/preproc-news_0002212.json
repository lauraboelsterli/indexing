    "text": " 40 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago German court to decide on Niki insolvency challenge on Thursday Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFRANKFURT/VIENNA (Reuters) - A German court is likely to decide on Thursday whether to reverse the insolvency filing of airline Niki, following legal action from a group representing airline passengers, according to a press release from the Berlin civil courts. FILE PHOTO: An Air Berlin aircraft parks next to a Niki airplane at Vienna International Airport in Schwechat, Austria December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo \nFairplane said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for budget airline Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, in a move that could endanger the sale of the Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) unit to Britain’s IAG ( ICAG.L ). \nA court in Berlin’s Charlottenburg must now decide whether to reverse its Dec. 13 decision opening insolvency proceedings for Niki or to pass on the case to a higher court. \nAn Austrian court has meanwhile received a request to open insolvency proceedings for Niki in Austria, a spokesman for the Korneuburg court said on Wednesday, adding it would take the court until next week to assess the matter.
