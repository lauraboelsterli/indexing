Several Latino men and Taiwan’s Ang Lee have won the award. \nGerwig, 34, was joined by Mexican Guillermo del Toro for “The Shape of Water,” black first-time director Jordan Peele for racial horror satire “Get Out,” and Britain’s Martin McDonagh for dark comedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” British director Christopher Nolan won a fourth DGA nomination for his war drama “Dunkirk.” Director Greta Gerwig arrives to attend the National Board of Review awards gala in New York, U.S., January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nSpielberg, whose press freedom movie “The Post” attracted strong Oscar buzz last month, “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, and Italian Luca Guadagnino, whose gay romance “Call Me by Your Name” is high on critics’ list, were all passed over by the DGA. \nPeele, 38, got a second nomination in the first-time director category for “Get Out,” along with “West Wing” creator Aaron Sorkin, who made his directorial feature film debut with drama “Molly’s Game.” Director Jordan Peele. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nAll five of the DGA nominees also won nods last week from the Producers Guild of America (PGA), which also has a track record of honouring the movie that goes on to win best picture at the Academy Awards, the industry’s top prize. \nIn addition, the PGA recognised ”The Post“, ”The Big Sick,“”Wonder Woman, “I, Tonya,”“Molly’s Game” and “Call Me by Your Name” on its 2018 nominations list. \nThe DGA announces its winners on Feb 3. Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 23 and the Academy Awards ceremony takes place in Hollywood on March 4. Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",
