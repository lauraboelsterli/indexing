He also led the creation of a Patient Navigation System (PNS) that now annually serves over 60,000 newly diagnosed and patients in treatment. He helped found CEOs Against Cancer with David Bernauer, the then-Chairman and CEO of Walgreens as well as launched The Discovery Ball, now a $3 M per year black tie event funding cancer research, patient services, education and advocacy.\nEarlier in his career, Derks served as Vice President and one of 15 members of the Executive Cabinet of Advocate Health Care, one of the country's largest integrated delivery networks (IDN). Prior to this he served as Senior Director of Federal and State Government Relations for the Illinois Hospital Association (IHA) and as a governance consultant to hospital boards of directors.\n\"I am honored to be invited to lead QLK forward, working with Mike, Roger and our team.
