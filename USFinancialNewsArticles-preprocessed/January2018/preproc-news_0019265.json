KARDAN \nKardan said on Thursday it will not be able to complete a transaction for the sale of its holdings in TGI in a manner that will enable it to meet the upcoming payments to the debenture holders in February 2018.

KERING \nGucci-owner Kering plans to spin off German sports brand Puma to the French conglomerate’s shareholders to focus squarely on its luxury brands.
