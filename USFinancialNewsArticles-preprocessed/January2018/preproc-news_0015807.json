In the incident's wake, a battery of officials that included Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, took to social networks to inform Hawaii residents and visitors that the alert was a mistake. Tulsi tweet \nGabbard, told MSNBC in an interview that she questioned why the error wasn't corrected more swiftly. \"What my family went through and what so many families in Hawaii just went through is a true realization that they have 15 minutes to seek some form of shelter or else they're dead â€” gone,\" she told the network.

Jodi Luchs, a doctor visiting Hawaii from Merrick, N.Y., told CNBC that he was enjoying breakfast at his hotel when every guest received the mistaken warning simultaneously. \n\"Most people were obviously very relieved about everything, [but] the concern was real given that the wording of the message did not leave much to the imagination,\" Luchs told CNBC. \"With tensions with North Korea, everyone regarded this as a serious threat.\" \n--CNBC's Javier E.
