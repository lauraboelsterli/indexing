    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 8:30 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Hedge fund Elliott Management buys stake in UK pay-TV group Sky Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, founded by Paul Singer, has built a stake in Sky Plc ( SKYB.L ), according to a regulatory filing published on Friday. \nThe fund’s subsidiary, Elliott Capital Advisors, announced a 1.09 percent interest in Sky through a derivatives stake, following the European pay-TV group reporting a 10 percent rise in its first-half earnings. \nThe investment comes ahead of Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) buying Twenty-first Century Fox’s ( FOXA.O ) 39 percent Sky stake in its $52.4 billion purchase of Fox assets, a deal that faces its own lengthy regulatory process in the United States. \nEarlier this month, Elliott disclosed a 1.7 percent stake in British engineering company GKN Plc ( GKN.L ) and a short position in GKN’s suitor Melrose Industries Plc ( MRON.L ). \nSky, whose customer base rose by 365,000 in first-half earnings to 22.9 million, reported revenue of 6.7 billion pounds for the six months to the end of December.
