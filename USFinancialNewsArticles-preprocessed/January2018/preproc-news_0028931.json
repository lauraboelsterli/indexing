There are currently no limits on who can be placed in solitary confinement or for how long. \nThe province has agreed to appoint an independent reviewer to monitor its compliance. \nThe agreement comes more than four years after the province originally agreed to stop segregating people with mental illness. It states solitary confinement “must only be used as a measure of last resort” but did not specify what that would mean. \n“The goal, for us, is the absolute prohibition of solitary confinement for people with mental health disabilities,” Renu Mandhane, Ontario’s human rights commissioner, said on Thursday.

Slideshow (2 Images) \nOn Wednesday a Canadian judge ruled that indefinite solitary confinement in federal prisons is unconstitutional and gave Canada’s government a year to fix it. \nMost of the people in Ontario’s jails, including many of those in solitary confinement, are awaiting trial. As Reuters has reported, people in Canadian jails are more likely to die while awaiting trial than when serving sentences. \nThe United Nations has said solitary confinement for more than 15 days constitutes torture and has called for the prohibition of solitary for youth and those with mental illness.
