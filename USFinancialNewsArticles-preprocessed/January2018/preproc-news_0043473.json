    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy needs to start thinking of a partnership in the space industry with France after the two countries have joined forces over the naval sector, Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said on Friday.\n“We now must think of a partnership in the space sector. We must do so with attention, as it is (an industry with) sensitive companies, but we must face the challenge,” Calenda said at a conference in Rome organized by Italian companies’ association Confindustria and its French peer Medef.\nIn September Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri took effective control of French rival STX France under a shared ownership agreement.\nThe move set the conditions to explore the creation of a Franco-Italian naval defense group, merging France’s Naval group with Fincantieri.\nReporting by Alberto Sisto\n ",
