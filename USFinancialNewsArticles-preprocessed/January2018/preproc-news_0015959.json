Trump was speaking at a roundtable event on prison reform at the White House. Published 10 Mins Ago SHARES Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, January 11, 2018. \nPresident Donald Trump said on Thursday he expects a physical examination he is to undergo on Friday to go well and that he would be surprised if it did not. \nAnswering questions from reporters after an event on prison reform at the White House, Trump said with a chuckle that if it does not go well, the stock market would take a hit. \n\"I think it's going to go very well. I'll be very surprised if it doesn't,\" he said. \nAs reporters were leaving, Trump added, \"it better go well, otherwise the stock market will not be happy,\" to laughter from the room. \nThe exam at Walter Reed Medical Center in nearby Bethesda, Md., will be the first for Trump since he took office nearly a year ago. \n--CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",
