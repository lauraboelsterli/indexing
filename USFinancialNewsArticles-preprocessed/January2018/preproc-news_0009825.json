    "text": "January 7, 2018 / 9:47 AM / Updated 18 hours ago Cricket-Rain delays start of day three at Newlands Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Rain delayed the start of the third dayâ€™s play of the first test between South Africa and India at Newlands on Sunday, with forecast for showers until mid-afternoon. \nSouth Africa were set to resume their second innings on 65 for two, a lead of 142 on what is a lively wicket offering plenty of assistance to the seamers. \nHashim Amla (four) and nightwatchman Kagiso Rabada (two) are the not out batsmen. \nWith low cloud and persistent drizzle in Cape Town soaking the outfield, play may not be possible until the final session. \nSouth Africa were bowled out for 286 in their first innings, before restricting India to 209 in reply. \nThe teams are meeting in a three-test series this month with matches in Pretoria and Johannesburg to come.
