    "text": "January 4, 2018 / 6:53 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Novartis' Promacta receives FDA breakthrough designation for new indication Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis drug Promacta has received breakthrough therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA). \nThe drug has received the designation for use in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy in treating the rare blood disorder in which a patientâ€™s bone marrow fails to produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, the Swiss drug maker said on Thursday. \nPromacta is already approved as a second-line therapy in SAA, as well as for adults and children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. \nBreakthrough status is a designation given to treatments demonstrating substantial improvement over existing therapies in treating a serious or life threatening illness. \nNovartis said it expects regulatory filings in both the United States and the European Union this year.
