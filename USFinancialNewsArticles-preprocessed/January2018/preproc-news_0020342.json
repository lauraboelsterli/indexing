French consumer confidence rose more than expected in December, returning to a 10-year high reached in July after the election of president Emmanuel Macron, data from the official INSEE statistics agency showed last week.\nThe French e-commerce federation Fevad said this week that shoppers were expected to spend 216 euros, on average, online during this winter sales season, 17 euros more than in 2017 and 32 euros more than in 2016.\nBeyond France, other countries often allow sales starting immediately after or even before Christmas, and impose fewer restrictions on when discounting happens. In Britain sales usually start on Dec. 26.\nAdditional reporting by Pascale Denis; Editing by Brian Love\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
