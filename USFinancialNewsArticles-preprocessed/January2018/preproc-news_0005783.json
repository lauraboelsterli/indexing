U.S. President Donald Trump departs for Camp David from the White House in Washington, U.S., January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \n“When I deal with President Trump, what I see is somebody who is committed to ensuring that he is taking decisions in the best interests of the United States,” she told the BBC. \nTrump has rejected accusations made by author Michael Wolff, who was granted unusually wide access to the White House during much of Trump’s first year, saying his business career and election victory showed he was “a very stable genius.” \nTrump would be visiting Britain, as planned, May added without giving any new details of his trip.
