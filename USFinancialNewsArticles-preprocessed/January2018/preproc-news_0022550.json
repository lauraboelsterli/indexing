    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy will take more time to consider the expressions of interest in struggling carrier Alitalia before starting exclusive talks with one of the interested parties, the industry and transport ministers said in a joint statement on Monday.\nAlitalia, which has made a profit only a few times in its 70-year history, was put under special administration last year after staff rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries.\nGermanyâ€™s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), British low-cost carrier easyJet ( EZJ.L ) and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among companies that have expressed an interest in Alitalia.\nRome originally planned to enter exclusive talks with one of the parties by mid-January in the hope to strike a deal before national elections due March 4.\nThe two ministers asked the commissioners managing Alitalia to work quickly on a sale once a solid and credible offer is made.\nReporting by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Isla Binnie\n ",
