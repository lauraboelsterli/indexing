Shaffer, MD, FAAFP , Assistant Professor of Medicine, Retired, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine.

In addition to bringing extensive medical experience and a first-hand patient perspective to this board position, Dr. Shaffer participated in the groundbreaking Beyond Celiac 2015 Research Summit and served as a co-chair of the very successful inaugural Step Beyond Celiac Kansas City 5K and Auto Show, raising $60,000 for Beyond Celiac in 2017.
