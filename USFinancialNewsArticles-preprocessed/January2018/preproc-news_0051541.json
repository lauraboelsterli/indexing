Participants’ weight was recorded an average of about 20 weeks before they became pregnant. \nMothers’ pre-pregnancy weight was consistently associated with babies’ birth weight. But only weight gain from pre-pregnancy to less than 14 weeks, and from 14 to 18 weeks, was associated with birth weight. On average, for every kilogram (2.2 lbs) a woman gained during this earliest period, her infant’s birth weight rose by 13.6 grams. For weight gained from 14-18 weeks, birth weight rose by 26.1 grams for each additional kilogram of maternal weight gain. But weight gain later in pregnancy had no effect on newborn size. \nEarly in pregnancy, the authors note, the fetus grows slowly, so weight gain mainly involves the mother’s body. Excess weight gain may expose the fetus to an excess of “maternal fuels,” such as glucose and amino acids, affecting development and increasing the risk of metabolic problems. \nAttempts to reduce a woman’s risk of delivering an unusually large infant by targeting diet and physical activity haven’t worked, Dr. Retnakaran noted, and the findings suggest it’s because they’re starting too late to make a difference. “This is adding further evidence that it may be particularly important to optimize weight before pregnancy.” \nHe added, “This is one of the amazing things about optimizing maternal health during this window. You actually are potentially talking about affecting two generations.” \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rUPC43 JAMA Pediatrics, online December 26, 2017.",
