    "text": "2 COMMENTS Nearly a decade ago, a wave of megamergers gripped the pharmaceutical industry. In 2018, conditions are right for a sequel.\nBack then, concerns about growth and tougher regulations spurred deals like Pfizer ’s $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth and Merck & Co.’s $41 billion acquisition of Schering-Plough.\nToday, growth concerns are rising again, and several other factors, including consolidation in other parts of health care, are setting the stage for another wave of deals.\nDrugmakers have relied on price increases for a big portion of their recent growth, but those are getting harder to push through. True, pharmaceutical companies boosted list prices as usual when the calendar turned to the new year, but raising prices doesn’t pack the same punch as it did in years past.\nNow, consolidation among insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers means drugmakers are seeing a smaller share of those hikes than in recent years, while money paid as rebates to PBMs increases. “Biopharma companies now have a reduced ability to increase net, realized price in the U.S.” compared to the status quo since 2010, analysts at Leerink Partners said in a note last month.\nBuying up smaller biotech startups has also helped boost growth rates for big pharma companies. But years of brisk acquisitions means that there is now a relative scarcity of targets with drugs that are close to generating revenue and have strong enough sales potential to move the needle for bigger outfits.\nConsider in 2016, Pfizer bought Medivation, which had a blockbuster cancer drug already on the market, for $14 billion . Gilead Sciences bought Kite Pharma for a similar price last summer, but Gilead doesn’t expect that deal to contribute to earnings for several years.\nBalance sheets within this group are generally strong enough to absorb larger-scale transactions, while debt capital remains extremely cheap. And company executives finally have clarity on U.S. tax policy after a long period of uncertainty. There is no shortage of opportunities for partnering. More than 20 branded drug companies have projected 2018 revenues above $10 billion, according to FactSet.\nThe main obstacles to deals are regulatory approval and integration concerns, which are particularly important because the companies in question are so large\nFor big pharma, a new set of challenges could lead to a familiar solution.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com",
