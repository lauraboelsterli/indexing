    "text": "LAWRENCEBURG, Ind., Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DSA Financial Corporation (OTCBB:DSFN) -- DSA Financial previously announced its financial results on January 10, 2018. Further regulatory guidance was issued on January 18, 2018 addressing provisions made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which caused the Company to amend its financial results for the second fiscal quarter and the six months ended December 31, 2017 to account for the reduction in the Federal Corporate tax rate to a flat 21% and the related effect to the value of the deferred tax asset.\nThe Company recorded net earnings of $60,000 or $0.04 per share which reflected a decrease of $144,000 or $0.09 per share, as compared to the $204,000 or $0.13 per share for same quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company recorded net income of $257,000 or $0.18 per share for the six month period ended December 31, 2017, which reflected a decrease of $150,000, or $0.07 per share, as compared to the six month period ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the quarter and the six months ended December 31, 2017 was negatively affected as the Company recorded a $214,000, or $0.15 per share, one-time charge for the second quarter 2018 to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets due to the Act. The Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which took effect on January 1, 2018. The reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax assets is subject to adjustment in future periods.\nNet income for the quarter and the six months ended December 31, 2017 was positively affected as the Company recorded a $45,000, or $0.03 per share, one-time charge for the second quarter 2018 to reduce the current year tax expense due to the Act.\nDSA Financial reported total assets of $113.1 million at December 31, 2017, total liabilities of $97.2 million, including deposits of $87.0 million and total stockholders’ equity of $15.9 million.\nThis announcement does not affect the dividend for this quarter announced on January 10, 2018, for shareholders on record as of January 26, 2018, and payable on February 12, 2018.\nDSA Financial Corporation is the holding company for Dearborn Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
