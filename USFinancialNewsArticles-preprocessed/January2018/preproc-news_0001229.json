    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Payout, Inc. (OTCPink:GOHE) (\"Global\") is pleased to announce that its majority owned subsidiary, MoneyTrac Technology, Inc. (\"MTRAC\" \"MoneyTrac\", the \"Company\") has promoted Ms. Vanessa Luna to the distinguished role and position of Chief Executive Officer. Former CEO, James Hancock will assume the distinguished role of the Company's Chairman of the Board. Both appointments are effective as January 1, 2018.\nThe Company's promotion of Ms. Luna comes following her successful and groundbreaking nine-month role as MTRAC's COO. This succession comes at a pivotal time, as the Company positions itself strategically for its anticipated growth and expansion within the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry.\nSaid MTRAC Chairman of the Board, James Hancock: \"I mentioned in the 2017 year-end review that was distributed last week that MoneyTrac is very much on the verge of significant growth from a revenue perspective. This is due in large part to the hard work and dedication Ms. Luna exhibited in cultivating some incredibly strategic partnerships and acquisitions for the Company. Her elevation to CEO provides the Company with the leadership it will need to foster continued growth and fully capitalize on an industry that is growing faster than any other right now. I am excited for her promotion and I look forward to offering her, and the Company's Board, valuable guidance and support in my role as Chairman.\"\nSaid MTRAC CEO, Vanessa Luna: \"The time is absolutely now to charge forward with the goals and objectives that will make MoneyTrac the most recognized leader in financial technology, banking, and payment solutions for the underserved businesses of the cannabis industry. I am fully aware of the responsibilities and challenges that come along with accepting a promotion such as this, but I am confident that with the foundation we built for this Company in 2017, and with the many different ventures and opportunities we have loaded into our pipeline, that we are poised to gain the stronghold on this industry that we know we are capable of.\"\nIncluded with the transition of Ms. Luna to CEO is the appointment of Mr. David A. Flores as the Company's new COO. Since June 2017, Mr. Flores has been instrumental in the Company's internal operational development in his role as MTRAC's Business Development Manager. His experience and knowledge are deeply rooted in his experience with the legal industry, where he gained several years of experience in operational support and management, including compliance oversight, HR, payroll and employee benefits administration, as well as in finance and accounting management. Mr. Flores will also be joining the Company's Board of Directors and will play a critical role in driving MTRAC's vision and objectives to fruition in collaboration with the Company's growing executive management team.\nThe Company has also selected a group of key individuals to fill the management positions that are being developed through its growth. Each of them bring invaluable industry experience and knowledge and will be important in the facilitation of the significant growth and expansion MTRAC anticipates over the next several months.\nOver the next few months the MTRAC Management Team anticipates following through on continued execution of strategic partnerships and networking relationships which will enhance their business objectives. A prime focus in the beginning will be the Los Angeles market, but in any state which provides for legal cannabis use MTRAC's technology will prove vital in regulatory compliance, technological advancement, crypto-currency, and alternative banking solutions.\nAbout Global Payout, Inc.
