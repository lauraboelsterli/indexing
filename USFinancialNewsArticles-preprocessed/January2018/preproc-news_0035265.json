    "text": "LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - UBS Wealth Management upgraded its short-term forecasts for the euro and sterling on Monday, citing protracted dollar weakness that it predicts is unlikely to end any time soon.\nIn a report published by the Chief Investment office at UBS Wealth Management, it upgraded the euro forecast against the dollar to $1.25 over the next three months from a previous forecast of $1.18.\nIt also upgraded the forecast for the British pound against the dollar to $1.40 from $1.36 for a similar time frame.\nThe CIOâ€™s office oversees the investment policy and strategy for approximately $2 trillion in invested assets.
