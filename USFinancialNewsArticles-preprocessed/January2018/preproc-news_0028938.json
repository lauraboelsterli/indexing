Noninterest expenses increased $5.55 million or 13.29% from the fourth quarter of 2016 (12.27% excluding leased equipment depreciation).\nSOUTH BEND, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 1st Source Corporation (NASDAQ: SRCE), parent company of 1st Source Bank, today reported a record high net income of $68.05 million for the year of 2017, an increase of 17.76% compared to $57.79 million earned in 2016. Fourth quarter net income was $17.99 million, an increase of 18.19% compared to $15.23 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2016. The annual net income comparison was impacted by both positive and negative pre-tax items. It was positively impacted by gains on the sale of investment securities of $4.34 million and gains on the sale of fixed assets and leased equipment of $1.08 million. These positives were partially offset by contributions to the 1st Source Foundation of $2.54 million and software and consulting costs of $1.31 million for the design and implementation planning of Salesforce®, a customer relationship management (CRM) system. Also, the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities due to the federal tax rate reduction as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $2.61 million.\nDiluted net income per common share for the year was a record high at $2.60 up significantly from the $2.22 earned a year earlier. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter was $0.69, up from $0.58 per common share reported in the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nAt its January 2018 meeting, the 1st Source Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.22 per common share, an increase of 10.00% over the prior quarter. The cash dividend is payable to shareholders of record on February 5, 2018 and will be paid on February 15, 2018.\nAccording to Christopher J. Murphy III, Chairman, “1st Source Corporation had a record year and 2017 was our 30 th consecutive year of dividend growth. Quarterly average deposits have increased 6.45% over the fourth quarter 2016 and 3.49% compared to third quarter 2017. Annual average deposits for 2017 are up 4.43% from 2016. The company experienced strong loan growth in 2017. Average loans and leases increased 7.15% in the fourth quarter of 2017 over the fourth quarter of 2016. Year over year, average loans and leases grew by 5.34%. Credit quality remains stable.\n“We are proud of the way we serve our clients. At December's annual meeting for the Indiana District of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), we received the 'Gold Level Award' for the Community Bank category for the fifth year in a row. Among community banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the award honors 1st Source Bank as #1 for delivering the greatest number of SBA loans in Indiana in 2017, helping small businesses grow and succeed in our communities. This award is confirmation of our commitment to delivering outstanding client service. This commitment exists whether our client prefers to bank in person, on-line or through their mobile device.\n“The new federal tax rate should have a positive impact on net income in 2018 and provide additional funds to invest in our people, our technologies, our client service and our branch, on-line, and mobile delivery channels. Of course, as the leading financial institution in our market, we will maintain attractive wage levels matching pay with skills, education, experience and job requirements. And we will continue to invest in the educational and personal development of our colleagues so we continue to grow together,” Mr. Murphy added.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nLoans\nAverage loans and leases of $4.45 billion increased $296.88 million, up 7.15% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the year ago quarter and have increased $59.05 million, up 1.35% from the third quarter.

Fourth quarter 2017 net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.61%, an increase of 19 basis points from the 3.42% for the same period in 2016 and an increase of 4 basis points from the 3.57% in the third quarter.\nNet interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2017 was 3.54%, an increase of 15 basis points from the 3.39% for the year ending December 31, 2016.

The increase in noninterest income was mainly due to higher equipment rental income resulting from an increase in the average lease portfolio, gains on the sale of available-for-sale equity securities, increased trust and wealth advisory fees, improved customer swap fees, and higher debit card income offset by reduced partnership gains resulting from the liquidation of an investment during 2016.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $5.55 million or 13.29% and $10.35 million or 6.33% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively over the comparable periods a year ago.
