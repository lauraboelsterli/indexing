    "text": " 01 AM / in 38 minutes Malaysia's c.bank raises policy rate to 3.25 pct, as expected Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s central bank on Thursday raised its key interest rate for the first time in three and a half years, at a time inflation has crept up and growth is robust. \nBank Negara Malaysia (BNM) hiked its overnight policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. \nThe central bank said its monetary policy committee “decided to normalise the degree of monetary accomodation” as the economy remains firmly on a steady growth path. \nA slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll - six out of 10 - had predicted the hike. \nThe last time BNM changed its key rate was in July 2016, shortly after Britain’s Brexit vote, when it made a 25 basis point cut. \nUntil Thursday, the last BNM hike was in July 2014, when the key rate was increased to 3.25 percent.
