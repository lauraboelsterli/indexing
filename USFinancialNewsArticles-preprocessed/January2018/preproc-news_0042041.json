    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: STWD) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has upsized and priced its private offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% unsecured senior notes due February 2021 (the \"Notes\"). The offering was upsized from the previously announced $400 million aggregate principal amount. The Notes priced at 100.000% of the principal amount and the settlement of the offering is expected to occur on January 29, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cash amounts due on its outstanding 4.55% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 at maturity or upon conversion, and to use the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under its existing repurchase agreements. The Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 mature on March 1, 2018, and, as of September 30, 2017, approximately $370 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 was outstanding. Amounts that the Company may repay under its revolving repurchase facilities may be reâ€‘borrowed, subject to customary conditions.\nThe Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes will not initially be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Starwood Property Trust, Inc.\nStarwood Property Trust, Inc.
