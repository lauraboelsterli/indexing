Smaller blasts at less frequent intervals could still be heard, he said.\nA Kabul police spokesman confirmed an incident inside a military facility near the Marshal Fahim university and said it was not yet clear if it was an attack by insurgents or was an internal military issue.\nThe blasts occurred days after an ambulance bomb in the centre of Kabul killed more than 100 people and just over a week after a separate attack on the Hotel Intercontinental killed more than 20.\nBoth those attacks were claimed by the Taliban.\nIn October, a suicide attacker rammed a car full of explosives into a bus carrying cadets from the defence university, which is home to one of Afghanistanâ€™s main officer training schools, killing 15 of them.
