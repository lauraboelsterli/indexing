    "text": "MOUNT AIRY, N.C., Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Insteel Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGS: IIIN) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to $8.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, from $4.5 million, or $0.23 per share, in the same period a year ago. Insteel's earnings for the current year quarter benefited from a $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share gain on the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and a $0.5 million, or $0.03 per share reduction in income taxes related to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Excluding the deferred tax gain, Insteel's effective tax rate decreased to 24.9% from 33.7% in the prior year quarter reflecting the reduction in the federal statutory rate to 21% from 35% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2018.\nInsteel's first-quarter results were unfavorably impacted by narrower spreads between selling prices and raw material costs, partially offset by higher shipments and lower manufacturing costs on the higher production volume relative to the prior year quarter. Net sales increased 4.1% to $97.7 million from $93.9 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting a 1.3% increase in shipments and a 2.8% increase in average selling prices. Shipments increased 1.7% sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 while average selling prices decreased 0.8% due to competitive pricing pressures. Gross margin narrowed 200 basis points to 11.9% from 13.9% in the prior year quarter due to the reduction in spreads.\nCash flow from operations increased to $14.8 million from $3.9 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to the relative changes in net working capital, which provided $4.7 million of cash while using $4.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nCapital Allocation and Liquidity\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to $6.1 million from $5.4 million in the prior year quarter. Capital outlays for fiscal 2018 are expected to total up to $21.0 million largely related to additional investments in engineered structural mesh manufacturing capabilities, the purchase of the leased Houston facility and further upgrades of production technology and information systems.\nInsteel ended the quarter debt-free with $37.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, and no borrowings outstanding on its $100.0 million revolving credit facility. Following the end of the quarter, on January 5, 2018 Insteel paid a special cash dividend totaling $19.0 million, or $1.00 per share, to shareholders of record as of December 20, 2017, marking the third consecutive year in which a special dividend has been paid.\nOutlook\n\"We are encouraged by the improving demand trends during the first quarter following the weakness we experienced over the second half of fiscal 2017,\" commented H.O. Woltz III, Insteel's president and CEO. \"As we move into the second quarter, however, we expect our results will be affected by the usual weather-related slowdown in construction activity.\n\"Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, the leading indicators for the construction sector are signaling continued growth which should drive improvement in our volumes, spreads and costs. We also expect to benefit from our recent acquisition of Ortiz Engineered Products as we intensify our efforts to penetrate the rebar market with the substitution of engineered structural mesh for cast-in-place applications and leverage our newly combined engineering and sales capabilities.\"\nConference Call\nInsteel will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss its first quarter financial results. A live webcast of this call can be accessed on Insteel's website at https://insteelgcs.gcs-web.com/ and will be archived for replay until the next quarterly conference call.\nAbout Insteel\nInsteel is the nation's largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
