(OTCQB: GRWG), GrowGeneration (\"GrowGen\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest specialty retail hydroponic and organic gardening stores, with currently 15 locations serving both commercial and home growers, today announced that it has purchased all the assets of Humboldt Depot located in Arcata, CA. The Humboldt Depot operation generated approximately $4.0 Million in revenue in 2017 and this revenue will be added to the Company's consolidated financial statement. Humboldt Depot also has a location in McKinleyville, CA which the company plans to open and operate as a 2 nd location in Humboldt County.\nGrowGeneration Focused On Aggressive California Expansion\nGrowGen continues the execution of its acquisition plans to acquire the leading hydroponic stores in key markets. Additionally, the company plans to expand its acquisition strategy into complementary verticals that include nutrients, soils, integrated pest management and other products that are consumed by cultivators already served by GrowGeneration. California continues to present significant growth opportuÂ­nities for GrowGen, particularly with adult-use laws going into effect on Jan. 1, 2018. According to New Frontier Data, the California market projects to grow at a compounded annual rate of 18.5%, from $2.76 billion in 2015 to $6.5 billion by 2020.\nGrowGen CEO Comments\nCommenting on GrowGen's a purchase of Humboldt Depot, Darren Lampert, Co-Founder and CEO, said, \"Our acquisition of Humboldt Depot strongly positions GrowGen in Humboldt County which is abundant with cultivators. Increasing our warehouse and retail showroom space will allow us to stock at inventory levels and sizes to attract the largest commercial growers. With over 2,000 cultivation licenses being applied for this year in Humboldt County, GrowGen is now poised to gain significant new business in one of America's iconic regions for cannabis cultivation. California is a major marketplace that the Company is developing, and plans to add several locations in the coming months.\"\nGrowGeneration has already increased its revenue forecast for 2018 to $30M and has a strong acquisition pipeline in development for 2018. The Company plans to complete several acquisitions in the first half of 2018 and expanding its US model into Canada in 2018.\nAbout GrowGeneration Corp. :\nGrowGeneration Corp.
