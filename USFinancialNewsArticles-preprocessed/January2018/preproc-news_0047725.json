    "text": "RICHMOND, Calif., Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EKSO), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today announced that its industrial division will now report solely to Thomas Looby, President and Chief Executive Officer. Concomitant with this news, the company also announced that co-founder Russ Angold, after 13 years with Ekso Bionics, has decided to step down. Mr. Angold will continue to work with the company in order to facilitate a smooth transition. His responsibilities will be merged with the already established engineering, EksoWorks and leadership teams.\n“As a co-founder, Russ has made significant contributions to the business from conception to commercialization of our industry-changing technologies,” said Mr. Looby. “He has set the team up for long term success as we continue to innovate and drive adoption. We thank him for his dedication and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.”\n“When starting the company in 2005, few people knew what exoskeletons were,” commented Mr. Angold. “We’ve come a long way - it’s not science fiction anymore - now people are embracing how Ekso’s technology can augment human capabilities. This is still only the beginning and while I am leaving to pursue other opportunities, I am confident the right team is in place to drive the business forward.”\nAbout Ekso Bionics ®\nEkso Bionics ® is a leading developer of exoskeleton solutions that amplify human potential by supporting or enhancing strength, endurance and mobility across medical and industrial applications.
