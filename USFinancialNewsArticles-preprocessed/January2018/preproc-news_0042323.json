When you have a pick-up in global economic activity with leading suppliers here in the United States whose sales are being helped along by a weaker dollar, you probably be buying from companies here,” said Pavlik.\nEarnings growth for S&P 500 companies for the fourth-quarter is expected at 12.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 9:35 a.m. ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 106.93 points, or 0.41 percent, at 26,317.74.\nThe S&P 500 was up 7.29 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,846.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.10 points, or 0.16 percent, at 7,472.39.\nAbbott Laboratories rose 3.5 percent after quarterly profit and 2018 adjusted earnings forecast beat estimates.\nTexas Instruments fell 5.4 percent after the company posted its slowest revenue growth in four quarters.\nUnited Continental tumbled 10 percent after the airline said it plans to increase capacity, likely threatening its profit margin. American Airlines fell 6.5 percent while Delta Air Lines dropped 6.6 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,776 to 771. On the Nasdaq, 1,487 issues rose and 831 fell.
