    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of DST Systems, Inc. (\"DST\") (NYSE: DST) breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SS&C) (NASDAQ: SSNC). DST provides technology-based information processing and servicing solutions.\nOn January 11, 2018, DST announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with SS&C. Under the terms, SS&C will acquire DST for $84.00 per share in cash.\nThe investigation concerns whether the DST board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for DST shares of common stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of DST and believe the proposed buyout price is too low, or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
