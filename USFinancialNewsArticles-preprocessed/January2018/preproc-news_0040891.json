    "text": "(Reuters) - Eighteen Russians had their status as Authorised Neutral Athletes (ANA) renewed by the International Association of Athletics Federations’ (IAAF) doping review board on Thursday.\nThe IAAF received more than 80 applications from Russians wanting to continue to compete as neutral athletes in 2018, with priority given to those seeking to take part in the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham in March.\nMariya Lasitskene, who won high jump gold at the 2015 and 2017 World Championships, was among those cleared to compete. All 18 athletes were afforded ANA status in 2017.\nRussia was banned by the IAAF in 2015 following an independent World Anti-Doping Agency investigation into allegations, still denied by Moscow, of state-sponsored doping.\nRussian athletes, however, can be cleared to compete internationally by demonstrating to the IAAF that their training environment meets the required anti-doping standards.\nThe country has also been excluded by the International Olympic Committee from this year’s Winter Games, where Russians can also compete as neutrals.\nIAAF President Sebastian Coe said: “With access to new information from WADA at the end of last year the Doping Review Board is assessing all applications against this information as well as existing information. It is a complex and lengthy process.”\nList of athletes cleared:\nViktor Butenko (discus)\nDanila Danilov (hammer throw)\nAlexsey Fedorov (triple jump)\nIrina Gumenyuk (triple jump)\nVyacheslav Kolesnichenko (sprints)\nSecond placed Irina Gumenyuk of Russia celebrates on the podium after the women's Triple Jump event at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Gothenburg March 3, 2013.
