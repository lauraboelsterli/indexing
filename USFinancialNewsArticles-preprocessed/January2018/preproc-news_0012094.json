    "text": "PLANO, Texas, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuvectra Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTR), a neurostimulation medical device company, today announced preliminary unaudited revenue for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nPreliminary unaudited fourth quarter consolidated revenue is expected to be in the range of $11.5 to $12.0 million, compared to $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Preliminary unaudited Algovita revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to be in the range of $10.0 to $10.5 million, compared to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNuvectra’s preliminary unaudited full year 2017 consolidated revenue is expected to be in the range of $31.5 to $32.0 million, compared to $12.5 million for full year 2016.\nThe preliminary unaudited revenue results included in this press release are prior to the completion of review and audit procedures by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and are therefore subject to adjustment.
