    "text": "INDIANA, Pa., Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- S&T Bancorp, Inc. (S&T) (NASDAQ: STBA), the holding company for S&T Bank with locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York, announced today its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings . Fourth quarter of 2017 net income was $9.3 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.27. As a result of the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, additional tax expense of $13.4 million was recognized to re-measure the net deferred tax asset (DTA) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This re-measurement decreased quarterly and annual diluted earnings per share by $0.38. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement, fourth quarter of 2017 net income was $22.7 million (non-GAAP) and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 (non-GAAP). This compares to fourth quarter of 2016 net income of $17.7 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, and third quarter of 2017 net income of $22.7 million, or $0.65 per diluted share.\nNet income was $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement, full year 2017 net income was $86.4 million (non-GAAP) and diluted earnings per share was $2.47 (non-GAAP) compared to net income of $71.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.05 for 2016.\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Highlights:\nReturn on average assets (ROA) was 0.52%, return on average equity (ROE) was 4.14% and return on average tangible equity (ROTE) (non-GAAP) was 6.30%.\nExcluding the net DTA re-measurement of $13.4 million, ROA was 1.26% (non-GAAP), ROE was 10.09% (non-GAAP) and ROTE was 15.16% (non-GAAP).\nNet interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) was stable at 3.58% compared to 3.59% in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet loan charge-offs were $1.3 million, representing 0.09% of average loans on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nS&T declared a $0.22 per share dividend, a 10% increase compared to $0.20 in the same period a year ago.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nNet income increased to $73.0 million compared to $71.4 million for 2016. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement of $13.4 million, net income increased 21% to $86.4 million (non-GAAP) compared to 2016.\nROA was 1.03%, ROE was 8.37% and ROTE (non-GAAP) was 12.77%.\nExcluding the DTA re-measurement of $13.4 million, ROA was 1.22% (non-GAAP), ROE was 9.90% (non-GAAP) and ROTE was 15.08% (non-GAAP).\nNet interest income increased $22.5 million, or 11%, and net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased 9 basis points to 3.56% compared to 3.47% in 2016.\nAsset quality metrics improved with a decrease in nonperforming loans of $18.7 million, or 44%, compared to December 31, 2016.\n\"Our performance in 2017 reached another milestone for net income,\" said Todd Brice, president and chief executive officer of S&T. \"Results were impacted by an 11% increase in net interest income as well as controlled expenses and a significant improvement in our asset quality.\"\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $0.3 million to $57.8 million compared to $57.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE) (non-GAAP) declined one basis point to 3.58% compared to 3.59% in the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income is due to an increase in average loans of $49.6 million and higher short-term rates.\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality trends continued to be favorable during the fourth quarter of 2017. Total nonperforming loans decreased 19% to $23.9 million, or 0.42% of total loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $29.5 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. Net charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.09% of average loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net charge-offs of $1.5 million, or 0.10% of average loans on an annualized basis, in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of improving asset quality, the provision for loan losses decreased $1.9 million to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $56.4 million, or 0.98% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $56.7 million, or 0.97% of total portfolio loans, at September 30, 2017.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nNoninterest income decreased $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $12.7 million compared to $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Securities were sold resulting in a $1.0 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank owned life insurance decreased $0.7 million due to a claim in the third quarter of 2017. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in other income from a $1.0 million gain on the sale of a branch during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest expense increased $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $37.9 million from $36.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Professional services and legal expenses increased $0.4 million mainly related to selling majority ownership of our insurance business that closed on January 1, 2018. Marketing expense increased $0.4 million due to normal timing of marketing campaigns. Other expense increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher loan related costs.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets were $7.1 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.2 billion at September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, $41.1 million of loans and $37.8 million of deposits were sold related to a branch sale. Total portfolio loans decreased $59.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher loan payoffs. S&T's risk-based capital ratios were relatively unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2017. All capital ratios remain significantly above the well-capitalized thresholds of federal bank regulatory agencies.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFull year 2017 net income increased to $73.0 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.09. Excluding the net DTA re-measurement of $13.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, net income increased 21% to $86.4 million (non-GAAP) and diluted earnings per share was $2.47 (non-GAAP). Net interest income increased $22.5 million, or 11%, in 2017 due to average loan growth of $438 million, or 8.2%, and higher short-term rates. Net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) increased to 3.56% compared to 3.47% for 2016. Asset quality improved throughout the year resulting in a $4.1 million decline in the provision for loan losses to $13.9 million. Nonperforming loans decreased $18.7 million, or 44%, and net loan charge-offs to average loans decreased to 0.18% compared to 0.25% in 2016. Expenses were well controlled during 2017 with an efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) of 51.77% compared to 54.06% for 2016.
