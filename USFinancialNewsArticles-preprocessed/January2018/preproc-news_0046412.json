    "text": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc fell more than 7 percent before the bell on Wednesday after the airline said it plans to add capacity, likely threatening its profit margin, as it is locked in a price war with low-cost carriers.\nThe parent of the No.3 U.S. airline plans to increase capacity by between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2018, and aims to likely grow by a similar rate in 2019 and 2020, saying it would give the carrier a competitive edge in its fight against low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlu Airways.\nThe decision comes months after United ordered 10 extra Airbus A350 jetliners, while ditching the largest model, the A350-1000, in favor of the smaller and more popular A350-900 and delaying deliveries to save cash.\nUnitedâ€™s shares are poised to open lower despite the bigger-than-expected jump in quarterly profit it reported on Tuesday.\nShares of other U.S. airline companies such as American Airlines Group and Delta Air Lines also fell in premarket trading.
