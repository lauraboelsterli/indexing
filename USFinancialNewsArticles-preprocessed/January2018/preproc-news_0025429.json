    "text": "BlackRock 's Larry Fink and other CEOs are \"extraordinarily hypocritical\" to push companies for more social responsibility, billionaire investor Sam Zell told CNBC on Tuesday.\nThe New York Times reported Fink will tell business leaders in a letter on Tuesday that their companies need to do more than just make profits. Companies need to contribute to society as well if they want to receive support, Fink argues in a draft letter obtained by the Times.\nFink's BlackRock manages more than $6 trillion in investments through 401(k) plans, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.\n\"They talk about the fact that they're in effect going to do exactly what market does,\" said Zell, the founder and chairman of property specialist Equity Group Investments. \"And then they put up public policy statements that suggest that they're going to advocate the market doing things other than what happens every day.\"\n\"Either they're a passive fund that follows the market or they're a leader that's setting the tone, Zell said in an interview on \" Squawk Box ,\" adding BlackRock can't have it both ways.\nZell questioned whether America is ready to have BlackRock \"in charge of the NYSE,\" saying \"I didn't know Larry Fink had been made God.\"\nBlackRock did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
