Stuart, a homeless man, sits under a bus shelter where he sleeps opposite Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \nQueen Elizabeth’s grandson Harry and his American actress fiancee are to tie the knot at Windsor Castle, the monarch’s palace to the west of London, in May with thousands of visitors expected to visit the town to celebrate the occasion. \nSimon Dudley, the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, wrote on Twitter there had been an “epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy” in the town and said he wanted police “to focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding”. \n“This is creating a concerning and hostile atmosphere for our residents and the seven million tourists who come to Windsor each year,” he wrote in a letter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield. \n“It is becoming increasingly concerning to see the quantities of bags and detritus that those begging are accumulating and leaving on our pavements, at times unattended, thus presenting a security risk.” \nHis remarks drew criticism from local homeless organizations and even Prime Minister Theresa May. \n“I don’t agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made,” she told BBC TV. Stuart, a homeless man, sits under a bus shelter where he sleeps opposite Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \n“I think it is important that we, councils, work hard to ensure that they are proving accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people aggressively begging on the streets then it’s important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive bullying.” \nWindsor, the oldest inhabited castle in the world which has been a home of British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, attracts 1.3 million visitors every year, while many also visit the town to watch the regular “Changing the Guard” ceremony with soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats parading with an army band.
