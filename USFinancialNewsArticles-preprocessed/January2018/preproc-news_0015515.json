    "text": "BELLEVUE, Wash., Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esterline Corporation (NYSE:ESL) ( www.esterline.com ), a leading specialty manufacturer serving global aerospace and defense markets, today announced that Stephen Nolan, Chief Financial Officer for Vista Outdoor, Inc., will succeed Robert George as Esterline’s Chief Financial Officer, effective February 5, 2018. George, who has been with Esterline as Chief Financial Officer for 21 years, will remain with the company in a special advisory role to help ensure a seamless transition before retiring in June 2018.\nEsterline Corporation announces Stephen Nolan as Chief Financial Officer, effective February 5, 2018\nEsterline Chief Executive Officer Curtis Reusser said, “As a valued team member and leader, Bob helped Esterline grow into a strong, multi-billion dollar global company during his tenure. I’m pleased to congratulate him on his well-earned retirement and am grateful for his many significant contributions. We are also excited to welcome Stephen, who has extensive experience within the aerospace and defense sector, an impressive track record of strategic execution, and a history of success serving in senior financial and business management roles in global manufacturing environments. I know his expertise in financial and strategic planning, and his results-oriented business leadership will offer valuable perspective to help Esterline achieve its objectives.”\nNolan has more than 15 years of experience in operational and strategic finance, most recently serving as Chief Financial Officer for Vista Outdoor, Inc., a publicly traded manufacturer of outdoor sports and recreation products. Nolan was instrumental in the formation and spin-off of Vista Outdoor from its aerospace and defense parent company Alliant Techsystems (ATK) in 2015, as well as the related merger between ATK and Orbital Sciences to create Orbital ATK. These transactions unlocked more than $1.5 billion in shareholder value. Nolan quickly and effectively put together functional teams and financial infrastructure for Vista Outdoor, helping the company operate independently in less than a year. Prior to that, he spent nearly a decade in strategic and operational management roles with ATK, including Senior Vice President for Strategy and Business Development and several business unit leadership positions. Earlier in his career, Nolan served for five years in corporate development and strategy roles at Raytheon Company.\nNolan began his career in engineering and business consulting. He has a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Trinity College at the University of Dublin, a master’s degree in civil engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAbout Esterline:\nEsterline Corporation is a leading worldwide supplier to the aerospace and defense industry specializing in three core business segments: Advanced Materials; Avionics & Controls; and Sensors & Systems.
