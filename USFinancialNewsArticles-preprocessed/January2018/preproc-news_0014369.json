    "text": "Schedules from the White House show that President Donald Trump often begins his official work day around 11 a.m., according to a new report .\nCiting copies of Trump's private schedule, news website Axios said the president's starts are apparently much later now than when he first took office. The president has been demanding more \"Executive Time\" for his days — which officials indicated \"almost always means TV and Twitter time alone in the residence,\" according to Axios.\n\"Executive Time\" is on Trump's schedule every day from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., the report said.\nFor comparison, Axios reported that Presidents George W. Bush usually began his time in the Oval Office around 6:45 a.m., and Barack Obama typically arrived between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the Axios report, saying, \"The time in the morning is a mix of residence time and Oval Office time but he always has calls with staff, Hill members, Cabinet members and foreign leaders during this time.\"\nFor more details on the president's schedule — and his TV habits — see the full report from Axios.",
