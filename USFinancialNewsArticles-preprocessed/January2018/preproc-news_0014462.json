    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 12:36 PM / Updated 8 hours ago BAWAG online banking back in service after technical glitch Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nVIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian lender BAWAG said its online banking services and its website were back to normal after temporarily shutting down on Thursday due to technical problems, but added that a cyber attack could be ruled out. FILE PHOTO: The logo of BAWAG PSK Bank is pictured on one of its branches in Vienna, Austria, March 2, 2016. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo \nThe systems were rebooted early in the afternoon after BAWAG’s internet provider A1 Group, a Telekom Austria unit, said a battery damage at its own power supply system had led to a temporary disruption of the IT system. \n“Power supply and operations at the data center are back in a reliable state,” A1 said in the statement. \nA BAWAG spokeswoman confirmed all systems were back to normal, adding it was too early to assess the damage.
