    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Jan. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HealthSouth Corporation, the nation's leading owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and a leader in home-based care, has completed its planned name change to Encompass Health Corporation. Effective with the opening of trading today, the Company's New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol will change from \"HLS\" to \"EHC.\"\n\"As Encompass Health, we will honor the legacy of our foundational businesses, HealthSouth Corporation and Encompass Home Health & Hospice, while continuing to advance our position as the leading provider of integrated post-acute care solutions in a rapidly changing healthcare environment,\" said Encompass Health President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Tarr. \"Our new corporate name further reinforces our strength as one Company, and reflects our expanding national footprint and our strategy to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care across the post-acute continuum.\"\nThe full rollout of the Encompass Health brand will include changing the name and logo across its field operations, as well as corporate resources such as its website. Inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home care agencies will begin transitioning to the Encompass Health name, beginning with locations in Texas, Alabama, and Arkansas, on April 1, with local migrations continuing throughout 2018. The rollout is expected to be fully completed by the first quarter of 2019.\n\"The decision to rebrand as Encompass Health Corporation is the result of a yearlong, research-intensive process that helped us understand how our brand could better reflect and support our business strategy, while raising awareness of our Company's strategy and value proposition with all key constituencies,\" said Tarr.\nThe Company will host a presentation at the 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 9, 2018. On Feb. 6, the encompasshealth.com website will go live and Tarr will ring The Closing Bell Â® at the NYSE.\nAbout Encompass Health\nAs a national leader of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home-based care, Encompass Health (NYSE: EHC) offers facility-based and home-based patient care through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies.
