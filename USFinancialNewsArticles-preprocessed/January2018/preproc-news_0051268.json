Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe opposition’s most popular leaders, Henrique Capriles and Leopoldo Lopez, are banned from standing for office. \n“We believe that this meeting represents a definitive opportunity for the government to review its recent decisions, and thus prevent the country from entering unmanageable chaos,” the opposition coalition said in a statement. \nThe opposition added it will request a “balanced” electoral council that allows for the vote of Venezuelans abroad and the reversal of political disqualifications, among other issues. \nThe Popular Will party, created by Lopez, has already pulled out of the talks.
