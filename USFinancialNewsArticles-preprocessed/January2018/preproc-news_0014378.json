    "text": "TUNIS (Reuters) - A Jewish school on a Tunisian island was attacked late on Tuesday as police battled violent unrest elsewhere in the country, arresting more than 200 people, witnesses and the interior ministry said.\nPetrol bombs thrown at the school on the tourist resort island of Djerba, home to an ancient Jewish community, caused some damage but no injuries, the head of the local Jewish community, Perez Trabelsi, told Reuters on Wednesday.\nThere were no protests in Djerba but locals said the assailants had exploited the fact that there was a reduced security presence as police were busy combating anti-government protests elsewhere in the North African state.\n“Unknown people took the opportunity of the protests and threw Molotov cocktails into the lobby of a Jewish religious school in Djerba,” Trabelsi said.\nAt the time of the attack, violent clashes were raging in some 20 Tunisian cities as people protested against rising prices and new taxes imposed by on Jan. 1.\nAbout 50 policemen were wounded in the clashes, said Interior Ministry spokesman Khelifa Chibani.\n“Last night criminals looted and burned security centers, 45 police cars were torched and some government offices were attacked,” he said. “They blocked roads and carried out robberies in many cities ... Obviously, these are not protests, but theft and damage to public and private property.”\nMainly Muslim Tunisia has a Jewish minority of fewer than 1,800 people. Jews have lived in Tunisia for over 2,000 years and Djerba is home to Africa’s oldest synagogue, El Ghriba, which was hit by al Qaeda-linked militants in 2002 in a truck bomb attack that killed 21 people including Western tourists.\nReporting by Tarek Amara; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
