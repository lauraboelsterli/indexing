Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda walks after meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Japan January 11, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \n“Governor Kuroda has met my expectations with job availability at a 43-year high,” Abe said in a programme by public broadcaster NHK. \n“I want him to keep up his efforts. But I haven’t made up my mind” on who should be next BOJ governor when Kuroda’s current term ends in April next year. Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli",
