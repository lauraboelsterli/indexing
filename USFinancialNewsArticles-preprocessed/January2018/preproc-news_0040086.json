    "text": "LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Golden Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq: GDEN) (“Golden”) announced today the closing of its underwritten public offering of 7,475,000 shares of common stock at the previously announced public offering price of $28.00 per share, which consisted of 6,500,000 shares sold by certain of its shareholders and 975,000 shares sold directly by Golden pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.\nGolden did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling shareholders. The aggregate gross proceeds to Golden from the offering of shares pursuant to the underwriters’ option, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $27.3 million. Golden expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of 975,000 primary shares for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, capital expenditures, opportunistic acquisitions or working capital.\nJ.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley acted as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the offering. Macquarie Capital also acted as a joint book-running manager. Union Gaming acted as co-manager for the offering.\nThe offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

LLC, Attn: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10014. Electronic copies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus are also available on the website of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov .\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the offered shares, nor shall there be any sale of such shares in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or other jurisdiction.\nAbout Golden Entertainment, Inc.\nGolden Entertainment, Inc. owns and operates gaming properties across two divisions – resort casino operations and distributed gaming.
