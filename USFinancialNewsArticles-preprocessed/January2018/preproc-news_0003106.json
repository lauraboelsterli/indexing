    "text": "The Pentagon says the U.S. has agreed to delay joint military exercises with South Korea until after the Winter Olympics.\nCol. Rob Manning is a Pentagon spokesman. Manning says President Donald Trump agreed to the delay in consultation with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nManning says in a brief written statement: \"The Department of Defence supports the president's decision and what is in the best interest of the ROK-U.S. alliance,\" referring to the U.S. defence treaty with the Republic of Korea.\nThe decision pushes back a set of annual military exercises known as Foal Eagle, which normally are held between February and April. Foal Eagle is a series of exercises designed to test the readiness of the two countries' militaries.\nThe Winter Olympics begin Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.",
