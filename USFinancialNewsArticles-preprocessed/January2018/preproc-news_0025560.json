    "text": "ROCK HILL, S.C., Jan. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD) and Stryker announced an exclusive distribution partnership for VSP ® (Virtual Surgical Planning) and anatomical models for the craniomaxillofacial specialty. This partnership will drive the availability of personalized surgical planning and techniques to healthcare professionals – saving both surgeons and patients hours in the operating room. 1\nEstablished by 3D Systems, VSP technology received FDA market clearance as a service-based approach to personalized surgery, combining expertise in medical imaging, surgical simulation and 3D printing. The surgeon initiates the process, bringing their clinical knowledge and desired surgical plan to an online web meeting with a 3D Systems biomedical engineer to simulate and plan the surgical procedure. The outcome is a digital plan that is transferred to the operating room via accurate 3D printed patient-specific models, guides and templates.\n\"Collaborating with surgeons to deliver the best possible patient outcomes is of the utmost importance to our company,\" said Kevin McAlea, executive vice president, general manager, metals and healthcare, 3D Systems. \"With the advancement of 3D printing, combined with the surgeon's ability to use our Virtual Surgical Planning and anatomical modeling technologies, a patient's life can be forever changed. It provides surgeons with the ability to have a clear 3D visualization of a patient's anatomy and to develop a customized surgical plan prior to even entering the operating room.\"\nAs a pioneer in the personalized medicine space, 3D Systems has provided VSP or anatomical services in more than 100,000 cases. Stryker's Craniomaxillofacial business specializes in providing patient-specific options and innovative solutions that help drive efficiencies in surgical suites. The combination of Stryker's specialized sales force with 3D Systems' cutting-edge 3D printing and patient-specific solutions positions both companies to provide a superior level of service to healthcare professionals who use these revolutionary products.\n\"This partnership allows us to better support the rapidly evolving needs of our customers and accelerate innovation in the area of personalized medicine,\" stated David Mercado, vice president and general manager, Stryker. \"We are very pleased that 3D Systems chose us as their long-term collaborator in this space.\"\n\"We have a history of achieving positive patient outcomes working with Stryker,\" said Katie Weimer, vice president, medical devices, 3D Systems. \"I am so proud to partner with a world leader in medical technologies to deliver our innovative solutions – helping surgeons change the lives of their patients.\"\nThe agreement between 3D Systems and Stryker is specific to the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.
