    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Freestone Resources, Inc. (“Freestone”) (OTCQB: FSNR ) and Dynamis Energy , LLC (“Dynamis”) today announced the formation of a transition team to manage the details of the proposed merger and direct the key operational decisions of the business before the merger is completed. The transition team will be made up of Kevin McNulty, CEO of Dynamis Energy, Michael McGhan, CEO of Freestone Resources, and Jason Bailey, Freestone Resources board member.\nThe responsibilities of this team will include: working together to meet the filing requirements for the proposed merger, making recommendations to the boards of the two companies regarding potential operational and commercial decisions that would affect the combined entity, helping to form the management structure and team that will run the combined entity, and directing key management decisions that affect Freestone and the Freestone Dynamis Energy Partners (the current joint venture between the two entities) during the interim period between now and the time when the proposed merger is put to shareholder vote.\nIn addition, the boards of both Freestone and Dynamis have recognized that the merger was not completed before the originally established date of December 31, 2017, and an extension that will allow adequate time to complete the proposed merger will be established.\nKevin McNulty, CEO of Dynamis Energy, said, “This is the first step to developing an overall management plan for the combined companies and for handling key business decisions that face our companies in the interim period.
