LIVECHAT-BREAKINGVIEWS PREDICTIONS 2018 There is plenty of discord and uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump’s second year starts. Yet money is cheap, the global economy is motoring, and markets are ebullient. That combustible mixture could be called “froth and frustration.” How this ironic social contrast, worthy of Jane Austen, resolves itself will be key for 2018. Quentin Webb, Reuters Breakingviews Asia Finance Editor, joins us to discuss at 0900 IST.

GLOBAL TOP NEWS • North, South Korea begin talks as Winter Olympics help break ice North and South Korea kicked off their first formal talks in more than two years on Tuesday, with both sides expressing optimism ahead of discussions on how the North's athletes can attend the Winter Olympics in the South despite tensions. • Trump to call on Pentagon, diplomats to play bigger arms sales role –sources The Trump administration is nearing completion of a new \"Buy American\" plan that calls for U.S. military attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry, going beyond the limited assistance they currently provide, officials said. • Samsung Elec profit guidance misses expectations as won weighs Samsung Electronics estimated a record fourth-quarter profit but the guidance fell short of market expectations as a strong won and one-off staff bonuses took the shine off surging DRAM chip prices. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,653.50, trading up 0.2 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely trade little changed against the dollar in early session, amid expectation that strong local shares will offset gains in the greenback as the euro rally fizzles out. • Indian sovereign bonds are likely to fall in early session tracking gains in crude oil prices that threaten to add to inflation. Investors also await a state bond auction later today. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 pct bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.32 pct-7.38 pct band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 extended its winning streak for 2018 on Monday although its advance slowed to a crawl as the healthcare and financial sectors weighed and investors awaited the start of the quarterly earnings season. • Asian shares edged higher on, approaching record highs after the S&P 500 extended its winning streak, while the dollar steadied against its major counterparts. • The euro languished after slipping from last week's high as investors were cautious after a months-long rally, while the dollar firmed against the yen though a lack of catalysts tempered its momentum. • U.S. bond yields were little changed on Monday after a boost from stronger German government debt and a Federal Reserve official's remarks that the U.S. central bank may only raise rates two times this year. • U.S. oil prices hit their highest since 2015 as speculators bet on further price rises amid OPEC-led production cuts and a dip in American drilling activity. • Gold prices inched down as the dollar held steady amid expectations of more U.S. interest rate hikes this year.
