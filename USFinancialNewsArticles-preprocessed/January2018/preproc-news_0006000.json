    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 4:43 AM / in 7 hours Peru's Fujimori leaves clinic as free man, reigniting anger over pardon Guadalupe Pardo 3 Min Read \nLIMA (Reuters) - Peru’s former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori left hospital as a free man on Thursday, waving to supporters from a wheelchair and reigniting anger over a pardon he secured from President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Christmas Eve. \nThe pardon has polarized Peru, triggering anti-government protests and political resignations that have shaken Kuczynski’s already-weak government. Kuczynski said last week he would unveil a new cabinet soon, but has announced no details yet. \nA corrupt dictator to some and a misunderstood hero to others, Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 rightwing populist government. \n“To the joy of many Peruvians, today Alberto Fujimori is free,” his doctor, and former health minister, Alejandro Aguinaga, said on television channel Canal N, adding that Fujimori was still recovering from heart troubles. \nFujimori, 79, was trailed by police escorts and news cameras as he arrived at a sprawling house in the upscale district of La Molina in Lima, the Peruvian capital. \nIn a snapshot shared by his daughter on social media, Fujimori was seen in a garden surrounded by his four adult children - a sign of unity that fueled speculation he would end a political rivalry between siblings Keiko and Kenji.

REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo \nWearing a jacket and blue shirt, a smiling Fujimori appeared alert as he waved to crowds outside the Lima hospital where he had been interned for what his doctor called life-threatening blood-pressure and heart problems on the eve of the pardon. \nKuczynski, a former investment banker who is 79, like Fujimori, cited the latter’s ailing health when he pardoned him nearly two weeks ago. But the decision has been widely seen in Peru as payback after Fujimori enlisted his loyalists to help Kucyznski survive an impeachment bid following a graft scandal.
