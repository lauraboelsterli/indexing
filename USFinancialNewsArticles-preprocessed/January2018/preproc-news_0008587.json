The two music luminaries created audio product company Beats Electronics, which Apple (aapl) bought in 2014 for roughly $3 billion. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \n“My contract is up in August, but the funny thing is, I don’t have a contract,” Iovine said. “I have a deal, and certain things happen along that deal. The bottom line is I’m loyal to the guys at Apple.” \nIovine said he’s committed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and he’s there to “ to help wherever and however I can, to take this all the way.” \nHe said that his “next chapter” would involve growing Apple’s music subscription and streaming service, Apple Music .
