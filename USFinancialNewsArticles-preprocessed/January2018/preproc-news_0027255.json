Slideshow (13 Images) \nIn a statement, the MGK said it would not allow the formation of a “terrorist army” along Turkish borders, after the U.S.-led coalition in northern Syria said it was working with the mainly Kurdish YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to set up a new 30,000-strong border force. \nThe MGK demanded that all weapons given to Kurdish fighters in Syria be collected without delay. It also advised the cabinet of ministers to extend the emergency rule imposed shortly after a 2016 coup attempt. Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Catherine Evans",
