    "text": "LG is preparing to build new OLED screens for an upcoming 6.5-inch iPhone, according to The Korea Herald.\nLG will reportedly provide the larger panels while Samsung will continue to ship its OLED screens for smaller 5.8- or 6-inch screens. The iPhone X is Apple 's first to use OLED panels. They're brighter and more colorful than traditional LCD panels, and Samsung is currently the sole provider.\nLG Display doesn't have the same capacity as Samsung, however. The Korea Herald said Samsung can pump out 10 million screens a month while LG is aiming to hit around 6 million.\nEarlier reports from KGI suggested that Apple is gearing up to launch three new iPhones in 2018, with 6.5-inch, 5.8-inch and 6.1-inch screens. Apple is reportedly trying to cram larger batteries inside next year's iPhones, too.",
