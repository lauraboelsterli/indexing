    "text": "BEIJING (AP) â€” China's total domestic movie ticket sales rose 13.5 percent in 2017 to 55.9 billion yuan ($8.6 billion), a state news agency said Monday.\nThe top-grossing title was the mainland-made action picture \"Wolf Warrior 2,\" which took in 5.7 billion yuan ($875 million), the Xinhua News Agency said, citing data from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.\nChina is the second-largest global film market and is narrowing the gap with the United States, where last year's domestic box office is estimated to have declined 2.6 percent from 2016 to $11.1 billion.\nMainland-made movies accounted for 54 percent of 2017 ticket sales, or 30.1 billion yuan ($4.6 billion), according to Xinhua.\nThe No. 2-grossing title was the Hollywood action movie \"The Fate of the Furious,\" which earned 2.7 billion yuan.",
