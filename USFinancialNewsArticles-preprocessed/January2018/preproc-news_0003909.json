    "text": "January 4, 2018 / 12:51 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago FBI chief, Deputy U.S. AG meet House Speaker on Trump-Russia probe - source Mark Hosenball , Patricia Zengerle 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two top law enforcement officials met U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday to discuss demands by congressional supporters of President Donald Trump that the Justice Department hand over files relevant to investigations of possible Trump 2016 campaign ties to Russia, a source familiar with the meeting said. \nFBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Ryan, a Ryan spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said, declining to comment on the subject of the meeting. \nA Justice Department spokeswoman   \nReuters reported in September that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee had issued subpoenas to Wray and Rosenstein demanding that they surrender their agencies files on former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, his “dossier” on suspected Trump team contacts with Russia and inquiries being made by the FBI and the Justice Department into the dossier’s contents. \nOfficials said at the time that the agencies were reluctant to comply with the subpoenas, backed by House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, because the FBI was conducting its own probe. That investigation is supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign to tilt the election in Trump’s favour. \nMoscow has denied any effort to influence the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Trump supporters have said that the “dossier” and other allegations of Trump involvement with Russia are smears concocted by Trump’s political enemies. \nIn December, news outlets reported that Nunes would ask his committee to vote to hold the Justice Department and FBI in contempt of Congress if they did not turn over the material sought by the committee. It is unclear whether such a vote has already been taken. \nA spokesman for Nunes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
