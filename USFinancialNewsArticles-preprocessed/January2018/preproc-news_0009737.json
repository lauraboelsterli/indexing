    "text": "Montclair, NJ , Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FluoroPharma Medical Inc. (OTCQB: FPMI) today announced it completed the buyback of convertible preferred and common shares held by Platinum Long Term Growth VII, LLC, which is currently undergoing a court ordered liquidation. The preferred shares were originally issued to Platinum in a private placement in 2013.\nAssuming conversion of preferred shares and notes, the repurchased shares would represent approximately 20% of the Companyâ€™s common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nFluoroPharma considers this a significant development, as it will allow the company to move forward with its recapitalization efforts, which were suspended over a year ago pending the outcome of this buyback transaction. The recapitalization efforts, if successful, will allow the company to move forward in an expeditious manner to restart clinical trials for both of its molecular imaging agents, CardioPET and BFPET, which are licensed from Massachusetts General Hospital. FluoroPharma believes these novel, proprietary PET imaging agents represent a breakthrough in the assessment of acute and chronic forms of heart disease.\nThe Company looks forward to engaging its shareholders actively during the recapitalization process.\nAbout FluoroPharma Medical\nFluoroPharma is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary PET imaging products to evaluate cardiac disease at the cellular and molecular levels. The Company has licensed technology from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The Company's goal is to enable personalized medicine through precision diagnostics that will help the medical community diagnose disease more accurately at the earliest stages, leading to more effective treatment, management and better patient outcomes.\nFluoroPharma's initial focus is the development of breakthrough PET imaging agents and the company is advancing two products in clinical trials for assessment of acute and chronic forms of heart disease. These novel agents have been designed to rapidly target myocardial cells. In addition to the United States, Europe and China, patents related to FluoroPharma's portfolio of imaging compounds have been issued in Japan, Canada, Australia and Mexico.
