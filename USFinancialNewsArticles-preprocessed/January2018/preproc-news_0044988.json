    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 4:58 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Former Guatemala defence minister arrested on corruption charges Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nGUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - A former Guatemalan general was arrested on corruption charges relating to a special bonus paid to President Jimmy Morales by the defence ministry, prosecutors said on Friday. \nWilliam Mansilla, who was minister of defence, left the government in September 2017 just after the payment came to light. \nSince December 2016, the defence department paid President Morales around $7,300 a month, on top of his regular salary, in what was called a “Bonus for Extraordinary Responsibility.” \nFormer comedian Morales, who came to power on an anti-corruption platform, has been under pressure amid allegations that include illegal election campaign financing. \nGuatemala’s federal prosecutors and the United Nations-backed commission against impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) had pushed to revoke immunity for Morales after his salary bonus became known. \nMorales denied that the payment was illegal but later returned some $60,000 (£42,308). \nMansilla was arrested on charges of abuse of authority, illegal enrichment and embezzlement, prosecutors said Friday. \n“In time, I will be able to give evidence and confront the legal cases that are coming,” Mansilla told journalists as he walked into the courtroom. \nGuatemala’s government did not respond to requests for comment on the case.
