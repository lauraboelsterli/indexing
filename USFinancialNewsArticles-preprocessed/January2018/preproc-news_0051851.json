Cost of deposits increased only 1 basis point sequentially Tangible common equity to tangible assets declined 38 bps to 9.12% sequentially Announced 6 branches closing in 1Q18, resulting in additional operating efficiencies\nLAFAYETTE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MidSouth Bancorp, Inc. (“MidSouth”) (NYSE:MSL) today reported a quarterly net loss available to common shareholders of $11.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net earnings available to common shareholders of $1.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $856,000 in net earnings available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included an after tax charge of $3.9 million resulting from the transfer of loans to held for sale, a $3.6 million charge for the write-down of net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an after-tax charge of $1.2 million for regulatory remediation costs, an after-tax charge of $512,000 resulting from the write-down of assets held for sale, an after-tax gain on sale of branches of $484,000 and an after-tax charge of $111,000 for severance and retention accruals. The third quarter of 2017 included a non-recurring after-tax expense of $587,000 related to the branch closures during the quarter, an after-tax charge of $556,000 for regulatory remediation costs and an after-tax gain on sales of securities of $220,000. Excluding these non-operating income and expenses, a loss of $0.15 per diluted share was reported for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to diluted earnings per common share of $0.10 for the third quarter of 2017 and $0.12 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nJim McLemore, President and CEO, remarked, \"We took decisive action to accelerate the turnaround of MidSouth this quarter to reduce our risk profile and build a foundation for long term growth with the completion of a comprehensive three-year Strategic Plan, our continued focus to reduce problem credits through our investments in talent and changes to our strategies relative to problem asset resolution, the announcement of additional branch closures to enhance our operational efficiencies and our expansion of resources and scope of regulatory and other remediation efforts. This turnaround is supported by our strong capital base, enhanced liquidity, a very high level of core deposits and long-term commitment to reduce our risk profile and improve the efficiency and effective execution of our Strategic Plan through enhanced corporate governance, strengthening management talent, investing in technology to reduce operating costs and significantly reducing problem assets. To accomplish these goals, we expect to invest $10-$12 million in 2018, with a significant drop-off of these costs in 2019 and 2020.\"\n\"We are especially pleased to welcome Mike Kramer as an advisor to our Board of Directors, pending final regulatory approval for his joining as a full director. Mike brings meaningful turnaround and corporate governance experience which will be invaluable to us.\"\nBalance Sheet\nConsolidated assets remained constant at $1.9 billion for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and September 30, 2017. Our stable core deposit base, which excludes time deposits, totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.4 billion at September 30, 2017 and accounted for 87.7% and 87.5% of deposits at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Net loans totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2017 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016. In an effort to further reduce classified assets, loans totaling $15.7 million were transferred to held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2017, and the sale of these loans is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018. A loss on transfer of loans to held for sale of $6.0 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 to write the loans down to fair value.\nMidSouth’s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 12.53% at December 31, 2017, compared to 12.84% at September 30, 2017. Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 16.51% and 17.77% at December 31, 2017, compared to 17.01% and 18.27% at September 30, 2017, respectively. Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2017 was 12.10%, compared to 12.68% at September 30, 2017. Tangible common equity totaled $167.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $180.7 million at September 30, 2017. Tangible book value per share at December 31, 2017 was $10.11 versus $10.92 at September 30, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets totaled $57.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.4 million compared to $53.9 million reported at September 30, 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to the $20.7 million of loans placed on non-accrual during the quarter and $2.8 million of loans transferred to held for sale that were identified as nonperforming during the fourth quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the payoffs/paydowns of $12.4 million of non-accrual loans and the charge-off of $7.4 million of non-accrual loans. Allowance coverage for nonperforming loans increased to 53.77% at December 31, 2017, compared to 48.47% at September 30, 2017. The ALLL/total loans ratio was 2.27% at December 31, 2017 and 2.03% at September 30, 2017. Including valuation accounting adjustments on acquired loans, the total valuation accounting adjustment plus ALLL was 2.36% of loans at December 31, 2017. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total loans increased to 2.94% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 1.26% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nTotal nonperforming assets to total loans plus ORE and other assets repossessed was 4.83% at December 31, 2017 compared to 4.35% at September 30, 2017. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings, accruing (“TDRs, accruing”) totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.6 million at September 30, 2017. Also included in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 was $5.1 million of nonperforming loans transferred to held for sale. Total classified assets, including ORE, were $118.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $139.7 million at September 30, 2017. Payoffs/paydowns of $25.8 million and charge-offs of $8.1 million of loans rated as classified at September 30, 2017 as well as a $5.2 million charge to write down classified loans to fair value when they were transferred to held for sale contributed to the decrease in classified assets. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades to classified loans of $16.2 million during the quarter. The classified to capital ratio at MidSouth Bank was 56.1% at December 31, 2017 versus 66.8% at September 30, 2017.\nMore information on our energy loan portfolio and other information on quarterly results can be found on our website at MidSouthBank.com under Investor Relations/Presentations.\nMr. McLemore noted, “Reducing our criticized asset levels continues to remain a top priority. We made great progress this quarter by reducing our classified asset ratio to 56%, which is down from a high of 79% earlier this year and reducing our energy exposure by $18.1 million. Our capital strength with a Tangible Common Equity ratio above 9% allows greater flexibility to manage problem assets from a position of strength, but we also remain committed to being as judicious as possible from a capital preservation standpoint.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Comparison\nMidSouth reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $11.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net earnings available to common shareholders of $856,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a $744,000 gain on the sale of branches, and the third quarter of 2017 included $338,000 in gain on sales of securities. Excluding these non-operating revenues, revenues from consolidated operations increased $795,000 in sequential-quarter comparison. Net interest income increased $659,000 and noninterest income increased $136,000 in sequential-quarter comparison.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 included non-operating expenses totaling $8.8 million which consisted of $171,000 of severance and retention accruals, a $789,000 write-down on assets held for sale, $1.8 million of remediation costs and a $6.0 million loss on the transfer of loans to held for sale. The third quarter of 2017 included a non-recurring charge of $903,000 related to branch closures and $856,000 of remediation costs. Excluding these non-operating expenses, noninterest expense increased $1.2 million in sequential-quarter comparison and consisted primarily of a $901,000 increase in legal and professional fees and a $316,000 increase in expenses on ORE. The increase in legal and professional fees is primarily due to increased outsourcing expenses to enhance risk management as well as increased legal fees to resolve credit quality issues. The provision for loan losses increased $6.3 million in sequential-quarter comparison. In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $3.6 million tax-related charge was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. Excluding this adjustment, we recorded an income tax benefit of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income tax expense of $574,000 for the third quarter of 2017.\nDividends on the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a result of our participation in the Small Business Lending Fund totaled $720,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a dividend rate of 9%, unchanged from $720,000 for the third quarter of 2017.

These changes were partially offset by a $128,000 decrease in FTE interest income on investment securities. Interest income on loans increased in sequential-quarter comparison due to an increase in the average yield on loans of 29 basis points, from 5.48% to 5.77%. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, the loan yield increased 28 basis points, from 5.39% to 5.67% during the same period. The average yield on investment securities increased 4 basis points, from 2.65% to 2.69%, and the average balance of investment securities decreased $25.5 million.

A reclass of certain hosted services subscriptions from corporate development into data processing at the beginning of 2017 caused the fluctuations in those two expense categories. The provision for loan losses increased $19.6 million in year-over-year comparison, from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the high level of charge-offs and additional impairment charges on nonperforming loans in 2017.

Our future growth prospects are solid with our dominant presence in Lafayette, complimented by a presence in markets such as Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, Dallas and Houston/Beaumont and with the eventual recovery of the other South Louisiana markets.

Note: Prior period information presented above has been adjusted to reflect a reclass of certain credit card income from interest income to non-interest income. MIDSOUTH BANCORP, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (unaudited) (in thousands except per share data) Certain financial information included in the earnings release and the associated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited) is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. We are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. \"Tangible common equity\" is defined as total common equity reduced by intangible assets. \"Core net interest margin\" is defined as reported net interest margin less purchase accounting adjustments. \"Annualized return on average assets, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average assets. \"Annualized return on average common equity, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average common equity. \"Annualized return on average tangible common equity, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average tangible common equity. \"Pre-tax, pre-provision annualized return on average assets, operating\" is defined as pre-tax, pre-provision earnings adjusted for specified one-time items divided by average assets. \"Tangible book value per common share\" is defined as tangible common equity divided by total common shares outstanding. \"Diluted earnings per share, operating\" is defined as net earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for specified one-time items divided by diluted weighted-average shares. The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is measured as noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes specified one-time items in addition to securities gains and losses and gains and losses on the sale/valuation of other real estate owned and other assets repossessed. We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for evaluating our financial condition and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our performance. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other companies may use.
