The government expects the economy to expand by 3.9 percent this year versus 4.4 percent in 2017, boosted by exports and investments. \nSome of the biggest banks are still state owned while the rest are mainly owned by foreign banks and investors. \nThose include U.S. investment firm Apollo Global Management , Societe Generale, UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo and Sberbank. $1 = 0.8036 euros Reporting by Marja Novak; editing by Jason Neely",
