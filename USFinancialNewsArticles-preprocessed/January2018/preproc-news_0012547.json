Morgan Healthcare Conference presentation are as follows:\nPresenter:\nCiara Kennedy, President and CEO, Amplyx Pharmaceuticals\nDate/Time:\nTuesday, January 9, 2018/12:00 PM PT\nRoom Location:\nElizabethan D Room\nAbout APX001\nAPX001 is the prodrug of APX001A, which is a first-in-class small molecule drug candidate that inhibits the highly conserved fungal enzyme Gwt1, compromising growth of major fungal pathogens, including Candida and Aspergillus. In many nonclinical studies, APX001A has shown broad-spectrum activity against common species of Candida spp., and Aspergillus spp., including multi-drug resistant strains and rare, hard-to-treat molds including Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., and fungi from the Mucorales order. APX001 has completed Phase 1 clinical studies for both IV and oral formulations. The product has been shown to be well tolerated and safe in healthy volunteers at all doses tested, and target exposures of APX001 for efficacy against Candida and Aspergillus were exceeded. Amplyx is planning to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials in early 2018.\nAbout Amplyx Pharmaceuticals\nAmplyx Pharmaceuticals is developing first-in-class products for life-threatening infections, with a near-term focus on deadly fungal pathogens in vulnerable, immune compromised patients. Amplyx's drug discovery and development efforts have been supported by significant venture investment and more than $10 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health.
