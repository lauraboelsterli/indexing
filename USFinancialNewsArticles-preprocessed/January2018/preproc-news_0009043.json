    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has provided, through a preferred investment with certain privileges and rights, $1,000,000 to Sandstone Diagnostic (“ Sandstone ”). This investment represents a 4.05% equity stake in the innovative developer of point-of care medical testing equipment and systems. Sandstone is the creator of Trak, www.trakfertility.com , the leading male fertility tracker which has been clinically tested and is FDA cleared for distribution. Trak is a consumer test kit and mobile app for males that provides couples a simple and accurate way to monitor and improve his fertility from the comfort and privacy of their home. Trak utilizes its proprietary bio-analysis platform to empower men to take control of their reproductive health and improve a couple's chances of conception. Sandstone Diagnostics is a Bay Area consumer health company focused on leveraging innovative biotechnologies to develop instruments and consumables for point-of-care medical testing that empower people to measure and improve important health markers at home.\n“DPW is an ideal strategic investor for Sandstone. Their broad interests in the medical device space and innovative thinking are additional assets they bring to the table,” stated Ms. Drexler.\n“We are very excited about our investment in Sandstone Diagnostics and look forward to supporting the work of the team led by their CEO, Karen Drexler. Ms. Drexler is a proven driver of change in Life Sciences and is an experienced and accomplished businesswoman and mentor of investment. Karen has both the entrepreneurial spirit and hardened corporate experience to surpass the success we envision for Sandstone, said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Ault continued, “Sandstone’s Trak provides couples an easy and proven solution to improve man’s health and their ability to have children. Sandstone represents another facet of our aggressive investment and growth strategies that we’ll continue to execute throughout 2018 as outlined during our webinar on December 20, 2017. We are moving methodically forward to expand our collaborative opportunities and maximize our existing revenue streams while creating new ones. DPW is focused on increasing profitability and leveraging scale, all contributing to our goal of providing shareholders long-term added-value and growth.”\nThe Company stated that Sandstone is the latest investment that will be held by its Life Sciences division. Mr. Ault has over 20 years of experience in developing businesses in the Life Sciences and the Medical Care sectors. Ranging from equity investment to operating bio-tech start-ups and a developing medical safety equipment manufacturer, Mr. Ault possesses a unique blend of talents and expertise that culminated on February 25, 2016 in the founding of Alzamend Neuro, Inc., a biotechnology firm dedicated to finding the treatment, prevention and cure for Alzheimer’s Disease. Mr. Ault has served as Chairman since Alzamend’s inception. As an activist, Mr. Ault in the Spring of 2004 became the majority shareholder of Franklin Capital Corp. and was elected to its board of directors in July 2004. Subsequently on February 25, 2005, Mr. Ault led Franklin Capital to acquire SurgiCount Medical, Inc. , the creator and developer of the SafetySponge® System; an FDA-cleared bar coding technology for inventory control that aims to detect and prevent the incidence of foreign objects left in the body after surgery. In April 2005, Ault restructured Franklin Capital Corp., having it change its name to Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (AMEX: PSTX) (“PST”). Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) acquired PST at the beginning of 2014 in a cash deal valued at one hundred twenty million dollars ($120,000,000) .\nThe Company stated it would keep the market updated on any developments or substantial changes in its investment in Sandstone Diagnostics, Inc.\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Fremont, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc. is a diversified holding company that, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Coolisys Technologies, Inc., is dedicated to providing world-class technology-based solutions where innovation is the main driver for mission-critical applications and lifesaving services.
