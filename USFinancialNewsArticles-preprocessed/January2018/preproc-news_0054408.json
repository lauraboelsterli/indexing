A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables following this news release. Total revenue increased primarily due to an increase in software fees and other revenue. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Automic Holding GmbH (Automic) and Veracode, Inc. (Veracode) contributed approximately 6.5 points of revenue growth for the quarter. Total bookings decreased primarily due to a decline in renewal bookings. The Company executed a total of 13 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $367 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company executed a total of 21 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $577 million. The weighted average duration of subscription and maintenance bookings for the quarter was 2.94 years, compared with 3.32 years for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nEXPENSES, MARGIN AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\n(dollars in millions) Third Quarter FY18 vs. FY17 FY18 FY17 %\nChange %\nChange\nCC**\nGAAP Operating Expenses Before Interest and Income Taxes $786 $699 12% 9% Operating Income Before Interest and Income Taxes $307 $308 0% 1% Diluted EPS ($0.23) $0.50 (146)% (146)% Operating Margin 28% 31% Effective Tax Rate 133.0% 28.8% Non-GAAP* Operating Expenses Before Interest and Income Taxes $683 $623 10% 7% Operating Income Before Interest and Income Taxes $410 $384 7% 6% Diluted EPS $0.75 $0.63 19% 16% Operating Margin 38% 38% Effective Tax Rate 18.4% 28.5% *Refer to the discussion of Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures included in the tables following this news release. **CC or Constant Currency is a non-GAAP financial measure, as noted in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables following this news release.\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses increased primarily due to costs from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions, which were mainly personnel-related. GAAP operating expenses were also affected by higher amortization expenses of purchased software from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions. GAAP income tax expense included a $318 million tax charge relating to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (“US Tax Reform”). This tax charge was comprised of $220 million related to the deemed US repatriation of earnings held by non-US subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, and $98 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $0.77 from the US Tax Reform adjustment. Non-GAAP income tax expense excluded the aforementioned tax charge relating to US Tax Reform. Non-GAAP EPS was positively impacted by $0.09 from a decrease in the non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is comprised of $0.05 related to a reduction in the statutory tax rate as a result of US Tax Reform and $0.04 related to other net discrete tax benefits realized.\nSELECTED HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE QUARTER\nAt CA World last November, the Company announced its most extensive list of products in recent company history, with more than 20 new offerings and enhancements designed to help customers leverage agile practices, intelligent automation, data insights and end-to-end security for better and faster business outcomes.\n* New offerings supporting business agility and modern architectures include:\nCA Microgateway , a lighter-weight, faster and easier to deploy API Gateway solution, suitable for microservices environments.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables following this news release. Mainframe Solutions revenue increased due to a favorable foreign exchange effect. Mainframe Solutions operating margin increased primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead costs. Enterprise Solutions revenue increased primarily due to revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions which contributed approximately 16 points of revenue growth for the quarter. Enterprise Solutions operating margin decreased primarily due to costs associated with our Automic and Veracode acquisitions, which were mainly personnel-related. Services revenue increased primarily due to professional services revenue generated from our Automic and Veracode acquisitions. Operating margin for Services increased primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs as a result of severance actions during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and, to a lesser extent, higher margins from services associated with our Automic and Veracode acquisitions.\nCASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS\nCash flow provided by operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $315 million, versus $517 million in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations decreased compared with the year-ago period due to a decrease in cash collections from billings attributable to lower single installment collections and an increase in vendor disbursements and payroll.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\n at December 31, 2017 were $2.971 billion. With $2.787 billion in total debt outstanding and $139 million in notional pooling, the Company’s net cash position was $45 million. Approximately 66% of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries outside the United States at December 31, 2017. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $53 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was authorized to purchase $507 million of its common stock under its current stock repurchase program. The Company distributed $106 million in dividends to stockholders during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company’s outstanding share count at December 31, 2017 was approximately 412 million.\nOUTLOOK FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018\nThe Company updated its fiscal 2018 outlook as described below. This guidance assumes no material acquisitions, and contains \" \" (as defined below).\nThe Company expects the following:*\nTotal revenue to increase approximately 5 percent as reported and approximately 4 percent in constant currency. At December 31, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.25 billion. Full-year GAAP operating margin between 26 percent and 27 percent. Full year non-GAAP operating margin between 36 percent and 37 percent. The Company also expects a full-year GAAP effective tax rate of between 55 percent and 58 percent and non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent. The change to the full-year GAAP effective tax rate primarily relates to US Tax Reform. The change to the non-GAAP effective tax rate primarily relates to the reduction in the statutory tax rate as a result of US Tax Reform and other net discrete tax benefits realized. Previous guidance was a full-year GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of between 28 percent and 29 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share to decrease in a range of 46 percent to 41 percent as reported and in constant currency. The change to the GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook primarily relates to the change to the full-year GAAP effective tax rate, as described above. Previous guidance was to decrease in a range of 8 percent to 5 percent as reported and in constant currency. At December 31, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.10. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to increase in a range of 2 percent to 5 percent as reported and in constant currency. The change to the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook primarily relates to the change to the non-GAAP effective tax rate, as described above. Previous guidance was to decrease in a range of 2 percent to flat as reported and in constant currency. At December 31, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.54 to $2.60. Approximately 412 million shares outstanding at fiscal 2018 year-end and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 415 million for fiscal 2018. Cash flow to increase in a range of 2 percent to 6 percent as reported and flat to 4 percent in constant currency. At December 31, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.10 billion to $1.15 billion.\n*In the outlook section, certain non-material differences between growth rates and translated dollar amounts may arise from impact of rounding.\nWebcast\nThis news release and the accompanying tables should be read in conjunction with additional content that is available on the Company’s website, including a supplemental financial package, as well as a conference call and webcast that the Company will host at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss its unaudited third quarter results.
