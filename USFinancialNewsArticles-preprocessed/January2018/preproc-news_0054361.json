    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 10:57 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Stuttgart prosecutor probes Bosch about Chrysler emissions role Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Stuttgart prosecutor’s office on Wednesday said two employees of auto supplier Robert Bosch were being probed on suspicion of aiding fraud, as part of a wider probe into Chrysler diesel emissions in the United States. \nTwo diesel-engined vehicles, the Chrysler Grand Cherokee 3.0 L and the Chrysler Dodge Ram 1500, which have been on sale in the United States since 2014, had shown signs of a “reduced effectiveness” of emissions control systems. \nThese two vehicles are subject to a “Notice of Violation” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Stuttgart prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Wednesday. \nBosch was not immediately available for comment.
