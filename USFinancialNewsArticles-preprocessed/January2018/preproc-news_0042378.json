    "text": "CHATSWORTH, Calif., Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hallmark Lighting , a leading provider of customized, high-end lighting solutions, primarily to the hospitality industry, today announced the hiring of Leslie Livingston as Vice President of International Sales. Livingston, who has deep experience in the hospitality industry, will lead the firm's expanded outreach to global markets. Livingston is the latest in a series of senior hires at the firm in recent months that also include Stephanie Weston, Vice President of Sales, who is responsible for the U.S. market.\nIn recent years, Hallmark Lighting has enjoyed growing demand driven by increasing recognition of its innovative lighting solutions, its highly competitive pricing and the superior craftsmanship provided by trained artisans in the U.S. Today, 98 percent of four- and five-star hotels use Hallmark Lighting products. Nearly all – 95 percent – of the top 100 designers and procurement firms work with Hallmark Lighting. The Lumin Collection by Hallmark Lighting, introduced yesterday, is expected to dramatically expand the company's reach by offering superior-quality stock products in addition to the company's customized lighting solutions.\n\"We have been aggressively investing in Hallmark Lighting's and Luminance's businesses, improving operations and recruiting talent at all levels,\" said Ron Cozean, executive chairman of both Hallmark Lighting and its sister company, Luminance and an operating executive at Resilience Capital Partners , which owns Hallmark Lighting and Luminance. \"We believe in investing patiently, finding companies that – with the right operating improvements, the right investments and the right talent – can compete on a world-class level. I'm confident that Leslie Livingston and Stephanie Weston can help Hallmark Lighting win new sales in a competitive marketplace.\"\nPrior to joining Hallmark Lighting, Livingston held senior positions with Global Views, a wholesale purveyor of furniture, decorative accessories and lighting. She most recently served as Director of Sales for the firm's Hospitality Division, where she increased international sales 34 percent in 2017. She previously served in increasingly important roles in the same division as National Sales Manager, Regional Sales Manager and Hospitality Sales Manager.\nEarlier, Livingston gained expertise in the hospitality industry as Director of Concierge Services for the W Dallas Victory Hotel and Residences. She also served as Director of Guest Services for the Ritz-Carlton Boston. Livingston is an alumna of the University of Colorado at Boulder, from which she earned a B.A. degree in political science.\nLivingston's hiring is the latest in a series of senior hires Hallmark Lighting has made in recent months. Among the others:\nStephanie Weston joined the team as Vice President of Sales. She has more than a decade of hospitality sales experience, creating strategic alliances to effectively align and support key revenue growth initiatives.

Camilo Acosta has been named Hallmark Lighting's new Operations Manager, overseeing the company's operations team on multiple levels. He has a quarter-century of lighting and manufacturing experience with companies such as Architecture Works and Interglobal, Inc. His experience includes working with Brad Senet, who founded Hallmark Lighting in 1978.\n\"Among Hallmark Lighting's top priorities is the acquisition of talent to take advantage of the increased demand and new market opportunities we are seeing,\" said Cozean. \"Our hiring of Leslie Livingston as Vice President of International Sales complements the hiring of Stephanie Weston as Vice President of Sales with responsibility for the U.S. market.
