It features more than 2,900 slots, 92 tables games, a 30-table poker room, nine distinctive restaurants and bars, a riverside amphitheater and a multi-purpose event center. Rivers employs approximately 1,700 Team Members and has been named “Best Overall Gaming Resort in Pennsylvania” for eight consecutive years by Casino Player magazine.\nAbout Rush Street Gaming\nFounded by Neil Bluhm and Greg Carlin, Rush Street Gaming and its affiliates have developed and operate successful casinos in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Des Plaines, IL (Chicago area) and Schenectady, NY.
