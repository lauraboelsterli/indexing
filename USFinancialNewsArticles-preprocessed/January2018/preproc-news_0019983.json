    "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - A pro-government member of Venezuela’s controversial legislative superbody was shot and killed in the west of the country by two assailants riding a motorcycle, authorities said on Thursday.\nLawyer Tomas Lucena, 31, was in his pickup truck with relatives on Wednesday afternoon when he was shot several times. He died in a hospital in Trujillo state, the public prosecutor’s office said in a statement.\nA relative unknown in Venezuelan politics, Lucena was a member of the 545-strong ‘Constituent Assembly’ created last year by socialist President Nicolas Maduro in a move widely condemned by Western powers and fellow Latin American nations.\nSpeaking during an hours-long televised broadcast, Maduro alleged that Lucena, a father of three young children, had been targeted for political reasons.\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (2nd L) speaks during a meeting with ministers in Caracas, Venezuela January 11, 2018. Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS “(He was) killed by right-wing hit men,” Maduro said.\n“Violence here, violence there... directed by the embassy of the United States,” he added, without offering any evidence.\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCritics say Maduro routinely uses Washington as a scapegoat for the OPEC member’s political and economic meltdown.\nVenezuela has one of the world’s highest murder rates, while a fourth straight year of recession has deprived millions of three square meals a day.\nReporting by Alexandra Ulmer and Corina Pons; Editing by Daniel Wallis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
