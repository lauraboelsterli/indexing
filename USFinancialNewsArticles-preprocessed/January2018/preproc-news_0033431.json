    "text": " 15 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Sri Lanka rupee ends down on importer dollar demand in dull trade Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee closed slightly weaker on Thursday as importer dollar demand surpassed mild greenback sales by exporters in dull trade, dealers said. \nThe spot rupee ended at 153.85/95, compared with Wednesday’s close of 153.75/95. \n“It was a dull day. Remittances were quite dull and the imports were not that significant,” said a currency dealer. \nThe rupee might witness volatility with the government’s heavy debt repayment this year, said dealers. \nSri Lanka aims to raise $500 million this month via development bonds, the central bank said last week, as the government faces unprecedented debt repayment this year. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisenea’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans, and a total of $5.36 billion of interest. \nThe currency fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nThe central bank, while announcing its key economic policies for the year on Jan. 3, said it has allowed more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on the present market conditions. \nIt added intervention policies will be adopted consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime and supportive of improving foreign exchange market functionality, and maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be an important objective.
