    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 12:42 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago EU confirms new sanctions on seven senior Venezuela officials Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday announced new sanctions on seven senior Venezuelan officials, saying this was an expression of the bloc’s concern with the political crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. \nReuters reported last week the EU would make the move, which introduces a travel ban and an asset freeze on people in charge of security forces accused of widespread abuses, particularly during the 2017 anti-government protests. Slideshow (2 Images) \nWhile the EU already has an arms embargo in place on Venezuela, it has not considered imposing an oil embargo or blacklisting Maduro himself. \nOil and related products make up three quarters of Venezuela’s exports to the EU. The country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves but suffers inflation and food shortages. \nFor a list of the officials sanctioned on Monday, please go to: here .pdf%23page Writing by Gabriela Baczynska, Editing by William Maclean",
