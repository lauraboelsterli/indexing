    "text": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator on Friday said it would begin reviewing of the sale of Reckon Ltdâ€™s accounting practice management software business to MYOB Group which was announced in November last year.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a statement it would accept comments from third parties on the acquisition until Feb. 1, 2018.\nIn November, accounting software provider Reckon said it would sell the business for A$180 million ($141.86 million). MYOB had said separately that it would acquire all clients, intellectual property, systems and processes, and take in all employees of the Reckon accounting practice software business.
