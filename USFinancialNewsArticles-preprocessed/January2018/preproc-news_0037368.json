    "text": "January 21, 2018 / 1:07 PM / in 14 minutes Scandal-hit Thai temple helps to stage mass Buddhist event in Myanmar Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMANDALAY, Myanmar (Reuters) - Thousands of Buddhist monks gathered in Myanmar’s second largest city on Sunday for an event partly organized by a scandal-hit Thai temple whose abbot is wanted for questioning on money-laundering allegations. \nThe Dhammakaya temple’s foundation helped organize the mass alms-giving for an estimated 20,000 monks on the runway of an abandoned airport in central Mandalay. \nThailand’s largest and wealthiest temple, Dhammakaya has staged similar spectacles at its vast complex north of Bangkok, which police besieged last year in a fruitless search for its fugitive abbot. \nThe Mandalay event aimed to “tighten the relationship between both Myanmar and Thailand (and) unite the Theravada monkhood” in the region, according to a Dhammakaya Foundation press release. \nMyanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka are predominantly Buddhist countries which follow the religion’s Theravada branch. \nIn Mandalay, a center for Buddhist learning crowded with temples and monasteries, monks in burgundy or orange began filing barefoot into the old airport before dawn. \nAlmost all the monks at the ceremony were from Myanmar and there were also thousands of local lay people attending along with about 100 monks and other Buddhists from Thailand and Sri Lanka, according to Dhammakaya temple. \nMandalay is home to the monk Wirathu, the self-styled “Buddhist bin Laden” famous for his anti-Islamic sermons, but there was no sign that he attended the mass alms-giving.

REUTERS/Ann Wang \n“It’s such a wonderful ceremony. I live in Mandalay, and it’s never happened like this before,” said Ven Ya Ma, 40, who led a group of about 30 monks from the city’s Ma Soe Yein monastery. \nVen Ya Ma opposed the actions of the Thai police against the Dhammakaya temple, which he said was only promoting Buddhism worldwide.

His whereabouts are unknown. \nDhammakaya claims millions of followers in Thailand and around the world, and in recent years has forged closer ties with Myanmar’s Buddhists. \nWirathu is a leading light in Ma Ba Tha, a religious group accused of whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment in Myanmar. \nA brutal military crackdown in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, has driven about 650,000 Rohingya Muslims over the border into Bangladesh since August.
