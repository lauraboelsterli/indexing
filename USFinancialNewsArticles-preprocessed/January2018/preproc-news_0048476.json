It reported a loss of $23 million on revenue of $307.2 million for the first nine months of 2017, its filing said. \nHigher oil prices - U.S. crude futures have traded above $60 per barrel throughout January - are helping boost demand for drilling and other services and creating an opening for services firms to tap investor interest. \nPressure pumper Liberty Oilfield Services in mid-January was the first oilfield service firm to go public this year, following a drought of IPOs in the second half of 2017. Since that offering, rival Nine Energy Service has also gone public, and last week FTS International firmed up plans to raise $250 million through a public offering. \nShares of Liberty Oilfield Services were trading around $22.50 on Monday, above its initial offering price of $17 per share. Nine Energy Service was trading $25.70, about 11 percent over its initial price of $23 a share. Reporting by Liz Hampton Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
