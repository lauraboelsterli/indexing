    "text": "Evan Fournier scored a career-high 32 points as the Orlando Magic stunned the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-102 Tuesday night at the Amway Center in Orlando.\nFournier hit 6 3-pointers and D.J. Augustin had 11 points in the fourth quarter as Orlando snapped a seven-game losing streak and won for only the second time in its last 18 games.\nJimmy Butler scored 28 points for Minnesota, which saw a five-game winning streak snapped in surprising fashion.\nAugustin keyed a big fourth quarter for the Magic, who won only their fifth game since getting out to an 8-4 start. Augustin hit a 3-pointer at the 4:07 mark of the fourth quarter and later made three straight free throws after he was fouled attempting another triple to extend Orlandoâ€™s lead to 101-92.\nBut Tuesday was all about Fournier, who broke the 30-point barrier for only the third time in his career. Fournier, who entered averaging a career-best 17.6 points per game this season, made up for an off-night by teammate Aaron Gordon. Fournier made 12 of 22 shots, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range. The sixth-year guard scored 15 in the third quarter to keep Orlando within two points of Minnesota, which entered tied for the third-best record in the Western Conference.\nBismack Biyombo and Khem Birch also played a big role in the Magic upset as they combined for 26 rebounds. Orlando outrebounded the Timberwolves 51-37. Biyombo finished with 10 points and five blocked shots.\nGordon finished with 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting and added seven rebounds. Augustin had 18 points, six rebounds and six assists in the victory. He keyed a Magic bench that outscored Minnesota 42-19.\nKarl-Anthony Towns finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds in the loss. Taj Gibson had 18 points and seven rebounds for Minnesota, which only got nine points from Andrew Wiggins in 34 minutes of action.\nJeff Teague scored 13 in the losing effort.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
