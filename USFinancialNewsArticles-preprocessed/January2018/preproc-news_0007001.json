    "text": "DETROIT, Jan. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Geometric Results, Inc. (GRI), a portfolio company of Bain Capital Private Equity and wholly owned subsidiary of MSX International (MSXI), is pleased to announce it has finalized an agreement to acquire the de Poel group of companies. De Poel is the UK's leading Managed Service Provider (MSP) for the purchase of non-employee workers.\nCurrently serving more than 120 private and public-sector clients, de Poel provides vendor-neutral MSP programs supported by its own unique technology platform. The company's experienced management team focuses on helping clients realize the benefits of outsourcing while coordinating with more than 1,500 recruitment agencies weekly.\nBy combining with de Poel, GRI is positioned to provide MSP services to an even broader array of industries such as automotive, technology, oil and gas, health care, retail and education.\n\"Together, GRI and de Poel are the world's largest independent MSP provider. De Poel's commitment to operate as a vendor-neutral MSP mirrors GRI's service offering,\" said Art Knapp, President of GRI. \"Since neither company is affiliated with a staffing firm, each creates individualized, strategic solutions for every client. Merging de Poel and GRI creates a leading global extended workforce solutions provider with a strong U.S. and European presence.\"\n\"Partnering with a vendor neutral, independent partner is a highly-effective outsourcing strategy for our clients,\" said Andrew Preston, de Poel's president. \"This is why so many household names in the UK choose to trust the management of their non-employee workforce to us. We are very excited to join with GRI. The acquisition will allow us to move more quickly to broaden the scope of our services for our existing and future clients.\"\n\"We are pleased to welcome the de Poel organization to our portfolio. The immediate benefits to GRI will be to increase our geographic diversity, branch out into more industry sectors, and broaden our customer base,\" said Charles Megaw, Operating Partner at Bain Capital Private Equity. \"When completed in late January 2018, de Poel will be our first acquisition following the purchase of MSXI a year ago, fulfilling our commitment to organic growth and strategic investments.\"\nContact:\nJill E.
