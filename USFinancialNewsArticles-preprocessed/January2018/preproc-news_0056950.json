(Nasdaq: SGEN) today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of $550.0 million of shares of its common stock. All of the shares are being offered by Seattle Genetics. In addition, Seattle Genetics expects to grant the underwriters of the offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $82.5 million of shares of its common stock solely to cover over-allotments at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering will be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering.\nSeattle Genetics anticipates using the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the costs of the acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc. In the event that Seattle Genetics does not consummate such acquisition, Seattle Genetics expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for the ongoing commercialization of ADCETRIS ® (brentuximab vedotin) in the United States and Canada, its research and development efforts designed to further expand the ADCETRIS label and the advancement of its pipeline of product candidates, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\nBarclays Capital Inc. and J.P.
