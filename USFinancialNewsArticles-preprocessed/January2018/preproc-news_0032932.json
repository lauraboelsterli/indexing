    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said President Donald Trump does support a bill the House is set to vote on Thursday to provide a short-term extension of government funding.\n“I spoke with the president. He fully supports passing what we’re bringing to the floor today,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters.\nQuestions about Trump’s support arose earlier on Thursday after the president posted a tweet that said a children’s healthcare provision in the legislation should be part of a long-term solution not a short-term bill.\nReporting by Susan Cornwell and Makini Brice; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
