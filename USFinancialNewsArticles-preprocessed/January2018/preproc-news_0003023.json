    "text": "US weekly jobless claims up 250,000, vs 240,000 expected Published 7 Hours Ago SHARES Getty Images A 'now hiring' sign is posted outside of a Ross Dress for Less store in San Francisco. \nThe number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose for a third straight week last week, but that likely does not suggest a material shift in labor market conditions as data for several states, including California, were estimated. \nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 250,000 for the week ended Dec. 30, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 240,000 in the latest week. Claims tend to be volatile around holidays.",
