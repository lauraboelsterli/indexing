    "text": "MIAMI, Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Miami-based United Blockchain Corp a wholly owned subsidiary United American Corp (\"UnitedCorp\"), (OTC:UAMA) announced today that it has acquired its first data center facility in the Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec Canada which it will operate through a newly created mining division; Blockchain Data Centers Inc.\nThe leased facility which has capacity for 50 mining rigs is fully built out and will be ready to start hosting GPU-based mining servers within the following weeks. UnitedCorp recently completed experimental testing on its own custom designed and built, 13 GPU-based Ethereum mining rig, and successfully completed a full 30 day uninterrupted hashing rate of 400 Mega Hash per second (400 MHash/s) in precise over clock calibration.\nThe total amount of Ether (Ethereum or ETH) tokens mined using an independent third party mining pool, was 2 ETHER TOKENS over a 31 continuous days with current Ethereum network difficulty during the period of November 21 to December 22, 2017. The total revenue in USD is estimated at US$2,225 based on the current value of an ETH.\nThe power draw of the rig was on average 1,492 watts or 1.492 kW/h resulting in an estimated cost of electricity of approximately US$50 per month based on undiscounted power rates. The total cost of each rig including assembly is estimated at US$8,000 and the company is currently evaluating options for the financing of a suite of rigs for the facility.\nAbout United American Corp\nEstablished in 1992, United American Corp is a Florida-based development and management company focusing on telecommunications technologies.
