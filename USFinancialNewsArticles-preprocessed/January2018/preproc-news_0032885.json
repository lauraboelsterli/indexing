    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF) today announced fourth quarter 2017 net earnings of $385 million, or $0.49 per diluted share including the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) of 2017, and $545 million, or $0.70 per diluted share excluding $160 million of additional tax expense related to the impact from the Tax Act. Highlights for the quarter included:\nNet interest income increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $3.9 billion Loan receivables grew $6 billion, or 7%, from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $82 billion Purchase volume increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $37 billion Deposits grew over $4 billion, or 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $56 billion Announced agreement to significantly expand strategic consumer credit relationship with PayPal, acquiring PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio and becoming the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program; expected to close in the third quarter of 2018 Renewed relationships: Men’s Wearhouse, Home Furnishings Association, Husqvarna Viking, Sweetwater, Bosley, and Sono Bello Quarterly common stock dividend payment of $0.15 per share and repurchased $430 million of Synchrony Financial common stock The Tax Act resulted in $160 million of additional tax expense primarily due to the Tax Act’s reduction in the corporate tax rate that resulted in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset\n“Substantial progress was made on our strategic priorities not only in the fourth quarter, but throughout 2017. Our business continues to deliver organic growth, leveraging innovative marketing, promotions, and value propositions. We are making investments in our robust data, analytics and digital capabilities, further enhancing the experience of our partners and cardholders. And we are supporting our business with continued growth in our direct deposit platform. We accomplished all of this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders through growth and the execution of our capital plan,” said Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer of Synchrony Financial. “Synchrony Financial continues to be well positioned for long-term growth and we look forward to driving further value for our partners, cardholders, and shareholders in 2018.”\nBusiness and Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nAll comparisons below are for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, unless otherwise noted.\nEarnings\nNet interest income increased $288 million, or 8%, to $3.9 billion, primarily driven by strong loan receivables growth. Net interest income after retailer share arrangements increased 11%. Provision for loan losses increased $278 million to $1.4 billion primarily driven by credit normalization. Other income was down $23 million to $62 million, primarily due to higher loyalty program expense, partially offset by higher interchange revenue. Other expense increased $52 million, or 6%, to $970 million, primarily driven by growth and marketing. Net earnings totaled $385 million including the impact from the Tax Act that resulted in $160 million of additional tax expense primarily due to the Tax Act’s reduction in the corporate tax rate that resulted in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset; excluding this impact of the Tax Act, net earnings totaled $545 million compared to $576 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nPeriod-end loan receivables growth remained strong at 7%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 3% and average active account growth of 4%. Deposits grew to $56 billion, up $4 billion, or 9%, and comprised 73% of funding compared to 72% last year. The Company’s balance sheet remained strong with total liquidity (liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities) of $21 billion, or 22% of total assets. The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III subject to transition provisions was 16.0% and the estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was 15.8%.\nKey Financial Metrics\nReturn on assets was 1.6% and return on equity was 10.5%, including the impact from the Tax Act; excluding the impact of the Tax Act, return on assets was 2.3% and return on equity was 14.9%. Net interest margin was 16.24% compared to 16.26% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Efficiency ratio was 30.3%, compared to 31.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The efficiency ratio for 2017 was 30.3%, compared to 31.1% in 2016. The improvement in both the fourth quarter and full-year efficiency ratio reflected the strong operating leverage generated by the business.\nCredit Quality\nLoans 30+ days past due as a percentage of total period-end loan receivables were 4.67% compared to 4.32% last year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loan receivables were 5.78% compared to 4.65% last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loan receivables was 6.80% compared to 5.69% last year.\nSales Platforms\nRetail Card interest and fees on loans increased 8%, driven primarily by period-end loan receivables growth of 7%. Purchase volume and average active account growth was 3%. Loan receivables growth was broad-based across partner programs. Payment Solutions interest and fees on loans increased 10%, driven primarily by period-end loan receivables growth of 8%. Purchase volume growth was 9%, adjusted to exclude the impact from the hhgregg bankruptcy, and average active account growth was 7%. Loan receivables growth was led by home furnishing and automotive. CareCredit interest and fees on loans increased 8%, driven primarily by period-end loan receivables growth of 10%. Purchase volume and average active account growth was 8%.
