    "text": "Airbnb SHARES \nDuring a stop on John Legend's Darkness and Light tour, Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen kicked back in a private mansion in Shawnee, Kansas and of course, they shared the experience on Instagram. \nLegend posted a video of himself, Teigen and their daughter, Luna, relaxing on an outdoor swing the size of a bed. \"Thanks to the good people at @Airbnb for gifting me and my family a home away from home on tour!\" he captioned it. \"So nice to have a kitchen, a backyard, and a swinging patio couch!\" \nThough Teigen and Legend's trip last summer was on the house from Airbnb, the space, which sleeps seven, according to the listing, is available for anyone to rent â€” if you can afford the $10,000-a-night price tag. \nHere's a look inside. \nThe entryway opens into a chic living space, complete with high ceilings, a fireplace and a cozy sitting area. Airbnb \nA glass-paneled wall slides away to create an indoor/outdoor living room, allowing fresh air to breeze through the house. Airbnb \nThe open kitchen has the requisite stainless steel appliances, ample counter space and a breakfast nook that overlooks the lush backyard. Airbnb \nThe estate has five bedrooms, two of which are furnished with king-sized beds. Airbnb \nHis and hers vanities make the master feel more like a private spa than a bathroom. Airbnb \nIndoor amenities include a home office, craft room and billiards table. Airbnb \nBut the resort-like backyard is the highlight of the property. Guests can spend days lounging in the sun beside the pool and nights curled up next to the firepit. Airbnb \nAn outdoor kitchen makes it entertaining easy. Airbnb \nAt night the backyard twinkles, showing off the impeccable landscaping even after the sun has set. It sure won't feel like you're in Kansas anymore. Airbnb ",
