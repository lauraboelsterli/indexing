    "text": "Expands Services into the Medical and Pharmaceutical Waste Sector\nATLANTA, GA, Meridian Waste Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRDN) (“Meridian” or the “Company”), an integrated, non-hazardous solid waste services and innovative technology company, today announced the closing of the acquisition of RedX Medical, LLC (d/b/a EnviCare). The transaction expands Meridian’s services into the medical and pharmaceutical waste sector.\nEnviCare is a regulated medical waste company which will provide waste transportation and disposal solutions for regulated and specialized waste, pharmaceutical disposal solutions, sharpes management services, controlled substance waste solutions, integrated waste solutions for large healthcare facilities, and compliance training and education for the healthcare industry. EnviCare is based in the Atlanta area with the ability to service the Southeast, and expects to expand to cover the entire United States.\nThe acquisition of EnviCare builds upon Meridian’s healthcare footprint, established by the acquisition of four companies in 2017.
