    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Nearly 1,500 people have been evacuated from homes in the Paris region, with authorities on alert for any major flood risk after the levels of the swollen River Seine rose further on Sunday.\nMichel Delpuech, head of the Paris police body, told reporters that around 1,500 people had been moved out of homes in the Ile de France region comprising the French capital and its suburbs.\n“The waters will only go away slowly,” added Delpuech.\nA ticket booth for sightseeing boats is partly submerged by the River Seine after days of almost non-stop rain caused flooding in the country, in Paris, France January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Mal Langsdon The Seine’s waters were set to peak later on Sunday or early on Monday close to levels which led to similar flooding in 2016, authorities said.\nThe overflowing waters have already engulfed riverside walkways in Paris and led the world-famous Louvre museum to close a basement display of Islamic art. [nL8N1PJ4N4]\nParis’s “Bateaux Mouches” tourist boats have been shut down due to the high waters while swans have been seen swimming where there are usually pavements and rats forced up onto the streets.\nFlooding caused destruction in Paris in 1910 when the Seine rose by 8.65 meters, although no deaths were recorded there.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Pascale Antonie; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
