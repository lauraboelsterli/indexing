Slideshow (9 Images) \nThe players traded breaks early in the deciding set but the 22-year-old Kontaveit outlasted her opponent in marathon seventh game, thumping a weak second serve for a backhand winner on her fifth break point to seize the advantage again. \nAfter holding serve, 32nd seed Kontaveit sealed victory when an Ostapenko forehand thumped into the net. \nHer reward is a fourth round tie against unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro who got the better of Kaia Kanepi in three sets.
