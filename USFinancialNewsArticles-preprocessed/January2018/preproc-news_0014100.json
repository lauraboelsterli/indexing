    "text": "VANCOUVER, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Nevsun Resources Ltd . (TSX:NSU) (NYSE American:NSU) (\"Nevsun\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report its 2017 fourth quarter and full year production results (100% basis) for the Bisha Mine in Eritrea for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nBisha Full Year 2017 Operating Highlights\nProduced 207.8 million pounds of zinc in zinc concentrate, at the top end of its guidance of 190-210 million pounds Produced 18.0 million pounds of copper in copper concentrate, below guidance of 20-30 million pounds Produced 55.1 million pounds of zinc in Q4 2017 as zinc recoveries continued to improve in H2 2017 from H1 2017 Moved a record 5.3 million tonnes of material in Q4 2017\nPeter Kukielski, Nevsun CEO, commented, \"We continued to see positive results from our primary ore metallurgy improvement program in the second half of 2017 with zinc recoveries now consistently around 70%. A specialist contractor was brought in to oversee heavy mining equipment maintenance, which resulted in improved equipment availability and allowed Bisha to move a record amount of waste in Q4. This completed the necessary catch up on stripping of the Bisha pit to allow the mine to access and process 100% fresh primary ore in 2018.\"\nMr. Kukielski continued, \"We look forward to providing the market with our 2018 outlook for both Bisha and Timok later this month.\"\nPreliminary Q4 2017 and full year 2017 operating results are summarized below:\nMining\nQ4 2017\nFull Year 2017\nOre mined, tonnes\n362,000\n2,050,000\nWaste mined, tonnes\n4,981,000\n15,960,000\nStrip Ratio (using tonnes)\n13.8\n7.8\nProcessing\nQ4 2017\nFull Year 2017\nOre milled, tonnes\n520,000\n2,233,000\nZinc feed grade, %\n6.9%\n6.2%\nCopper feed grade, %\n1.2%\n1.0%\nRecovery, % of zinc\n69.3%\n68.2%\nRecovery, % of copper\n31.0%\n37.0%\nZinc in concentrate produced, tonnes\n24,700\n94,000\nZinc in concentrate produced, millions of pounds\n55.1\n207.8\nCopper in concentrate produced, tonnes\n1,700\n8,000\nCopper in concentrate produced, millions of pounds\n4.1\n18.0\nCopper production in Q4 was, as in Q3, impacted by processing of stockpiled zinc-only ore (previously described as \"boundary\" material). Zinc-only ore does not result in any recovery of copper into copper concentrate. Zinc-only ore was processed due to a shortage of fresh primary ore in the Bisha Main pit in H2 2017.\nDuring the quarter, stripping levels increased to 5.0 million tonnes from an average of 3.7 million tonnes per quarter over the previous three quarters. Waste stripping benefitted from shorter haulage distances due to in-pit waste dumping and from improved heavy mining equipment availability due to the employment of an experienced third-party in overseeing maintenance. Mining benches, walls and faces in the Bisha main pit continued to be re-established to improve mining efficiency with the goal of accessing 100% fresh primary ore in 2018.\nThe majority of new mining equipment announced in Q3 2017 and purchased in Q4 2017 will arrive on site during H1 2018. This equipment will replace aging equipment on site, improving mechanical availabilities which, along with continued in-pit dumping of waste, will assist the mine in meeting its planned material movement for the upcoming year.\nNevsun expects to release its 2018 outlook and production guidance later in January.\n2017 Financial Results Release Date\nNevsun plans to release its annual 2017 and fourth quarter 2017 financial results on Thursday, March 1, 2018, after close of trading, with a conference call to follow on Friday, March 2, 2018 at 8am Vancouver / 11am Toronto, New York / 4pm London. Conference call details follow:\nNorth America: 1 888-390-0546 / +1 416-764-8688 / +1 778-383-7413\nUK: 0800 652 2435 (toll free)\nOther International: +1 416-764-8688 / +1 778-383-7413The conference call will be available for replay until March 9, 2018, by calling 1 888-390-0541 / +1 416-764-8677 and entering passcode 946987#.\nAbout Nevsun Resources Ltd.\nNevsun Resources Ltd. is the 100% owner of the high-grade copper-gold Timok Upper Zone and 60.4% owner of the Timok Lower Zone in Serbia. The Timok Lower Zone is a partnership with Freeport-McMoRan Exploration Corporation (\"Freeport\") which currently owns 39.6% and upon completion of any feasibility study, Nevsun Resources Ltd. will own 46% and Freeport will own 54%. Nevsun generates cash flow from its 60% owned copper-zinc Bisha Mine in Eritrea. Nevsun is well positioned with a strong debt-free balance sheet to grow shareholder value through advancing Timok to production.\nForward Looking Statements\nThe above contains forward-looking statements or forward-looking information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and applicable Canadian securities laws.
