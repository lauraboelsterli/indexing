    "text": " 30 PM / a few seconds ago Tupperware's quarterly profit beats estimates   \n(Reuters) - Tupperware Brands Corp ( TUP.N ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as strong demand for its storage containers in Latin America helped counter weakness in Europe and India. \nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 for the fourth quarter, beating analystsâ€™ average estimate of $1.50, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nSales fell 2 percent to $588.6 million. \nTupperware posted a net loss of $326.5 million, or $6.41 per share, largely due to a $375 million charge related to changes in the U.S. tax code. \nThe company reported a net income of $79 million, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier.
