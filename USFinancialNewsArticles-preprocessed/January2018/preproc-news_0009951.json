The Company cited the significant cost, limited benefit and very limited trading of its stock as some of its reasons in taking this step.\nAs an alternative reporting Company, MobiCard Inc. plans to file unaudited financials along with various disclosures directly through www.otcmarkets.com .\nThe Company has submitted its application on 1/8/18 to OTC Markets and was informed that the application to OTC Markets may take 5-10 days to be effective.\nThe Company intends to file directly with OTC Markets soon after the application is approved. The Company has also retained the auditing firm BF Borgers CPA PC to conduct a full 2-year audit as the Company plans to take the appropriate steps necessary to re-register its securities with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company cited that the circumstances for deregistration that were associated with costs and limited trading in its common stock are now non factors.\nAbout MobiCard Inc:\nMobiCard Inc. fka Peer to Peer Network (\"PTOP\") owns and markets its core technology, a SaaS mobile solution branded C2A MobiCard, a scalable mobile business card software platform that enables users to create a customized web based personalized mobile app that is sharable by text sms, email, digital and social media.
