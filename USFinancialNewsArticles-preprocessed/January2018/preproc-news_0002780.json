    "text": "December 31, 2017 / 9:57 PM / Updated 17 hours ago France's Macron vows to keep up pace of reforms Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron vowed on Sunday to rapidly push through economic and political changes in France over the coming months and said he would seek to jolt Europe into reforming too. \nThe televised New Year’s speech was the 40-year-old president’s first year-end address following his electoral victory in May. Macron made clear he would tackle even potentially thorny domestic issues, like a new immigration law. \nMacron, who left political rivals reeling when he won power barely a year after launching a new centrist movement, has already rattled his way through an overhaul of French labor rules, in spite of street protests and a pushback from unions. \n“I will ensure all voices, including contrary ones, are heard. But all the same, I will not stop acting,” Macron said, seated a marble table in his office at the Elysee Palace. The formula of the speech was largely in keeping with the one favored by many of his predecessors, despite speculation Macron would seek to shake up France’s New Year presidential rite of passage too. \nWith parties to his left and right divided or scrambling to regroup under new leaders, Macron will benefit from a window of opportunity at home to push through more reforms in 2018 as the opposition flounders, analysts say. \nMacron’s popularity ratings have recently recovered from a slump as he tries to carve out an international profile and starts delivering on campaign pledges. \nBut his next steps also carry risks as he seeks changes that could spawn more of a popular backlash than he has previously faced, including a proposed overhaul of unemployment benefits which aims to tighten conditions for these subsidies.

REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier \nDetractors have labeled the former investment banker the “president of the rich”, and he also faces the challenge of maintaining a grip over his young party. \nThe French government plans changes in 2018 to immigration laws that have sown unease even among some members of Macron’s Republic on the Move (LREM) movement. They include a tougher line on deporting migrants who have been refused asylum.
