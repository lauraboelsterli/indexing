FILE PHOTO: Intel's logo is pictured during preparations at the CeBit computer fair, which will open its doors to the public on March 20, at the fairground in Hanover, Germany, March 19, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo \nIntelâ€™s shares fell as much as 5 percent to $43 in heavy early morning trading, their worst day since Oct. 19, 2016. They closed down 3.4 percent on Wednesday. \nSecurity researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device that uses chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.
