    "text": "ALPINE, Utah and NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Global Partner Acquisition Corp. (\"GPAC\") (NASDAQ: GPAC, GPACU, GPACW) and Purple Innovation, LLC (\"Purple\") today announced that GPAC has entered into a definitive agreement with a consortium of investors who have agreed to acquire an aggregate of $25 million of shares of common stock of GPAC through open market purchases, private purchases and private placements. In connection with these investments, Global Partner Sponsor I LLC, the sponsor of GPAC (the \"Sponsor\"), has agreed to assign to the investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 warrants that were issued to the Sponsor in a private placement in August 2015. GPAC is currently engaged in discussions with other investors in connection with additional investments of up to $65 million. Any such additional investments will be subject to the execution and delivery of definitive agreements.\nGPAC will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the \"Special Meeting\") on Friday, February 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at which GPAC's stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the previously announced merger of a subsidiary of GPAC with and into Purple, with Purple surviving such merger, and related proposals. The record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting was January 10, 2018. GPAC and Purple anticipate completing the proposed business combination following the Special Meeting on February 2, 2018. Upon the completion of the proposed business combination, GPAC will change its corporate name to Purple Innovation, Inc.\nAbout Purple\nPurple is a leading comfort technology company with a vision to improve how people sleep, sit and stand.
