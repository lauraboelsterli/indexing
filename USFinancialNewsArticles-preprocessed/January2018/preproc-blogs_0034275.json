He squandered it away on a string of expensive and often eccentric purchases, eventually facing foreclosure on several properties and owing the IRS $6.3 million in property taxes. \nNow worth around $25 million, Cage is taking roles left and right to help pay off his debts. \nAs chronicled in CNBC's \" The Filthy Rich Guide ,\" here's a glimpse at some of Cage's craziest purchases. \nCage once owned 15 residences , including a $25 million waterfront home in Newport Beach, California, a $15.7 million countryside estate in Newport, Rhode Island, and an $8.5 million abode in Las Vegas, pictured below. Bloomberg | Getty Images The master bedroom of a luxury home previously owned by actor Nicolas Cage is seen in Las Vegas, Nevada. \nHe also purchased, for $3.4 million, the infamous LaLaurie mansion in New Orleans, known as one of the most haunted houses in America. Alamy \nOver in Europe, Cage purchased not one but two castles for $10 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Getty Images : Alamy \n$3 million got him a deserted island in the Bahamas.

Crankhandle \n... and another $150,000 on a pet octopus. Getty Images \nHe spent yet another $150,000 on the first Superman comic. The Independent UK “Action Comics No. 1,″ created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, was first published in June 1938. \nAllegedly, Cage also once outbid fellow actor Leonardo DiCaprio for a 7-million-year-old dinosaur skull. The $276,000 artifact turned out to be stolen, however, and Cage had to return it to the Mongolian government.
