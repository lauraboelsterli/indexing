    "text": "Trump signs order disbanding voter fraud commission President Donald Trump signed an executive order disbanding his voter fraud commission A White House statement blamed the decision on some states that refused to provide voter information Past studies have found voter fraud to be exceptionally rare Published 10 Hours Ago Donald Trump \nPresident Donald Trump has signed an executive order disbanding his voter fraud commission. \nA White House statement is blaming the decision on numerous states that have refused to provide voter information to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders says that, \"Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense,\" Trump has signed an order to dissolve the commission and asked the Department of Homeland Security to determine the administration's next steps. \nCritics saw the commission as part of a conservative campaign to strip minority voters and poor people from the voter rolls, and to justify unfounded claims made by Trump that voter fraud cost him the popular vote in 2016. \nPast studies have found voter fraud to be exceptionally rare.
