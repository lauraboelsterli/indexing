( bit.ly/2p2d20I ) \nSome bank branch customers were seeing duplicate postings for debit card transactions, the company said in an email to Reuters. \nIt was not immediately clear how many people had been affected. \nCapital One said customers would not be responsible for fees due to the issue, and could continue to access their accounts and services through its online banking services, ATMs, mobile app and branches.
