    "text": "SEOUL, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries Co Ltd said on Monday it has agreed to sell a semi-submersible drilling rig for $500 million to an unidentified European company.\nThe world’s third-largest shipbuilder by orderbook said Sweden’s Stena, which originally ordered the drilling rig, had cancelled the order last year.\nLast week, Samsung Heavy agreed to sell the rig to a European third party, resolving the risk of non-payment, the firm said in a regulatory filing.
