Not this year. \nAs techies swarm Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, the world's biggest internet company is squarely out to capture their attention. It's created a giant \"playground\" in the parking lot of one of the convention centers, complete with a slide and a faux gumball machine. \nThe words \"Hey Google\" — used by consumers to ask questions of the voice-powered Google Assistant — are plastered on multiple casinos as well as the monorail that whisks attendees between conferences halls. CNBC A gigantic gumball machine as part of Google's display at the 2018 CES. \nGoogle isn't explicitly saying it, but the company is spending all this promotional money in an aggressive push to take on a single rival: Amazon. \nOn Monday, Google announced a slew of new products and updates for Assistant, its artificial intelligence software that lives on a range of devices like Home smart speakers. \nGoogle debuted partnerships with JBL, Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch new, Assistant-powered \"smart displays\" equipped with front-facing cameras that will let users watch media and make video calls, similar to Amazon's Echo Show. \nSince Amazon launched the $230 Show last spring, both Google and Facebook have reportedly been working on their own versions. It now appears that Google will be leaving the hardware production to partners, at least at first. \nGoogle also announced that it will start referring to Assistant's capabilities as \"Actions,\" akin to how Amazon has \"Skills\" for Alexa. \nThey're not perfectly analogous. Google's Actions include asking your Assistant for directions using Maps, as well as features enabled through third parties, while Amazon's Skills only refer to Alexa voice apps built by third-party developers. \nAmazon recently said that Alexa has over 30,000 Skills while Google just announced that Assistant can perform more than 1 million \"Actions.\" Users can search for Actions via a newly launched directory page. \nIf you've been following the news blasting out of CES at all, then you've probably noticed the trend -- companies are building smart assistants into everything, including ovens and refrigerators , countless new headphones and speakers, and cars. \nGoogle said on Monday that new partners will be launching Assistant-optimized headphones this year and that Assistant is coming to the more than 400 car models that already run its Android Auto operating system. Meanwhile, Panasonic announced this morning that, alongside Assistant, it was launching Alexa Onboard, which lets users interact with Alexa in their cars, even when there is no network connection. #Google going all out to promote its AI personal assistant at #CES2018 .

According to the latest CIRP estimates, Amazon's Echo products controlled 76 percent market of the U.S. home smart speaker market compared with 24 percent for Google's Home devices. \nFor the next few days, the two companies are taking their battle for the living room to the CES showroom.
