    "text": "Mark Neuling | CNBC Nick Woodman, GoPro Founder and CEO \nGoPro just announced that it has a new reason for its customers to sign up for its $4.99 monthly GoPro Plus plan: A free camera replacement. \nPeople who sign up for the service will now get a free new camera if they ever break their current one, \"no questions asked.\" \nThe service also includes unlimited photo storage and 35 hours of cloud video storage, as well as features like 20 percent off of GoPro accessories, premium support and cloud uploads. \nGoPro said cloud backup will be available for iPhone users on February 20 and for Android later this spring. \nIt might help the company generate additional revenue. The company issued weak guidance and announced plans to eliminate 20 percent of its workforce earlier this month. \nGoPro is offering a 30-day free trial of GoPro Plus for new customers and said it plans to roll out the option globally later this year.",
