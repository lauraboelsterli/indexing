    "text": "STOCKHOLM, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Apartment prices in Sweden fell 2 percent in the October-December period from the same period a year earlier, data from an association of Swedish real estate agents showed on Monday.\nPrices of single-family homes increased 5 percent, the Svensk Maklarstatistik association said.\nCompared with the September-November period this year, apartment prices were down 3 percent, while single-family home prices fell 2 percent.\nProperty prices have surged in recent years, outpacing wage growth, and authorities have long warned about high debt levels being a threat to the economy.\nHowever, home prices have dipped, mainly due to a surge in building and new, tougher mortgage rules.
