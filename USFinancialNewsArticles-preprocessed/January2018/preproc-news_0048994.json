    "text": "By Sarah Gray January 29, 2018 \nKrispy Kreme is hoping that you’ll give your loved ones the gift of doughnuts for Valentine’s Day. In addition to its classic selection of Valentine’s Day doughnuts, Krispy Kreme is selling a heart-shaped one called Oreo Cookie’s and Kreme. \nThe doughnut, available in the U.S. from Jan. 29 through Valentine’s day on Feb. 14, is filled with Oreo cookie cream, dipped in dark chocolate, sprinkled with Oreo cookie crumbles, and drizzled with red icing. \nOther Krispy Kreme Valentine’s treats include the Sprinkle Heart Doughnut, Happy Heart Doughnut and Chocolate Iced with Sprinkles Doughnut. \n“Whether for a friend, family member, colleague or significant other, delicious Krispy Kreme doughnuts are perfect for sharing,” Jackie Woodward, chief marketing officer of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, said in a statement. \nValentine’s Day is just as well-known for its consumerism as it is for romance. Last year, Americans spent an estimated $18.2 billion for the holiday, according to the National Retail Federation —including $1.7 billion on candy. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
