Reynolds will focus on providing guidance and insights to government and industry stakeholders in a changing regulatory environment.\n“Very few individuals can bring the expertise and reputation that Glenn does to complex telecommunications policies and regulations,” said Tara O’Neill Diaz, General Counsel, iconectiv. “His strong professional relationships with government agencies and telecommunications associations is a testament to his deep industry knowledge and leadership skills.”\nPrior to iconectiv, Reynolds served as Chief of Staff for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), where he was responsible for coordinating policy development across a broad spectrum of issues, including those involving internet, wireline and wireless networks. Previously, he served in senior management positions at BellSouth Corporation, the USTelecom Association and was Deputy Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC, where he provided strategic counsel with a comprehensive understanding of how policy decisions are made and led diverse teams to achieve organizational goals.\n“Telecommunications regulations and policies are key drivers in the life of the nation, affecting consumers and businesses as well as economic growth and innovation,” Reynolds said. “As an authoritative, neutral third-party, it’s critical that iconectiv stays engaged in the ever-evolving regulatory environment as the industry seeks to reduce robocalls and cybersecurity threats, modernize the nation’s network infrastructure, and ensure the connectivity and speed that consumers demand.”\niconectiv maintains active engagement with numerous government agencies, industry trade associations, standards bodies and academic institutions to define the technical solutions that support regulation. This year, iconectiv will become the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA) for all regions of the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC).
