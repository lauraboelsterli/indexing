And while the Northeast is expected to receive the brunt of the ‚Äúwinter hurricane‚Äù , potentially record-breaking weather is also hitting Southeast states. \nOn Wednesday morning, Grayson delivered 0.1 inch of snow and sleet to Florida‚Äôs capital, Tallahassee, according to the National Weather Service. It was the first measurable snow there in 28 years, according to Weather.com , and led to closing parts of Interstate 10 on Wednesday morning. You can watch a video of snow in Monticello, Fla. here . \nOther southern states, including North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and South Carolina, are also preparing for snowfall. ‚ÄúThis could be one of the heaviest one-day snowfalls on record in both Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina,‚Äù Weather.com reported.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has declared a state of emergency there. \n‚ÄúThe bitter cold that continues to plague the Commonwealth will be joined by a potentially significant winter storm which will blast Hampton Roads, the Northern Neck, Eastern Shore and other areas of Eastern Virginia with snowfall and blizzard-like conditions in some communities,‚Äù Gov. McAuliffe said in a statement. ‚ÄúWith this forecast in mind, all Virginians should take the necessary precautions now to ensure they are prepared for the travel disruptions, power outages and other threats to health and safety that could arise during this significant weather event.‚Äù SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
