Oil prices and annual wage negotiations this spring hold the key for price trends, they say.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more to spur consumer spending, piling pressure on firms to spend their huge cash pile to broaden the benefits of the strengthening economy.
