    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, PA, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) (“Five Below” or the “Company”) today announced net sales results for the quarter-to-date period from October 29, 2017 through January 6, 2018 (\"Holiday Period\"). The Company also announced that it expects fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 (ending February 3, 2018) results near the high end of its previously provided guidance ranges.\nThe Company announced that net sales for the Holiday Period increased by 26.7% to $442.6 million from $349.3 million in the comparable fiscal week period of 2016. Comparable sales for the Holiday Period increased by 6.7%.\nJoel Anderson, President and CEO of Five Below, stated, “We are pleased to share that our holiday sales performance was the strongest since our IPO in 2012. We believe our compelling merchandise assortment, offered at an amazing value with a great in-store experience, resonated with customers and drove these results. Multiple merchandise categories outperformed, once again demonstrating the broad-based strength of our business. Given our strong quarter-to-date performance and expectations for the remainder of January, we expect to finish the fourth quarter and full year near the high end of our previously provided guidance ranges.”\nThe Company’s guidance given on its third quarter earnings call is provided below. The Company’s guidance did not include any impact from the tax reform bill enacted in December 2017. The fiscal 2017 results will contain an additional, non-comparable week, or the \"53rd week\" in the fourth quarter. The 53rd week is expected to contribute approximately $16 million in sales and approximately $0.03 in diluted income per common share.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Guidance\n• Net sales of $491 million to $503 million\n• Comparable sales increase of 4% to 6%\n• Diluted income per common share of $1.09 to $1.16 on approximately 55.7 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding\nFull Year Fiscal 2017 Guidance\n• Net sales of $1.264 billion to $1.276 billion\n• Comparable sales increase of 5.7% to 6.5%\n• Diluted income per common share of $1.72 to $1.79 on approximately 55.7 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding\nAs previously announced, management is scheduled to present today at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time at the 20th Annual ICR Conference.
