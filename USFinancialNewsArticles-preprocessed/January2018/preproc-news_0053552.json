    "text": "MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that a new U.S. sanctions report expected to be released imminently was an attempt to influence Russiaâ€™s presidential election in March, but would fail to influence the vote.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Russia would analyse the report once it was published.\nThe United States could release reports as early as Monday detailing the possibilities for expanding sanctions against Russia, including a list of prominent oligarchs and potential restrictions on the holding of Russian government debt.
