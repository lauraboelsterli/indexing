    "text": "ATLANTA, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc. (“Chart”) (Nasdaq:GTLS) announced today the acquisition of Skaff Cryogenics & Cryo-Lease, LLC (together “Skaff”).\nFounded in 1979, Skaff provides quality repair service and remanufacturing of cryogenic and liquefied natural gas storage tanks and trailers. Skaff is headquartered in Brentwood, New Hampshire and provides services and equipment to customers in North America. Skaff also maintains a portfolio of cryogenic storage equipment that is leased to customers for temporary and permanent needs. Customers include major gas suppliers, as well as a variety of smaller distributors and end users.

This is a very strategic expansion for us as we drive to bring more value to our customers.

We are very proud of the growth we’ve achieved over the years and are ready to take Skaff to the next level as part of Chart.”\nCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
