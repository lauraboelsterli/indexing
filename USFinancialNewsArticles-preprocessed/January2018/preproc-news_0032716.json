The owners are providing new growth and working capital to the Company and have high expectations for the Company's long-term success.

Collectively, the new Board has significant healthcare and corporate leadership experience. As its first order of business, the Board unanimously appointed Kimberly Commins-Tzoumakas as Interim Chief Executive Officer.\n“Kim has been a key part of the executive team for the past few years, and during the Chapter 11 process she was instrumental in achieving a resolution of various key issues that ultimately allowed us to obtain approval of the Plan earlier this month,” said Mr. Goldberg, chair of the new Board. “Kim will provide important leadership, stability and continuity as we transition into the post-Chapter 11 phase and conduct a search for someone to fill the role on a permanent basis.”\nMr. Goldberg added, \"We have amazing physicians, a talented senior leadership team and incredible employees across the organization. I know I can speak for the full Board and our new ownership when I say that our team is our greatest asset, and it adds greatly to our confidence that we can execute on our business plan and become an even stronger provider of integrated cancer care services. We all are aligned on the long-term strategy and are fully committed to what will always be our top priority – providing the best medical care possible to our patients.”\nMs. Commins-Tzoumakas said, \"I am very excited about this opportunity to help lead 21 st Century Oncology during an important time in the Company’s history. The successful financial restructuring provides a fresh start and an infusion of capital from our new ownership group, which demonstrates their confidence in the Company and its future. We now have the opportunity to fully leverage the strengths of our business and the skills of our medical professionals and other employees. We are very grateful that our physicians, patients, partners and employees stood by us as we went through the Chapter 11 process. The Board and I intend to work as hard as we can to reward their loyalty, support and patience and to make sure the Company reaches its full potential.”\nNEW LEADERSHIP BIOGRAPHIES\nThomas Gordon\nThomas Gordon has over 20 years of experience in managing medical organizations.
