    "text": "By Hallie Detrick 9:18 AM EST \nStarbucks is going to start offering a “gateway” espresso to help new coffee drinkers get into the hard stuff. \nAs of Tuesday , Starbucks locations across the U.S. will offer a blonde roast espresso with a crisp, citrus flavor and a creamy texture for the same price as a Signature espresso shot. It will be a permanent menu item. \nThe introduction of a light espresso is an interesting move for Starbucks, which was founded more than 40 years ago to bring darker, more flavorful coffees to the American market. The company’s vice president of Global Coffee, Andrew Linnemann, recognised this. “We set the standard for a dark, boldly roasted coffee and in this case, we broke a few of our own rules by taking a lighter approach to espresso which created a bright taste with sweet citrus notes and a smooth body,” he said. This is the first time the company has expanded its espresso offer in the U.S. For the first time in 43 years… a second espresso. Subtly sweet, amazingly smooth.

The new espresso will be available in more than 8,000 of the chain’s U.S. locations. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
