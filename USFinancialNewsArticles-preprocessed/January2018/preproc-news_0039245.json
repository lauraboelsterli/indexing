    "text": "VIENNA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Former Formula One champion Niki Lauda will acquire Niki, the airline he founded, and a meeting of its Austrian creditors have unanimously supported his bid, the carrierâ€™s Austrian and German administrators said on Tuesday.\nAn agreed sale of Niki to British Airways owner IAG was thrown into doubt earlier this month after two courts ruled that insolvency proceedings had to move to Austria from Germany.\nThat paved the way for other interested parties, such as Ryanair and Lauda, to bid for the carrier, which most recently was part of failed airline Air Berlin.
