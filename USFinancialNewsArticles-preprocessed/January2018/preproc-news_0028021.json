    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 18 (Reuters) - China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, above expectations and unchanged from the previous quarter’s growth.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected gross domestic product to expand 6.7 percent in the October-December quarter, slowing from 6.8 percent growth in the previous quarter.\nChinese policymakers have been trying to contain financial risks and slow an explosive build-up in debt without stunting economic growth.\nThe world’s second-largest economy grew an annual 6.9 percent in 2017, beating the government’s target of around 6.5 percent and quickening from 2016 growth of 6.7 percent, which was the weakest pace in 26 years.\nGDP in the fourth quarter grew 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, compared with revised growth of 1.8 percent in July-September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.\nAnalysts had expected fourth-quarter GDP would grow 1.6 percent on a quarterly basis.
