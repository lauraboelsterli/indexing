    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed to a record on Friday as the U.S. dollar held near three-year lows and a U.S. government shutdown loomed, while U.S. Treasury yields continued their ascent to hit their highest levels since September 2014.\nDemocratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer met with President Donald Trump at the White House to search for ways to avert a U.S. government shutdown, but Schumer said afterward that disagreements remained as the clock ticked toward a midnight deadline to pass a funding bill.\nLegislation to stave off an imminent federal government shutdown encountered obstacles in the Senate on Thursday night, despite the passage of a month-long funding bill by the House of Representatives hours earlier.\nWithout an infusion of new money, no matter how temporary, hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers may be put on furlough, while “essential” employees, dealing with public safety and national security, would continue working.\n“Whatever immediate concern the government shutdown brings to the market, I think it will swiftly overcome,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\nEquity markets have historically shrugged off government shutdowns.\nShares on Wall Street rose modestly, with each of the major Wall Street indexes marking their third straight weekly gain.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 53.91 points, or 0.21 percent, to 26,071.72, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 12.27 points, or 0.44 percent, to 2,810.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 40.33 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,336.38.\nTraders work at their desks in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, early November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Staff/Remote/Files For the week, the Dow rose 1.04 percent, the S&P 500 advanced 0.86 percent and the Nasdaq rose 1.04 percent.\nThe trade-weighted dollar index =USD was last up 0.1 percent, but was on pace for its fifth straight weekly drop, and is down nearly 2 percent so far in 2018. The euro EUR= was down 0.14 percent to $1.222.\nEuropean shares closed higher as confidence grew about corporate earnings and the strength of the global economy. The euro zone’s STOXX .STOXXE benchmark index closed up 0.73 percent at 402.95 points, its highest level in 10 years and the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark rose 0.5 percent to 400.71 points, a 2-1/2 year peak.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.49 percent, also a 2-1/2 year high, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.46 percent. MSCI's index notched its ninth straight week of gains.\nYields on the 10-year U.S. government note hit a three-year high as weakness in overnight trading led the debt to test key technical support levels, before the higher yields attracted new buyers.\nThe benchmark 10-year yield US10YT=RR hit its highest level since September 2014 at 2.646 percent, breaking the 2017 high of 2.64 percent the market had been flirting with all week.\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.6555 percent, from 2.611 percent late on Thursday.\nOil prices retreated and snapped a four-week streak of gains, as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 0.9 percent at $63.37 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $68.61, down 1 percent on the day.\nAdditional reporting by April Joyner; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
