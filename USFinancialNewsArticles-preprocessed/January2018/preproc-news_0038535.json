    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ShiftPixy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIXY), a developing, proprietary next-gen technology platform for workforce engagement and management, today announced the appointment of Patrice H. Launay as Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Launay succeeds Stephen DeSantis who resigned from the Company as reported on October 5, 2017.\nScott W. Absher, Chief Executive Officer of ShiftPixy stated, “The Board and I are very excited about Patrice joining ShiftPixy as our new CFO. His exemplary skills and deep experience in accounting along with his astute business acumen make him the right person to lead our finance team.”\nMr. Launay comes to ShiftPixy with an extensive accounting background, having served as an audit manager for various large regional and multinational accounting firms. He began his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) where he spent six years in Paris and Los Angeles. He then spent two years at Groupe Roullier as Corporate Controller, and the following two years as an audit Manager for the City Auditor Office of the City of Long Beach, California, where he led several audits to help prevent and deter fraud within the city’s programs. From 2011 to 2016 Mr. Launay worked for BDO USA and was involved in the audits of several listed and non-listed companies in the US and Australia. Immediately before joining ShiftPixy, he served as a financial and accounting manager for RxSight, Inc., providing month-end close assistance, designing and implementing effective controls, and drafting accounting procedures. Mr. Launay holds a master’s degree from the Business School of Tours (ESCEM) France with a major in Finance and Accounting, is a Certified Public Accountant (Active) and a Certified Fraud Examiner (Inactive), and holds a Series 65 securities license.\nMr. Launay stated, “The ShiftPixy story is one of rapid growth and incredible potential, and I am excited to join the Company at this early stage in its evolution. I look forward to applying my skillset to help Scott and the team as we create a world-class operation.”\nAbout ShiftPixy\nShiftPixy is a disruptive human capital management (HCM) services provider, revolutionizing employment in the Gig Economy by delivering a next-gen platform for workforce management that helps businesses with shift-based employees navigate regulatory mandates, minimize administrative burdens and better connect with a ready-for-hire workforce.
