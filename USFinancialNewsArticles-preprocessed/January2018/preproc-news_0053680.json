(Nasdaq:MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased to report our ninth straight year of record trading volumes, revenues and operating income. These results were accomplished in spite of the difficult fixed income trading environment in 2017 that had unusually low volatility in both credit spreads and interest rates. As we enter 2018, we are encouraged to see signs of more normal fixed income trading conditions, including improving global economic growth and declining central bank quantitative easing. Client adoption of electronic trading in fixed income continues to grow, and our international client diversification creates a valuable foundation for long term growth.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 5.4% to $99.6 million, compared to $94.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Pre-tax income was $49.4 million, compared to $50.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1.9%. Pre-tax margin was 49.6%, compared to 53.3% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income totaled $33.5 million, or $0.88 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $33.2 million, or $0.88 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCommission revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 2.9% to $88.0 million, compared to $85.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Variable transaction fees decreased 6.5% to $65.4 million on total trading volume of $355.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to variable transaction fees of $69.9 million on total trading volume of $338.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to an estimated 17.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAll other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services, investment income and other revenue, increased to $11.6 million, compared to $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher information services revenue of $1.1 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.9 million.\nTotal expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 13.8% to $50.2 million, compared to $44.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs of $1.8 million, mainly due to an increase in headcount, technology and communication costs of $1.2 million, general and administrative costs of $1.1 million and depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 32.2%, compared to 34.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 income tax provision includes a one-time tax charge totaling $11.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was signed into law in December 2017, offset by excess tax benefits of $11.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, related to a new share-based compensation accounting standard (ASU 2016-09) adopted as of January 1, 2017. The tax charge relates to the repatriation tax on accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets, among other items. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ materially from the charge recognized this quarter due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nEmployee headcount was 429 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 383 as of December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7.4% to a record $397.5 million, compared to $369.9 million for 2016. Pre-tax income was a record $201.8 million, compared to $191.6 million for 2016, an increase of 5.3%. Pre-tax margin was 50.8%, compared to 51.8% for 2016. Net income totaled $148.1 million, or $3.89 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $126.2 million, or $3.34 per share, for 2016.\nCommission revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 6.9% to a record $355.3 million, compared to $332.3 million for 2016. Variable transaction fees increased 4.4% to $279.8 million on total trading volume of $1.5 trillion, compared to variable transaction fees of $268.1 million on total trading volume of $1.3 trillion for 2016. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 16.9%, compared to an estimated 16.0% for 2016.\nAll other revenue increased 12.2% to $42.2 million in 2017, compared to $37.6 million for 2016. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher information services revenue of $2.5 million and an increase in investment income of $1.5 million.\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 9.8% to $195.7 million, compared to $178.3 million for 2016. The increase in total expenses was principally due to higher employee compensation and benefits costs of $6.0 million mainly due to an increase in employee headcount, general and administrative costs of $3.0 million, technology and communication costs of $2.8 million, professional and consulting fees of $2.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was 26.6% compared to 34.1% for 2016. The 2017 income tax provision includes excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of approximately $26.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, offset by the one-time tax charge totaling $11.7 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nDividend\nThe Company’s board of directors declared a 27% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on February 28, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 14, 2018.\nShare Repurchases\nA total of 32,500 shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a cost of $6.1 million.\nBalance Sheet Data\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $581.2 million and included $406.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2017 was $514.8 million.\nGuidance for 2018\nFor 2018, the Company is providing the following guidance:\nExpenses are expected to be in the range of $220.0 million to $232.0 million, including duplicate occupancy costs of approximately $8.0 million for the Company’s new corporate offices in New York during the build-out phase.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $43.0 million to $50.0 million, including approximately $25 million of buildout costs for the new corporate offices.\nThe Company’s overall effective tax rate is expected to be between 23.0% to 25.0%, including the estimated impact of the Tax Act and excess tax benefits on share awards that are expected to vest in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and free cash flow. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding the Company's operating results and useful for period-to-period comparison results. See the attached schedule at the end of this release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nRichard M.
