[CEO] Chuck Robbins is redoing everything. Get in Cisco before the quarter.\"\nMondelez Intl : \"I think the stock is inexpensive and the group is starting to get a couple bids underneath. I think that you could do far worse than buying Mondelez.\"\nMitsubishi Financial Group : \"You know what, you actually should [add Mitsubishi to your portfolio]. I've been working on Japan and that is a great way to play Japan. I'm going to endorse that.\"\nJetBlue : \"JetBlue is OK. I'm actually talking about Southwest . My charitable trust should not have sold it. It had a gain. If LUV comes back when it reports [on Jan. 25], that's the one to be in.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: lightning round: Buy Cisco before its quarterly earnings report 20 Hours Ago | 03:50 ",
