    "text": " 31 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago China says hopes to get Japan ties back on track Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - China hopes to work with Japan to get relations back onto a normal track, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart on Sunday, amid a series of disputes, some dating back to before World War Two. \nChina and Japan have long sparred over their painful history, with Beijing frequently accusing Tokyo of not properly atoning for Japan’s invasion of China before and during the war. \nTies between China and Japan, the world’s second- and third-largest economies, have also been plagued by a long-running territorial dispute over a cluster of East China Sea islets and suspicion in China about efforts by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to amend Japan’s pacifist constitution. \nHowever the two countries have sought to improve ties, and Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in November on the sidelines of a regional summit in Vietnam. \nWang told Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono that his trip to Beijing, coming so early in the year, showed Japan’s strong wish to improve relations, and China approves of this as better ties are in both nation’s interests.

We desire to extend mutual cooperation between our two countries in working towards resolving this issue.” \nJapan has repeatedly pressed China to do more to help rein in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes. China says it is committed to enforcing U.N. sanctions, but that all parties need to do more to reduce tensions and restart talks. Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie",
