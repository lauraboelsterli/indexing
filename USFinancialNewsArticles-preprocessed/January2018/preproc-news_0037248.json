He is based in Guggenheim’s Chicago office.\nMr. Binder has over 24 years of experience in the asset management industry.

All six of Guggenheim’s taxable fixed income mutual funds were rated five stars by Morningstar, in addition to the five-star rated Risk Managed Real Estate fund, based on risk-adjusted return 1 . The Guggenheim Macro Opportunities Fund (GIOIX) was recognized as Best 40-Act fund of 2017 by HFM and Best Alternative Credit Focus Fund for the third year (2015, 2016, 2017) by the Thompson Reuters Lipper Fund Awards. Guggenheim Investments was recognized by Cogent Research and Market Strategies International among the top 10 providers of research and thought leadership that is both read and shared by financial advisors.\nAdds Miller: “Guggenheim Investments reached new heights in 2017 and the addition of Brian Binder to our team reflects our continued investment in growing our Firm to a position of global leadership as a specialty active manager.”\n1.

Investments in fixed-income instruments are subject to the possibility that interest rates could rise, causing their values to decline. High yield and unrated debt securities are at a greater risk of default than investment grade bonds and may be less liquid, which may increase volatility.\nThe Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products with at least a three-year history and does not include the effect of sales charges. Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10 percent of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5 percent receive 4 stars, the next 35 percent receive 3 stars, the next 22.5 percent receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10 percent receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.\n©2017 Morningstar, Inc.
