    "text": "January 4, 2018 / 12:09 PM / in 12 minutes Sri Lankan shares edge down amid high turnover Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares ended slightly weaker on Thursday amid heavy buying by foreign investors, but traders said sentiment was likely to remain positive after the central bank kept key policy rates unchanged last week. \nThe Colombo Stock Index ended 0.06 percent weaker at 6,459.66, snapping an eight-session win streak. \nShares in Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc fell 1.3 percent, while DFCC Bank Plc dropped 2.9 percent. \nLosses were, however, capped by gains in Melstacorp Ltd , which climbed 1.9 percent, and conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc, which rose 0.3 percent. \n“Small volume of selling in CTC dragged the market down,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital Holdings. \n“The positive trend due to declining market interest rates will continue.” \nTurnover stood at 1.5 billion rupees ($9.77 million), more than last year’s daily average of 915.3 million rupees. \nForeign investors net bought shares worth 1.3 billion rupees on Thursday. Foreign investors net bought 18.5 billion rupees worth equities in 2017, and 633.5 million rupees worth stocks in 2016. \nThe index rose 2.26 percent in 2017, posting its first annual increase in three years. It fell 9.7 percent in 2016. \nSince March 2017, treasury bill rates have fallen between 188 and 216 basis points though end-December, mainly driven by foreign investors buying treasury bonds, resulting in declining market interest rates. \nThe country’s 2018 economic growth trajectory is likely to help boost market sentiment, analysts said. \nSri Lanka’s economic growth in 2018 is forecast at 5-5.5 percent, bouncing back from an anticipated four-year low of less than 4 percent last year, central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said on Wednesday.
