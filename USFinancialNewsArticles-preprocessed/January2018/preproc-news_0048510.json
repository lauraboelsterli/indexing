The agency said some of its other priorities for the bill include encouraging younger farmers as well as opening up foreign markets for U.S. agricultural products. \n“These principles will be used as a road map – they are our way of letting Congress know what we’ve heard from the hard-working men and women of American agriculture,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \nThe current farm bill, which was projected to cost $489 billion over its five-year life, is set to expire this year.
