    "text": " 44 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago India sees growth picking up in coming fiscal year - Newsrise   \nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s economy should grow between 7 percent and 7.5 percent in the upcoming fiscal year that begins on April 1, the finance ministry will say in its pre-budget Economic Survey on Monday, financial newswire Newsrise reported citing a source. \nThe annual survey, set to be presented in Parliament later on Monday, comes ahead of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s annual budget that is set to be presented on Thursday. \nThe forecast comes after the government this month lowered its GDP growth forecast for the year ending March 2018 to 6.5 percent, the weakest pace in four years.
