Netflix stock is up 66 percent in the past 12-months through Monday. \nHarrigan raised his price target for Netflix shares to $257 from $251, representing 13 percent upside to Monday's close. \nThe analyst noted the rising risks from Netflix's well-financed media and internet competitors. \n\"Even CEO Reed Hastings is open kimono that the global migration to IPTV content will attract new entrants and accelerating commitments from those currently engaged, which include deep pocketed tech companies like Amazon and companies with significant programming access like Hulu and European public broadcasters,\" he wrote. \nNetflix stock downgrades are a rare occurrence on Wall Street in recent years. The last time the company was downgraded was in Sept. 2016, when Macquarie lowered its rating to underperform from neutral. \nâ€” CNBC's Patricia Martell contributed to this report.
