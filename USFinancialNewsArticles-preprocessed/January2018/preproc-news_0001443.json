Barrick Gold rose 1.8 percent to C$18.50 and Kirkland Lake Gold gained 3.8 percent to C$20 as gold prices hit a three-month peak. \n* Aurora Cannabis Inc jumped 14 percent to C$10.94 after saying it sold cannabis worth C$3.1 million in November, its highest ever. \n* A string of other marijuana companies also gained, as Canada moves to legalize the production, sale and consumption of recreational marijuana by July 2018, with Canopy Growth Co up 6.8 percent to $31.75 and Aphria Inc adding 7.7 percent to C$20.13.
