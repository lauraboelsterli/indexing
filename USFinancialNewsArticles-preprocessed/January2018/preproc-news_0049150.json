    "text": "EAU CLAIRE, Wis., Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") (Nasdaq:CZWI) , the parent company of Citizens Community Federal N.A. (the “Bank”), today reported GAAP earnings increased to $1.34 million, or $0.23 per diluted share in Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $940,000, or $0.18 per share one year earlier and a loss of $458,000, or ($0.08) one quarter earlier. The Q1 fiscal 2018 operations reflect a full quarter earnings impact from the Wells Financial acquisition, the decrease in tax rate due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Tax Act\") of 2017, offset by higher professional costs, severance costs, and a $275,000, or $0.05 per share additional one-time tax expense associated with the recently passed Tax Act discussed above. The quarter reflected continued growth in commercial/ag loans while indirect lending balances have declined.\nThe Board of Directors increased the annual cash dividend 25% to $0.20 per share over the annual dividend paid to holders of common stock in 2017. The dividend will be payable on March 8, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 9, 2018.\nCore earnings (non-GAAP) increased 140% to $1.8 million, or $0.30 per diluted share for Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $0.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share from the prior quarter. Q1 fiscal 2018 core earnings (non-GAAP) exclude modest merger and branch closure expenditures and the net impact of the Tax Act which are itemized on the accompanying financial table \"Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings (loss) and Core Earnings (non-GAAP)\".\nCore earnings is a non-GAAP measure that management believes enhances investors' ability to better understand the underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities. For a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see the accompanying financial table \"Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings (loss) and Core Earnings (non-GAAP)\".\n“We continue to make progress in transforming our balance sheet composition, which is translating into stronger core earnings. Our commercial loan growth reflects our commercial bankers' successful calling efforts and the addition of new commercial and ag bankers to our team. The efforts to improve our funding sources and costs by increasing transaction oriented, core deposits continues,” said Stephen Bianchi, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our commitment to expense management is ongoing as we use technology to automate and manage workflows, specifically in commercial banking.”\nQ1 Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights: (at or for the periods ended December 31, 2017, compared to September 30, 2017 and /or December 31, 2016)\nGAAP net income reflected earnings of $1.34 million in Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $940,000 from a year ago, and a loss of $458,000 in Q4 fiscal 2017.\nNet interest income increased 35.5% to $7.53 million in Q1 fiscal 2018, from $5.56 million in Q1 fiscal 2017 and 22.0% from $6.17 million one quarter earlier, largely due to the full quarter impact of the Wells acquisition.\nNet interest margin (NIM) expanded to 3.42% for the current quarter, compared to 3.36% for Q1 fiscal 2017 and 3.29% for Q4 fiscal 2017, largely due to the full quarter impact of the Wells acquisition.\nLoan loss provision increased to $100,000 in Q1 fiscal 2018 compared to no provisions one year earlier and decreased from $319,000 the previous quarter.\nTotal non-interest income increased 56% to $1.94 million in Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $1.24 million in Q1 fiscal 2017 and 39% from $1.39 million one quarter earlier. Growth in non-interest income is being driven by the impact of the Wells acquisition which has resulted in higher deposit charges and increased loan fees and service charges due to gain on sale of residential loan income.\nTotal non-interest expense increased to $7.14 million for Q1 fiscal 2018 from $5.39 million for Q1 fiscal 2017 and declined from $7.91 million in Q4 fiscal 2017, largely due to lower merger and branch closure expenses, partially offset by a full quarter's expenses related to the Wells acquisition.\nNet loans were $725.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $543.0 million at December 31, 2016, reflecting the Wells acquisition and $727.1 million at September 30, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $741.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $535.1 million at December 31, 2016 and $742.5 million at September 30, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses was 0.80% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.08% one year earlier and 0.81% the preceding quarter. The lower ratio for Q1 fiscal 2018 relative to one year earlier was a result of the larger balance of loans related to the acquisition of Wells Financial that were recorded at fair values and therefore without provisions for loan losses.\nNonperforming assets were $14.2 million, or 1.50% of total assets at December 31, 2017, compared to $7.4 million, or 1.08% of total assets at December 31, 2016, and $14.1 million, or 1.49% of total assets at September 30, 2017. In the current quarter, the impact of paydowns on non-performing loans was offset by the transfer of an owned, closed branch acquired in the Wells acquisition.\nBank capital ratios exceeded regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution under the Basel III regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017:\nCitizens\nCommunity\nFederal N.A. To Be Well Capitalized Under\nPrompt Corrective Action\nProvisions Total capital (to risk weighted assets) 13.4 % 10.0 % Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 12.5 % 8.0 % Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 12.5 % 6.5 % Tier 1 leverage ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.3 % 5.0 % Balance Sheet and Asset Quality Review\nTotal assets were $943.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $686.4 million at December 31, 2016, and $940.7 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in total assets from a year ago was primarily due to the acquisition of Wells Financial.\nLoan balances decreased slightly from the immediate prior quarter due to the pay down of indirect loans and one to four family real estate loans. Meanwhile, commercial real estate loans increased through originations outpacing loan pay downs. At December 31, 2017, commercial and agricultural real estate loans totaled 39.4% of the total loan portfolio versus 37.2% the prior quarter and 27.6% one year earlier. One to four family residential and home equity real estate loans represented 32.4% of the total loan portfolio versus 33.6% the prior quarter, while consumer related non-real estate loans totaled 17.0% of the total loan portfolio versus 18.5% the prior quarter.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses was largely unchanged at December 31, 2017 and totaled $5.9 million, representing 0.80% of total loans, compared to $5.9 million and 0.81% of total loans at September 30, 2017. Net charged off loans totaled $183,000 for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $151,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming assets were $14.2 million, or 1.50% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared to $7.4 million, or 1.08% of total assets at December 31, 2016, and $14.1 million, or 1.49% of total assets at September 30, 2017. Included in nonperforming assets are approximately $5.1 million of REO properties acquired in the Wells Financial acquisition. Additionally, the level of other real estate owned increased to $7.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $6.0 million one quarter earlier due to the transfer of an owned, closed branch acquired in the Wells acquisition.\nDeposits totaled $741.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $535.1 million at December 31, 2016, and $742.5 million at September 30, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $78.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $75.3 million at September 30, 2017, and $47.5 million at December 31, 2016. Core deposits, excluding time deposits, increased to $452.5 million, or 61.1% of total deposits compared to $451.7 million at September 30, 2017, or 60.8% of total deposits.\nFederal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") advances totaled $94.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $90.0 million at September 30, 2017. Other borrowings decreased slightly to $29.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $30.3 million at September 30, 2017. The Bank has used borrowings and equity capital to fund acquisitions of other financial institutions, branch closings and FHLB advances to support organic loan growth.\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $9.98 at December 31, 2017, compared to $11.09 at December 31, 2016, and $9.78 at September 30, 2017.\nCapital ratios for the Bank continued to remain well above regulatory requirements.\nReview of Operations\nNet interest income increased to $7.5 million for Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $5.6 million for Q1 fiscal 2017 and $6.2 million on a linked quarter basis. The NIM increased to 3.42% for Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to 3.36% for the same quarter one year earlier and 3.29% for Q4 fiscal 2017. The increase in the net interest margin was supported by higher yields on loans and lower cost of funds.\nLoan yields increased to 4.72% for Q1 fiscal 2018 compared to 4.61% one year earlier and 4.59% for the immediately prior quarter. Meanwhile, deposit costs declined to 0.72% for Q1 fiscal 2018 from 0.89% one year earlier and 0.77% for Q4 fiscal 2017. Costs on the FHLB and other borrowings increased to 2.33% for Q1 fiscal 2018 from 1.37% one year earlier and 2.12% for the preceding quarter. “The improved net interest margin is largely due to the full quarter impact of the Wells merger along with the result of our changing balance sheet composition which reflects more direct lending of commercial related loans and funding the loans with lower cost deposits,” said Jim Broucek, Chief Financial Officer.\nFor Q1 fiscal 2018, provision for loan losses totaling $100,000 was recorded, responsive to organic loan growth. Net charge offs were $183,000 for Q1 fiscal 2018, compared to $151,000 for Q1 fiscal 2017. Allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 0.80%, at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.08% at December 31, 2016 and 0.81%, at September 30, 2017.\nTotal non-interest expense was $7.1 million for Q1 fiscal 2018 compared to $5.4 million for Q1 fiscal 2017 and $7.9 million for Q4 fiscal 2017. Total non-interest expense for the first quarter includes severance expense related to an executive departure and slightly higher professional fees.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted December 22, 2017, reducing the corporate Federal income tax rate for the Company from 34% to 24.5% in fiscal 2018 and 21% in fiscal 2019. Additionally, the Tax Act made other changes to U.S. corporate income tax laws. GAAP requires that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. The Company revalued its net deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates. For the first quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a one-time net tax charge of $275,000 related to the revaluation of the deferred assets related to both the revaluation of timing differences and the unrealized loss on securities. This increase in income tax expense was partially offset by an approximately $135,000 reduction in income tax expense due to a lower corporate tax rate.\nThese financial results are preliminary until the Form 10-Q is filed in February 2018.\nAbout the Company\nCitizens Community Bancorp, Inc.

These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “planned,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of those terms or other words of similar meaning. Such forward-looking statements in this release are inherently subject to many uncertainties arising in the operations and business environment of Citizens Community Federal N.A. (“CCFBank”). These uncertainties include the combined company’s ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the transaction with Wells Financial; management’s ability to promptly and effectively integrate the businesses of the two companies; the diversion of management time on post acquisition integration issues; the effects of governmental regulation of the financial services industry; industry consolidation; technological developments and major world news events; general economic conditions, in particular, relating to consumer demand for CCFBank’s products and services; CCFBank’s ability to maintain current deposit and loan levels at current interest rates; competitive and technological developments; deteriorating credit quality, including changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest margins; prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions; CCFBank’s ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity; maintaining capital requirements may limit CCFBank’s operations and potential growth; changes and trends in capital markets; competitive pressures among depository institutions; effects of critical accounting estimates and judgments; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other regulatory agencies overseeing CCFBank; CCFBank’s ability to implement its cost-savings and revenue enhancement initiatives, including costs associated with its branch consolidation and new market branch growth initiatives; legislative or regulatory changes or actions or significant litigation adversely affecting CCFBank; fluctuation of the Company’s stock price; CCFBank's ability to attract and retain key personnel; CCFBank's ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; and the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Such uncertainties and other risks that may affect the Company’s performance are discussed further in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in the Company’s Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on December 13, 2017 and the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this news release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, which management believes may be helpful in understanding the Company's results of operations or financial position and comparing results over different periods. Non-GAAP measures eliminate the impact of certain one-time expenses such as acquisition and branch closure costs and related data processing termination fees, legal costs, severance pay, accelerated depreciation expense and lease termination fees and the net impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Merger related charges represent expenses to either satisfy contractual obligations of acquired entities without any useful benefit to the Company or to convert and consolidate customer records onto the Company platforms. These costs are unique to each transaction based on the contracts in existence at the merger date. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this press release. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other banks and financial institutions.\nContact: Steve Bianchi, CEO\n(715)-836-9994\nCITIZENS COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC.
