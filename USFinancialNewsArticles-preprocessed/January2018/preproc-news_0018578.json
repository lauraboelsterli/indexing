    "text": "Jan 10 (Reuters) - Struggling retailer Sears Holding Corp said on Wednesday it raised $100 million in funding and was in talks with lenders to improve the terms on its more than $1 billion of non-first lien debt, sending its shares up 5 percent in premarket trading.\nThe company said the new loan was backed by land leases and select intellectual property and would be entitled to raise a further $200 million with the consent of the lender.\nSears also said comparable-store sales during November and December fell as much as 17 percent, as shoppers continued to stay away from the embattled retailerâ€™s stores.\nThe company, controlled by billionaire Eddie Lampert, has reported 24 straight quarters of sales declines.
