The company entered into agreements on January 24, 2018 relating to the sale of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at an offering price of $10.00 per share together with a 40% one-year warrant to purchase an aggregate 1,200,000 shares of its common stock at $10.00 per share, which will be immediately exercisable for a period of one year. The gross proceeds from the offering were $30,000,000 before deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses. Chardan acted as the lead placement agent for this transaction and Maxim Group LLC acted as a co-placement agent for this transaction. The company has filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be viewed at https://ir.vuzix.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001144204-18-003905/tv484137_424b5.htm .\nThe Company estimates the net proceeds from this offering are approximately $28.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable.
