    "text": "MEDFORD, Mass. and SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agero, Inc. , a market leader in software enabled driver assistance services to automotive manufacturers and insurance providers in North America, today announced its acquisition of San Francisco-based SwoopMe, Inc. (Swoop), a provider of web-based dispatch solutions for roadside assistance providers. Swoop has been heralded in the automotive community for its intuitive, end-to-end dispatch management platform which helps service providers optimize operational efficiencies, and its transparent mobile service updates to consumers which strengthens brand loyalty.\n“We are excited to bolster our service provider relationships by joining forces with the Swoop team, as we believe they’ve created the industry’s most innovative and comprehensive service provider platform,” said Agero CEO and President Dave Ferrick. “The responsiveness and quality of the roadside service provider is central to customer experience and loyalty, and Agero remains commited to investing in and partnering with a multitude of dispatch platforms to ensure we deliver that premium roadside connection.”\nTogether, Agero and Swoop provide customers with a uniquely powerful combination of trusted network and operational scale as well as truly innovative software solutions and digital experiences.

We believe it represents a truly unique partnership in the industry that positions us well in the ever-changing automotive and insurance environment.”\nSwoop employees have joined Agero effective immediately, and the company will remain an independently managed dispatch solution, and continue to maintain and expand its existing San Francisco presence. Agero remains committed to its national network of trusted service providers, and will continue to ensure its clients can rely upon its leading portfolio of driving solutions inclusive of roadside assistance, accident management, and telematics products. Swoop marks another major step in accelerating Agero’s roadmap to deliver against evolving market needs as autonomous vehicles and car sharing trends continue to penetrate, and consumers’ appetite for digitally enabled experiences intensifies.\nAbout Agero\nAgero’s mission is to safeguard consumers on the road through a unique combination of platform intelligence and human powered solutions, strengthening our clients’ relationships with their drivers.
