    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercom Capital Group, llc, a clean energy research and communications firm, has released its 2017 Q4 and annual report on funding and merger and acquisition (M&A) activity for the solar sector.\nTotal global corporate funding into the solar sector, including venture capital /private equity (VC), debt financing, and public market financing came to $12.8 billion (B), compared to $9.1B raised in 2016.\nReport: http://bit.ly/MercomSolarQ42017\nChart: Solar Corporate Funding 2010-2017\n\"A strong fourth quarter pushed overall funding higher in 2017. Higher installation levels around the world, the lack of threat to the solar investment tax credit, lower than expected tariff recommendation by U.S. ITC , strong debt financing activity, and over a billion dollars in securitization deals helped the solar industry have a much better year in terms of financial activity compared to 2016. After several challenging years, most of the solar securities were up in 2017 reflecting overall positive sentiments around the solar industry even as several Chinese manufacturers decided to go private. Of course, all this could change swiftly if President Trump decides to impose higher tariffs in the trade case,\" commented Raj Prabhu, CEO and Co-Founder of Mercom Capital Group.\nGlobal VC investments came to $1.6B in 99 deals in 2017, up from $1.3B in 78 deals in 2016.\nChart: Solar VC Funding 2010-2017\nSolar downstream companies accounted for $1.4B in 2017.

Three IPO s were logged in 2017 for $363M: Canadian Solar Infrastructure Fund, New Energy Solar Fund, and Clenergy.\nDebt financing totaled $9.5B in 2017. There were six securitization deals in 2017 totaling $1.3B. For the first time, securitization deals surpassed $1B.\nAnnounced large-scale project funding in 2017 reached $14B in 167 deals, compared to $9.4B in 133 deals during 2016.\nA total of 161 investors funded about 20.5 GW of large-scale solar projects in 2017 compared to 5.9 GW funded by 153 investors in 2016.\nThe top investors in large-scale projects included Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), Santander, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Siemens Financial Services.\n$2.4B was raised by 16 residential and commercial solar project funds in 2017, compared to $4.9B by 30 funds in 2016.
