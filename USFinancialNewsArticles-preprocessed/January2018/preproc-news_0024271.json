Airbus posted 1,229 gross or unadjusted orders compared with Boeing’s 1,053. \nAirbus confirmed it had met its core 2017 delivery target of more than 700 aircraft by releasing 718 jets to customers in 2017, up 4 percent from the previous year despite some industrial delays. \nBoeing remained the world’s largest jetmaker for the sixth year running with a record total of 763 deliveries.
