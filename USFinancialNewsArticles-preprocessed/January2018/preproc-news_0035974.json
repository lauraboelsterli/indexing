The brokerage firm reported earnings of $0.52 per share on revenue of $1.26 billion, well beating Wall Street expectations of $0.50 per share on revenue of $1.2 billion. In a statement TD Ameritrade CEO and president Tim Hockey attributed the quarter's performance to the acquisition of Scottrade, and increased consumer interest in new sectors.\n\"Enhanced consumer interest in blockchain and cannabis-related securities drove a further surge in engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, particularly among first-time investors,\" Hockey said in a statement.\nAdobe shares gained more than 1 percent in extended trading, after the software company announced two executives would retire. Both CFO Mark Garrett and General Counsel Mike Dillon will retire in 2018.
