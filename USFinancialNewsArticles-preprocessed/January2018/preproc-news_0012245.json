    "text": "Egor Koulechov scored 23 points as Southeastern Conference-leading Florida stayed unbeaten in league play with a 71-54 victory against Mississippi State on Wednesday night at Exactech Arena in Gainesville, Fla.\nThe Gators (12-4, 4-0 SEC) beat the Bulldogs (13-3, 1-2) for the eighth consecutive time. Florida visits Ole Miss on Saturday while Mississippi State, which lost its second consecutive game after a five-game winning streak, hosts Auburn.\nQuindarry Weatherspoon scored 16 points, making 4 of 8 3-point attempts, to lead the Bulldogs, who didn’t have a double-figure scorer in a 64-58 loss at Ole Miss last Saturday. The rest of the Bulldogs made a combined 1 of 8 3-point tries Wednesday. Abdul Ado had 12 points and a game-high 10 rebounds.\nAric Holman, Mississippi State’s second-leading scorer with an average of 12.2 points, fouled out with 13:19 left in the game after scoring seven points.\nJalen Hudson scored 12 for the Gators, Keith Stone scored 10 and Chris Chiozza came off the bench to add 10. Florida made 9 of 23 3-point attempts, with Koulechov making 4 of 5.\nChiozza sank back-to-back 3-pointers, converting a four-point play after being fouled on the second one, as Florida extended its five-point halftime lead to 45-35 early in the second half.\nHudson and Kevaughn Allen scored three points each as Florida increased the lead to 52-38 midway through the second half.\nAfter a basket by Weatherspoon, Koulechov scored five consecutive points as the Gators built the advantage to 65-42.\nKoulechov scored Florida’s first 13 points, making 5 of 6 field-goal attempts, including all three of his 3-point attempts.\nGorjok Gak finally gave him some support with a layup that gave the Gators a 15-12 lead midway through the first half.\nE.J. Datcher became the fifth Bulldog to score when he made a jumper to make it 15-14.\nFlorida twice led by 10 points in the first half before going into halftime with a 33-28 lead after Koulechov scored 17.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
