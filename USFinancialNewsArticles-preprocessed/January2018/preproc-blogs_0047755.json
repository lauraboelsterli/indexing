    "text": "US Concrete : \"I like that stock. I think that stock could have another leg up here once the states start funding more business.\"\nUlta Beauty Inc. : \"I want to see. There's apparently a lot of price-cutting. We've got to hear from the CEO. I don't like to hear price-cutting because I've got a lot of retailers that are going full-price and non-promotional.\"\nDominion Energy Inc. : \"Dominion [has a] 4.4 percent yield. I like that compound. It's a well-run company. I know it's down because people are staying away from those kinds of stocks. I want you to buy it.\"\nMicron : \"You know what? Until I listen to [ Lam Research CEO] Martin Anstice on the Lam Research call, which is going on as I do the show, I cannot opine on what I think about Micron because I want to see whether the supply-demand has tipped. I have not liked the stock of late.\"\nLloyds Banking Group PLC : \"No. If we're going to do that, we're going to do Banco Santander . If we want to do a European bank, we want to do S-A-N.\"\nFirst Republic Bank : \"We like that stock. That's a good one. And by the way, can I just say I thought First Horizon was really, really good?\"\nAdvanced Micro Devices : \"I think it's not as good as Nvidia , but I want [CEO] Dr. Lisa Su to come on because it is an inexpensive stock, but it's got Intel against it and it's got Nvidia against it and those are very powerful opponents.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: US Concrete could go higher because of state spending 34 Mins Ago | 05:02 ",
