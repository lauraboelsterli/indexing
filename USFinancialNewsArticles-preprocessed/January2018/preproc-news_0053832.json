It did not give a timeline on how long the advisory review would take. \nThe Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which will nearly triple capacity on the 1,147-kilometer (712 mile) line to 890,000 barrels per day, was approved by the Canadian government in 2016. The line runs from Alberta’s energy heartland to a port in suburban Vancouver. \nWhile supported by the federal government, the province of Alberta and industry, the expansion is vehemently opposed by British Columbia, numerous local municipalities, many First Nation groups and environmental activists. \n($1 = 1.2323 Canadian dollars)",
