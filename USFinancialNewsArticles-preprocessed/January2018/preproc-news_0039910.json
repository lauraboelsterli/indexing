    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Acorn Paper announces the launch of a new division today, focused on meeting the paper, packaging, janitorial/sanitation and custom promotional needs of the Cannabis industry. Branded as Acorn Paper Cannabis Packaging (APCP), this division will address the entire cannabis supply chain to growers, manufacturers, distributors and consumer facing retail products. Acorn Paper is positioning itself to become a packaging industry thought leader in the fast-growing cannabis industry.\nTo lead this division, Acorn has hired Brad Davis as the APCP Product Category manager. A trailblazing senior sales, marketing and business development executive, Davis has a proven record leveraging innovation to drive revenue and market share growth. Davis' background includes several C-suite corporate sales executive posts, at major digital media organizations including Disney, AOL and Comcast. He also brings substantial experience with entrepreneurial initiatives. A recognized \"lifestyle brand expert\" in fashion, parties & events, he was recently recognized by Angeleno Magazine as one of Los Angeles' \"Modern Men.\"\nDavis will manage day to day operations of the division, including sales and marketing initiatives with general management responsibilities. Davis will work with the 90+ sellers in the Acorn Paper sales organization. Acorn Paper Cannabis Packaging will initially focus on the West Coast, but will offer a national footprint and e-commerce solutions in the coming year. Once launched, www.cannabispckg.com will be the destination URL.\nDavid Weissberg, CEO & President of Acorn, said, \"We recognize the tremendous opportunity that the cannabis industry presents to our company. This will be a $70B industry in just a few years, and Brad Davis is the perfectly positioned executive to lead our initiatives in the space.\"\nDavis is \"Proud to represent one of the largest privately held packaging companies on the west coast. With their long history of success and vertical focus in areas from agriculture to wine, addressing the needs of the entire cannabis supply chain is a natural addition to the Acorn family.\"\nAcorn Paper Cannabis Packaging has recently became a corporate sponsor of MJBA (Marijuana Business Association) and will have presence at tradeshows and conferences including MJBizCon throughout 2018.
