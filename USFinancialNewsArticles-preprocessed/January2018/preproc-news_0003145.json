    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) said today that its Board of Directors and Elliott have agreed to work collaboratively to promptly identify a new member to join the Alexion Board. Alexion announced in November that it had a search underway to fill an open Board seat and is seeking candidates who represent a range of backgrounds, perspectives, skills, and expertise, with an emphasis on maintaining a diverse Board.\nDavid Brennan, Chairman of Alexion’s Board of Directors, said, “This agreement is in line with our ongoing efforts to maintain active and constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders and to identify a new board member with a proven track record of building value. We have been actively working to expand and diversify our Board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion’s Board.”\nAn Elliott spokesperson stated, “Elliott is pleased to reach agreement with Alexion to identify a new independent director to join the Company’s Board of Directors. We are encouraged by actions taken under Ludwig’s leadership to improve financial performance and re-set Alexion’s strategy. Enhancing the strength of the Board is another step toward maximizing value creation for all shareholders.”\nAbout Alexion\nAlexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-changing therapies.
