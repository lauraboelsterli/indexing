    "text": "Nick Bonino, Kevin Fiala and P.K. Subban scored in the second period as the Nashville Predators tallied three unanswered goals to erase an early deficit en route to a 4-3 victory over the Florida Panthers on Saturday night in Nashville.\nFiala also had a first-period goal for the Predators, who won a fourth straight on their ongoing, five-game homestand. The win was Nashville’s fifth straight overall.\nVincent Trocheck, Derek MacKenzie and Keith Yandle scored for Florida, which has alternated losses and wins in its last five games.\nYandle’s goal, his fourth of the season, got Florida within 4-3 at the 8:34 mark of the third period, but the visitors couldn’t score again despite a 13-5 shot advantage in the final period.\nPekka Rinne had 37 saves for the Predators, who will go for a 5-0 home sweep when they host Tampa Bay on Tuesday.\nAfter Fiala opened the scoring just 36 seconds into the game, the Panthers took their first-period lead when Trocheck tallied on a power play and MacKenzie found the net at the 16:33 mark.\nThe goals were the 18th of the season for Trocheck, the second for MacKenzie.\nEach team got just one power-play opportunity in the game. Nashville failed to take advantage of its in the second period.\nBonino got the Predators even in the second minute of the second period with his seventh goal, before Fiala gave the hosts the lead for good at the 10:53 mark.\nBonino had an assist on both of Fiala’s goals, while Calle Jarnkrok assisted on all three of Nashville’s first three goals.\nThe pair of goals gave Fiala 13 for the season. It was his first two-goal game of the season.\nSubban’s eventual game-winner, his 10th goal of the season, came at the 16:29 mark and was assisted by Craig Smith and Kyle Turris.\nEvgenii Dadonov assisted on two of Florida’s three goals.\nIn what was the clubs’ first meeting of the season, Florida enjoyed a 40-29 advantage in shots.\nThe Panthers were opening a two-game trip that takes them to Dallas on Tuesday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
