    "text": "January 14, 2018 / 11:11 AM / Updated 10 hours ago HNA's Tianjin Tianhai says reports that firm plans to sell Ingram Micro are false Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co Ltd ( 600751.SS ), a unit of Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], said on Sunday that media reports that the firm planned to sell Ingram Micro were false. \nThe firm said the company was not involved in a situation as described by Chinese media reports, which said Tianjin Tianhai was looking to sell its U.S. electronics distributor subsidiary, Ingram Micro Inc, to Synnex Corp ( SNX.N ). \n“Ingram Micro is an important, strategic investment project to the company and is a key cornerstone and asset to the company’s transformation and development,” it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. \nIt said that Ingram Micro’s operating income in the third quarter grew 10.79 percent year-on-year and net profits rose 6.14 percent over the same period. \nTianjin Tianhai bought Ingram Micro last year for about $6 billion. The company on Friday halted share trading and said that it planned to disclose a “major plan”. Reporting by Brenda Goh, editing by Louise Heavens",
