    "text": "BOSTON, Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CloudHealth Technologies , the leader in cloud service management, today announced the appointment of Greg Nicastro as Chief Product Officer, a newly created position that will focus on building and scaling product teams globally. Nicastro's hire coincides with the sustained and significant evolution of the company's industry-leading cloud management platform, CloudHealth, which helps enterprises accelerate business transformation in the cloud.\n2018 promises to be another high growth year for the company. CloudHealth Technologies -- which named Tom Axbey as President and CEO in September -- is coming off a $46 million Series D funding round in June and planning to move to expanded global headquarters in downtown Boston. As CPO, Nicastro will play an integral role in seeing the company through its next phase, unifying and leading CloudHealth Technologies teams as they continue to develop cloud solutions that empower customers to control the problems associated with \"cloud chaos.\" Nicastro will be based in Boston and report directly to CEO Tom Axbey.\nNicastro comes to CloudHealth Technologies with over two decades of executive experience in leadership positions across the entire product lifecycle, including product management and corporate development, consulting and strategy. Prior to joining CloudHealth Technologies, he spent nearly six years with Veracode as Executive Vice President of Product Development, leading the company's transformation to the public cloud, while balancing a mandate for efficiency and security.\n\"In a rapidly scaling global company, it's critical that we maintain our momentum both internally, as we expand the team, and externally, as we work to provide ongoing customer value globally,\" said Tom Axbey, President and CEO, CloudHealth Technologies. \"As a former CloudHealth customer, Greg not only brings a valuable perspective--he also carries a successful track record with proven expertise in building world-class product teams. He will be critical in spearheading the next phase of growth and helping maintain our market leadership position.\"\n\"The CloudHealth story is built upon amazing people and technology,\" said Greg Dracon, Partner at .406 Ventures and member of the CloudHealth Technologies Board of Directors. \"Greg, who is coming fresh off a very successful run during his time at Veracode, is a tremendous hire and a testament to the ability of CloudHealth Technologies to attract top talent. He will help to propel the company's product teams into the next era of cloud transformation and growth on a global scale.\"\nNicastro's career experience to-date has provided him with both an ISV and an enterprise perspective, giving him a unique outlook on enterprise-class software development and delivery. Prior to Veracode, he was an EVP at Iron Mountain Corporate and Iron Mountain Digital. During his time there he led Product Management and was responsible for both IT Systems Development and Engineering.\nAbout CloudHealth Technologies\nCloudHealth, the recognized worldwide leader in the growing Cloud Service Management industry, provides integrated reporting, recommendations and active policy management to help companies control the problems associated with \"cloud chaos.\" Our comprehensive platform gives enterprise companies and MSPs the ability to visualize, optimize and govern their cloud and hybrid environments.
