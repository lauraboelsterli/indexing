    "text": "Vancouver, British Columbia , Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Future Farm Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “Future Farm”) ( CSE: FFT ) ( OTCQB: FFRMF ) is pleased to provide additional details regarding the previously announced plan to spin off its augmented reality business in the form of a stock dividend to Future Farm shareholders. The resulting new augmented reality (AR) company will issue 12,000,000 new shares to Future Farm shareholders, on a pro rata basis, to shareholders of record on the ex-dividend date, which is expected to occur within the next four months.\nThe new augmented reality company will be called NexTech AR Solutions Corp. (“NexTech”) and will trade on the CSE with a stock symbol to be announced at a later date. NexTech is expected to have a first mover advantage in bringing its patented next generation of AR to the cannabis industry and more. Upon spin-off, the two separate public companies are expected to have leading positions in their respective industries, and compelling growth opportunities.\nAugmented Reality Presentation\nAR Demo Video\nMr. William Gildea, CEO of Future Farm, comments, “We believe that this transaction will maximize our shareholder value and create a new and exciting public company, which will be one of the first augmented reality public companies on the CSE.”\nThe AR market is set to explode from a $10 billion market today to $120 billion in just the next two years as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel are now aggressively launching software and hardware to support this dynamic and fast-growing industry. Once this spin-off is complete, Future Farm shareholders will own shares in NexTech. The company will be occupying a very valuable niche, featuring augmented reality enhanced packaging as well as an ad-tech driven platform for dispensaries.\nOn behalf of the Board,\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc.\nWilliam Gildea, CEO & Chairman\nAbout Future Farm\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company with projects throughout North America including California, Florida and Maryland. The Company’s business model includes developing and acquiring technologies that will position it as a leader in the evolution of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) for the global production of various types of plants, with a focus on cannabis. Future Farm provides scalable, indoor CEA systems that utilize minimal land, water and energy regardless of climate, location or time of year and are customized to grow an abundance of crops close to consumers, therefore minimizing food miles and its impact to the environment. The Company holds an exclusive, worldwide license to use a patented vertical farming technology that, when compared to traditional plant production methods, generates yields up to 10 times greater per square foot of land. The contained system provides many other benefits including 90% less water, fertilizer and land used, less travel costs, seed to sale security, scalability, consistency due to year-round production, cost control, product safety and purity by eliminating environmental variability. The Company also utilizes a leading cannabis oil extraction technology, which enables the Company to process 20lbs/hour of cannabis plant to yield approximately 908 grams/hour of oil.\nThe Company is also in the business of designing and distributing LED lighting solutions utilizing the COB and MCOB technology. The Company is focused on delivering cost efficient lighting to North America via advanced e-commerce sites the Company owns and operates. LEDCanada.com , which caters to B2B customers, is a supplier of the newest and highest demand LED solutions. The Company also owns and operates COBGrowlights.com , which caters to both large and small agriculture green houses and controlled cultivation centers.\nThe Company recently acquired the exclusive right to use a patented, augmented reality (AR) technology in the cannabis industry. As described in more detail above, the Company has decided to spin this asset off to its shareholders.\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Market Regulator (as that term is defined in the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. The Canadian Securities Exchange has not in any way passed upon the merits of the proposed transaction and has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this press release.\nThis news release may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
