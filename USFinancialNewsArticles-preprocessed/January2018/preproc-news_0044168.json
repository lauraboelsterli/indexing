We must do so with attention, as it is (an industry with) sensitive companies, but we must face the challenge,” Calenda said at a conference in Rome organised by Italian companies’ association Confindustria and its French peer Medef. \nIn September Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri ( FCT.MI ) took effective control of French rival STX France under a shared ownership agreement. \nThe move set the conditions to explore the creation of a Franco-Italian naval defence group, merging France’s Naval group with Fincantieri.
