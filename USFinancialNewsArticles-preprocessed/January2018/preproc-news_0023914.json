    "text": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York. \nJohn Chambers , the ex-CEO of Cisco who spent 20 years running the networking giant before stepping down in 2015, is turning his attention to venture capital. \nThe self-funded firm, JC2 Ventures , will back at least a dozen companies that have the potential to go public, according to multiple media reports . Chambers will focus on areas like the Internet of Things, digital communications, security and agriculture. \nThe firm has 8 companies in its portfolio so far, including drone software developer Airware and social media management company Sprinklr. I’m thrilled to announce the launch of JC2 Ventures! Our mission is to change the world by investing in #startups across industries & geographies that share our passion for solving major issues using digital tech. Check out our new website for more. https://t.co/L59zlEYBYT — John T. Chambers (@JohnTChambers) January 16, 2018 \nAs CEO and chairman of Cisco, Chambers guided the company through the dot-com bubble and bust as well as the recession. He left the chairman role in December. \nChambers has been outspoken about the issues facing Silicon Valley, including how the lack of IPOs could dampen job growth. He said late last year that he wanted to \"change the world\" with start-up investing and that he wanted to see at least one female interviewed for each opening in a start-up. \nChambers told CNBC that he thought tax reform and reduced regulation from the Republican party would help start-ups. Changes to the tax code, he said, would allow companies to bring cash back to the U .S. at a tax rate, giving them a bigger incentive to make acquisitions. ",
