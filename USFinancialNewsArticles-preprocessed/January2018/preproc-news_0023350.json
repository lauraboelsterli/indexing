We didn’t make a bogey, we made quite a few birdies and in foursomes that’s going to be hard to beat, really,” Englishman Fleetwood said after the match. \n“I won’t mind playing doubles again, I have really enjoyed playing this team game... Looking forward to the singles and we will see where we are at the end of the day.” \nBritons Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton then picked up a 2 and 1 win against An Byeong-un of South Korea and Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat as Europe moved ahead. \nMatthew Fitzpatrick and Thomas Pieters then gave Europe a two point-lead with a 3 and 2 win against Kang Sung-hoon and Poom Saksansin in the fourth match of the day. \nAsia needed something special to stop the rot and the Japanese-Malaysian pairing of Yuta Ikeda and Gavin Green stepped up to the plate by winning three of the last four holes for a rousing 1-up win over Alex Levy and Rafa Cabrera. \nThai teen Phachara Khongwatmai and Hideto Tanihara leveled the score with a 2 and 1 win over Paul Dunne and Alex Noren, before Li Haotong and Nicholas Fung put Asia back in front with a 3 and 1 victory against Bernd Wiesberger and Ross Fisher.
