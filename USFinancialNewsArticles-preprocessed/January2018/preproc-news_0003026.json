(Photo: Minnesota Masonic Charities)\nFor nearly 30 years, the Scottish Rite Foundation has sponsored the Clinic for Childhood Language Disorders, which has diagnosed and treated children in Northeastern Minnesota and Northwestern Wisconsin. Services at the Clinic are provided without charge. In becoming an affiliate of MMC, the Clinic will remain a Masonic organization and be able to continue to provide critical treatment to children desperate to communicate.\nThe partnership between the two organizations is not a new one. MMC has long recognized the important work provided by the Clinic and has supported its efforts through annual Mission grants. The integration secures the Clinic’s ability to provide critical interventions and remediation of childhood language disorders in perpetuity with the goal of expanding operations.\n“We have a saying at Minnesota Masonic Charities: Stronger Together,” said Eric Neetenbeek, president and CEO of Minnesota Masonic Charities. “That is certainly true in this case. The Scottish Rite Clinic has done an outstanding job of serving this community. By coming together, we will be stronger, and we will serve more.”\nFor more information regarding the Scottish Rite Clinic for Childhood Language Disorders, please visit scottishriteclinicduluth.org or MnMasonicCharities.org .\nAbout Minnesota Masonic Charities\nAmong the largest grant-making organizations in the state, Minnesota Masonic Charities (MMC) is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization that represents the charitable interests of Minnesota Masonry.
