    "text": "Getty Images Jimmy Iovine Apple executive Jimmy Iovine — a longstanding link between Apple and the music industry — could leave his role at Apple Music this year, a Billboard report says.\nUnnamed sources told Billboard, as well as industry blog Hits Daily Double , that Iovine's departure might be timed around the vesting of his stake in Apple in August.\nApple declined to comment to CNBC.\nIovine's departure would come at a key time for Apple, which has staked the release of its smart speaker, HomePod, around its identity as a music technology pioneer, even as Spotify aims to go public.\nAs a boss at Interscope, Iovine helped Steve Jobs make iTunes a reality, and later joined Apple as part of its acquisition of Beats. That 2014 deal was worth $3 billion, with approximately $400 million of that vesting over time .\nBut Iovine, who is in his 60s, has openly flouted the business behind music streaming companies , even in his role at Apple Music.\nFor more on the story, see the report from Billboard.\nWATCH: Iovine on Apple, Beats deal show chapters Iovine on Apple, Beats deal 8:00 AM ET Thu, 29 May 2014",
