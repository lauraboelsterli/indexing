    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 5:23 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Van Persie comes full circle with return to Feyenoord Bart Meijer 3 Min Read \nROTTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch soccer star Robin van Persie returned to his home ground on Monday as he signed with Feyenoord Rotterdam hoping for a positive ending to his dwindling career. \nVan Persie completed the free transfer from Turkish side Fenerbahce, having not played since a knee last August raised questions over the long-term fitness of the 34-year-old former Arsenal and Manchester United player. \n”I have made a fantastic journey since leaving Feyenoord 14 years ago, but I‘m happy to return now,“ he told reporters at Feyenoord’s De Kuip stadium. ”I hope to bring a lot to this team, but we’ll have to wait and see what’s possible. \n“I have trained with the team today and I feel good. But feeling good is not the same as being able to play matches and it will certainly take time before I reach that level.” \nHaving spent two frustrating years at Fenerbahce, Van Persie will hope to mimic the glorious return to Rotterdam of former national team mate Dirk Kuyt, who retired in May after securing Feyenoord’s first league title in 18 years. \nBut memories of that long-awaited trophy are fading fast, with Feyenoord already trailing league leaders PSV Eindhoven by 17 points halfway through the season. Robin van Persie attends a news conference, after the Dutch player signed a contract with Feyenoord, in Rotterdam, Netherlands January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Cris Toala Olivares \nFeyenoord clearly lacked offensive creativity in their 2-0 defeat against Ajax Amsterdam on Sunday, but Van Persie warned against too high hopes of his return. \n“I mainly hope to help younger players by setting an example, like experienced players such as (Dennis) Bergkamp, (Thierry) Henry and (Patrick) Vieira helped me at Arsenal,” Van Persie said of his expected role at Feyenoord.
