    "text": "U.S. government debt yields rose Wednesday ahead of key economic data.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.658 percent at 11:21 a.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was higher at 2.945 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- Existing homes sales continued their downward slide in December as the supply of houses on the market dropped to a record low, according to the latest housing data. Sales fell 3.6 percent in December vs. a 1.5 percent fall expected.\nOver the weekend, the U.S. government shut down after a bill that would have kept it funded was voted down in the Senate. This marked the first U.S. government shutdown since 2013 .\nShutdown concerns lingered on Wall Street on Monday ; however, by the end of trade, major indexes hit all-time highs after it emerged the Senate had enough votes to stop the shutdown. They continued to post strong gains during Tuesday's session.\nHowever, concerns over trade weighed on sentiment overseas, after President Donald Trump approved tariffs on solar cells and washing machines imported to the U.S. on Tuesday. South Korea said it would bring the matter to the World Trade Organization.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nThe U.S. Treasury is set to auction $34 billion in five-year notes.\nInvestors will be looking out for key headlines from the World Economic Forum (WEF) should any industry or national leaders comment on global growth or the state of the U.S. economy. The European Central Bank will be delivering its latest monetary policy decisions Thursday.",
