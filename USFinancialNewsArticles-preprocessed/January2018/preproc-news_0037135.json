    "text": "PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - French Energy Minister Nicolas Hulot said the government has discussed the possibility of putting state-owned utility EDF’s nuclear activities in a separate legal unit, but added that nothing had been decided.\nHe also said that building a new-model EPR nuclear reactor in France was not a priority for now.\nAsked whether putting EDF’s nuclear activities in a separate legal unit was an option that had been discussed by the government, Hulot said: “This is one of the scenarios that are on the table, but there is no preferred option at this point”.\n“This is part of the suggestions, but no single solution has a preference,” Hulot told reporters at a news conference held to mark the beginning of the new year.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
