( bit.ly/2A7nOIj ) \nAbout 110 Agilis Steerable Introducer Sheath devices made and distributed between Jan. 1 and May 5 are a part of the Class I recall, according to the FDA. ( bit.ly/2lFe3N6 ) \nA Class I recall is the strictest form of recall issued by the health regulator, in situations where the use of faulty devices may cause serious injury or death. \nJohnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
