Knight-Ludvigson brings over a decade of experience building world-class marketing organizations and helping companies to accelerate their go-to-market strategies.\nJulie Knight, Chief Marketing Officer\nKnight-Ludvigson joins MOVE Guides from her role as CMO of Reflektive, a provider of real-time performance management solutions sold to HR leaders for use across their workforces. Before that, she was vice president, Global Enterprise Marketing at Zendesk and senior vice president, Global Marketing at SAP, where she saw all manner of integrated marketing activities for the company. She joined SAP through the SuccessFactors acquisition, where she led Global Marketing. She holds a bachelor’s degree from University of California, Berkeley and has participated in Columbia University’s executive education program.\nBrynne Kennedy, founder and CEO of MOVE Guides, said, “As MOVE Guides transforms global talent mobility, having a leader with Julie’s extensive background in marketing enterprise solutions to HR leaders is a critical ingredient to our success. We’re thrilled to welcome Julie to the company and to the leadership team.”\nKnight-Ludvigson commented, “Global relocation represents an untapped frontier for enterprises struggling to differentiate through talent. The future of work depends on HR leaders placing talent where and when it’s needed in order to quickly capitalize on key business opportunities and growth objectives. I am excited to join MOVE Guides; it’s a company that’s driving such a sea change in human resources through its expertise in talent mobility solutions.”\nHaving disrupted traditional relocation management, MOVE Guides is turning workforce mobility into a true competitive advantage.
