    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 7:18 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Top U.S. House Democrat wants to call 'dozens' more witnesses in Russia probe Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday there are dozens of witnesses he would like called before the panel as it investigates whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions attended a closed door interview with the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol in Washington, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nThose witnesses would include Trump’s daughter Ivanka and Steve Bannon, his former adviser, U.S. Representative Adam Schiff told reporters. He also said he would like Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner to appear again before the committee while noting that the choice of witnesses is determined by the panel’s Republican leadership.
