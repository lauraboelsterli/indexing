The bid will be subject to Takeda and its affiliates owning at least 85% of the securities of TiGenix with voting rights or giving access to voting rights on a fully diluted basis, as well as the following conditions precedent: the absence of a material adverse effect occurring after the date of this announcement, Cx601 obtaining European Medicines Agency approval and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S. The European Medicines Agency approval for Cx601 is expected during the first half of 2018.\nConsistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to review of the final bid prospectus, the bid is unanimously supported by TiGenix' board of directors, who will provide its formal response to the proposed takeover bid in a response memorandum which it will issue in due course in accordance with the applicable legal provisions.

Cx601 has been filed for regulatory approval in Europe and a global Phase III trial intended to support a future U.S. Biologic License Application (BLA) started in 2017. TiGenix has entered into a licensing agreement with Takeda, a global pharmaceutical company active in gastroenterology, under which Takeda acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Cx601 for complex perianal fistulas outside the U.S. TiGenix' second adipose-derived product, Cx611, is undergoing a Phase Ib/IIa trial in severe sepsis - a major cause of mortality in the developed world. Finally, AlloCSC-01, targeting acute ischemic heart disease, has demonstrated positive results in a Phase I/II trial in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). TiGenix is headquartered in Leuven (Belgium) and has operations in Madrid (Spain) and Cambridge, MA (USA).
