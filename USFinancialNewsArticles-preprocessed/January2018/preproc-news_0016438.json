    "text": "January 10, 2018 / 11:48 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Jimmy Iovine says not leaving Apple: Variety Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Music mogul Jimmy Iovine is committed to staying at Apple Inc’s music streaming service, according to a report by Variety on Tuesday. Chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Jimmy Iovine reacts to a question during the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy inaugural Symposium in Los Angeles California, September 24, 2012. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo \n\"I am committed to doing whatever Eddy [Cue], Tim [Cook] and Apple need me to do, to help wherever and however I can, to take this all the way,\" Iovine told the publication in an interview. ( bit.ly/2CX1xmI ) \nLast week, Billboard magazine reported that Iovine would leave Apple Music in August. The report also stated that his departure is likely timed to his Apple shares fully vesting. \n“All this stuff you’re seeing in the newspapers, let me tell you, my stock vested a long time ago,” Iovine told Variety. \nIovine, best known as the co-founder of Interscope Records, joined Apple in 2014 after the company bought Beats Electronics, a company that he co-founded with hip-hop artist and producer Dr Dre for $3 billion. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
