    "text": "TUBAS, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian mother Ezzeya Daraghmeh opens up a pillowcase and pulls out large clumps of her multi-colored hair that she has kept for nearly seven decades.\nEzzeya Daraghmeh, an 82-year-old Palestinian woman who said she has kept parts of her hair she cut over 67 years, stuffs a pillow with her hair in the West Bank town of Tubas January 2, 2018. Picture taken January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Raneen Sawafta “I like my hair and I hate to throw it away. Even when Icomb my hair or wash it I keep the hair that falls off,” the 82-year-old told Reuters at her home in Tubas in the West Bank.\nDaraghmeh started collecting her hair when she was 15, storing the different shades of black, brown, grey and white colored locks in a mattress before opting to use it to stuff three big pillows in her home.\nShe uses the hair pillows as decoration.\n“God is great, all this hair came from a single head, myhead,” she said.\nReporting by Raneen Sawafta and Nidal al-Mughrabi.
