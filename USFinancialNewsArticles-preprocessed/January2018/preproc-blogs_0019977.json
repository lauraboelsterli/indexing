    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of MoneyGram International Inc ( MGI.O ) jumped 10.5 percent on Thursday, after the money-transfer company said it partnered with blockchain firm and bitcoin-rival Ripple.\nAs part of the arrangement, MoneyGram will test the use of Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, to move funds in a faster and cheaper way.\nRipple, created by the founder of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has risen 31,000 percent over the past year, overshadowing bitcoin’s 1,200 percent increase.\nXRP rose 13 percent to $13.38 on Thursday, according to coinmarketcap.com.\nMany see it as a close contender to bitcoin, which is by far the biggest cryptocurrency with a market value of more than $250 billion.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren XRP allows banks and payment companies to send money quickly, no matter the location. Its transaction fee, at just “fractions of a penny”, is also comparable to bitcoin’s $30 per transaction fee.\nSeveral companies such as UBS ( UBSG.S ) and Santander ( SAN.MC ) already use Ripple’s products to enable payments. In November 2017, American Express Co ( AXP.N ) also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.\nChina's Ant Financial's deal to buy MoneyGram for $1.2 billion collapsed last week.
