    "text": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail on Thursday reported a rise in nine-month revenue, helped by higher parcel volumes and strength in its international business.\nThe postal and parcel delivery company said revenue rose 2 percent for the nine months ended Dec. 24, with revenue at its European parcels business climbing 10 percent.\nRoyal Mail, which has been in a row with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) over plans to replace the company’s defined benefit pension scheme, added it was making progress in talks with its unions.
