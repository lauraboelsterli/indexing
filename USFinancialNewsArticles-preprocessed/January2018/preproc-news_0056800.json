    "text": " 25 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Qualcomm reports quarterly loss on $6 billion tax charge Reuters Staff 1   Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) on Wednesday reported a loss for the first fiscal quarter as the chipmaker took a $6 billion (4.24 billion pounds) one-time charge because of new U.S. tax laws. \nNet loss attributable to Qualcomm was $5.95 billion or $4.03 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 24, compared to a profit of $682 million or 46 cents   \nRevenue rose 1.2 percent to $6.07 billion. \nThe results come as Qualcomm tries to fend off a $103 billion takeover bid by Broadcom ( AVGO.O ) and close its long-pending deal to buy automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors ( NXPI.O ).
