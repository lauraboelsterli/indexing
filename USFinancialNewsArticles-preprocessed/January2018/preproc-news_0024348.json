    "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GigCapital, Inc. (NYSE: GIG.U) (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation that is an emerging-growth blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, also known as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, today announced that holders of the Company’s public units may elect to separately trade the common stock, rights and warrants underlying such public units commencing on January 17, 2018. Each public unit consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1⁄10) of one share of common stock upon the Company’s completion of an initial business combination and three-fourths (3⁄4) of one warrant to purchase one share of common stock for an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share of common stock. For each public unit, a whole share of common stock and a whole right will be issued. Furthermore, although each public unit also contains three-quarters (3⁄4) of one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the public units and only whole warrants will trade. In addition, only whole warrants are exercisable. Those public units not separated will continue to trade under the symbol “GIG.U”. The common stock, rights and warrants are expected to trade under the symbols “GIG,” “GIG RT”, and “GIG WS”, respectively. Holders of the public units will need to have their brokers contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, in order to separate the public units into shares of common stock, rights and warrants.\nThe units were initially offered by the Company in an underwritten offering and Cowen and Chardan acted as bookrunners for the offering.\nRegistration statements relating to the offering of the public units and the underlying securities have been filed by the Company and were declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 7, 2017 and December 8, 2017, respectively.\nA final prospectus relating to and describing the final terms of the offering of the public units has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov or may be obtained from Cowen and Company, LLC c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY, 11717, Attn: Prospectus Department. Phone (631) 274-2806 / Fax (631) 254-7140. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout GigCapital, Inc.\nGigCapital, Inc.
