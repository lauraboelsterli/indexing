    "text": "January 4, 2018 / 7:19 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Debenhams' Christmas nightmare sours mood on UK high street Paul Sandle 5 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Department store group Debenhams ( DEB.L ) slashed its annual profit forecast on Thursday after it was forced to cut prices to drive sales of Christmas gifts, illustrating the challenges facing some of Britain’s best known retailers. People walk past a Debenhams store in Stockport, Britain January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Phil Noble \nShares in the 240-year-old company slumped as much as 24 percent after the mid-market retailer rushed out sales figures a week earlier than expected. \nIts performance underlines the threat to traditional British retailers from online competition, a decline in demand for clothing and pressure on consumer spending. \nChief Executive Sergio Bucher said customers had “come late to Christmas”, and when they did start shopping its gifts were not special enough to encourage them to buy without discounts. \n“Gifting has become very promotional,” he told reporters. “In hindsight, if I’d do anything different I think my gifting pipeline would be more premium and differentiated.” \nDebenhams is second ranked in department stores by sales value to John Lewis, which said on Wednesday its sales in the week before Christmas rose 8.9 percent. \nBucher said a raspberry-flavoured gin flew off the shelves, but lower priced items at Debenhams such as cards and decorations did not appeal. \nIt held its ground in a declining clothing market, he added, and stronger demand for beauty and food helped drive a 1.2 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the six weeks before Christmas. \nBut shoppers did not return for the post-Christmas sale, resulting in more price cuts and a further dent to margins. \nTrade in September and October had also been poor, contributing to an overall 2.6 percent fall in underlying British sales in the 17 weeks to 30 December. NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL \nBucher, a former Amazon ( AMZN.O ) and Inditex executive, who joined Debenhams in 2016, set out a plan to revive the company in April, centred on closing a few stores, revamping others, cutting promotions and improving its online offer.

Its shares were down 2 percent. \nThe price cuts took a toll on its margins, with gross margin seen down by about 150 basis points in the first half, far below its target of a 25 basis point fall for the year to September 2018. \nIt said its profit before tax for the year was now likely to be in the range of 55-65 million pounds. \nDebenhams reported underlying profit before tax of 95 million pounds last year and analysts had been expecting a figure of 83 million pounds in 2018, according to Reuters data.
