    "text": "January 8, 2018 / 7:04 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Perrigo hires Gerresheimer ex-boss Rohrhoff as new CEO Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Generic drugmaker Perrigo Company Plc appointed Uwe Rohrhoff, former CEO of Gerresheimer AG, as its new chief executive, the company said on Monday. \nRohrhoff succeeds John Hendrickson, who will resign as CEO and board member on Jan. 15, Perrigo said. \nRohrhoff was the CEO of Gerresheimer for seven years when he left the German pharmaceuticals company in August 2017. \nPerrigo said in June Hendrickson planned to retire after a little more than a year into the job. Hendrickson joined the company in 1989 and became CEO in April 2016. \nIn February 2017, Perrigo’s then chief financial officer Judy Brown stepped down and joined Amgen Inc. Ronald Winowiecki was appointed acting CFO. \nPerrigo had suspended its search for a CFO during its search for Hendrickson’s successor as CEO, the company said in a regulatory filing in July.
