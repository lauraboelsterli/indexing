Her career history includes serving as Director of Foundations and Corporate Relations for the Salvation Army, chair of the Sacramento Chapter of the National Latina Business Women Association, Advertising Manager and Social Editor of Comstock’s Magazine and serving as a senior executive in the administrations of two California governors.
