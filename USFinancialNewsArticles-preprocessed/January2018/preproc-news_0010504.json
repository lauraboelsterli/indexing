    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq:GNMK), a leading provider of automated, multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems, today provided preliminary operational and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nTotal revenue for 2017 expected to be approximately $52.5 million, representing an increase of 7% over 2016 Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 expected to be approximately $16.0 million, representing an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter of 2016\nOperational Highlights\nPlaced 49 ePlex ® analyzers in the fourth quarter of 2017 Finished the quarter with an installed base of 196 ePlex analyzers in U.S. and European labs Launched ePlex NP targeting customers with lower testing volumes, contributing to fourth quarter placements Initiated the first of three clinical trials for the ePlex BCID family of panels\n“Our commercial teams delivered another quarter of strong ePlex placements. With a growing portion of this installed base now in routine clinical use, ePlex is beginning to make a meaningful contribution to our revenues. We expect this trend to continue in 2018, based on the strength of our sales funnel and the changes we are making to optimize our approach in Europe,\" said Hany Massarany, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are also delighted with the recent launch of ePlex NP – a new configuration of the ePlex system designed to improve patient access to multiplex molecular diagnostics and drive ePlex adoption in lower volume testing sites,” added Massarany.\nThese preliminary results are based on management's initial analysis of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and are subject to further internal review and audit by the company's external auditors. The company expects to issue full 2017 financial results and 2018 guidance in late February.\nAbout GenMark Diagnostics\nGenMark Diagnostics (NASDAQ:GNMK) is a leading provider of multiplex molecular diagnostic solutions designed to enhance patient care, improve key quality metrics, and reduce the total cost-of-care.
