Eric Dier hit the post for the visitors after a corner was not cleared and Moussa Sissoko almost deflected in a low centre from Davies. \nAt the other end Southampton centre-half Jack Stephens was left unmarked but headed over the bar from a fine cross by James Ward-Prowse. \nTwo Argentine coaches, Mauricio Pellegrino and Mauricio Pochettino, turned to their substitutes’ benches in an attempt to liven up the later stages. Soccer Football - Premier League - Southampton vs Tottenham Hotspur - St Mary's Stadium, Southampton, Britain - January 21, 2018 Tottenham’s Davinson Sanchez after the match REUTERS/David Klein \nAttacking players Sofiane Boufal and 17 year-old Michael Obafemi, making his league debut, came on for Southampton and Erik Lamela appeared for Spurs, who made the better chances overall. \nLamela was crowded out four metres from goal, Dele Alli went close from 20 metres and Kane, who scored a hat-trick in the win at Christmas, shot across goal, leaving him to wait for his 30th of the season in all competitions. \nObafemi, one of Southampton’s youngest ever players, missed a glorious opportunity, however, when he side-footed wide shortly after coming on.
