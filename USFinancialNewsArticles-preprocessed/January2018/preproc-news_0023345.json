    "text": "Spencer Dinwiddie hit the go-ahead layup with 11 seconds remaining and scored seven of his 20 points in the final 2 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter, as the Brooklyn Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-105 Friday night at Phillips Arena in Atlanta.\nDinwiddie helped the Nets finish the game with a 9-2 run in the final 85 seconds. He gave the Nets the lead for good when he rebounded a missed layup by Dennis Schroder and converted the layup while being fouled by Malcolm Delaney.\nAfter Dinwiddie missed the foul shot, he grabbed the rebound with nine seconds left and sank two free throws for a 108-105 margin.\nFollowing a timeout, Schroder missed a layup with five seconds remaining and was called for traveling after the Hawks grabbed the rebound. The Nets finished it off when Caris LeVert dunked with three seconds remaining.\nDinwiddie nearly recorded his first career triple-double, totaling 10 assists and matching a career best with nine rebounds. He posted his first career game with 20 points and 10 assists, as the Nets broke a three-game losing streak.\nSchroder led all scorers with a career-high 34 points on 14-of-26 shooting. He scored 11 of his points in the fourth and added seven assists.\nSchroderâ€™s final assist was to Dewayne Dedmon, who buried an open 3-pointer to give Atlanta a 99-94 lead with 2:37 remaining.\nJahlil Okafor added 17 points for the Nets, who shot 46 percent and made eight of their last nine shots. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 14, while DeMarre Carroll contributed 13 for Brooklyn.\nKent Bazemore added 16 and Dedmon contributed 11 before fouling out for Atlanta, which did not take its first lead until late in the third quarter.\nThe Nets held a 53-50 lead by halftime, opened the third with a 9-2 run and took a 63-52 lead on a Dinwiddie 3-pointer with 8:19 remaining. Atlanta countered with a 17-5 run to take a 70-68 lead on a 3-pointer by Bazemore with 2:25 left.\nThe teams went into the fourth in a 74-74 deadlock after LeVert missed a drive to the rim and Tyler Dorsey missed a 3-pointer for Atlanta.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
