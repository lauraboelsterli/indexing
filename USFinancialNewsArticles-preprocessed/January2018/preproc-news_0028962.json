GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. House passes short-term spending bill; sends to Senate Legislation to avoid a U.S. government shutdown at midnight on Friday advanced in Congress, as the House of Representatives on Thursday night approved an extension of federal funds through Feb. 16, although the bill faced uncertain prospects in the Senate. • SoftBank is now Uber's largest shareholder as deal closes A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp closed a deal with Uber Technologies Inc on Thursday, making SoftBank the largest stakeholder in the ride-services firm and providing a much-needed boost to controversy-ridden Uber. • Outback Australians grounded as pilot crisis worsens A recruitment drive by Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd after a seven-year hiatus is exacerbating shortages of pilots at regional air services that provide a lifeline to remote communities in the country's sparsely populated Outback. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,823.00, trading up 0.1 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely trade higher against the dollar in early session, tracking gains in most Asian currencies and a fall in global crude oil prices, even as the U.S. Congress passed a short-term spending bill to avoid government closure. • Indian government bonds are likely to fall in early trade ahead of a weekly auction of notes and tracking overnight gains in U.S. Treasury yields. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 pct bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.45 pct-7.50 pct band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street fell on Thursday as losses in industrials and interest-rate sensitive sectors offset marginal gains in tech stocks. • Asia stocks edged higher and were within reach of record highs, although losses on Wall Street slowed the advance, while worries over a possible U.S. government shutdown weighed on the dollar. • The U.S. dollar was lodged near a three-year low against a basket of currencies with fears over a possible U.S. government shutdown adding to its underlying woes stemming from its eroding yield advantage. • Yields on U.S. 10-year notes reached a 10-month high on Thursday after China reported fourth-quarter growth that accelerated for the first time in seven years. • Oil prices fell on a bounce-back in U.S. production, but ongoing declines in crude inventories curbed losses in the market. • Gold prices edged up, supported by a weaker dollar and worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown, but the precious metal was still on track for its first weekly drop in six weeks.
