REUTERS/Andres Stapff TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY \nAl-Attiyah, driving a Toyota Hilux, ended the day with a 25- second lead over Dutch team mate Bernhard ten Brinke after the 35km special stage through the sand dunes around Pisco, down the coast from Lima. \nWhile they enjoyed a trouble-free run, nine-times world rally champion Sebastian Loeb had a harder time and was six minutes off the lead after suffering brake issues with his Peugeot. \nLoeb said his brakes failed after three kilometres of the stage, with the handbrake also failing. \n”We went slowly, doing our best not to get stuck or bogged down,“ said the Frenchman. ”There were dunes with steep descents, so I had to stop accelerating 200 metres before that to avoid any risks. \n“It was quite tricky, driving without brakes is exasperating. It was a difficult start,” he told the dakar.com website.

REUTERS/Andres Stapff \nPeugeot’s reigning champion Stephane Peterhansel of France, who is chasing a 14th Dakar win, was in 11th place and two minutes 15 seconds off the pace. \nPortuguese soccer manager Andre Villas Boas, entering his first Dakar, was in 46th place and 11 minutes behind al-Attiyah’s time.
