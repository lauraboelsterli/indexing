    "text": " 18 p.m. ET Share \nFormer Trump aide says he regrets delay in responding to book Getty Images Steve Bannon, seen at the White House last February. \nBy Harriet Torry Rebecca Ballhaus \nWASHINGTON — Former Trump senior strategist Stephen Bannon expressed regret Sunday for his role in a new book critical of   as senior White House officials sharpened the administration’s attack on it. \n“My support is also unwavering for the president and his agenda,” Bannon said in the statement. “I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr has diverted attention from the president’s historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency.” \nRead: Paul Brandus: Donald Trump has badly misplayed the Michael Wolff book \nThe book, “Fire   House” by Michael Wolff, quotes Bannon as speculating whether Donald Trump Jr. may have introduced those who attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin and top campaign aides to President Donald Trump. “The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero,” the book said. \nIn his statement Sunday, which was first reported by Axios, Bannon expressed “regret” to the Trump family and praised Donald Trump Jr. as “both a patriot and a good man.”",
