(OTCQB: CLSH) “CLS,” a development stage diversified cannabis company operating as Cannabis Life Science, today announced comments from Oasis Cannabis on Nevada’s continuation of delivery services of marijuana to local residents.\nOasis Cannabis has been successfully operating a delivery service to medical patients since opening in 2015, and adult-use marijuana to residents since last August.\nThe State of Nevada has approved new rules for the local cannabis industry, which include allowing delivery services to continue operating. The Nevada state legislative committee is expected to formally adopt the regulations into law in the next several weeks.\nInterviewed on local news, Ben Sillitoe, CEO and Co-Founder of Oasis Cannabis, commented, \"Delivery service has been a part of our business model since inception and is really about convenience for the consumer. Our internal process and systems have been designed for safe and convenient same day delivery service.”\nhttp://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/marijuana-home-delivery-services-will-continue/922035173\nOasis Cannabis is a fully integrated cannabis operation in Nevada. Las Vegas-based Oasis Cannabis’ ( http://oasiscannabis.com ) operations include a grow, extraction, conversion and processing facility, and a retail dispensary.

The closing of the transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction of conditions, is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.\nAbout Oasis Cannabis ( http://oasiscannabis.com )\nOasis Cannabis has operated a cannabis dispensary in the Las Vegas market since dispensaries first opened in Nevada in 2015 and has been recognized as one of the top marijuana retailers in the state. Its location within walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown Las Vegas in combination with its delivery service to residents allows it to efficiently serve both locals and tourists in the Las Vegas area. The company recently commenced wholesale offerings of cannabis in Nevada with the launch of its City Trees brand of cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products in August 2017. An expansion of its cultivation and production facility is currently underway and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2018.\nDisclaimer\nCLS Holdings USA has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oasis Cannabis, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
