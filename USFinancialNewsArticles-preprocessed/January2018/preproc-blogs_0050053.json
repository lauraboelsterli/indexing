    "text": "President Donald Trump told CNBC on Thursday that undocumented young people in the United States should be able to stay in the country.\n\"These are good people. These are good people that should be able to stay in this country,\" he said in an exclusive interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nIn a snippet aired on NBC's \"Nightly News,\" Trump said that he would consider it a \"great achievement\" to find a solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — a program that his administration ended in September. DACA protects about 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.\nLater Thursday, a Republican source told CNBC that the White House is expected to support a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants who were either shielded by DACA, or eligible for the Obama-era program.\n— Reporting by CNBC's Joe Kernen .\nProgramming note: CNBC's full interview of President Trump will air on \" Squawk Box \" at 6 a.m. ET Friday.",
