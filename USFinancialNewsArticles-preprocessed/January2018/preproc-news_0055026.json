    "text": "Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple Inc violated securities laws concerning its disclosures that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\nThe government has requested information from the company, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. bloom.bg/2DQhxaU\nThe chairman of a U.S. Senate committee overseeing business issues asked Apple to answer questions about its disclosures, Reuters reported earlier this month.\nApple did not respond to request for comment.\nThe company admitted earlier in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems.\nApple said the problem was that aging lithium batteries delivered power unevenly, which could cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside.
