    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Revelstoke Capital Partners (“Revelstoke”), a Denver-based private equity firm, announced today that its portfolio company Upstream Rehabilitation Inc. together with certain of its affiliates (“Upstream”) has completed the acquisition of Drayer Physical Therapy Institute, LLC (“DPTI”). Certain DPTI shareholders, including Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, rolled over a portion of their proceeds in exchange for a minority ownership stake in Upstream. In addition to the DPTI transaction, Upstream announced that it has completed four additional add-on acquisitions: Personal Injury Network Northwest (Washington), Rocky Mountain Sport and Spine (Colorado), Lincoln City Physical Therapy (Oregon) and Southern Physical Therapy (Tennessee).\n“Upstream and DPTI share similar cultures and a strong commitment to clinical excellence and compliance. We see a tremendous opportunity to combine the strengths and capabilities of both companies, while maintaining the portfolio of brands from each, to continue to grow and be the provider and employer of choice in the industry,” said David Van Name, CEO and founder of Upstream.\n“Since we invested in Upstream in December 2015, the company has nearly tripled in size driven by above-market same-clinic growth, approximately 100 de novo clinic openings and 12 add-on acquisitions.
