    "text": " 50 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Lockheed enhances capability of its Aegis missile-defense system Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 11 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said on Thursday it had connected key components of its new long-range discrimination radar (LRDR) with its Aegis Ashore missile-defense system to enhance Aegis’s capabilities. \nWith this technology, the Aegis missile-defense system - a collection of radar stations and interceptors - will be simultaneously able to detect threats from longer distances and combat targets with reduced reaction time, the U.S. weapons maker said. \nIn December, Japan decided to expand its ballistic missile defense system with Lockheed’s ground-based Aegis in response to a growing threat from North Korean rockets. \nJapan intends to build two Aegis Ashore batteries that will likely cost at least $2 billion and are not expected to be operational at least until 2023. \nRaytheon Co’s solid-state radar offering, SPY-6, would be a competitor to Lockheed’s improved offering.
