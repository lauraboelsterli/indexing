    "text": "(Corrects asset figure, paragraph 8)\nBy Diptendu Lahiri and Trevor Hunnicutt\nJan 12 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as investors flooded into the world’s biggest asset manager’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nThe company’s profit was boosted by a $1.2 billion gain related to the recent enactment of the U.S. tax laws, and the company also raised its quarterly cash dividend by 15 percent.\nBooming markets drove demand for index-tracking ETFs in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, and helped push the assets BlackRock oversees past $6 trillion.\n“We’re winning more and more clients, and we’re winning more of their wallet,” Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC, who said he is generally optimistic about the trajectory of U.S. stocks.\nBlackRock said its iShares ETF business took in $54.8 billion in new money in the quarter, up from $49.3 billion a year earlier.\nThe New York-based company’s net income surged to $2.3 billion, or $14.07 per share, from $851 million, or $5.13 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding the benefit from the new tax law, BlackRock earned $6.24 per share. Analysts on an average expected the company to earn $6.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, up 22 percent from $5.15 trillion at the same point last year.\nNet investment in fixed-income securities totaled $42.95 billion. BlackRock attracted total “long-term” net flows of $102.93 billion in the quarterly period.\nBlackRock shares were up nearly 2 percent in pre-market trading on Friday.
