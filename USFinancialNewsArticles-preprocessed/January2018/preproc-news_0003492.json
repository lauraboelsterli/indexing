    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRegulatory News:\nPharnext SA (Paris:ALPHA) (FR0011191287 - ALPHA) , a biopharmaceutical company pioneering a new approach to the development of innovative drugs based on the combination and repositioning of known drugs, today announced its board of directors has appointed Dr. Philippe Chambon as a new, independent, non-executive member. He is replacing Jacques Attali for the remainder of the term, until the Annual Shareholder’s meeting is called to approve the 2018 financial statements.\nDr. Chambon, M.D, Ph.D., is a well-known healthcare professional who has spent 22 years as a venture capital investor in the U.S., primarily focused on biopharmaceutical and digital health companies. He led the creation of New Leaf Venture Partners as a spin-off from the Sprout Group. As such, he served on numerous boards of both private and public companies, including Auxilium Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Endo), ePocrates Inc. (acquired by AthenaHealth), Truveris and NxStage Medical (acquisition by Fresenius Medical Care pending).\n“We thank Jacques Attali for his unique and precious contribution during the years he served on our board” said Michel de Rosen, Chairman of Pharnext’s Board of Directors . “We are delighted that Philippe is joining us. His experience, expertise, and judgement are invaluable and will help Pharnext reach the next level and deliver the innovative treatments we are working on.”\nDr. Chambon added : “I am honored to have the opportunity to work alongside Daniel, Michel and the whole Pharnext team. The Company’s unique focus on the clear opportunity that drug combinations represent has the potential to be truly revolutionary.”\nAbout Pharnext\nPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded by renowned scientists and entrepreneurs including Professor Daniel Cohen, a pioneer in modern genomics. Pharnext has two lead products in clinical development.
