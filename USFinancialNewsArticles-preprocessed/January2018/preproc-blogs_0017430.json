    "text": "Bernstein revealed its five conviction stock ideas to clients this week, telling investors that the top picks could see big gains in 2018.\n\"The common themes across the ideas were: high conviction in the investment thesis; a material opportunity for absolute return in the next 6 to 12 months; and a fundamental forecast that differed from consensus and a set of catalysts that laid out when that differentiated view would be realized in the market,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.\nThe companies on the list span a wide range of industries and market caps and represent a snapshot into Bernstein's equity outlook.\nHere are the top ideas.",
