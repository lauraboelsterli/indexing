    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 8:58 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago Gay Singaporean doctor to appeal failed adoption of his biological son Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - A gay Singaporean doctor is to appeal against a court’s rejection of his bid to adopt his biological son who was born through a surrogate mother in the United States, one of his lawyers said on Friday. \nThe court rejected his adoption last month on the grounds that the steps he had taken to have the baby in the United States would not have been possible in socially conservative Singapore. \n“Our client has filed an appeal against the decision,” said one of his lawyers, Ivan Cheong. \nThe man’s name has been withheld because the case involves a minor. \nCheong said the appeal would be heard by the family division of the high court in Singapore, but that no date had been set.
