    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 9:25 PM / a few seconds ago U.S. tax law, trucking demand lift Knight-Swift quarterly profit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Trucking company Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc ( KNX.N ) on Tuesday posted a higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts, boosted by changes to the U.S. tax law and strong freight demand. \nBut North Americaâ€™s largest full truckload carrier reported revenue that fell short of analyst projections. \nThe Phoenix, Arizona-based company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $447.56 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, up from $22.16 million, or 27 cents per diluted share in the year-ago period. \nAdjusting for one-time items, Knight-Swift reported earnings per share of 52 cents. Wall Street analysts expected 41 cents. Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle; Editing by David Gregorio",
