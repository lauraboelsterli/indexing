FILE PHOTO - Darts - Betway Premier League Darts 2016 - Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff, Wales - 31/3/16 Phil Taylor in action Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Peter Cziborra Livepic EDITORIAL USE ONLY. \nThe 27-year-old Cross, who turned professional at the start of last year, was soon three sets ahead of fellow Englishman Taylor, who is 30 years older and won his last title in 2013. \nTaylor who battled to stay in the contest, won 10 legs and had 12 180s, one more than Cross, but could not stop the sparkling former electrician who triumphed with a 140 finish. \nCross is the first man to win the tournament on his debut since Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld in 2007. Taylor won his first final on debut 28 years ago by beating Eric Bristow. \nTaylor, nicknamed ‘The Power’, said before the tournament that it would be his last professional event before retirement.
