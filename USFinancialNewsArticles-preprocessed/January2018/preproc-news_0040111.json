    "text": "Tim Hardaway, Jr. scored 31 points and went 6-of-7 from 3-point range to lead the New York Knicks to a 117-115 win over the Utah Jazz on Friday night.\nCourtney Lee and Kristaps Porzingis each chipped in 18 points for the Knicks. New York won for just the third time in 10 games in January.\nRudy Gobert tallied a season-high 23 points and 14 rebounds in his first game back from a knee injury that sidelined him for 15 games. Rodney Hood scored 18 points while Ricky Rubio and Donovan Mitchell added 17 points apiece for the Jazz.\nUtah rallied from a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit and tied it up at 91-all on a basket from Mitchell. The Knicks countered with back-to-back baskets from Enes Kanter and Trey Burke to make it 98-93 moments later. Then Hardaway, Jr. converted a four-point play and drove for a dunk to put New York up 109-100 with 3:21 remaining.\nThe Jazz mounted one final rally and cut it to 115-112 on a 3-point play from Gobert. Hardaway, Jr. missed a pair of free throws to open the door for a tying basket. Utah had three different cracks at a tying 3-pointer, but missed each one.\nNew York opened up a 16-9 first quarter lead behind hot shooting from Hardaway, Jr. and Porzingis. The duo combined for five of New York’s first seven baskets.\nUtah rallied toward the end of the quarter and took a 25-22 lead into the second quarter behind a 10-0 run. Raul Neto fueled the spurt with back-to-back layups and Hood provided the go-ahead basket by draining his first 3-pointer of the game.\nThe Knicks tied it up three times in the second quarter, the final time on a Porzingis dunk. The Jazz created some separation again behind back-to-back layups from Gobert and then carved out their first double-digit lead at 48-38 on a dunk from Derrick Favors.\nNew York came out of the gate strong in the third quarter. The Knicks hit 8 of 10 shots to open the half and took a 71-66 lead midway through the quarter. Lee did much of the damage to get New York going, scoring back-to-back baskets less than two minutes into the half to give the Knicks their first lead since the first quarter.\nHardway, Jr. hit back-to-back 3-pointers in the final minute of the third quarter to ignite an 8-0 run that extended New York’s lead to 87-78 early in the fourth quarter.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
