    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Validus Holdings Ltd (\"VR\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: VR) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by American International Group (\"AIG\") (NYSE: AIG). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $68.00 for each VR share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether VR's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, according the acquisition announcement, VR \"is an excellent strategic fit for AIG, bringing new businesses and capabilities to [AIG's] operation, expanding the bench of [its] management team and deepening [AIG's] underwriting expertise.\"\nMoreover, the acquisition of VR is a strategic transaction which AIG anticipates will be immediately accretive to earnings per-share and return on equity, deliver profitable growth, and enhance its platform and long-term growth opportunities.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether VR's Board acted in the best interests of VR's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
