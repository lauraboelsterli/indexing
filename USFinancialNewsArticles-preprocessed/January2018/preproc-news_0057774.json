    "text": "(Reuters) - Printer and copier maker Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday as tumbling demand for office printing took a toll on its results.\nThe company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $196 million, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $185 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue was nearly flat at $2.75 billion.\nJapan’s Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ) is set to take over Xerox, and combine the U.S. company into their joint venture Fuji Xerox in an effort to cut costs, the companies said in a separate statement.\nBillionaire investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who collectively hold over 15 percent of Xerox, had jointly pushed the photocopier pioneer to explore strategic options, oust its “old guard,” including its CEO Jeff Jacobson.\n(This version of the story corrects last paragraph to say the two investors ‘pushed’, not ‘persuaded’ Xerox to explore options)\nReporting by Ismail Shakil and Muvija M Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
