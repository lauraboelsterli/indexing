    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 8:24 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago GKN received several approaches for business after Melrose bid - FT Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British engineering company GKN ( GKN.L ), which is facing a hostile bid from Melrose Industries ( MRON.L ), has received several approaches for its individual business, the Financial Times reported on Friday. \nA top-20 investor said he understood there had been 10-15 approaches made for the GKN’s automotive business since the board announced plans to split the company in response to the Melrose bid, the FT also reported. \nGKN, a British firm that makes parts for the Boeing 737 jet and components for Volkswagen and Ford cars, rebuffed a 7.4 billion pounds offer by Melrose last week, on the grounds that the terms of the paper-and-cash bid are “effectively unchanged” from an earlier approach made by Melrose, which was also rejected. \nMelrose later responded to the criticism of its offer for the much larger GKN saying that the rise in the companies’ share prices showed the merit of its bid. \nMelrose and GKN were not immediately available for comment on the report.
