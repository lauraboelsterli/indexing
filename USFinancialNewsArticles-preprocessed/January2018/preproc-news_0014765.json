    "text": "SURPRISE, AZ, Jan. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corix Bioscience, Inc., (OTCQB: CXBS) a Wyoming corporation (“Corix”), acknowledges receipt of the lawsuit filed by a minority shareholder named George Sharp. Mr. Sharp holds 0.01% of Corix’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. Sharp has filed numerous lawsuits against publicly reporting companies alleging the same or similar claims.\nCorix’s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Ogburn stated, “Corix denies all allegations of wrongdoing and will respond accordingly through the judicial process. Notwithstanding his claims that Corix has diminished value, Mr. Sharp has made settlement proposals to the company demanding not only financial remuneration, but also the issuance of additional stock. Corix believes this proposal contradicts Mr. Sharp’s allegations that the company is not viable or is being used as a conduit for fraudulent activity.”\nMr. Sharp recently issued a press release dated January 2, 2018 outlining the allegations in his Complaint against Corix. Corix similarly denies uniformly the allegations in Mr. Sharp’s press release as inaccurate and untrue. Corix believes Mr. Sharp’s press release is part of a pattern of abusive litigation tactics aimed at pressuring Corix to enter into a quick settlement. In fact, courts have previously barred Mr. Sharp from issuing inaccurate or defamatory press releases in cases similar to this. An example can be found here:\nhttp://floridalawsuit.yolasite.com/resources/Injunction%20-%20Executed%209-16-2013.pdf\nCorix will provide updates to this press release upon developments in this litigation.\nAbout Corix Bioscience Inc.\nCorix Bioscience, Inc.
