The S&P 500 and Nasdaq scored eight record closing highs out of the first nine trading days of 2018, while the Dow boasted its sixth closing high of the year.\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase on average by 12.1 percent in the quarter, with profit for financial services companies likely to increase 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“The big consensus trade of being short U.S. dollars into 2018 and long European and U.S. financials continues to work in earnest and this remains the key focal point in the week ahead,” said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG.\n“The decline in the USD index was actually the biggest sell-off since 27 June, with prices closing below the Sept. 8 low. It just shows how much sway the USD bears have right now.”\nDOLLAR IN DECLINE The dollar index showed no sign of bouncing early on Monday, instead edging down to a fresh trough at 90.896.\nThe euro was up at a three-year peak of $1.2203 and holding all of Friday’s 1.3 percent surge.\nThe single currency has been bolstered by speculation European Central Bank policymakers are preparing to temper their vast monetary stimulus campaign.\nAlso helping was news German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party and the Social Democrats (SD) were moving toward formal coalition talks.\nLeading members of the Social Democrats said on Sunday they would press for improvements to the coalition blueprint, seeking to win over sceptical party members who can torpedo the deal.\nThe dollar was near a six-week low on the yen at 111.08 yen , while the pound was at its highest since mid-2016 at $1.3737.\nThe Canadian dollar also held firm on wagers the country’s central bank would hike interest rates at a policy meeting on Wednesday.\nA softening U.S. dollar combined with resilient Chinese demand has been positive for most commodity prices.\nGold stood at $1,338.34 an ounce after reaching a four-month top of $1,339.34 on Friday.\nOil prices were a shade lower in early trade, but that followed six straight sessions of gains.\nBrent crude futures eased 16 cents to $69.71 a barrel, while U.S. crude dipped 9 cents to $64.21.\nReporting by Wayne Cole; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
