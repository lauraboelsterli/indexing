REUTERS/Issei Kato \n“I think I was down on my serve love-30, like, every few games,” Osaka said. “Normally, you would think the game is basically over a little bit, and get really upset. But I tried to think positive and stuff.” \nThe Australian battled right until the end but Osaka produced four huge shots in a row to win the match and set up a fourth round meeting with world number one Simona Halep for a place in the quarter-finals. Slideshow (3 Images) \nOsaka, who beat defending champion Angelique Kerber at last year’s U.S. Open, joked that she sweated more over Halep’s epic struggle to subdue Lauren Davies than she had her own match and did not sound overawed to be meeting the top seed. \n“I’ve played her twice, and both times it was three sets. I had fun both times,” she said. \n”I feel like I learned a lot. I feel playing the number one is really an honour. No matter what happens, I’ll try my best. I’ll just see what happens from there. \n“I‘m grateful (to be in the fourth round),” she added. “But I‘m, like, I don’t want to stop here, if you know what I mean.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by John O'Brien",
