    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. energy regulator on Monday said it extended the timeframe to respond to Magellan Midstream Partners’ request for a rehearing on its proposal to establish a marketing arm to buy, sell and ship crude oil.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) extended the 30-day deadline by which it is required to respond to appeals of its decisions, according to a filing.\nThe order “provides the Commission as much as it needs to review thoroughly the issues raised in the record” and make a decision, a FERC spokeswoman said in a statement.\nOn Nov. 22, FERC denied Magellan’s proposal to establish a marketing affiliate. Marketing arms are common in the pipeline industry, and most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators have already established their own marketing or trading arms.\nMagellan requested a rehearing on Dec. 22, in a filing that rivals said raised new issues that could have far-reaching consequences for the oil industry and could jeopardize existing marketing affiliates.\nLast week, oil and gas producers WPX Energy and Chevron asked FERC for a new hearing on the broad industry impact of Magellan’s request.\n(This version of the story was refiled to remove erroneous coding)\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
