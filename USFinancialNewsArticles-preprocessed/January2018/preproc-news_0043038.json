    "text": "Energy stocks are finally catching up to the rally in crude pricesâ€”a sign that investors are increasingly positive about the long-term prospects of oil companies.\nAccelerating global growth has increased demand for commodities, drawing down oil inventories and helping push oil prices to three-year highs. Meanwhile, a rout in the oil market from over $100 a barrel to under $30 led to extensive cost-cutting by producers, meaning they can now make more money at lower prices, investors say.\n ",
