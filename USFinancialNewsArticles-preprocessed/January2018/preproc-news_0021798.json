    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 5:10 AM / Updated 11 hours ago Wal-Mart launches program to safely dispose of unused opioids Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Wednesday said it will provide customers filling prescriptions for opioids with a packet of powder that will help them dispose of leftover medication in order to help curb misuse and abuse. \nThe company said patients filling any new class II opioid prescriptions at its pharmacies will receive a free packet of the product - called DisposeRx - when filling a new prescription. Patients with chronic Class II opioid prescriptions will be offered a free packet every six months, the company said. \nPeople filling prescriptions at Samâ€™s Club can also get DisposeRx at their pharmacies. \nIn order to safely dispose of opioids, patients would add warm water and the DisposeRx powder to their pill bottle, which then forms a biodegradable gel around the pills. \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioids were involved in over 42,000 deaths in 2016. In October, President Donald Trump declared the problem a national public health emergency. \nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, most people misusing prescription opioids get them from family and friends.
