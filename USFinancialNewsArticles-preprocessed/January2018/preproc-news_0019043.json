REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo Brandon Lewis told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that the government had all contingency plans in place for Carillion, which is on the brink of entering administration, according to some news reports.\n“We are keeping a very close eye on this, make sure there are all plans, contingency plans in place, but it is a going concern this and ... hopefully, they will be able to work with their partners to get the working capital they need to continue to provide important services,” Lewis said.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper, editing by Louise Heavens\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
