    "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday he would ask lawmakers lift his parliamentary immunity to face allegations of EU subsidy fraud.\nPolice are investigating whether he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy a decade ago by hiding ownership of a farm and conference center. Babis denies wrongdoing.\nBabis was speaking before a parliamentary committee meets on Tuesday to make a recommendation on whether to lift Babisâ€™s immunity from prosecution that he is granted as an elected member of the chamber.\nReporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
