    "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nApple will launch a new entry-level MacBook during the second half of this year, according to DigiTimes . \nThe report suggests that the current entry-level computer, the 13-inch MacBook Air, might be replaced. Apple refreshed the components inside the MacBook Air in 2017 — such as the processors — but hasn't updated other features like the display in years. \nApple's 12-inch MacBook computers cost hundreds of dollars more than the MacBook Air, but also have sharper screens and newer hardware designs. \nDigiTimes has an on-again off-again record but often follows movements in Apple's supply chain. DigiTimes' unidentified sources said a company named General Interface Solution \"is expected to land more LCM (LCD module orders) for the new computer.\" \nApple was not immediately available to comment on the report.
