Botting brings hands-on product and business leadership experience to the executive team, which has recently added several seasoned Silicon Valley executives.\nSelligent announces Chris Botting has been hired as COO.\n“Selligent is perfectly poised for massive growth in North America and Europe, as brands look for a more flexible marketing automation approach that can help them meet increasingly sophisticated consumer demands,” said Botting. “I’m excited to lead the teams that will be responsible for delivering the strategy and solutions to serve our clients’ needs both in the present and future.”\nBotting joins Selligent with a successful track record of agile product development and business operations in large, fast-growing software businesses.
