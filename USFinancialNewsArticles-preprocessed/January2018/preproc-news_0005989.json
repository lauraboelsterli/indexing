    "text": " 09 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Pakistan criticises 'shifting goalposts' after U.S. aid suspension Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan said on Friday U.S. “arbitrary deadlines” and its shifting of goalposts were counterproductive to defeating common security threats in the region after the United States slashed aid to Pakistan. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi speaks with a Reuters correspondent during an interview at his office in Islamabad, Pakistan September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood \n“We are engaged with the U.S. administration on the issue of security cooperation and await further detail,” the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement following a U.S. announcement it was suspending all military assistance, believed to be at least $900 million (664.31 million pounds). \n“Arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats,” the ministry said.
