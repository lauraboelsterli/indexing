SHARES Source: Akamai \nShares of cloud service provider Akamai jumped Tuesday on a Bloomberg report of a strategic review by Morgan Stanley. \nThe stock rose as much as 5 percent in afternoon trading. \nAkamai saw a similar bump in December on news that Elliott Management had bought a 6.5 percent stake in the company. \nThe hedge fund at the time indicated it would push the company to curtail wasteful spending and to improve what it deemed poor strategic planning for expanding into new markets, sources told Reuters. \nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",
