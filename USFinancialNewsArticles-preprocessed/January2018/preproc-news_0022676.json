    "text": "FRANKFURT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European wholesale prices for next week jumped on Monday as colder weather was forecast while forward curve price came down sharply, along with carbon, as Germany’s latest climate policy decisions point to remaining overcapacities.\n* “The cold weather hype seems to have gone away, with the focus now on next week,” one trader said. Forecasts at the end of last week had seen cold weather fronts on the cards much sooner, which had beefed up spot prices for Monday.\n* Temperatures will now turn lower next week, with Germany’s seen falling by 2.4 degrees Celsius on average from the 4.4 degrees predicted for Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n* It also showed French temperatures down at a likely 5.8 degrees next week, compared with 9.2 degrees expected for Tuesday.\n* The German baseload electricity contract for the week starting Jan. 22 rose 16.5 percent to 38.45 euros ($47.18) while its French equivalent increased by 11.6 percent to 43.25 euros.\n* Day-ahead prices in both countries fell sharply on more wind supply.\n* Wind power generation in Germany is forecast to reach 25 GW on Tuesday, up 3 GW day-to-day and equivalent to half the total capacity.\n* French nuclear capacity usage is currently steady at 91.6 percent of the available total.\n* Further ahead, Germany’s Cal ‘19 baseload contract dropped to a five-week low of just under 35 euros, down 1.1 percent from Friday and the lowest since Dec. 7.\n* Its less liquid French counterpart was off 1.3 percent at 40.45 euros, the lowest since Nov. 20.\n* December 2018 expiry carbon emissions permits lost 1 percent to 7.78 euros a tonne.\n* Traders said energy sector plans within the agenda for Germany’s coalition talks, published since Friday, while including a higher renewable power quota by 2030, have delayed previously more aggressive CO2 cutting targets for 2020.\n* “The view is this probably spares the coal sector plant closures, which could have come much sooner,” one said, adding 2020 and 2021 prices also came down. A commission will nevertheless have to come up with plans by the end of this year on how to prepare a long-term exit from coal generation.\n* In eastern Europe, Czech Tuesday baseload power was down 1.25 euros at 33.75 eurs/MWh. Czech year-ahead power was off 0.9 euros at 35.9 euro. ($1 = 0.8150 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)\n ",
