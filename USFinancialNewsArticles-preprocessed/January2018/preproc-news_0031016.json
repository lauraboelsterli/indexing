Former tennis player Andre Agassi, coach of Novak Djokovic of Serbia, speaks during an official event promoting the Australian Open tennis tournament at the Grand Slam Oval in Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia, January 19, 2018. Tennis Australia/Fiona Hamilton/Handout via REUTERS \n“With a new service motion and the pressure and the big match and not playing in a while, that was the time for it to get tested and, getting through it, he’ll be a lot better for it moving forward.” \nDjokovic had not played a competitive match for six months before his first round clash with American Donald Young and while that was a breeze, his clash with Monfils in 40 degrees heat proved to Agassi that the 30-year-old is battle ready. \n“Recovery is not something I worry about with him,” said Agassi, who added he is not working with Djokovic for ‘personal gain’. \n”Novak is physically extraordinary and he has a recovery ability that is unlike mine, probably just because the nature of how his body is made and how efficient he is. \n“The guy has a capacity for pushing himself that is unique.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
