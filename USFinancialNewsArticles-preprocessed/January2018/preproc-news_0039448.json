But we need low barriers to trade for all of this to work,” said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst and portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.\nThe International Monetary Fund on Monday revised up its forecast for world economic growth to 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, saying U.S. tax cuts were likely to boost investment in the world’s largest economy and help its main trading partners.\nShares of Whirlpool rose 2.6 percent and solar companies such as Real Goods Solar, Sunworks and First Solar climbed following the new tariffs.\nAt 12:47 p.m. ET (1747 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.03 points, or 0.1 percent, at 26,189.57 and the S&P 500 was up 4.16 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,837.13. The Nasdaq Composite was up 45.31 points, or 0.61 percent, at 7,453.34.\nVerizon fell marginally as its quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates but revenue beat expectations as it added phone subscribers.\nJohnson & Johnson fell 4.11 percent, dragged down by a $13.6-billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law and a court ruling on a crucial patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade.\nProcter & Gamble dropped about 3.4 percent as investors focused on a drop in gross margins at the world’s largest consumer goods maker.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,591 to 1,218. On the Nasdaq, 1,477 issues rose and 1,393 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
