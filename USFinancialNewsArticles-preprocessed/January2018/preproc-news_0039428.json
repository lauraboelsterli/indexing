These services, coupled with Deloitte's in-depth business and industry knowledge, will advantageously enable clients to achieve the transformative value of cloud.\n\"Combining the power of the ATAsphere platform with Deloitte services allows clients to more rapidly and efficiently plan, build and operate innovative cloud solutions,\" said Larry Calabro, principal and cloud practice leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP.\nThe ATAsphere platform provides automated, integrated cloud migration along with discovery, application mapping, mirroring, and migration for enterprise workloads at scale.

We are excited to amplify that success by enabling simple, scalable data and application stacks for on-premise, private and public clouds,\" said Charles Wright, CEO and CTO, ATADATA. \"Clients look to partner with companies that demonstrate deep technical migration expertise as a part of a comprehensive, strategic solution. With ATADATA's assets, Deloitte offers just that.\"\nAs part of the deep cloud engineering and migration experience of ATADATA transitioning to Deloitte, Wright joins the Deloitte team alongside Ian Easton, chief commercial officer, ATADATA, to enable client success within and across sectors.
