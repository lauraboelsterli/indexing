Utah has won three in a row after losing the previous four.\nHolder had 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Shannon Evans II had 14 points and seven rebounds for the Sun Devils (15-5, 3-5). Arizona State was the last undefeated team in NCAA Division I at 12-0 before entering conference play.\nBarefield, a former starter who has come off the bench the past two games, sent the game into overtime at 69-69 on a 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds remaining.\nAfter Barefield’s fourth trey gave the Utes a 79-76 lead, Mickey Mitchell hit one of two free throws on Arizona State’s next possession.\nUtah had three turnovers and missed 3 of 4 free throws the rest of the way, while Arizona State missed its final six field-goal attempts.\nArizona State reserve guard Remy Martin scored all 10 of his points in a 13-0 second-half run as the Sun Devils took a 60-55 lead they could not hold.\nHolder made a driving layup for a 67-66 lead with 54.1 seconds left in regulation, and Evans a made a driving layup with nine seconds remaining before Barefield’s 3-pointer tied it.\nDe‘Quon Lake had 10 points for the Sun Devils.\nBibbins made 5 of 13 3-point attempts and had six assists before fouling out late in regulation. He is the reigning Pac-12 player of the week after recording two double-doubles in a sweep of the Washington schools last week.\nUtah made 14 of 32 3-point attempts and shot 43.5 percent from the field.\nArizona State shot 40 percent overall, 36.4 in the second half, and finished 10 of 27 from 3-point range.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
