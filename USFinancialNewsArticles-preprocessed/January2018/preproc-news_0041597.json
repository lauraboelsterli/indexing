    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. (NYSE American: CVRS), a leading developer of precision vascular robotics, today reported preliminary revenue results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nPreliminary and unaudited revenue for fourth quarter 2017 is expected to be between $4.0 million and $4.2 million. During the fourth quarter, the company installed 10 systems including 6 new systems and 4 CorPath GRX upgrades purchased by existing customers. This brings the installed base of CorPath GRX systems to 33 units as of December 31, 2017.\nPreliminary and unaudited revenue for full year 2017 is expected to be between $9.5 million and $9.7 million.\n\"Our fourth quarter accomplishments reflect continued progress toward our strategic objectives,\" said Mark Toland. \"Our results are highlighted by meaningful strategic partnerships with leading institutions which validates our GRX robotic technology platform and the benefits it provides to hospitals and their patients.\"\nDisclosure Regarding Preliminary Unaudited Results\nThe preliminary unaudited revenue results included in this press release are prior to the completion of review and audit procedures by our independent registered public accountants. Accordingly, our independent registered public accountants do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. These results could change as a result of further review and actual fourth quarter and full year results could differ materially from these estimates. Full quarterly results will be announced during our fourth quarter and 2017 year-end financial results conference call and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAbout Corindus Vascular Robotics\nCorindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. is a global technology leader in robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company's CorPath ® System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to bring robotic precision to percutaneous coronary interventions. During the procedure, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation to advance guide catheters, stents, and guidewires with millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that causes musculoskeletal injuries. CorPath GRX is the second generation robotic-assisted PCI technology offering enhancements to the platform by adding important key upgrades that increase precision, improve workflow, and extend the capabilities and range of procedures that can be performed robotically. With the CorPath System, Corindus Vascular Robotics brings robotic precision to interventional procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated with complications of improper stent placement during manual procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 hospital credit \"One Stent Program.\" For additional information, visit www.corindus.com , and follow @CorindusInc.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
