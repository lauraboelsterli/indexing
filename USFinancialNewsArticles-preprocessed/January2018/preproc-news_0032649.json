    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government shutdowns, which hurt federal workers who go on furlough and taxpayers in need of federal services, have not caused major disruptions to financial markets in the past.\nInvestors expect nothing different from the shutdown that could begin on Saturday.\n“It’s more a political event than an economic one,” said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager with OpperheimerFunds’ global multi-asset group in New York. “We have been in this situation before.”\nOn Friday, Washington lawmakers and U.S. President Donald Trump were pushing against a midnight deadline to reach an agreement to keep the government open in the effort to avert a shutdown that last occurred more than four years ago.\nWall Street has brushed off the increasing likelihood of a shutdown. The three major U.S. indexes .SPX .DJI .IXIC rose on Friday, marking their third straight week of gains.\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR reached a three-year peak at 2.659 percent, meanwhile.\nThe dollar held steady against a basket of currencies .DXY =USD but still ended lower for a fifth straight week, the longest such streak since April-May 2015.\nSpot gold XAU= was up about 0.4 percent at $1,331.84 an ounce, retreating from Monday’s four-month highs.\nIn the aftermath of the last shutdown in October 2013, which lasted for 16 days, the S&P 500 posted a modest 3 percent gain. Gold, the dollar and the 10-year yield barely changed.\nEven if a shutdown begins this weekend, most analysts and investors suspect it will be short lived.\n“It’s still seen as a short-term event,” said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at Credit Agricole in New York.\nAdditional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Sinead Carew and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
