    "text": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Ltd, Australia’s largest independent oil and gas producer, said fourth-quarter sales revenue slipped 6.9 percent from a year earlier, as pipeline natural gas production in the North West Shelf slumped.\nProduction fell to 21.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), partly due to the delay in the start-up of the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, and took full year output to 84.4 mmboe, at the lower end of the company’s forecast of 84-86 mmboe.\nWoodside said it expects annual production of 85-90 mmboe in 2018.\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru\n ",
