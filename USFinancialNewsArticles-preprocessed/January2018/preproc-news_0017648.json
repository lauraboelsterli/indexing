    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Malaysia's industrial production rose 5 percent in November from a year earlier, boosted by gains in all three major sectors, government data showed on Thursday. Factory output was just above the 4.7 percent annual rise forecast in a Reuters poll, and up from the 3.4 percent growth in October. Manufacturing sector output expanded 6.7 percent from a year earlier in November, up from 4.2 percent in the previous month, according to data from the Statistics Department. The electricity generation sector rose 3.9 percent year-on-year in November, while mining output grew marginally by 0.2 percent, the data showed. Industrial output reached a two-and-a-half year-high of 6.8 percent in August. On a monthly basis, factory output fell 1.4 percent from October. Malaysia's exports in November rose 14.4 percent from a year ago, slower than the previous month, on lower shipments of commodities.
