Slideshow (9 Images) \nWith Volkswagen, Nvidia said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers’ future lineup, using their new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called “intelligent co-pilot” capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car. \nSo far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, the company said. \nHuang said Baidu and German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL] had selected Nvidia Drive for their AV computing platform development in China. \nNvidia added that its first Xavier processors would be delivered to customers this quarter. The system on a chip delivers 30 trillion operations per second using 30 watts of power. \nNvidia will collaborate with Silicon Valley startup Aurora - co-founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous program, Chris Urmson - to build a new self-driving hardware platform using the Xavier processor, Huang said. \nBets that Nvidia will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence have more than doubled its stock price in the past 12 months, making the Silicon Valley company the third-strongest perfomer in the S&P 500 during that time.
