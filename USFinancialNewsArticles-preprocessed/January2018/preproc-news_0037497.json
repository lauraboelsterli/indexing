    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 1:15 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Tennis-Kerber crushes Keys to reach Melbourne Park semis Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Revitalised 2016 champion Angelique Kerber made a major statement of intent as she stormed into the semi-finals of the Australian Open with a dominant 6-1 6-2 victory over Madison Keys on Wednesday. \nMaking a mockery of the 21st seeding she landed after a miserable 2017, the former world number one outplayed Keys in almost every facet of the 51-minute match on Rod Laver Arena. \nIn an echo of her loss to compatriot Sloane Stephens in the final of last yearâ€™s U.S. Open final, Keys simply failed to get going until 3-1 down in the second set when she unleashed a couple of bombs to break the German. \nA 21st unforced error from Keys gave Kerber the break straight back, however, and the 30-year-old sealed a semi-final date with Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova with a third break of the set when the American netted a backhand.
