Yokohama FC's Japanese striker Kazuyoshi Miura, oldest footballer to score competitive goal, speaks during an interview with Reuters after a training session in Yokohama, Japan, March 21, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nThe new deal means “King Kazu” will enter the 33rd season of his record-breaking career, which began at the Brazilian side Santos in 1986. \n“I’ve signed a contract extension for this season. I will always play my heart out and hope to continue to grow (as a player),” Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying. \nThe former Genoa and Dinamo Zagreb player has been at Yokohama FC since 2005. \nCapped 89 times for his country, Miura’s 139 goals place him sixth in the all-time list of top scorers in J-League’s top division.
