The bonds will refinance some of the city’s outstanding general obligation debt.\nThe city had initially planned to lead this week’s sales with an $898 million tax-exempt bond issue. But it postponed the sale, citing weaker market conditions and the possibility of restructuring to include taxable debt.\nThe biggest market story going into next week is whether the U.S. Senate will avert a government shutdown on Friday ahead of a midnight deadline.\nThe effect of a shutdown, if it occurs, should be marginal on the U.S. municipal market, Barclays reported on Friday. During previous government shutdowns, municipal yields have tended to underperform U.S. Treasuries, but the underperformance was relatively small.\nThe municipal market will see an increase in new sales next week as $7.15 billion of bonds and notes are expected to come to market, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data.\nThe surge is nearly triple the amount of issuance from this week and an uptick from the slow start to the new year after record-breaking municipal sales in December.\nOther large deals on the calendar for next week are $832 million of Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds pricing through Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Tuesday and $800 million of Connecticut special tax obligation bonds pricing through Goldman Sachs & Co on Wednesday.\nMunicipal funds had a second consecutive week of over $1 billion of net inflows in the week that ended Jan. 17.\nReporting by Robin Respaut and Karen Pierog; Editing by Daniel Bases and Leslie Adler\n ",
