    "text": "LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks and currencies had a strong start to the year fuelled by solid growth numbers, perky commodity markets and a tepid dollar with equities on track for the best weekly performance since July.\nMSCI’s emerging market index rose 0.4 percent to take weekly gains to 3.4 percent - the best start to a new year since 2006. Asia ex-Japan shares hit a fresh decade high, hovering close to an all-time record led by gains in South Korea.\nRisk appetite has been whetted by a run of solid data from both developing and emerging economies, confirming the economic expansion is firmly on track.\nThursday’s latest U.S. ADP National Employment Report further boosted the mood, showing private employers added a forecast-beating 250,000 jobs in December, and stoking expectations for key U.S. non-farm payroll data out later on Friday.\nThe upbeat outlook and a tepid dollar also fuelled commodity markets with the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity CRB index at its highest since October 2015 and oil prices holding near the highest levels since May 2015.\n“That’s providing a macro tailwind for emerging markets – oil and global trade both speak to stronger emerging markets exports and emerging markets growth, which helps lift people’s expectations on a whole range of EM assets,” said Koon Chow, strategist at UBP.\nCurrencies were trading more mixed on the day but painted an equally upbeat picture for the first trading week of the year.\nTurkey’s lira and Russia’s rouble are on track to end the week around 1 percent stronger against the dollar.\nSouth Africa’s rand eyed an eighth straight week of gains - the longest weekly winning streak since late 2002.\nHowever, analysts thought the cheer may not last, with the latest Reuters poll showing expectations for the rand to weaken by more than 12 percent by end-2018 as the country’s fiscal woes return.\nInspired by the benign backdrop, governments continued to tap international capital markets. Overnight, Argentina sold $9 billion in a three-part dollar bond, raising nearly a third of its expected financing needs for 2018 in a deal that was 2.4 times oversubscribed.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1197.51 +4.95 +0.42 +3.37\nCzech Rep 1105.03 -0.10 -0.01 +2.49\nPoland 2525.55 -7.62 -0.30 +2.61\nHungary 39822.23 -27.77 -0.07 +1.13\nRomania 7993.37 +27.67 +0.35 +3.09\nGreece 828.68 +2.90 +0.35 +3.28\nRussia 1211.74 -2.43 -0.20 +4.96\nSouth Africa 52753.17 +90.54 +0.17 +0.42\nTurkey 16590.74 +1099.55 +0.95 +1.09\nChina 3392.36 +6.65 +0.20 +2.58\nIndia 34162.77 +193.13 +0.57 +0.31\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.51 25.52 +0.02 +0.05\nPoland 4.15 4.15 -0.09 +0.56\nHungary 308.14 308.06 -0.03 +0.78\nRomania 4.63 4.63 -0.07 +0.95\nSerbia 118.90 118.93 +0.03 -0.42\nRussia 57.06 56.94 -0.21 +1.05\nKazakhstan 329.80 332.02 +0.67 +0.91\nUkraine 28.19 28.01 -0.64 -0.16\nSouth Africa 12.35 12.31 -0.33 +0.09\nKenya 103.15 103.30 +0.15 -0.05\nIsrael 3.45 3.44 -0.03 +0.93\nTurkey 3.74 3.75 +0.08 +1.26\nChina 6.49 6.49 +0.07 +0.30\nIndia 63.42 63.40 -0.03 +0.65\nBrazil 3.23 3.23 +0.00 +2.40\nMexico 19.30 19.29 -0.08 +1.78\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 301 -1 .11 8 10.79 1\nAll data taken from Reuters at 10:03 GMT.
