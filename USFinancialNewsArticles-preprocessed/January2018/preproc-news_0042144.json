This included record quarterly revenue in its tungsten slurry and pads product areas, and significant revenue growth from its dielectrics slurries. Gross profit margin was 52.9 percent of revenue; non-GAAP gross profit margin was 53.8 percent of revenue, excluding amortization expense related to the company’s October 2015 acquisition of NexPlanar Corporation, up 290 basis points compared to last year. The company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.12 due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 in the United States (“tax reform”); record non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19, excluding the one-time impact of tax reform and the amortization expense, representing an increase of 29.3 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 million.\n“We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as we achieved another record level of quarterly revenue and very strong operating performance, driven by the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives and healthy semiconductor industry demand,” said David Li, President and CEO of Cabot Microelectronics. “During the quarter, we continued our momentum from last year in three key product areas – CMP slurries for polishing tungsten, dielectrics slurries, and CMP pads. In particular, we continued to grow with the ramp of our customers’ advanced technologies, including 3D NAND and FinFET, and to deliver our innovative, high-quality CMP solutions across a wide range of other memory and logic applications. As a result, we achieved significant year-over-year growth in each of these three key product areas.”\nMr. Li continued, “Looking ahead, I am confident that we are well-positioned for continued profitable growth. We believe that ongoing effective execution in our key product areas, combined with our focused business model and global resources, capabilities and infrastructure, continue to differentiate us among leading suppliers of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, and position us well to deliver another year of strong performance.”\nKey Financial Information\nThe company’s record revenue of $140.0 million in the first fiscal quarter represents an increase of 13.6 percent from $123.3 million in the same quarter last year. The company achieved record quarterly revenue in its tungsten slurry and pads product areas, which grew 13.7 percent and 16.5 percent year-over-year, respectively. Revenue from the company’s dielectrics slurry product area grew 8.4 percent.\nGross profit for the quarter was 52.9 percent of revenue, compared to 49.9 percent of revenue reported in the same quarter a year ago. Gross profit this quarter included $1.2 million of NexPlanar amortization expense; excluding this, non-GAAP gross profit was 53.8 percent of revenue, up 290 basis points compared to last year. Factors impacting gross profit this quarter compared to last year include higher sales volume and a higher valued product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense. The company’s full fiscal year GAAP gross profit guidance range of 50 to 52 percent of revenue remains unchanged. This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense.\nOperating expenses, which include research, development and technical, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, were $36.9 million in the first fiscal quarter, including $0.5 million of NexPlanar amortization expense. Operating expenses were $3.5 million higher than the $33.4 million reported in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher staffing related expenses, including costs related to the company’s CFO transition and higher incentive compensation expense. The company currently expects its GAAP operating expenses for the full fiscal year to be between $145 million and $150 million; the prior guidance range was $142 million to $147 million. This includes approximately $2 million of NexPlanar amortization expense.\nOperating income for the first fiscal quarter represented 26.5 percent of revenue, which was 370 basis points higher than in the same quarter last year. The significant year-over-year increase represents operating leverage driven by revenue growth, combined with the company’s ongoing attention to controlling costs.\nThe company’s effective tax rate for the first fiscal quarter was 108.4 percent, compared to 20.3 percent in the same quarter last year. The significant increase is primarily related to tax reform, the one-time impact of which increased the company’s income tax expense by approximately $32.9 million. The company currently expects its effective tax rate for the rest of the fiscal year to be within the range of 21 to 24 percent. Before the enactment of tax reform, the company had estimated 24 to 27 percent for the full fiscal year.\nThe company reported a net loss for the quarter of $3.1 million, or net income of $31.1 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time impact of tax reform and the referenced amortization expense. Non-GAAP net income was 33.3 percent higher than in the same quarter last year, and increased primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nThe company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.12 this quarter, or diluted earnings per share of $1.19 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time impact of tax reform and referenced amortization expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were 29.3 percent higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation’s quarterly earnings conference call will be held today at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

The conference code for the call is 2284727. A transcript of the formal comments made during the conference call will also be available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe company presented the following measures considered as non-GAAP by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: gross profit margin, net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the one-time effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 in the United States (“tax reform”), and amortization expense related to its October 2015 acquisition of NexPlanar Corporation. The non-GAAP financial information provided in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the investor's understanding about the company's ongoing operations. Specifically, the company believes the one-time impact of tax reform and NexPlanar amortization expenses are not indicative of its core operating results, and thus presents its gross profit margin, net income and diluted earnings per share excluding these effects. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, including gross profit percentage, net income and diluted earnings per share, is contained in this press release.\nABOUT CABOT MICROELECTRONICS CORPORATION\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation, headquartered in Aurora, Illinois, is the world's leading supplier of CMP polishing slurries and second largest CMP pads supplier to the semiconductor industry.

(2) Non-GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 excludes the item mentioned above in (1) plus $468 of NexPlanar amortization expense recorded in operating expenses and $32,880 of one-time tax expense due to U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017. These adjustments are partially offset by a $441 increase in the provision for income taxes related to excluding NexPlanar amortization. (3) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated based upon Non-GAAP net income. The one-time impact of tax reform reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.26.
