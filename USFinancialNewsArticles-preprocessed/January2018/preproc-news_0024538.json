It is on track for a 0.3 percent fall for the week.\n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.8 percent, while the energy group climbed 0.6 percent. The financials group slipped 0.2 percent.\n* Those three groups make up two thirds of the index’s weight.\n* Cannabis companies, which have risen sharply as they race to prepare for Canada’s legalization for recreational use, extended a recent pullback. Aphria Inc fell 14.5 percent to C$17.57 and Canopy Growth Corp was down 15.1 percent to C$31.88.\n* Lumber companies, whose softwood products are the subject of a trade spat between Canada and the United States, advanced, with Canfor Corp up 6.4 percent to C$27.42 and West Fraser Timber Co Ltd rising 7.7 percent to C$86.72.\n* Peyto Exploration and Development Corp surged 7.9 percent to C$14.23 after saying it will cut its 2018 capital budget and dividend payouts.
