    "text": "SANTIAGO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A regional Latin American grouping on Tuesday criticized Venezuela’s decision to hold a presidential vote by the end of April, saying an election held under the present conditions would lack legitimacy.\nThe so-called Lima Group, whose members include Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Mexico called for Venezuela to release political prisoners after a meeting in Santiago.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom foes decry as a dictator who has wrecked the OPEC member’s economy, said he would run again if the ruling Socialist Party asked him.
