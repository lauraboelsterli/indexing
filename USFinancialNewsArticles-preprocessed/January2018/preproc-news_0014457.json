    "text": "NEW YORK, NY , Jan. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Metrospaces, Inc. (OTC PINK: MSPC) announces its majority-owned sub Etelix grew revenue at almost 100% year-over-year from 2016.\nMr. Silva stated: “Etelix had a very strong year, outperforming our most aggressive year-estimate of $7.5M by a margin of almost 3%. Etelix Management out proved itself by setting a very high bar for year-end increase in revenue of almost 100% and still outperforming. 2016 Year End revenue was $4,067,807 so actual increased in revenue from 2016 to 2017 was a very strong 89%. Our EBITDA margin stayed strong, even though we had additional expenses of almost $178,000 tied to our new office in La Coruna, Spain and one-time acquisition costs for increasing our commercial footprint on some customers based in Europe and Asia, that are beginning to operate in our network. Our financial expenses also increased by almost $244,000 due to new operating lines of credit that we acquired to help finance our sales growth during the 2017 as well as the investment in the new office in Spain. Even though this was an important hit to our net earnings, it was necessary to fund revenue growth. It also shows the trust our financial partners showed in the Company, since these were all basically rotating lines of credit that were increased by a factor of 5 during the 2017 year. We think it’s the right decision to sacrifice short-term net income for continued revenue growth and the increase of the commercial footprint. We look forward to an even stronger 2018.”\nAbout Etelix.com USA, LLC\nEtelix.com USA ( http://www.etelix.com/ ) is a Miami-based, FCC-licensed voice, SMS and data/hosting operator.
