    "text": " 55 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago Sri Lankan rupee firmer on bank, exporter dollar sales Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee ended firmer on Thursday, further moving away from a record low hit earlier this week, as banks and exporters sold dollars, dealers said. \nThe spot rupee ended at 153.70/80 per dollar, compared with Wednesday’s close of 153.75/85. \nOn Tuesday, the rupee hit a record intraday low of 154.20/25 per dollar. \n“There were some exporter (dollar) sales and inward remittances,” said a currency dealer. \n“There could be 2-3 percent depreciation this year.” \nThe rupee might see volatility due to heavy debt repayment by the government this year, said dealers. \nSri Lanka raised $470.6 million last week via development bonds, the central bank said. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans, and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors bought 2.1 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 18, central bank data showed. \nThe rupee fell 2.5 percent last year, and 3.9 percent in 2016.
