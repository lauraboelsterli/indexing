    "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Algerian state energy company Sonatrach will study possible investments in oil exploration and natural gas projects in Iraq, the Iraqi oil ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe statement cited comments by Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi and Algerian Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni, who arrived in Baghdad on Sunday.\nThe Algerian delegation will hold meetings with Iraqi energy companies “to achieve concrete steps toward sealing a cooperation agreement with Sonatrach”, said Luaibi, mentioning specifically projects to develop Iraq’s gas wealth.\nIraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports.\nAlgeria is a main supplier of gas to Europe, exporting it by pipelines to the continent and also shipping it on tankers after liquefying the gas in special plants.\nGuitouni expressed hope of strengthening cooperation in oil exploration and natural gas, the Iraqi ministry statement said.\nIraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ second-largest crude producer behind Saudi Arabia, with output of 4.4 million barrels per day. Fellow OPEC member Algeria has estimated output of 1 million bpd.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli and Ahmed Rasheed; Editing by John Stonestreet and David Goodman\n ",
