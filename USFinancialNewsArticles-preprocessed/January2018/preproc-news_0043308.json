She resides in Monmouth County with her husband and daughter.\nSiegfried congratulates Vandell as she takes on this new role as a Director and continues her success at the Firm.\nMore information about the Firm and its career opportunities is available at siegfriedgroup.com .\nAbout The Siegfried Group, LLP (Siegfried)\nSiegfried works alongside financial executives across the nation, on their most important accounting and finance projects.
