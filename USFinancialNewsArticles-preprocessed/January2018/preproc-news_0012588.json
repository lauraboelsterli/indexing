(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today that it has launched, subject to market and other conditions, a private offering of $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, to be allocated between additional 4.375% senior notes due 2025 and new senior notes due 2028.\nThe additional 2025 notes will be issued under the indenture dated October 10, 2017 that governs Hologic's 4.375% senior notes due 2025. The new 2028 notes will be issued pursuant to a new indenture to be executed as of the closing of the offering. The additional 2025 notes and the new 2028 notes will be unsecured obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed by certain subsidiaries. Hologic intends to use the proceeds of the offering and available cash, including funds from its secured revolving credit facility, to redeem its outstanding 5.25% senior notes due 2022 in the aggregate original principal amount of $1.0 billion.\nThe additional 2025 notes and the new 2028 notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws.

The additional 2025 notes and the new 2028 notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nHologic will redeem all outstanding 2022 notes on or about February 15, 2018 (30 days following the commencement of this offering), subject to the completion of this offering and the receipt of proceeds from the offering, for an aggregate redemption price equal to the principal amount of the outstanding 2022 notes, plus the applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest through the day immediately preceding the redemption date.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer, solicitation or sale is not permitted. This press release shall not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the 5.25% senior notes due 2022.\nAbout Hologic, Inc.\nHologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment.
