    "text": "(Reuters) - Casey’s General Stores Inc ( CASY.O ) has submitted a bid for Kroger Co’s ( KR.N ) convenience-store business that is worth about $2 billion, CNBC reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.\nJCP Investment Management in January had asked Casey's to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, and CNBC said buying Kroger's convenience-store business could stave off pressure to sell. ( cnb.cx/2nekVBR )\nBoth companies were not immediately available for comment.\nCasey’s shares closed up 2.7 percent at $127.73. Kroger shares closed up 2 percent at $30.88.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ",
