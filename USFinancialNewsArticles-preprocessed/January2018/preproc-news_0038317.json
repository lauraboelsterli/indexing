    "text": "(Reuters) - Electric utility FirstEnergy Corp ( FE.N ) said on Monday it received a $2.5 billion equity investment from a group of fund managers including Elliott Management Corp.\nFirstEnergy’s shares were up 15.30 percent at $33.32 in morning trading after the company also said it would form a group to determine whether its unit, FirstEnergy Solutions, should file for bankruptcy protection.\nThe investment includes $1.62 billion in mandatory convertible preferred equity and $850 million of common equity, FirstEnergy Corp said.\nOther investors include investment firm Bluescape, Singapore sovereign fund GIC [GIC.UL] and Zimmer Partners.\nAkron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt by $1.45 billion and contribute $750 million to its pension fund.\nFirstEnergy Corp had $21.1 billion in debt as of Sept. 30.\nPower prices have slumped in recent years in the face of cheap natural gas-powered electricity and growing demand for renewable sources of energy, forcing many companies to rethink their diversification strategies.\nMoelis & Co LLC was FirstEnergy’s financial adviser and Jones Day its legal adviser, while Ropes & Gray served as Elliott’s legal adviser.\nReporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
