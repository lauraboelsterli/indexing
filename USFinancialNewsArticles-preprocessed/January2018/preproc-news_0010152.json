    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyline Medical Inc . (NASDAQ:SKLN) (“Skyline” or the “Company”), producer of the FDA-approved STREAMWAY® System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal, today announced it has completed the purchase of preferred stock convertible into 20% of the outstanding common stock of Helomics Corporation , in exchange for total consideration of 1.1 million shares of newly issued Skyline Medical common stock.\nIn addition, Skyline has the right to convert a previous $500,000 loan to Helomics into a further 5% equity stake, which would bring its total ownership to 25%.\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Helomics has established operations that bridge two emerging areas of the healthcare industry: precision medicine and big data. Helomics’ competitive advantage lies in its proprietary D-CHIP™ database, which contains de-identified data compiled from more than a decade of clinical testing of tumor responses to drugs coupled to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -powered bioinformatics engine which generates actionable scientific insights from this rich data. These insights are used by BioPharma companies in the research and development of targeted cancer treatments for any given patient profile. Skyline has an agreement in principle with Helomics to form a Skyline-Helomics joint venture.\n“We are pleased to move forward with our investment in Helomics,” stated Dr. Carl Schwartz, CEO of Skyline Medical. “Precision medicine is emerging as a credible research area that could greatly improve the current state of cancer diagnosis and stimulate the development of oncological therapies. Helomics’ D-CHIP™ database supports pharmaceutical companies in the development of novel therapies that have the potential to expand the range of cancer treatment options on the market today by providing actionable insights which can be used to improve the clinical outcomes for patients. We believe this investment in Helomics presents an exciting opportunity for Skyline to participate in the growth of the precision medicine industry and look forward to working closely with the company to expand their business.”\nAbout Helomics Corporation\nHelomics® is a precision diagnostic company and integrated clinical contract research organization whose mission is to improve patient care by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. In addition to its proprietary precision diagnostics for oncology, Helomics offers boutique CRO services that leverage our patient-derived tumor models, coupled to a wide range of multi-omics assays (genomics, proteomics and biochemical), and a proprietary bioinformatics platform (D-CHIP) to provide a tailored solution to our client’s specific needs.\nHelomics® is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the company maintains state-of-the-art, CLIA-certified, clinical and research laboratories.\nFor more information, please visit: www.Helomics.com .\nAbout Skyline Medical\nSkyline Medical produces a fully automated, patented, FDA-cleared waste fluid disposal system that virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical's STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with OSHA and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room, and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the U.S. For additional information, please visit www.skylinemedical.com .\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain of the matters discussed in this announcement contain forward-looking statements that involve material risks to and uncertainties in the Company's business that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made herein.
