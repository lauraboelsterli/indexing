A controlling stake would be a holding of at least 30 percent and would require a full takeover offer under German law. \nIt is unclear from whom Ouram is buying the TLG shares. \nTLG’s biggest shareholders are hedge fund ADAR Macro Fund with 16.8 percent of shares, DIC Asset with 15.1 percent and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC with 9.25 percent. \nA spokesman for DIC said the property firm had not sold its holding in TLG.
