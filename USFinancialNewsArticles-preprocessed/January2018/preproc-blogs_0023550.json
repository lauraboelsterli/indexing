    "text": "Hess is cutting roughly 13 percent of its workforce and streamlining operations as it battles Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund shareholder pushing for the U.S. oil and gas producer to post its first quarterly profit since 2014.\nMost of the cuts, which could start as early as Tuesday and continue through the week, are in Houston home to a majority of the company's employees.\nLorrie Hecker, a Hess spokeswoman, confirmed the cuts, saying about 300 workers, or about 13 percent of the company's workforce, would be dismissed.\nExecutives from the New York-based company's headquarters were flying to Houston on Tuesday to meet with employees. The job cuts are part of a plan to reduce expenses by more than $150 million a year, the company said.",
