    "text": "7 Hours Ago | 00:58 \nU.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday as the corporate earnings season rolled on. \nDow Jones industrial average futures climbed 100 points, and indicated a record open for the 30-stock index. S&P 500 futures also pointed to a record open, rising 7.25 points. Nasdaq 100 futures gained 16 points. \nGeneral Electric and Stanley Black & Decker are among the companies that reported earnings before the bell. GE shares rose 1.8 percent after the company reported, while Stanley Black & Decker remained flat. \nBaker Hughes and United Technologies also posted quarterly results. Companies set to report after the bell include Whirlpool, Ford and Lam Research. JB Reed | Bloomberg | Getty Images \nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed at record highs on Tuesday, while the Dow ended the session slightly lower. Investors also digested the end of the U.S. government shutdown. \nOver the weekend, the U.S. government shut down after a bill that would have kept it funded was voted down in the Senate. This marked the first U.S. government shutdown since 2013. \nShutdown concerns lingered on Wall Street on Monday; however, by the end of trade, major indexes hit all-time highs after it emerged the Senate had enough votes to stop the shutdown. They continued to post strong gains during Tuesday's session. \nHowever, the positive sentiment on Wall Street was not echoed by international markets. On Wednesday, Asia-Pacific markets closed mixed while European stocks were under pressure in morning trade. \nConcerns surrounding global trade weighed on sentiment after President Donald Trump approved tariffs on solar cells and washing machines imported to the U.S. on Tuesday. South Korea said it would bring the matter to the World Trade Organization. ",
