    "text": "  \nThe mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania’s third most-populous city, solicited bribes to fund an expected run for the U.S. Senate, prosecutors told a court on Monday, but the defense said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had falsely accused him. \nEdwin Pawlowski, a Democrat who was elected in November to his fourth term as mayor despite a sweeping “pay-to-play” indictment, went on trial in U.S. District Court in Allentown on 54 criminal counts, including bribery, conspiracy and fraud. \nPawlowski and former Reading, Pennsylvania, Mayor Vaughn Spencer were charged in July in a long-running federal corruption investigation. The trial of Spencer, who is also a Democrat, is scheduled to begin on March 5. \n  www.reuters.com",
