Telenor expects to conduct these assessments in the first quarter of 2018,” it said in a statement. \nWhile Telenor declined to name the potential buyer or buyers, its shares rose on the news, trading 1.2 percent higher for the day at 1355 GMT. \nThe eastern and central European operations contributed 8 percent of the company’s revenues and nine percent of core operating earnings in 2017. \nTelenor currently has operations in 12 countries, including the four in continental Europe, three in the Nordic region and five in Asia, with a combined 176 million customers. \nIt will report its full-year 2017 earnings on Jan. 31. Analysts in a Reuters poll are forecasting revenues of 124.7 billion Norwegian crowns ($16.2 billion). \n($1 = 7.6775 Norwegian crowns)",
