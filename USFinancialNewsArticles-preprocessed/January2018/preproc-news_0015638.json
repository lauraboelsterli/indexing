    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 6:35 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago El Salvador earthquake shakes buildings in capital; no damage Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A shallow earthquake in El Salvador shook buildings in the capital on Thursday afternoon, emergency services said, though there were no immediate reports of damage. \nAlarms sounded as locals evacuated buildings in the capital, San Salvador, according to a Reuters witness. \nThe Environment Ministry said on Twitter that the quake measured at magnitude 4.0, after issuing a preliminary estimate of 4.3. The quake was measured at a depth of 4 kilometers, the ministry noted. \nThe ministry of the Central American country said the earthquakeâ€™s epicenter was in San Marcos, a municipality a few miles south of the capital. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey did not report any earthquake occurring in El Salvador on Thursday, but did show a 5-magnitude quake in Costa Rica earlier in the day. \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, local emergency services said. \nOn Tuesday, a 7.6-magnitude quake struck in the Caribbean near remote islands belonging to Honduras. Although the quake could be felt across northern Central America, there have been no reports of deaths or major damage. Reporting by Nelson Renteria, editing by G Crosse",
