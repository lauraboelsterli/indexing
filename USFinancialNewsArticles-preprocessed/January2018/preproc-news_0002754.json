    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ – Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (\"Taylor Morrison\") (NYSE:TMHC), today announced the commencement of an underwritten public offering of 11,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock.\nTaylor Morrison intends to use all of the net proceeds that it receives from the offering to purchase partnership units in its direct subsidiary - TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership - along with shares of Taylor Morrison's Class B common stock, held by its current equity sponsors that are affiliates of and funds managed by TPG Global, LLC and Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. The aggregate number of partnership units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock purchased by Taylor Morrison will be equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the offering.\nIn addition, in a separate privately negotiated transaction, TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership intends to repurchase an aggregate of $100 million of its partnership units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock from the equity sponsors at a purchase price per unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for the Class A common stock in the public offering. The consummation of the unit repurchase from the equity sponsors is subject to certain conditions, including the consummation of the public offering.\nTaylor Morrison also announced that it was increasing the size of its previously announced stock repurchase program for purchases from time to time through December 31, 2018 to $200 million (of which $100 million will remain available following the unit repurchase described in the preceding paragraph).\nCitigroup and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as joint book-running managers and underwriters for the proposed public offering, and may offer the shares of Class A common stock purchased by them from Taylor Morrison from time to time in one or more transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market or through negotiated transactions at market prices or negotiated prices.\nAn effective shelf registration statement relating to such shares of Class A common stock has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). A copy of the preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the offering has been filed with the SEC and may be obtained from the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov , or from Citigroup, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, New York 11717, telephone at (800) 831-9146; or Goldman Sachs & Co.

The offering may only be made by means of a prospectus supplement and related prospectus.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
