    "text": "HONG KONG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Chinese property developer Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd said on Wednesday it plans to raise HK$23.5 billion ($3.0 billion) through the sale of new shares and convertible bonds to reduce debt and provide working capital.\nCountry Garden said it plans to issue 460 million shares to its major shareholder Concrete Win Ltd at HK$17.13 apiece. Concrete Win would pay for the new shares once it has sold the same amount of its existing Country Garden shares at the same price, it said.\nThe developer said it also planned to issue HK$15.6 billion worth of bonds convertible into 758.90 million shares at HK$20.556 each to third-party buyers.\nOnce the share sale and bond issue are completed, Concrete Winâ€™s stake Country Garden will be reduced to 54.79 percent from 57.93 percent at present, it said.\nChina property stocks were among the best performers in Hong Kong in 2017, propelled by robust sales, with Country Garden climbing 270 percent. The strong growth has raised some concerns about high levels of debt as developers borrow to buy land.\nShares of Country Garden slid 4.8 percent in early trade on Wednesday, compared with a 0.1 percent fall in the benchmark index.\n$1 = 7.8235 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Richard Pullin\n ",
