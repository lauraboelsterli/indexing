    "text": "DENVER, Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SRC Energy Inc. (NYSE AMEX:SRCI) (“SRC” or the “Company”), an oil and gas exploration and production company focused in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, today issues preliminary fourth quarter 2017 operating results, provides an operations update, issues initial 2018 guidance and announces its fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and conference call dates.\nProduction and Average Realized Pricing Summary\nThree Months Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 Sequential\n% Chg. 12/31/2016 Average Daily Volumes 3-Stream 2-Stream Daily Production (BOE/day) 45,658 40,378 13 % 13,269 Liquids % 69% 67% 58% Product Price Received Crude Oil ($/Bbl) * $48.80 $41.89 16 % $40.94 Natural Gas Liquids ($/Bbl) $20.81 $17.32 20 % NA\nNatural Gas ($/Mcf) $2.21 $2.35 -6% $3.18 Differentials NYMEX WTI * $(6.57 ) $(6.29 ) 4 % $(8.20 ) NYMEX Henry Hub $(0.69 ) $(0.64 ) 8 % $0.14 Unit Costs Lease Operating Expense ($/BOE) $1.54 $1.17 32 % $4.08 * Adjusted to include transportation and gathering expense. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 crude oil accounted for approximately 51% of total equivalent production volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, production averaged 34,194 BOE per day, 47% oil and slightly ahead of the mid-point of the Company’s previously issued guidance.\n2017 Preliminary Year-End Reserves\nProved developed reserves and total proved reserves at year-end 2017 increased 389% and 144%, respectively, over year-end 2016 proved reserves as shown in the following table:\nYEAR-OVER-YEAR RESERVES 2017 2016 * Reserve Category Oil\n(MMbbls) Gas\n(Bcf) NGL\n(MMbbls) Net\nMMBOE Net\nMMBOE Change\n% Proved Developed 27 219 24 88 18 389 % Proved Undeveloped 43 341 40 139 75 85 % Total Proved 70 560 64 227 93 144 % * 2016 year-end reserves are reported in 2-stream equivalents Capital Expenditures\nDrilling and completion capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $460 million. During the fourth quarter the Company chose to retain its interest in multiple non-operated wells located within SRC's core operating area which began producing late in Q4 2017. These wells represented approximately $35 million in non-operated drilling and completion capital expenditures in 2017. Given the timing of these wells, they had limited impact on SRC's 2017 production volumes; however, they should have a more measurable impact on 2018 production volumes.\nOperations Update\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, SRC drilled 27 gross (~25 net) wells and completed 12 gross (~11 net) wells. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company drilled 115 gross (~103 net) wells and completed 115 gross (~102 net) wells.\nThe table below details all recent activity:\nGross Well Count by\nZone Pad Name Lateral Length Avg.

The pace of completion activity is anticipated to be skewed towards the latter half of 2018 to align with natural gas processing capacity additions. Total drilling and completion capital expenditures are projected to be between $480 million and $540 million. In 2018 SRC expects to drill approximately 117 gross (100 net) wells and complete approximately 116 gross (103 net) wells on an operated basis. SRC's operational program for 2018 is similar to the program executed in 2017. The expected year-over-year capital expenditure increase is a function of productivity gains with respect to SRC's contiguous block of acreage, larger average working interest and anticipated cost pressures. Crude oil differentials, which include all transportation and gathering costs from the wellhead to the settlement point, are expected to remain relatively stable within a range of $6.00 to $6.50 per barrel.\nManagement Comment\nLynn A. Peterson, Chairman and CEO of SRC Energy commented, \"Our team's execution through 2017 was very positive. We have continued our strong operational momentum into 2018, which should lead to an alignment of SRC's operating cash flow with capital expenditures while continuing to deliver robust year-over-year growth.\"\nMr. Peterson added, “As it relates to midstream infrastructure, 2018 will be a year of change. Multiple gas processing facilities as well as oil gathering assets are currently under construction or are on the drawing boards as midstream companies respond to the growing needs.” He concluded, “As good stewards of SRC’s capital, we intend to maintain our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility, while focusing on delivering favorable returns on capital for our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Call\nSRC plans to issue its fourth quarter earnings release on Wednesday, February 21, 2018 after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nSRC will host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Mountain time) to discuss the results.
