This year, the IRS bumped the deadline to file returns to April 17 because the traditional filing date of April 15 falls on a Sunday. Emancipation Day — a legal holiday — will be observed Monday, April 16.\nThe IRS expects it will receive nearly 155 million individual tax returns this season.\nThere's good reason to get organized and file in a timely fashion this year.
