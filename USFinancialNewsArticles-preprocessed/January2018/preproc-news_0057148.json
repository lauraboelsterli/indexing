Retail shops still operate in the 80s.” \nLuxury goods firms including industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH ( LVMH.PA ) or Gucci parent Kering ( PRTP.PA ) have recently made a big push to sell their wares online, launching and revamping e-commerce sites for various labels. \nCartier owner Richemont ( CFR.S ) last week said it would bid for full control of Farfetch’s larger rival, luxury retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter ( YNAP.MI ), as it tries to do more on the web. \nUnlike Yoox, Farfetch does not have to stock inventory.

China’s second-biggest e-commerce site, JD.com, has since invested in and partnered with Farfetch. \nChina is one of Farfetch’s fastest growing markets, Neves said.
