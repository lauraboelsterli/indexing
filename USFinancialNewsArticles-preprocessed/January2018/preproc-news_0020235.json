    "text": "January 12, 2018 / 6:47 PM / Updated an hour ago U.S. consumer bureau official appeals decision keeping her from leading agency Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The deputy director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has appealed a court ruling that prevented her from taking control of the regulator instead of a Trump administration official. \nLeandra English filed paperwork on Friday to appeal that ruling, wanting to revisit the case with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Earlier this month, a U.S. federal judge denied her request for a preliminary injunction barring Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trumpâ€™s budget director, from leading the agency on an interim basis.
