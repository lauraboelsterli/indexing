The benchmark added 0.4 percent on Monday.\nBanks accounted for most of the losses on the benchmark, with the Australian financial index dipping 0.5 percent. The “big four” banks fell between 0.3 and 0.6 percent.\nMaterials also fell, underpinned by a drop in Chinese iron ore futures, which touched their weakest level in a month on Monday. Global miner BHP Billiton dipped 1 percent to a near four-week low, while its rival Rio Tinto Ltd slid 0.1 percent.\nShares of gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd fell 1.7 percent after it posted a 0.3 percent decline in second-quarter gold production, missing analyst estimates.\nBucking the trend, Fortescue Metals Group rose to a two-week high. Fortescue, the world’s fourth-largest producer of iron ore, reported a 3.7 pct fall in second-quarter cash production costs on Tuesday.\nHurt by a fall in oil prices, energy was the worst performing sector on the benchmark. Oil and gas company Woodside Petroleum Ltd dipped 1.8 percent, while Santos Ltd fell to a one-week low.\nEducation provider Navitas Ltd was the biggest percentage loser on the benchmark as it fell 7.1 percent to its lowest since November 2017.\nNavitas saw its net profits crumble by more than 50 percent over the first half of the year, hurt by college closures and lower demand for its English language programmes for migrants. In New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index declined 0.2 percent, or 12.61 points, to 8,314.98.\nConsumer staples led the decliners, with dairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd falling 2 percent, dragging the index.\nReporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
