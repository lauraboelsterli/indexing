    "text": "NEW YORK, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nIncreasing interests in the blockchain technology continues to drive the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. According to a recent report from Netscribes Inc., the global blockchain technology market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.8%, to reach USD 13.96 billion by 2022. Blockchain technology is being increasingly used in the financial sector. More Companies start to offer blockchain applications in secure payments, maintain customer identities, settle cross-border payments, etc. Blockchain technology is also employed in the healthcare sector, supply chain management, energy, media, informatics, etc. SinglePoint, Inc. (OTC: SING), Global Arena Holding, Inc. (OTC: GAHC), AppSwarm, Inc. (OTC: SWRM), Tapinator, Inc. (OTC: TAPM)\nThe number of companies that are interested in the blockchain technology increased rapidly in the recent years. According to Reuters, the tech giant Microsoft Crop and Accenture Plc recently announced partnership to build a digital ID network using blockchain technology during the second summit of ID2020. Dakota Gruener, executive director at ID2020, said in an interview, \"What ID2020 is truly focused on is bringing together an alliance of stakeholders to ensure the technology that is being developed is responsive to the needs of individuals.\"\nSinglePoint, Inc. (OTC: SING) yesterday announced, \"a letter of intent (\"LOI\") to acquire 100% of Bitcoin Beyond, a premier platform that enables retail merchants to accept bitcoin payments using their existing web-enabled point-of-sale device. This acquisition, priced at $1 million all stock, is expected to provide SinglePoint with a full end-to-end purchasing experience that provides merchants and bitcoin users unprecedented capabilities.\nBitcoin Beyond was created to address growing demand for fast and reliable electronic payment processing for the cannabis industry. As the industry exists today, many merchants face extensive physical cash management issues that require expensive and risky on-site safes, armed guards, armored cars, and physical cash transfers. Bitcoin Beyond stands to overcome these challenges, functioning as a general-purpose point-of-sale system that processes dollar-denominated payments using bitcoin. It can be operated from any web-enabled terminal available at checkout, from a cell phone to a tablet, to a full PC.\n\"We are thrilled with this opportunity. Acquiring Bitcoin Beyond put us ahead of what we believe merchants have access to now. This platform has by far the easiest user interface we have seen in the market, and we are confident merchants will be quick to adopt this solution as it stands as the sole alternative to traditional options offered to the cannabis industry,\" states SinglePoint President Wil Ralston.\nThe Bitcoin Beyond System was designed using 14 years of expertise in creating payment processing and online wallet solutions. It is built on a widely used technology stack, with security best practices and private merchant data is stored encrypted at rest. Because of this industry-leading technology, Bitcoin Beyond can be easily used and integrated with existing frameworks to add a simple means of payment with bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, such as Weed Coin, in the future. SinglePoint has an early investment in Weed Coin which has currently increased 8x in value.\nBitcoin Beyond furthers SinglePoints' Bitcoin payments solution which the company recently signed Kevin Harrington to evangelize and consult on. Last week the company started production of the commercial spot and is now in editing and post-production. SinglePoint has engaged a media specialist to start the process of getting the commercial aired on major national news networks to drive consumer sign ups and awareness for the service.\nSinglePoint has plans to acquire additional companies in the space and again broaden its footprint in the quickly emerging blockchain space. The company is currently in negotiations to acquire another blockchain centric company in an effort to deploy its technology to major established markets.\"\nGlobal Arena Holding, Inc. (OTC: GAHC) is a holding and technology development company. The company is focused on acquiring technologies, patents and companies having the ability to leverage the blockchain crypto technology. GAHC incorporated GAHI Acquisition Corp. to be the merger subsidiary for the acquisition of Blockchain Technologies Corporation (\"BTC\"). Currently, GAHC and BTC have entered into an acquisition arrangement where BTC will merge with GAHI Acquisition Corp. BTC is a technology company which leverages the underlying crypto technology of Bitcoin [Blockchain], acting as a seed accelerator. BTC currently features a number of innovative startups utilizing the Blockchain and operating within the crypto technology field.\nAppSwarm, Inc. (OTC: SWRM) announced earlier this month the beta launch of its new Bitcoin tracking app 'BitChart'. BitChart is an interactive way to visualize the bitcoin price index through your smartphone. Ron Brewer, CEO of AppSwarm, Inc. commented, \"We are very excited about the beta launch of our new BitChart app, and think going forward we have the potential to build a unique investors hub for crypto investors, while also helping bring some additional transparency to this rapidly growing market. Through our years of mobile development of games and different business applications, we look forward to adding a number of new features to our BitChart app through the rest of 2018, and will be providing updates on this in the very near future.\"\nTapinator, Inc. (OTCQB: TAPM) announced earlier this month that it is sponsoring and will speak on a panel at leading blockchain conference, ETH Denver on February 17th. The panel will focus on the intersection of blockchain & gaming and the Company will announce it first blockchain product, which will be released by Tapinator's subsidiary, Revolution Blockchain , in Q2 of this year. \"We are very excited to attend and present at one of the industry's top blockchain conferences. We believe that gaming is one of the most exciting verticals for blockchain technology and we look forward to sharing more information about our first product on February 17th,\" commented Ilya Nikolayev, CEO of Tapinator.\nSubscribe Now!
