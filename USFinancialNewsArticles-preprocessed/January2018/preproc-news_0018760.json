    "text": "January 12, 2018 / 8:26 PM / in 40 minutes U.S. top court to decide if online retailers must collect state sales tax Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether to expand the ability of states to require online retailers to collect sales tax, taking up South Dakotaâ€™s dispute with three e-commerce companies. \nSouth Dakota, appealing a lower court decision that favored Wayfair Inc, Overstock.com Inc and Newegg Inc, is asking the justices to overturn a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that companies with no physical presence in a state are not required to collect a state sales tax on purchases.
