Fans leave tributes to Cyrille Regis at the Jeff Castle gates of West Bromwich Albion football club's The Hawthorns stadium in West Bromwich, Britain January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples \n“I think he was the best centre forward I’ve ever had and I’ve had some top players. But I also think he was a better bloke than a player. He was an unbelievable guy.” \nRegis quickly became a fan favourite and scourge of rival defences as an explosive striker with a powerful physical presence.

One of my earliest football memories was walking into WBA for a trial as a 13-year-old kid, seeing Cyrille Regis and being in awe of him. RIP big man,” former England striker Alan Shearer said on Twitter. \nKnown to the fans as “Smokin’ Joe” and “The Big C”, Regis encountered more racism as he moved into international contention. \nOn one occasion he received a bullet in the mail along with a threat that he would get one in the knee if he played for England at Wembley. \n“The racism was quite abhorrent but I turned a negative into a positive,” he recalled. “I chased harder and played harder, I wanted to score goals and win points.” \nRegis returned to West Brom as a coach before becoming a football agent.
