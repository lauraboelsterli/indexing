    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercantile Bank Corporation (NASDAQ: MBWM) (\"Mercantile\") reported net income of $8.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net income of $8.1 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the respective prior-year period. For the full year 2017, Mercantile reported net income of $31.3 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, compared with net income of $31.9 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nExcluding the impacts of certain noncore transactions, diluted earnings per share during 2017 and 2016 equaled $1.89 and $1.76, respectively. These transactions included a Bank-owned life insurance death benefit claim in the first quarter of 2017, the revaluation of Mercantile's net deferred tax asset in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in December of 2017, the repurchase of trust preferred securities at a discount in the first quarter of 2016, and accelerated purchase discount accretion on called U.S. Government agency bonds during 2016.\nThe fourth quarter and full year were highlighted by:\nStrong core earnings and capital position Stable and robust net interest margin Solid growth in various fee income categories Controlled overhead costs Strong asset quality, as depicted by low levels of nonperforming assets and loans in the 30- to 89-days delinquent category Total loan growth of $180 million, or nearly 8 percent, during the full year New commercial term loan originations of approximately $119 million during the fourth quarter and $529 million during the full year Sustained strength in commercial loan pipeline Announced first quarter 2018 regular cash dividend of $0.22 per common share, an increase of approximately 16 percent from the $0.19 regular cash dividend paid during the fourth quarter of 2017\n\"Our strong 2017 financial results reflect the success of various ongoing strategic initiatives,\" said Robert B. Kaminski, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercantile. \"Our focus on net interest margin maintenance, enhanced fee generation, and overhead cost control played a key role in our demonstrated solid operating performance throughout all of 2017. We are very pleased with the level of loan growth during the year, which was achieved in a disciplined manner and in spite of competitive pressures, and our continuing strong asset quality. Based on our overall financial strength and current loan pipeline and prospects, we are well-positioned to participate in the economic strength of our markets during 2018.\"\nOperating Results\nTotal revenue, which consists of net interest income and noninterest income, was $32.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, up $1.9 million, or 6.0 percent, from the prior-year fourth quarter. Net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $28.4 million, up $2.0 million, or 7.4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting a higher level of earning assets and an increased net interest margin. Total revenue was $129 million during the full year 2017, up $1.8 million, or 1.5 percent, from 2016. Net interest income was $110 million in 2017, up $3.9 million, or 3.7 percent, from the prior year, reflecting a higher level of earning assets.\nThe net interest margin was 3.76 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 3.72 percent in the prior-year fourth quarter. The increase in the net interest margin primarily resulted from a higher yield on loans, mainly reflecting the positive impact of higher interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans stemming from the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") hiking the targeted federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December of 2016 and March, June, and December of 2017. The cost of funds equaled 0.59 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 0.46 percent during the respective 2016 period mainly due to increased costs of certain non-time deposit accounts, time deposits, and borrowed funds.\nThe net interest margin was 3.79 percent in 2017, down from 3.86 percent in 2016 due to an increased cost of funds, which more than offset a slight increase in the yield on average earning assets. The cost of funds equaled 0.54 percent during 2017, up from 0.45 percent during 2016 primarily due to higher costs of certain non-time deposits, time deposits, and borrowed funds. The improved yield on average earning assets mainly resulted from an increased yield on loans, primarily reflecting higher interest rates on variable-rate commercial loans stemming from the previously-mentioned FOMC rate hikes, which more than offset a decreased yield on securities, mainly reflecting a decreased level of accelerated purchase discount accretion on called U.S. Government agency bonds. A change in earning asset mix also contributed to the increased yield on average earning assets; average loans represented 85.2 percent of average earning assets during 2017, up from 84.9 percent during 2016. The accelerated discount accretion totaled $2.2 million during 2016, positively impacting the net interest margin by eight basis points. A nominal level of accelerated discount accretion on called U.S. Government agency bonds was recorded as interest income during 2017.\nNet interest income and the net interest margin during 2017 and 2016 were also affected by purchase accounting accretion and amortization entries associated with the fair value measurements recorded effective June 1, 2014. Increases in interest income on loans totaling $4.6 million and $4.9 million were recorded during 2017 and 2016, respectively. An increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures totaling $0.7 million was recorded during both 2017 and 2016. Purchased loan accretion amounts vary from period to period as a result of periodic cash flow re-estimations, loan payoffs, and payment performance.\nMercantile recorded a $0.6 million provision for loan losses during both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the prior-year fourth quarter. During 2017, Mercantile recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million, compared to a provision of $2.9 million during 2016. The provision expense recorded during the 2017 and 2016 periods primarily reflects ongoing loan growth and periodic adjustments to loan loss reserve environmental factors.\nNoninterest income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.5 million, down $0.1 million, or 2.2 percent, from the prior-year fourth quarter. Growth in credit and debit card fees and payroll processing revenue was more than offset by a decline in other income, which was elevated in the fourth quarter of 2016 mainly as a result of payments received on certain purchased credit-impaired loans. Noninterest income for 2017 was $19.0 million, down $2.0 million, or 9.7 percent, from 2016. Core noninterest income revenue streams, including treasury management income, credit and debit card interchange fees, mortgage banking activity income, payroll processing revenue, and customer service fees, increased $1.2 million, or 8.5 percent, on a combined basis in 2017 compared to the prior year. The increase in mortgage banking activity income primarily reflects the positive impact of strategic initiatives that were implemente",
