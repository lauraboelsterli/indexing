    "text": "HASTINGS, Neb., Jan. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nebraska-based ALLO Communications (ALLO) announced today the purchase of the fiber network and customer contracts of Glenwood Telecommunications' (Glenwood) Hastings, Neb. operations.\n\"ALLO looks forward to operating the fiber network to serve the customers in Hastings with exceptional service and technology,\" said ALLO President Brad Moline. \"We will be an active member of the Hastings community and will soon expand our fiber network to serve more homes and businesses' with exceptionally fast internet and superior telephone and television services. We are encouraged by the city's recent approval to acquire utility poles that ALLO may be able to lease to build a network passing every business and home to create a world-class, gigabit city.\"\nRegulatory approval is expected from the Nebraska Public Service Commission in early 2018 for ALLO to begin operating the Glenwood network in Hastings, at which time Glenwood's customers will begin migrating to ALLO's services and network.\n\"Glenwood has enjoyed serving the broadband and telecommunications needs of its Hastings customers and will continue to do so through the transition,\" said Glenwood General Manager Stan Rouse. \"This will not impact our IT services and business telephone systems as we will continue as your provider in Hastings.\"\nExisting customers will be contacted by ALLO and Glenwood with information regarding the transition.\nHastings businesses not being serviced by Glenwood can contact ALLO at 402.834.1401 for a customized Quote: and to discuss solutions.
