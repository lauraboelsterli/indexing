Cricket - India v South Africa - Third Test match - The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - January 27, 2018. South Africa’s Vernon Philander is bowled out by Mohammed Shami. REUTERS/James Oatway \nHowever, South Africa lost their way following Amla’s dismissal 20 minutes before tea, with four batsmen out for ducks. \nThe wickets were shared between the excellent Mohammed Shami (5-28), Ishant Sharma (2-31), Jasprit Bumrah (2-57) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1-39). \nSouth African claim the series 2-1 after victories in Cape Town and Pretoria.
