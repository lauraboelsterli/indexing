    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 3:32 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Rugby-France suffer Six Nations blow with Parra injury   \n(Adds details) \nPARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - France’s Six Nations hopes suffered an early setback when experienced scrumhalf Morgan Parra was ruled out of their opening game against Ireland due to a knee injury. \nParra, who has been replaced by Baptiste Serin, was recalled to the squad after not playing for his country since October, 2015 and not featuring under previous coach Guy Noves. \nNew coach Jacques Brunel will also have to cope with the absence of injured fullback Brice Dulin, who has been replaced by Hugo Bonneval. \nFrance take on Ireland at the Stade de France on Feb. 3. \nLes Bleus, who finished last year’s Six Nations in third place, are still reeling from a dismal autumn campaign. \nBrunel had called up the gritty Parra to boost the team’s self-confidence but he will now have to turn to Maxime Machenaud or Serin. \nThey also lost Mathieu Bastareaud last week after the burly centre was handed a three-week ban for making a homophobic remark to a player during a Champions Cup game with his club Toulon.
