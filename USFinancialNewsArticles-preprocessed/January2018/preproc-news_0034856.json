Cowan’s layup trimmed the deficit to 69-68, but Newkirk, who was hampered by foul issues most of the game, hit two free throws to put Indiana up 71-68 with 15 seconds left.\nCowan missed a 3-point shot with six seconds left, and Indiana’s Zach McRoberts got the rebound. McRoberts was fouled and missed both free throws with three seconds left. Huerter missed a 3-point shot from half-court at the buzzer.\nThe Hoosiers shot 50 percent for the game, and the Terrapins shot 41.1 percent. The Hoosiers were hurt by a 9-for-16 effort at the free throw line.\nMaryland’s Bruno Fernando suffered a right ankle injury in the first half and wasn’t able to return.\nThe Hoosiers sank 18 of 32 shots (56.9 percent) to take a 42-39 lead at halftime.
