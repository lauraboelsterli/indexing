    "text": "Jeff John Roberts, FORTUNE Sunday, January 21, 2018 Credit: Photograph by Adam Berryâ€”Getty Images A protester holds a German translation of George Orwell's book '1984' as he demonstrates for journalists' rights on August 1, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. After two German journalists, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl, reported that the German government planned to increase online surveillance, an investigation for treason, the first such case in the country against journalists in over 50 years, was brought against them and has since been suspended by the country's prosecutor-general after negative reactions from other journalists and politicians due to the implications of stifling the freedom of the press.",
