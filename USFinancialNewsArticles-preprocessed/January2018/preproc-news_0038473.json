    "text": "LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand rose to its highest in more than two years on Monday amid growing expectations that scandal-tarnished President Jacob Zuma would soon be ousted, while emerging-market equities pushed to another near-decade high.\nThe rand gained around 1 percent against the dollar to trade at its best levels since June 2015, following reports that the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party plans to force Zuma to step down.\nThe rand has strengthened by about 12 percent since the election of businessman Cyril Ramaphosa as ANC leader in December, with investors warming to his promises to root out corruption and boost the economy.\n“South Africa has a couple of things going for it which remind me of Brazil two years ago,” said Kiran Kowshik, a strategist at UniCredit. Those include improving external balances, a shrinking current account deficit, high real yields and hopes of reform under Ramaphosa, he said.\n“The momentum behind the reform expectations is very strong and will continue to support the rand. I don’t think it’s a big deal if it goes to 11.70 per dollar. The support is there for the currency,” Kowshik said.\nIn another promising sign, Ramaphosa appointed a new board at state-owned power utility Eskom at the weekend. Eskom has been in a leadership crisis after several board members resigned in 2017 amid growing governance concerns.\nSouth African bank stocks rallied hard, up 2 percent and the broader index rose 0.3 percent.\nShares of troubled South African retailer Steinhoff also jumped 10.6 percent after it announced a plan to sell $620 million of stock in investment firm PSG Group as it scrambles to plug a liquidity gap.\nMSCI’s emerging equity index rose 0.4 percent, underpinned by accelerating world economic growth. Equity markets are shrugging off the shutdown of the U.S. government, after the Senate failed to reach a compromise on funding it .\n“EM equities owe (their) strong performance to rising earnings,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said it a note, adding that valuations had “significant room to improve” based on improving economic fundamentals and the rosier earnings outlook.\nChinese blue-chip stocks rose to 31-month highs.\nIn emerging Europe, Russian shares rose 0.7 percent, approaching Friday’s record highs, as oil prices held near $69 a barrel.\nBut the lira weakened 0.3 percent after Turkey launched a military operation at the weekend against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in Syria. The move threatens to further strain Turkey’s ties with the United States.\nThe Romanian leu underperformed regional peers, trading at its weakest year-to-date against the euro. Tens of thousands of Romanians marched in Bucharest on Saturday to protest corruption and attempts by the ruling Social Democrats to weaken judicial independence.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1237.72 +5.12 +0.42 +6.84\nCzech Rep 1125.26 +1.64 +0.15 +4.37\nPoland 2602.83 +1.01 +0.04 +5.75\nHungary 40212.49 +190.60 +0.48 +2.12\nRomania 8355.16 -6.79 -0.08 +7.76\nGreece 852.65 +5.09 +0.60 +6.27\nRussia 1281.96 +11.04 +0.87 +11.05\nSouth Africa 54275.29 +216.55 +0.40 +3.32\nTurkey 15438.87 +291.81 +0.25 +0.09\nChina 3501.36 +13.50 +0.39 +5.87\nIndia 35691.91 +180.33 +0.51 +4.80\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.39 25.38 -0.05 +0.52\nPoland 4.17 4.17 +0.07 +0.16\nHungary 309.25 309.07 -0.06 +0.41\nRomania 4.67 4.66 -0.14 +0.26\nSerbia 118.49 118.35 -0.12 -0.08\nRussia 56.55 56.68 +0.23 +1.96\nKazakhstan 323.96 324.70 +0.23 +2.73\nUkraine 28.87 28.86 -0.03 -2.51\nSouth Africa 12.06 12.18 +0.96 +2.45\nKenya 102.75 102.70 -0.05 +0.34\nIsrael 3.42 3.41 -0.22 +1.62\nTurkey 3.81 3.81 -0.24 -0.66\nChina 6.40 6.40 -0.04 +1.63\nIndia 63.74 63.82 +0.13 +0.14\nBrazil 3.20 3.20 +0.00 +3.63\nMexico 18.60 18.61 +0.03 +5.63\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 295 0 .00 8 06.17 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; additional reporting by Sujata Rao, editing by Larry King\n ",
