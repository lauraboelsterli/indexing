MCO 0.08% said Monday that Finance Chief Linda Huber would be leaving the company to pursue other opportunities after more than a decade of leadership at the firm.\nMoody’s said Ms. Huber, who joined the company in 2005, has agreed to remain for a transitional period and that it has started its search for a successor.\n“Linda has made a significant contribution to the success of Moody’s and will leave a legacy of strong and stable financial leadership,” Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel said.\nSince May of 2005, Moody’s shares have more than quadrupled to $167.23. The stock, up 60% over the past year, was inactive during premarket trading.\nMs. Huber, who has also held senior positions at PepsiCo Inc. and a subsidiary of Charles Schwab & Co., was a strong advocate for veterans, women and diversity in the workplace, Mr. McDaniel said.\nWrite to Imani Moise at imani.moise@wsj.com",
