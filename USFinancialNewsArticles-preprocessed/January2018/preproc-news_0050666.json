    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 4:14 PM / in 22 minutes Russia's Novak: neither U.S. firms nor world economy benefit from sanctions Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Neither U.S. companies nor the global economy would benefit from new sanctions against Russia, Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday, after the U.S. Treasury published a list of Russian businessmen and officials close to the Kremlin. \nNovas is among those included on the new list, which was drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law last August. It does not mean those included will be subject to sanctions, but it casts a potential shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians. \n“All sanctions... aim to create obstacles for business which means hindering market competition,” Novas said in a statement.
