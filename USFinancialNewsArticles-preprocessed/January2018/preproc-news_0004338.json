FILE PHOTO - Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of the State Council at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia December 27, 2017. REUTERS/Alexander Nemenov/Pool \nThe order was effective as of Jan 2. \nRussia halted civilian air traffic to Egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving the tourist resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing 224 people on board. \nThe bombing and the Russian suspension were blows to Egypt’s tourism industry, a key source of hard currency.
