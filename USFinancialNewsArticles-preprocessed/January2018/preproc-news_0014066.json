    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Intel Corporation (\"Intel\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: INTC) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Intel securities between July 27, 2017 and January 4, 2018, both dates inclusive (\"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/intc .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) there is a fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips as they contain a feature that makes them vulnerable to hacking; (2) updates to fix the problems in Intel's processor chips could cause Intel chips to operate 5-30 percent more slowly; and (3) consequently, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
