    "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (NASDAQ:WHLR) (“Wheeler” or the “Company”), a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers, today reported that the Company, through WHLR-JANAF, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has entered into a purchase and sale agreement (as amended) with JANAF Shopping Center, LLC, JANAF Shops, LLC, JANAF HQ, LLC and JANAF Crossings, LLC to acquire JANAF Shopping Yard (“JANAF”), an 887,917 rentable square foot shopping center located in Norfolk, Virginia.\nJANAF is located approximately 9 miles from the Wheeler corporate office in Virginia Beach, Virginia and, as of September 30, 2017, was 94% occupied and anchored by prominent retailers including BJ’s Wholesale Club and Fuel Center (151,345 square feet in total); T.J. Maxx (37,383 square feet); Petco (17,000 square feet); Wawa (7,240 square feet); and Big Lots (42,500 square feet). Service and necessity providers such as the United States Postal Service, SunTrust Bank and others are also tenants of JANAF and serve the surrounding community. JANAF encompasses approximately 92 acres and includes 850,683 square feet of retail space in multiple buildings and 37,234 square feet of office space in one building. Originally built in 1959, JANAF has undergone several renovations, the last being in 2006.\nThe expected purchase price of the acquisition of $85.65 million, or approximately $96 per leasable square foot, includes the assumption of approximately $58.4 million of mortgage loans secured by the property. The primary loan that the Company is assuming has a $53.3 million balance, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.49%, matures in July 2023 and is pre-payable 90 days prior to its maturity. The Company will also assume a separate loan with a $5.1 million balance that bears interest at a rate of 4.95%, matures in January 2026 and is pre-payable six months prior to its maturity.\nJon S. Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wheeler, stated, “JANAF is an iconic property located right here in our back yard in Virginia. The asset is centric to our business strategy of owning the dominant center in secondary and tertiary markets. We expect JANAF to be a long-term play for WHLR as we believe there is tremendous value in the underlying real estate. ”\nAbout Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Virginia Beach, VA, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.
