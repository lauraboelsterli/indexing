    "text": "(Reuters) - Mark E. Smith, lead singer and songwriter of British post-punk band The Fall, died at home on Wednesday aged 60, the bandâ€™s manager said in a statement. \nThe statement by Pam Van Damned gave no details but said an update would follow in the coming days. bit.ly/2n911rO \nIn 2017, The Fall canceled shows due to concerns over the health of Smith who underwent treatment, media reports said. \nSmith formed the band in 1976 and remained its only constant presence with many other members changing around him. \nSmith also released two solo albums - 'The Post Nearly Man' in 1998 and 'Pander! Panda! Panzer!' in 2002. He is described as a \"singular figure in post-punk\" by Rolling Stone magazine. rol.st/2n9b93R \nReporting by Kanishka Singh; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
