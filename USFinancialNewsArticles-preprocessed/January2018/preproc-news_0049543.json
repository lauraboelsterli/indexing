The brokerage has a “buy” rating on the stock. \nAnalysts, on an average, were expecting the company to report EBITDA of 64.4 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. KCom earned 67.6 million pounds last year. \nThe company, which provides communications services for customers such as Aviva Plc, said revenue performance for the year ending March 31 would be slightly below its expectations. \nShares in KCom were up 2 percent at 90 pence in thin trade at 0806 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.
