    "text": "Elfrid Payton scored 22 points and the Orlando Magic snapped a 14-game losing streak in Boston by delivering an impressive 103-95 triumph over the Celtics on Sunday at TD Garden.\nEvan Fournier added 19 points as Orlando won for just the second time in the past 10 games and third time in the last 20. Aaron Gordon contributed 11 points and 13 rebounds.\nKyrie Irving scored 40 points on 14-of-23 shooting but was unable to prevent Boston from going winless on a three-game home stand. Irving hit 5 of 7 3-point attempts and also had seven rebounds and five assists after a one-game absence due to shoulder soreness.\nJaylen Brown added 17 points for the Celtics, who committed 15 turnovers leading to 23 Orlando points.\nThe Magic took a 90-71 lead into the fourth quarter before suddenly becoming frigid and missing 15 of their first 16 field-goal attempts and scoring just four points over the first eight-plus minutes.\nThe Celtics whittled away and moved within 94-86 when Irving made two of three free throws with 4:16 to play. Payton broke Orlando’s drought with an 18-footer with 3:55 remaining and Khem Birch followed with a tip-in to give the Magic a 12-point advantage.\nFournier’s basket gave Orlando a 103-93 lead with 39.7 seconds left to all but close it out.\nOrlando trailed by one at the break before outscoring the Celtics 32-12 in the third quarter to open up the 19-point lead. The Magic made 15 of 25 shots in the stanza while Boston was a porous 4 of 17.\nIrving hit a 3-pointer early in the third quarter to give the Celtics a 62-60 lead before Orlando erupted on a 23-5 run. A basket by Fournier pushed the Magic lead into double digits at 75-64 with 6:25 left and Shelvin Mack’s hoop capped the surge and increased the margin to 83-67 with 3:45 to play.\nMario Hezonja drained a 3-pointer with 27.3 seconds remaining to give the Magic the 90-71 advantage.\nMagic guard Arron Afflalo missed the second game of a two-game suspension for punching Minnesota Timberwolves forward Nemanja Bjelica on Tuesday.\nIrving scored 24 first-half points on 9-of-12 shooting as the Celtics held a 59-58 halftime lead.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
