    "text": "SEATTLE,\nDividend Increase:\nAnnounced today a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.32 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 8, to all shareholders of record as of Feb. 20, 2018. This is the fifth time the company has raised the dividend since initiating the quarterly dividend in July 2013, with a cumulative increase of 220% since that time.\nFinancial Highlights:\nReported net income for the fourth quarter and full-year under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") of $367 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, and $1.0 billion, or $8.30 per diluted share. These results compare to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $114 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, and full-year 2016 net income of $814 million, or $6.54 per diluted share. As the acquisition of Virgin America Inc. (Virgin America) closed on Dec. 14, 2016, 2017 information reflects the results of Virgin America. 2016 information reflects the results of Virgin America from Dec. 14-31, 2016. Reported fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.83 compared to $1.56 reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted net income, excluding merger-related costs, special income tax benefits related to tax law changes, and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, was $103 million compared to $193 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This quarter's adjusted results compare to the First Call analyst consensus estimate of $0.82 per share. Reported full year 2017 adjusted net income, excluding merger-related costs, the special income tax benefit, and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, of $823 million, compared to $911 million in 2016. Reported 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.64, compared to $7.32 in 2016. Paid a $0.30 per-share quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter, bringing total dividend payments in 2017 to $148 million. Repurchased a total of 981,277 shares of common stock for approximately $75 million in 2017. Generated approximately $1.6 billion of operating cash flow and used approximately $1.0 billion for capital expenditures, resulting in approximately $547 million of free cash flow in 2017. Grew passenger revenues by 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and by 36% compared to full-year 2016, largely enabled by our acquisition of Virgin America in December of 2016. Generated full-year adjusted pretax margin of 17% in 2017. Held $1.6 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities as of Dec. 31, 2017. Reduced debt-to-capitalization ratio to 51% as of Dec. 31, 2017, compared to 59% as of Dec. 31, 2016.\n2017 Accomplishments and Highlights:\nRecognition and Awards - Alaska\nRanked \"Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Carriers\" in 2017 by J.D.

We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:\nBy eliminating fuel expense and certain special items (including merger-related costs, changes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and certain state tax law enactments) from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items, such as merger-related costs, is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as merger-related costs and mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business.\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nAircraft Utilization - block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours per day our aircraft are in transit\nAircraft Stage Length - represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure\nASMs - available seat miles, or \"capacity\"; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown\nCASM - operating costs per ASM, or \"unit cost\"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items\nCASMex - operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio - represents adjusted debt (long-term debt plus the present value of future operating lease payments) divided by total equity plus adjusted debt\nDiluted Earnings per Share - represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding\nDiluted Shares - represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised\nEconomic Fuel - best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program\nFree Cash Flow - total operating cash flow generated less cash paid for capital expenditures\nLoad Factor - RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers\nMainline - represents flying Boeing 737 and Airbus jets and all associated revenues and costs\nPRASM - passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called \"passenger unit revenue\"\nProductivity - number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee\nRASM - operating revenue per ASMs, or \"unit revenue\"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight & mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile\nRegional - represents capacity purchased by Alaska from Horizon, SkyWest, and PenAir. In this segment, Regional records actual on-board passenger revenue, less costs such as fuel, distribution costs, and payments made to Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir under the respective capacity purchased arrangement (CPAs). Additionally, Regional includes an allocation of corporate overhead such as IT, finance, other administrative costs incurred by Alaska and on behalf of Horizon.\nRPMs - revenue passenger miles, or \"traffic\"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM\nYield - passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alaska-air-group-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-and-full-year-results-and-raises-dividend-7-300588032.html\nSOURCE Alaska Air Group Inc.",
