    "text": " 30 AM / Updated 31 minutes ago Bank of England says payments problem fixed, some catch-up work ongoing Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Friday it was working to catch up on processing financial transactions after a communications outage hit one of its payment systems on Thursday. \n“Technology communications problems reported by the Bank yesterday have been fixed overnight. Systems are now working normally although there is some catch-up work to complete,” the central bank said in a statement. \nThe BoE expected to process payments as normal on Friday, but added that wholesale counterparty transactions may be dealt with later in the day than normal. \nThe outage did not affect the general public or the main high-speed interbank payments service, CHAPS, the BoE said.
