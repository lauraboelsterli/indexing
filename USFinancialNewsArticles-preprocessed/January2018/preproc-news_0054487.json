(“Dynex” or the “Company”). As detailed below, dividends paid by Dynex on its Common Stock were in part ordinary taxable income and in part a return of capital. No portion of the dividends paid in 2017 were capital gains. The distributions of ordinary taxable income are not eligible for the tax rate reductions enacted for qualified dividend income under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and are accordingly being reported as non-qualifying dividends.\nShareholders should review the 2017 tax statements and/or Forms 1099 that they receive from their brokerage firms in order to ensure that the dividend distribution information reported on such statements conforms to the information set forth in this press release.\nThe table below provides a summary of the tax information relating to the quarterly dividend distributions of the Company for the 2017 tax year:\nDynex Capital, Inc.
