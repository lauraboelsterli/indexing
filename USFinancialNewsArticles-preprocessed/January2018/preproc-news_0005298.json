    "text": "Japanese air bag maker Takata is recalling an additional 3.3 million faulty air bag inflators as it expands the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.\nThe latest recalls cover frontal air bags in certain 2009, 2010 and 2013 vehicles made Honda , Toyota , Audi , BMW , Daimler Vans , Fiat Chrysler , Ford , General Motors , Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda , Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi , Nissan , Subaru and Tesla . Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nNotices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday on the agency's website .\nTakata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers.\nAt least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured.\nThe latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection.\nThe recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority.\nMany automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001.\nNHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner.",
