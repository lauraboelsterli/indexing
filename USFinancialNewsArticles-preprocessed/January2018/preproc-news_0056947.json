    "text": "PLACERVILLE, CA, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - iMD Companies, Inc. (OTC: ICBU) Board of Directors announced today that the company is in negotiations to acquire gold producing mines in the California, Nevada, and Arizona regions. The company is looking to add revenues and assets by acquiring several new mines that have already produced millions of dollars in mining gold and have the potential to expand their operations. The company feels that with the addition of revenue producing gold mines, this would be the perfect complement to KRSNA Minerals, which is mining Chrome Powder and Iron Ore.\nKRSNA Minerals continues to mine Iron Ore and Chrome Powder and has expanded its operations to continue to fulfill purchase orders from their Hong Kong based customer for 5,000 metric tons of Magnesia Chrome Powder and 40,000 metric tons of Iron Ore. Because of the additional orders the contract had to be extended to two years for delivery. The company is looking to ship its next order of 10,000 metric tons of Chrome Powder and expects to have an update on shipments and quarterly revenue soon. Mining operations are moving forward on all orders and the company will continue to update its shareholders as new orders are fulfilled. The company will announce the details to all new acquisitions once completed.\nAbout iMD Companies, Inc.\nIMD Companies, Inc., (OTC: ICBU) is a Florida corporation, engaged in the manufacturing, extraction and distribution in mining, and asset accumulations of revenue producing companies.
