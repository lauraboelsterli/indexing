    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 7:25 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Hays posts higher quarterly net fees on strong international business Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British staffing company Hays Plc reported higher second-quarter net fees on Thursday, helped by strong performance in its international businesses. \nThe company said it continues to see vigorous trading conditions in the majority of its international markets, reporting a 16 percent rise in net fee growth in its Asia Pacific business. \nThe company, which places workers in areas such as finance and IT, reported a 13 percent rise in second-quarter group net fees at constant currencies in the three months ended Dec. 31. \nNet fees from its UK and Ireland operations rose 1 percent and the company said business in the UK remained stable. \nMost British staffing companies are relying on their overseas business to drive growth as uncertainty following Britainâ€™s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union curbs domestic demand. \nThe company, which has operations in 33 countries, said 24 of those markets grew in excess of 10 percent in the period.
