    "text": "Los Angeles, CA , Jan. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADOMANI, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADOM) , a provider of advanced zero-emission and hybrid vehicle drivetrain solutions and purpose-built electric vehicles, today announced the closing of an S-1 registered public offering of 3,666,667 Units at $3.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 1.5 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 (the “Offering”). The gross proceeds to ADOMANI from the Offering will be $11.0 million, before payment of placement agent fees and other offering expenses.\nBoustead Securities, LLC, the underwriter of ADOM’s Regulation A+ IPO in June 2017, which was the first ever on NASDAQ, was the exclusive placement agent for the Offering, while Roth Capital Partners served as a financial advisor to ADOMANI.\nWith this closing, ADOMANI is the first Regulation A+ Issuer on NASDAQ to conduct an S-1 registered secondary offering.\n“ADOMANI has, once again, demonstrated its leadership in pioneering a progression of equity offerings from Regulation A+ and Form 1-A for its NASDAQ IPO; to now completing a full S-1 Registration Statement offering,” said Dan McClory, Boustead Securities’ Head of Equity Capital Markets. “In our opinion, this is precisely what the SEC intended by enabling emerging growth companies to utilize the JOBS Act and access capital on a more efficient basis,” he continued. “ADOM has now raised more than $25 million through the public capital markets, ranking as the second-largest amount of gross funding proceeds for a Regulation A+ issuer,” McClory concluded.\nADOMANI intends to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily for the prepayment of its outstanding secured 9% notes payable and working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nThe Units will be issued pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-1 that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A preliminary prospectus has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Copies of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained, when available, from Boustead Securities, LLC, 6 Venture, Suite 325, Irvine, CA 92618, by telephone at +1 (949) 502-4409 or by e-mail at offerings@boustead1828.com\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, any security in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\nAbout Boustead Securities, LLC\nBoustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead”) is an investment banking firm that executes and advises on IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, capital raises and restructuring assignments in a wide array of industries, geographies and transactions, for a broad client base.
