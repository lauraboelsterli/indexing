Few analysts expect a crash despite a recent surge in supply.\nSpeaking last week, Riksbank Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley welcomed the fact the market was cooling off.\n“I don’t think it would have been good if we had continued to have the kind of price rises we have seen in recent years of 10-15 percent a year,” she told reporters.\n“Our view is that the increase in supply will probably lead in the short term to maybe some further price falls, but the strong economic development in Sweden and the rest of the world points to a stable price development ahead.” (Reporting by Simon Johnson, editing by Larry King)\n ",
