    "text": "Rookie Alex DeBrincat scored a hat trick in his first game in his home state and the Chicago Blackhawks snapped a four-game losing streak by defeating the Detroit Red Wings 5-1 on Thursday.\nDeBrincat, a 20-year-old winger from Farmington Hills, Mich., increased his season total to 17 goals and added an assist. DeBrincat’s three-goal night was the second of his career.\nAnthony Duclair scored his first goal with Chicago and chipped in two assists while Vinnie Hinostroza also scored. Anton Forsberg stopped 23 shots for the Blackhawks.\nAnthony Mantha broke up Forsberg’s shutout bid on a power-play goal with 3:51 remaining. Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard was pulled after allowing three goals in the first 8:47. Replacement Petr Mrazek made 17 saves.\nThe Blackhawks’ four-game losing streak began when the Wings and Mrazek blanked them 4-0 on Jan. 14. Chicago had a 28-24 advantage in shots on goal. Only three penalties were called and Chicago went 0-for-2 on the power play.\nDeBrincat opened the scoring at 3:19 when he spun around at the edge of the circle and lifted the puck over Howard’s left shoulder.\nDeBrincat set up the second tally at 5:34, passing it from the boards between the circles to Duclair, who fired it in for his 10th goal of the season. Duclair was acquired from the Arizona Coyotes on Jan. 10 in a four-player deal.\nHinostroza made it 3-0 after a Detroit giveaway in the neutral zone. Hinostroza carried the puck past the blue line, skated to the left circle and beat Howard on the short side.\nDeBrincat’s second goal came midway through the second. He brought the puck past the blue line, dropped a pass to Jonathan Toews, then got it back on the right side and beat Mrazek over his left shoulder.\nHenrik Zetterberg and Niklas Kronwall assisted on Mantha’s team-leading 16th goal.\nDeBrincat secured the hat trick with 19 seconds left on an empty-net goal assisted by Ryan Hartman.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
