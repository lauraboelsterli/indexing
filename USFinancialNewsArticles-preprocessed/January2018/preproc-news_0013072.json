    "text": "WASHINGTON—The world trading system confronts a new power vacuum, with out-of-date rules and no driving force spearheading any effort to update them.\nThat’s in large part because of the shifting American position on trade. The U.S. has flipped from being chief advocate to lead skeptic of the World Trade Organization, leaving the guardian of globalization without its primary champion. That new dynamic will be on display at the group’s biannual meeting, starting Sunday in Argentina.\n ",
