Consequently we expect revenue to grow by 7 - 10% to a range of $1,870 - $1,930 million whilst reducing our full year concentration of our largest customer to circa 12 – 14%. Furthermore, by leveraging our support infrastructure, we aim to continue our best in industry cost management approach and expect earnings per share to increase by 10 – 13% to a range of $5.89 - $6.09. In addition to this organic growth, we will continue to focus on deploying capital to maximise shareholder value through a combination of M&A and share repurchases.”\nThe full year 2018 financial guidance assumes:\nTop customer concentration to reduce to circa 12 - 14% of revenue from circa 18% in 2017. US dollar to Euro exchange rate of $1.20 (constant currency revenue growth of circa 7%). An effective tax rate of circa 12%. Circa $360 million of free cash flow and capital expenditures of circa $50 million. $25 million worth of shares repurchased in Q4 2017 from current up to $400 million repurchase programme contributing circa 3c to 2018 earnings. Remaining authorisation of up to $157 million to be executed opportunistically during 2018 depending on cash commitments to support M&A pipeline, no additional earnings benefit included in guidance.\nWith respect to 2017, the company confirmed its current guidance, of revenue in the range of $1,740 – $1,770 million and earnings in the range of $5.30 - $5.40.\nICON will be presenting at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 9 th at 9:30am PT (12:30pm EST, 5:30pm Ireland & UK).
