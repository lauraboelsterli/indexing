( bit.ly/2mSwxKD ) \nSpotlightâ€™s content will include news, pop culture, sports and politics, and will be available through a play list, said Spotify, which has 70 million subscribers. \nSpotify has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018, Reuters reported last week.
