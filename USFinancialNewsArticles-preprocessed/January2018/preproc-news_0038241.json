The creations, often handmade, are not meant for shops, and when sold are usually exclusively tailored to one person. \nDior showed off its almost completely monochrome outfits on a checkered catwalk. Models peered out from behind facemasks: some feline, others like mailboxes, all of them black. \nFamed Surrealist artists such as Salvador Dali or Rene Magritte often depicted bird cages or disjointed body parts in their art, a motif evoked in the show with giant noses and ears dangling over the runway and cage-like corsets worn on it.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau \nGowns and capes strewn with feathers or featuring waspy, see-through fabrics also gave the collection a dream-like feel, as did the geometric patterns or swirls on many dresses. \n“Black and white is the color of the subconscious and I think when you dream, you dream in black and white, so I decided it would be great to make a collection in black and white,” Dior’s chief designer Maria Grazia Chiuri told Reuters after the show. Slideshow (9 Images) \nChiuri said in a press release she was also inspired by Italian Surrealist artist Leonor Fini, a friend of Christian Dior, the late founder of the house in the last 1940s. \nThe fashion house is set to host a masqued ball later on Monday, also in the grounds of Paris’ Rodin museum, the setting for the show. \nDior’s latest collection from Chiuri comes amid a shake-up at the label, as former Fendi boss Pietro Beccari prepares to replace long-standing CEO Sidney Toledano, who is moving to run several other labels in the LVMH group.
