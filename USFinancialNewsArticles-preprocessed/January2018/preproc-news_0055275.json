    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) said on Tuesday it has suspended its chief lobbyist Thomas Steg amid steps to clear up the circumstances of diesel fume tests conducted with monkeys and humans that were sponsored by the carmaker.\nThe German carmaker said it has accepted the proposal by Steg to assume full responsibility for the experiments that were revealed by the New York Times last week and have since been condemned by politicians and animal rights activists.\nJens Hanefeld, responsible for international and European political issues at VW, will replace Steg on an acting basis, VW said.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
