    "text": "President Donald Trump just made a case for \"worldwide trickle down\" economics during his speech at the World Economic Forum, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday.\n\"Davos is a conversation about how to get the poor to be rich,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street ,\" shortly after the president's \"America First\" speech in Davos, Switzerland.\nTrump spoke \"about how to get the rich to be even richer and therefore the poor will do better. Kind of a worldwide trickle down,\" Cramer contended.\nTrickle down theory , popularized during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, maintains that cutting taxes, particularly for U.S. companies, will spur economic growth and help everyday Americans. There's been a fierce debate years, split largely along party lines, on whether it works.\nTrump, the first sitting U.S. president in 18 years to address the annual conclave of the rich and powerful, said the U.S. was \"open for business,\" casting the U.S. as a hospitable business environment, boosted in part by the corporate tax cut enacted by Republicans last year.\nDenis Balibouse | Reuters President Donald Trump gestures as he delivers a speech during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland January 26, 2018. Cramer said Trump's speech was not typical of American leaders.\n\"I think he made a great sales pitch for America,\" said Cramer, the host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" \"That's not what anyone has ever done at Davos.\"\nTrump struck an inclusive tone, inviting other world leaders to do business in the U.S.\nThe president was saying, \"'I'm with ya,'\" Cramer said. \"He's not saying you can't come to our place. He's saying you better come to our place.\"\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
