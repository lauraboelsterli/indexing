    "text": " 13 AM / in 28 minutes Estate agent Countrywide CEO Alison Platt resigns Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 24 (Reuters) - Countrywide, Britain’s biggest lettings and estate agency firm, said Chief Executive Officer Alison Platt had stepped down, a week after the company warned on full-year group income after a disappointing fourth quarter. \nPlatt will also resign from the board, the company said. \nCountrywide said Paul Creffield, previously managing director of the company’s commercial development division, has been appointed as group operations director with immediate effect. \nThe company said in August that Platt would take on more responsibilities as it executes a new organisational structure.
