    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The CFP Board Center for Financial Planning today announced that Vanguard will support its work as a Visionary Circle Sponsor.\n\"Vanguard has been a strong supporter of the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification and its role in contributing to a talent pipeline for the financial planning profession,\" said Marilyn Mohrman-Gillis, Executive Director of the CFP Board Center for Financial Planning. \"We are thrilled that Vanguard is among those at the forefront of working to grow and diversify the profession through its support of the Center and its initiatives.\"\nVanguard's sponsorship aligns with the Center's commitment to attracting and developing the next generation of trusted financial professionals so that every American has access to competent and ethical financial planning.\n\"At Vanguard we are committed to placing client needs first while giving them the best chance for long-term investment success,\" said Frank Kolimago, Principal and Head of Personal Advisor Services. \"The CFP® certification has become the recognized standard of excellence for personal financial planning. When combined with Vanguard's mission, this credential gives advisors a strong foundation for helping clients achieve their goals.\"\nMohrman-Gillis noted that there are many challenges facing the financial planning profession, including an aging workforce that does not reflect the diversity of the public that it serves and a dire shortage of qualified faculty to teach the next generation of financial planning professionals. The Center brings together stakeholders, including more than 80,000 CFP® professionals, firms of all sizes, CFP Board's registered programs, non-profit organizations and subject matter experts to address these challenges facing the profession.\nTo learn more and support the Center's initiatives, visit www.CenterforFinancialPlanning.org . The work of the Center is also made possible through Center sponsors, including Lead Founding Sponsor TD Ameritrade Institutional and Founding Sponsor Northwestern Mutual.\nABOUT VANGUARD\nVanguard is one of the world's largest investment management companies. As of December 31, 2017, Vanguard managed $4.9 trillion in global assets. The firm, headquartered in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, offers 385 funds to its more than 20 million investors worldwide.
