    "text": "DAVOS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Britain will not be reversing Brexit, finance minister Philip Hammond told business chiefs in Davos.\n“Britain will be leaving the EU on the 29th of March 2019,” Hammond said. “This decision is not going to be reversed. That is a matter of political reality.”\nHammond said it was important to have an arrangement which allowed free trade between Britain and the world’s largest trading bloc to continue.\nBut he said any Brexit trade deal should be both bespoke and ambitious.\n“Off-the-shelf deal - Canada and Norway - is not the right model for Britain or the EU,” Hammond said. “This is something more ambitious than any trade deal that has been agreed in the past.”\nThe European Council meeting in March should confirm what the British call the implementation period, which is known by most people as the transition period.
