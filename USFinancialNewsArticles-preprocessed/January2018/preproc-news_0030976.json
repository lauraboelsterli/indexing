    "text": "Strong Financial Performance Despite Non-cash Tax Cuts & Jobs Act Charge\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI) today announced that its board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.125 per share for the fourth quarter ($0.50 annualized) payable on February 15, 2018, to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 31, 2018. KMI continues to expect to increase its dividend to $0.80 per share for 2018 ($0.20 per share for Q1 2018). KMI also continues to expect to use cash in excess of dividend payments to fully fund growth investments, further strengthening its balance sheet.\n“Kinder Morgan thrived in 2017. We had very good financial performance despite facing continued strong headwinds (including an epic rain event), we strengthened the balance sheet beyond our original projections, and we announced our plan to return value to shareholders through an increasing dividend and a $2 billion share repurchase program. Our previously announced 2018 guidance, with $0.80 dividends to be declared for 2018, and the early start to our share repurchases, which we began in December 2017, shows our commitment to that plan. We are highly confident in our ability to maintain robust dividend coverage while delivering a substantial dividend increase to stockholders out of operating cash flows in excess of growth capital. And of course we will continue the important work of strengthening our balance sheet by funding all growth capital through operating cash flows with no need for external funding for growth capital for the third straight year,” said Richard D. Kinder, Executive Chairman.\nPresident and CEO Steve Kean said, “During 2017 we completed the Elba Liquefaction Project joint venture and the IPO of our Canadian pipelines and terminals assets (KML). Those transactions helped us outperform our original target for strengthening our balance sheet, leading to a year-end 2017 Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times versus our plan of 5.4 times. We are committed to achieving or beating our longer term leverage target of 5.0 times. We also placed almost $1.8 billion of projects in service throughout the year and added a substantial additional natural gas project in Gulf Coast Express. We had good commercial and operating performance, slightly exceeding our plan for the year. We are pleased with the strength and resiliency of the company’s business and with our operational performance.”\n“We also had a solid fourth quarter, but because of a non-cash accounting charge resulting from the reduction in corporate income tax rates, we are showing a fourth quarter loss of $0.47 in earnings per common share. While the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will ultimately be moderately positive for KMI, the reduced corporate income tax rate causes certain deferred-tax assets to be revalued at 21 percent versus 35 percent. Although there is no impact to the underlying related deductions, which can continue to be used to offset future taxable income, KMI will take an estimated approximately $1.4 billion non-cash accounting charge for the 4 th quarter. This charge is our initial estimate and may be refined in the future as permitted by recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The positive impacts of the law include the reduced corporate income tax rate and the fact that several of our U.S. business units (essentially all but our interstate natural gas pipelines) will be able to deduct 100 percent of their capital expenditures through 2022. The net impact results in postponing the date when KMI becomes a federal cash taxpayer by approximately one year, to beyond 2024,” continued Kean.\nFor the quarter, we achieved distributable cash flow (DCF) of $0.53 per common share, representing 4 percent growth over the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in $910 million of excess DCF above our dividend. The discrepancy between a reported net income loss and a DCF gain illustrates why we and those who follow our businesses view the DCF metric as an important measure of our financial performance.”\nKean added, “We continue to drive future growth by completing significant infrastructure development projects that we track as part of our project backlog. Our current project backlog is essentially flat with last quarter at $11.8 billion, with a small decrease primarily due to projects going into service, which was mostly offset by the addition of our Gulf Coast Express joint venture. Excluding the CO 2 segment projects, we expect the projects in our backlog to generate an average capital-to-EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.5 times.”\nKMI reported a fourth quarter net loss available to common stockholders of $1,045 million, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and DCF of $1,190 million, up 4 percent from $1,147 million for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in DCF was driven by greater contributions from the Natural Gas, Terminals and Products Pipelines Business Units, as well as from Kinder Morgan Canada, partially offset by decreased contributions from CO 2 . Net income available to common stockholders was impacted by a $1,276 million unfavorable change in total Certain Items (as described under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 Certain Items were driven largely by the non-cash accounting charge resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as previously discussed.\nFor the full year, KMI reported net income available to common stockholders of $27 million, versus $552 million for 2016, and DCF of $4,482 million ($2.00 per share) that was down slightly from $4,511 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in DCF was driven by the sale of 50 percent of Southern Natural Gas (SNG) in 2016, negative impacts of Hurricane Harvey, a contribution to KMI’s pension plan, and the KML IPO, partially offset by increased contributions from the Terminals Business Unit, growth projects in the Natural Gas Business Unit, lower interest expense, and lower general and administrative expenses. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Harvey, the SNG sale and the KML IPO, DCF was up over 1 percent from 2016. Net income available to common stockholders was also impacted by a $512 million increase in total Certain Items compared to 2016. Certain Items in 2017 were driven by the revaluation of certain deferred-tax assets described above, partially offset by asset impairment charges taken during 2016.\n2018 Outlook\nFor 2018, KMI’s budget is set to declare dividends of $0.80 per common share, achieve DCF of approximately $4.57 billion ($2.05 per common share) and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7.5 billion. KMI also budgeted to invest $2.2 billion in growth projects during 2018 (excluding growth capital expected to be funded by KML), to be funded with internally generated cash flow without the need to access equity markets, and to end the year with a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 5.1 times.\nKMI previously announced it will further enhance shareholder value through a $2 billion share buy-back program.
