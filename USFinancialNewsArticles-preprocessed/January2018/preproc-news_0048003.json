(\"Sucampo\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SCMP ) who held Sucampo securities and have been harmed by Guidance and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(d)(4), 14(e), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the tender offer of Company common stock to be purchased by Mallinckrodt plc (\"Mallinckrodt\").\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sucampo stockholders are only anticipated to receive $18.00 per share in cash in exchange for each share of Sucampo.
