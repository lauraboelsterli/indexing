    "text": "January 8, 2018 / 7:30 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Apple releases new update to fix 'Spectre' chip flaw Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday released an updated version of its operating system software to fix a major microchip security flaw that affected nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. \nLast week, Alphabet Inc’s Google and other security researchers disclosed two major chip flaws, one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre, that left computing devices vulnerable to hackers. \n\"For our customers' protection, Apple doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and patches or releases are available,\" the company said on its website. ( apple.co/2CWbZe8 ) \nThe technology giant also released software updates for its Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch. \nThe iPhone maker had said on Thursday it will release a patch for the Safari web browser on its iPhones, iPads and Macs. \nApple had also said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw.
