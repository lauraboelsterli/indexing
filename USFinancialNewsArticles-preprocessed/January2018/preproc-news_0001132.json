    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Live Ventures Incorporated (Nasdaq:LIVE), a diversified holding company, today announces its wholly owned subsidiary, Vintage Stock, has achieved unprecedented sales during the 2017 holiday season.\nDuring the holiday season period from December 1 through December 24, 2017, compared to the same period last year, Vintage Stock demonstrated:\nAn increase in year-over-year sales by 60 percent from stores opened within the last year\nIncreases in all same store sales compared to the same period last season of:\nUsed toys sales up by 60 percent Used comics and books sales up by 24 percent New video games and hardware sales up by 22 percent Used music CD’s & Record LP’s sales up by 16 percent Previously owned DVD and Blu-Ray movies sales up by 8 percent\n“Regardless of predictions to the contrary, brick and mortar is alive and well, as shown by the results of Vintage Stock’s 2017 holiday sales,” said Rodney Spriggs, CEO of Vintage Stock. “We believe the record sales Vintage Stock experienced this holiday season demonstrates that perhaps it is not brick and mortar in general, but rather big box stores that have not changed their business model over the last decade, combined with the over saturation of ‘me too’ fashion retailers. We believe that expected strong growth in new video game and hardware sales in 2018 will fuel future growth on the used side of our business and an expected stronger 2018 movie box office will drive more foot traffic that we believe should, in turn, drive sales across all of our product lines. We anticipate that smart and value-conscious consumers will continue to visit our stores for the brand-new video games and movies and seek out lost favorites and discover new treasures that they can physically own from our pre-owned inventory.”\nAbout Live Ventures Incorporated\nLive Ventures Incorporated is a diversified holding company with several wholly owned subsidiaries and a strategic focus on acquiring profitable companies that have demonstrated a strong history of earnings power.
