The Company refers investors to the Statement for the complete terms and conditions of the Offers. Any of the Offers may be amended in any respect in the Company's sole discretion, subject to applicable securities laws.\nThe following table sets forth certain terms of each Offer:\nNotes\nCUSIP/ISIN (1)\nPrincipal Amount\nOutstanding as of\nJanuary 26, 2018\nNotes\nConsideration (2)\n8.625% Senior Secured\nNotes due 2018\n144A\nCUSIP 822538 AA2 and ISIN\nUS822538AA22\nRegulation S\nCUSIP G23618 AA2 and ISIN\nUSG23618AA22\n$30,415,000\n$1,002.50\n9.500% Senior Secured\nNotes due 2020\n144A\nCUSIP 822538 AC8 and ISIN\nUS822538AC87\nRegulation S\nCUSIP G23618 AB0 and ISIN\nUSG23618AB05\nIAI\nCUSIP 822538 AD6 and ISIN\nUS822538AD60\n$502,834,978\n$1,025.75\n(1) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP or ISIN numbers listed in this press release, the Statement, the Letter of Transmittal or the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery or printed on the governing indentures. They are provided solely for the convenience of the holders of Notes.\n(2) \"Notes Consideration\" is the total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of 8.625% Notes and 9.500% Notes, respectively, accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer and excluding accrued and unpaid interest. Holders will receive in cash an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date (as defined below) in addition to the Notes Consideration.\nEach Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 2, 2018 (such date and time, as it may be extended, the \"Expiration Time\"), unless earlier terminated. Tendered Notes may be withdrawn from an Offer at any time until the earlier of (a) the Expiration Time and (b) if the applicable Offer is extended, the 10th business day after commencement of that Offer.\nTendered Notes need to be delivered on or prior to the Expiration Time, except if Notes are delivered through the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Statement, in which case guaranteed deliveries of tendered Notes need to be made by February 6, 2017. The Company expects both Offers to settle on February 7, 2017 (the \"Settlement Date\").\nFor each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer, holders will receive the amount set forth in the table above under the heading \"Notes Consideration,\" together with an amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date. In the event that an Offer is withdrawn or otherwise not completed, the applicable Notes Consideration will not be paid or become payable to holders of Notes who have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn their Notes in connection with such Offer. In any such event, Notes previously tendered pursuant to such Offer will be promptly returned to their tendering holder.\nThe Company will fund the Offers with the net cash proceeds from a debt financing transaction (the \"Proposed Financing\").\nEach Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the Statement, including successful completion of the Proposed Financing, which conditions may be waived by the Company in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law.\nThe Company is exercising, concurrently with the commencement of the Offers, its right to optionally redeem pursuant to the terms of the applicable indentures, as amended or supplemented, any and all Notes not purchased by the Company in the applicable Offer, conditioned upon and subject to successful completion of the Proposed Financing. In the event that the Company does not consummate the redemption of the Notes, it may otherwise acquire any Notes which remain outstanding after the Expiration Time, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, one or more additional tender offers, or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as the Company may determine.\nInformation Relating to the Offers\nThe Statement, the Letter of Transmittal and the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery are being distributed to holders of Notes beginning today.
