    "text": "Published: Jan 17, 2018 8:41 a.m. ET Share \nLawyers, advocates for Harvey Weinstein victims argue for deals in and out of bankruptcy Getty Images for The Weinstein Company Harvey Weinstein was fired from Weinstein Co. in October following allegations of assault and sexual harassment \nBy Jonathan Randles Peg Brickley \nThere’s debate about whether the women bringing allegations against Harvey Weinstein will fare better financially if Weinstein Co. finds a buyer who doesn’t require the studio file for bankruptcy protection, as the troubled company weighs several offers. \nA chapter 11 filing would halt lawsuits brought by women against the studio, forcing them to line up with low-ranking creditors to await their fate. Once the money from a sale comes in, bankruptcy law dictates who gets paid first — the banks that kept Weinstein Co. in business — and who gets paid last — women claiming that Weinstein Co. was part of Mr. Weinstein’s pattern of alleged sexual misconduct. Mr. Weinstein has denied allegations of non-consensual sex. \nIf the studio files for bankruptcy, it would only halt civil lawsuits against the company, not those filed against Mr. Weinstein, individually. \nSome attorneys argue that the appointment of a bankruptcy court judge and creditor fiduciaries would bring more transparency to how the company treats alleged victims. “My view is that anything that happens behind closed doors and outside of the scrutiny of the court is probably a misstep,” said Cris Armenta, an attorney representing alleged victims on a proposed class-action lawsuit against the studio.
