    "text": "On Monday, Kentucky learned that it was ranked outside of the top 25 for the first time in 68 weeks. On Tuesday, the Wildcats began the task to rectify that situation with a 78-65 victory over visiting Mississippi State.\nFreshman forward PJ Washington led the victory with 22 points, including 10-of-14 from the free throw line. Freshman Kevin Knox added 19 and freshman Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 16.\nKentucky trailed 52-49 with 12:46 to play when the Wildcats went on a 13-2 run to grab a 62-54 lead with 7:01 remaining and coasted to victory from there. Knox scored five points and Washington had four during the rally.\nFor the game, Kentucky shot 43.1 percent, including 35.7 from 3-point range. The Wildcats had 41 rebounds, 11 assists and 11 turnovers\nMissisippi State got 19 points from Quinndary Weatherspoon and 10 from Nick Weatherspoon. The Bulldogs shot 38.8 percent, but only 17.2 percent from 3-point range on 5-of-29 shooting. They had 31 rebounds, 16 assists and 11 turnovers.\nKentucky (15-5, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) was coming off back-to-back losses for only the ninth time in coach John Calipariâ€™s nine seasons in Lexington. The Wildcats never have lost three in a row under Calipari and average a 14.9-point victory in the bounce-back game.
