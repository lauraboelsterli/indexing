    "text": "January 6, 2018 / 11:36 AM / in 7 hours Former Zimbabwe ministers loyal to Mugabe charged with corruption Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nHARARE (Reuters) - Two former Zimbabwean cabinet ministers who served under ex-president Robert Mugabe have been charged with corruption, their lawyers said on Saturday, the latest sign of a crackdown on officials loyal to Mugabe. Robert Mugabe waits to address attendees during the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 28, 2015. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/Files \nMugabe, 93, stood down in November after 37 years in power following a de facto military coup, making way for his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa to take over. \nWhen the military seized power they arrested key allies of Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who was vying with Mnangagwa to succeed her husband. \nFormer foreign minister Walter Mzembi and ex-energy minister Samuel Undenge were charged on Friday with “criminal abuse of office”, their lawyers said. They both deny wrongdoing. \nUndenge is accused of issuing a $12,650 contract without due tender to a company that did no work, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters. \nMzembi and Undenge were both granted bail on Saturday, asked to surrender their passports and remanded until Jan. 22 when their cases will be heard. \n“We are going to make an application for an exception to the charge because the charges that my client is facing are ridiculous,” Job Sikhala, Mzembi’s lawyer, told reporters outside the court. \nUndenge’s lawyer Alex Muchadehama described the case against his client as a “circus”. \nFormer finance minister Ignatius Chombo is on bail after being charged in November over accusations he tried to defraud the central bank over a decade ago. Chombo denies wrongdoing. Reporting by Alfonce Mbizwo; Writing by Joe Brock; Editing by Ros Russell",
