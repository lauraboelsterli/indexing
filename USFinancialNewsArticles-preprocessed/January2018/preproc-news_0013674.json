    "text": "PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Bank of France said on Monday it already held some currency reserves in yuan, hours after the German central bank said it was looking to move some of its reserves into the Chinese currency.\n“Currency reserves remain in their vast majority invested in U.S. dollar, with a diversification towards a limited number of international currencies such as the Chinese renminbi,” the bank said in a statement.\nThe yuan leapt to its strongest level in more than two years against the dollar on Monday, buoyed by the Bundesbank’s comment.\nThe French central bank said it would not reveal a breakdown of its reserves, and did not say when it first included the yuan.
