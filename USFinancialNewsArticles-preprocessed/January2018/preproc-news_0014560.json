From the historical data thus far reviewed, we can confidently make the assumption that the AG1 Silver Mine is worth substantially more than what we paid for it. We look forward to providing additional details on why we are really excited about Bullard's Peak and Black Hawk and other new acquisitions that we expect to announce in coming weeks. We were also particularly fortunate to avail of the very promising nearby Sunset Lode and Sunset Placer deposits in the Pinos Altos District of Grant County, New Mexico on excellent terms.\nFuture announcements in which we will soon reveal additional details, will show these acquisitions have the potential to be game changers for Santa Fe shareholders. We remain confident in our overall strategy and are redoubling our efforts to acquire additional very attractive properties and make complementary investments and joint ventures that will continue to reflect favorably on our capacity to identify, research, qualify and secure the exceptional additional acquisitions we are currently working on: With the recent record breaking up moves in Gold and Silver and increasingly bullish predictions on precious metals, we continue to believe 2018 will be a very exciting year for Santa Fe shareholders.\"\nAbout Santa Fe Gold\nSanta Fe Gold is a U.S.-based mining and exploration enterprise and owns the following mining assets: The Knight’s Peak region of Grant County, New Mexico comprising the Malone Mines, Patanka, Hillcrest, Barranca and Principal Mines, altogether incorporating some twenty mine sites and all located at Knight’s Peak, together with an expanded area surrounding the Malone Mines in the southern region of Burro Mountains, New Mexico.
