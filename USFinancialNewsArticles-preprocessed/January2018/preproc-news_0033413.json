    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 2:59 PM / Updated an hour ago Storm kills three in the Netherlands, one in Germany Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Three people were killed in the Netherlands and a man died in Germany on Thursday as powerful winds toppled trees, blew trucks off the road and forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights. \nAmsterdam’s Schiphol Airport briefly suspended all air traffic on Thursday as gusts of up to 140 kph (85 mph) were recorded along the coast. \nAt least 260 flights were scrapped and falling roof tiles led to the closure of airport terminals. Nationwide train services and many tram and bus services were halted after the highest weather alert was issued. \nPolice said three people were killed by falling trees or debris in separate incidents. \nIn Rotterdam, shipping containers were toppled and entire roofs ripped off homes. \nSchiphol later said some flights would resume as the storm moved inland, but that there would be severe delays. \nIn Germany, a 59-year-old man was killed by a falling tree in Emmerich near the Dutch border, a spokesman for the town said. \nSome 100,000 people in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and in the northern state of Lower Saxony were left without power, a spokesman for the energy company Westnetz said. \nHe said the company hoped to restore power within hours, provided the storm did not cause further damage. \nThe German railway operator Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] said it had suspended all long-distance rail services due to the storm. “Rail traffic is currently halted Germany-wide,” it tweeted. \nSome bridges and some stretches of road were closed in NRW. \nIn Munich, eight domestic flights by Lufthansa were canceled, the airport operator said.
