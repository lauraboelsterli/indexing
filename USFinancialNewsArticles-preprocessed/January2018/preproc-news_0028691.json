THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON SIR'S PRESENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THESE STATEMENTS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND SIR'S CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT SIR'S DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE $0.51/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $2.04/SHARE PER YEAR.

THE SIR BOARD CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN SETTING DIVIDEND RATES INCLUDING SIR'S HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED INCOME, NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, THE THEN CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS AND AVAILABILITY OF CASH TO PAY SIR'S OBLIGATIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO MAINTAIN SIR'S TAX STATUS AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST AND OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY SIR'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN ITS DISCRETION. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE DIVIDEND RATES MAY BE INCREASED OR DECREASED AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE RATE AT WHICH FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID. FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS, INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE.\nA Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.\nNo shareholder, Trustee or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180119005653/en/\nSelect Income REIT\nChristopher Ranjitkar, 617-796-8320\nDirector, Investor Relations\nwww.sirreit.com\nSource: Select Income REIT",
