    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Parallax Health Sciences, Inc. (\"Parallax\" or the \"Company\") (OTC-Pink: PRLX), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Parallax Health Management, Inc. (\"PHM\"), Parallax Behavioral Health, Inc. (\"PBH\"), the owner of RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. and an emerging leader in Remote Patient monitoring and point of care technology, today announced that its board of directors has approved the planned spin-off of its pharmacy business, known as RoxSan Pharmacy, Inc. (\"RoxSan\"), and declared a special dividend distribution of a majority of the outstanding shares of RoxSan common stock, (\"Special Dividend\").\nThe Special Dividend will be made in conjunction with an equity financing into RoxSan currently in negotiation and the exact number of common stock ratio to be distributed will be announced at a later date and distributed to those shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 31, 2018. Parallax shareholders will receive shares of RoxSan common stock. Registered shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Special Dividend distribution is expected to be paid on or about April 1, 2018.\nThe distribution of RoxSan common stock will complete the proposed separation of the pharmacy business from Parallax. After the separation, RoxSan will become an independent company focused on compounding, prescriptions and infertility drugs, and Parallax will retain no ownership interest.\n\"Today's announcement is a significant milestone toward the creation of a 'pure play' focused on shareholder value creation with priorities given toward the goal of scaling our PHM, PBH and diagnostics businesses, each of which will be focused on transforming the lives of patients in distinct areas,\" said Paul Arena, Chief Executive Officer of Parallax.\nThe stock dividend distribution is subject to, among other conditions, a majority of the shareholders of Parallax voting in favor of the transaction. It is anticipated that a proxy solicitation will not be required. The Company will file the appropriate information describing the details on Form 8-K contemporaneous with the completion of this contemplated transaction.\nThe spin-off has been structured to qualify as a tax-free distribution to U.S. holders of Parallax's common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, cash received in lieu of fractional shares may be taxable to such shareholders. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the separation and distribution of RoxSan.\nNo action is required by Parallax shareholders to receive shares of RoxSan common stock as part of this Special Dividend distribution. Any holder of Parallax common stock who sells shares of Parallax common stock on or before the distribution date may be selling the entitlement to receive shares of RoxSan common stock.\nAbout Parallax Health Sciences, Inc.\nParallax Health Sciences, Inc.
