    "text": "OSLO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Italyâ€™s Eni will use the Songa Enabler semi-submersible rig to drill two infill wells at its Arctic Goliat field this year, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said on Monday.\nDrilling is scheduled to begin in late January, and is expected to last for 116 days, the safety watchdog, whose consent was required to use the rig, added in a statement.\nThe Songa Enabler, owned by Songa Offshore, is on a long-term contract with Statoil and was on sublets to Aker BP and Bayerngas in December.\nStatoil has a 35 percent stake in the Goliat field, while operator Eni holds the rest.
