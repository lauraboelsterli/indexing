    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The United States is “playing with fire” by setting up a Syrian border security force including Kurdish militia forces, Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Monday.\nThe U.S.-led coalition said on Sunday it was working with its Syrian militia allies to set up a new border force of 30,000 personnel. Turkey regards the Kurdish YPG militia, which will form part of this force, as a terrorist group.\nWriting by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
