(TSXV:EMH) (OTCQX:EMHTF) (\"Emerald\" or the “Company”) closed today its prospectus sale (the “Offering”) to a single Canadian institutional accredited investor (the “Investor”) announced on January 3, 2018. Pursuant to the Offering, the Company has issued 3,000,000 units (the “Units”) at a price per Unit of $5.00, for gross proceeds of $15,000,000.\nEach Unit consisted of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant will entitle the Investor to acquire one common share of the Company (a “Warrant Share”) at a price of $6.00 per Warrant Share for a period of 36 months following the closing of the Offering. In the event that the closing sale price of the Company’s common shares (the “Common Shares”) on the TSX Venture Exchange is greater than $8.00 per Common Share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days at any time after the closing of the Offering, the Company may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants by giving notice to the Investor and in such case the Warrants will expire on the 30th day after the date on which such notice is given by the Company.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for its production and R&D-related growth plans, working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Units were offered by way of a shelf prospectus supplement filed in all of the provinces of Canada, except Quebec, pursuant to National Instrument 44-101 - Short Form Prospectus Distributions .\nThe previously announced purchase by the Investor of 2,000,000 Common Shares (the “Secondary Sale”) from Emerald Health Sciences Inc., a control person of the Company, at a price of $5.00 per share, is expected to close separately.\nAbout Emerald Health Therapeutics Inc.\nEmerald Health Therapeutics, Inc.
