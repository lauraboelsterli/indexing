    "text": "Ford said its quarterly earnings swung to a profit in the fourth quarter, but fell shy of analysts' expectations on Wednesday.\nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:\nAdjusted EPS: 39 cents vs. 42 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $ 41.3 billion vs. $36.99 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters Fourth-quarter net income was $2.4 billion, or 60 cents per share. A year-ago, Ford posted a loss of $781 million.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 39 cents a share, which missed analyst expectations of 42 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\nFord reported $41.3 billion in revenue, up 7 percent from a year ago, and higher than the $36.9 billion analysts were expecting.\nAdjusted pretax profit was $1.7 billion in the latest period.\n\"In 2017 we made tremendous progress in laying the foundation for our strategy — smart vehicles in a smart world — from accelerating our connected vehicles plans to expanding our AV and EV work,\" said CEO Jim Hackett.\nThe second largest U.S. automaker is spending aggressively as it tries to transition from only making cars to selling a wide variety of transportation and mobility services and products. Ford has said it is relying on sales of high-margin trucks, crossovers, and SUVs to fund the development of new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and electrified powertrains.\nAmong other things, Ford plans to invest up to $11 billion in electrified vehicles by 2022, the company said in mid-January.\nFord also made several investments in mobility tech throughout 2017. It announced in 2017 it will invest $1 billion in autonomous technology company Argo AI over the next five years. The company also said in October it would invest in Silicon Valley startup Autonomic, which Ford plans to use to make a software platform for delivering transportation services.\nThis is breaking news.
