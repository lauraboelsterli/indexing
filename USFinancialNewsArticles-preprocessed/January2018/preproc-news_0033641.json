    "text": "PRAGUE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Czech lower house voted on Friday to allow prosecution of Prime Minister Andrej Babis in a case of alleged EU subsidy fraud, which has blocked his attempts at creating a government.\nLawmakers voted 111-69 to lift Babisâ€™ parliamentary immunity. Babis denies wrongdoing in the case, in which police allege he hid ownership of a farm and convention centre a decade ago to receive a 2 million-euro subsidy involving European Union funds.
