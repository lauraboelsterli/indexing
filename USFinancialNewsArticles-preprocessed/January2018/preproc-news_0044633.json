This makes sense considering how one-sided (to the upside) the speculative bets have become,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\nOverall, there is now far more demand for options to sell Brent than there is for call options, which are the right to buy Brent at a certain price.\nSTILL STRONG SUPPORT\nDespite this, traders said oil prices were unlikely to tumble far as markets remain supported by healthy economic growth, as well as from supply restrictions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\nIn the latest sign of robust global economic growth, Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years in January, a survey showed on Wednesday.\nEconomic growth is translating into healthy oil demand growth, which comes at a time that OPEC and Russia lead production cuts aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. The deal to withhold output started in January last year and is currently set to last through 2018.\nStephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore said a \"beaming economic forecast along with stout compliance from OPEC (to withhold production) is providing convincing support.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)",
