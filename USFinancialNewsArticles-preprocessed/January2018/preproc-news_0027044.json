    "text": "Published: Jan 17, 2018 12:24 p.m. ET Share \nBesides streaming games, Verizon and the NBA will develop original programming to complement coverage Getty Images New York Knicks point guard Frank Ntilikina (left) drives past Patty Mills of the San Antonio Spurs \nBy Joe Flint \nVerizon Communications Inc. has struck a wide-ranging agreement with the National Basketball Association that extends the telecommunications giant’s relationship with the league beyond streaming games and into content creation as well as virtual and augmented-reality fan experiences. \nAs part of the deal, Verizon VZ, +0.15% will now be able to offer the NBA’s “League Pass” subscription package of more than 1,100 regular season games on all its platforms through its Yahoo Sports. Verizon’s price tag for the package is $99 a season, 50% less than what it costs to buy it through a traditional pay-TV distributor. Verizon also receives some ad inventory to sell. \nCurrently Verizon distributes “League Pass” only on its go90 platform. As part of the deal, Verizon will gain mobile carrier exclusivity, meaning that no other carrier will be able to offer League Pass subscriptions. Non-Verizon users who have League Pass subscriptions will be able to access through Yahoo Sports. \nThe deal includes tablet and computer rights as well as mobile rights to games. \nTerms of the new agreement were not disclosed but a person familiar with the situation said it is in the $400 million range, which is similar to the previous deal between the two. Verizon and Yahoo are also investing $25 million in a technology fund to develop new fan experiences for watching games. ",
