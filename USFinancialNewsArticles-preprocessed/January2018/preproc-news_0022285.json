    "text": "January 15, 2018 / 11:59 AM / Updated 28 minutes ago Rugby-Toulon owner defends Bastareaud after homophobic comment Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal said he feared the “mormon side” of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) after Mathieu Bastareaud was cited for making a homophobic comment during Sunday’s Champions Cup win over Benetton Treviso. \nFrance centre Bastareaud apologised on social media and was defended by Boudjellal. \n“At no point did Mathieu Bastareaud make a judgement on the sexual orientation of the player in question,” Boudjellal told rugbyrama.fr. \n“I am not homophobic but I have already called someone a faggot. It’s become customary, it’s the first thing that comes to mind in an altercation.” \nBoudjellal fears his player will be heavily punished. \n“I am worried. What I fear is the mormon side of EPCR with the Welsh and the Irish,” he said. (Reporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Ed Osmond)",
