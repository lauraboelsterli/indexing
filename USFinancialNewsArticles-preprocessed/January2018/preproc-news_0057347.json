    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 3:41 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago Supplies dwindling in Syria's Afrin city hospital after attacks - director Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Supplies are dwindling in the main hospital of Syria’s Afrin city, which has taken in 48 people killed and 86 wounded in recent Turkish attacks, its director said on Wednesday. \nAnkara launched an air and ground offensive nearly two weeks ago against the Afrin region, opening a new front in Syria’s multi-sided war to target Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. \n“We call on the United Nations to stop the Turkish aggression,” Khalil Sabri, head of the Afrin city hospital, said at a televised press conference. “The medical situation is getting worse in Afrin, and the medical supplies we have are about to run out,” he said. \nSince the onset of Syria’s conflict in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have set up three autonomous cantons in the north, including Afrin which borders Turkey.

REUTERS/Osman Orsal/File Photo \nSyrian rebel factions, which are fighting alongside Turkey in its offensive, control territory around Afrin. The Syrian army also holds a patch of land bordering the canton. \nAnkara views the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a three-decade insurgency on Turkish soil.

Related Coverage Russia says hundreds killed in Turkish operation in Syria's Afrin - Ifax \nThe SDF said Turkish forces and their rebel allies shelled a neighbourhood in Afrin city on Wednesday, wounding 12 civilians. \nTurkey’s state-run Anadolu agency said two rockets fired from the Afrin region hit the Turkish border town of Reyhanli and killed one person.
