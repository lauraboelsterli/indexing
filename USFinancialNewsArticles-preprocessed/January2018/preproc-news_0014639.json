But as a result of the sell-off, those bonds are now looking attractive, analysts said.\n“The broader picture is yields are still low but we still need to be excited a bit on this (upward) move in the last few weeks,” said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet.\nThe yield on the region’s benchmark, German 10-year debt, was flat at 0.43 percent on Tuesday, well above the mid-December level of 0.30 percent.\nThe Dutch equivalent was also flat at 0.52 percent but was about 16 bps higher than its December low, while Austria has seen its 10-year borrowing costs increase 18 bps over the past month to 0.57 percent.\nIn a continuation of a recent trend, Southern European debt outperformed, and the gap between Spanish and German bond yields was at its tightest since September.\nNormally, an improvement in economic conditions would cause investors to be cautious about buying government bonds as it makes an early end to the European Central Bank’s bond-buying scheme more likely.\nBut with inflation yet to show a sustained increase, investors would feel reasonably safe buying debt.\n“To me, the current Bund yield level makes sense given economic data looks rock solid. The only thing we’re all waiting for is signs of inflationary pressure,” said Van Vliet.\nInflation in the euro zone slowed as expected in December to 1.4 percent, well below the ECB’s target of just under 2 percent.\nThe Bank of Japan meanwhile trimmed its buying of long-dated Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in market operations, stoking speculation about a future exit from its massive stimulus policy.\nYields on 20-to-40 year JGBs hit one-month highs following the news.\n“The fear of this being a prelude to BoJ reduction in purchases is misplaced, but it did move the market this morning along with the strong Japanese wages data,” said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, additional reporting by Fanny Potkin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ",
