    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB), a leading provider of silicon, software and solutions for a smarter, more connected world, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017. Revenue in the fourth quarter ended at the high end of guidance at $201 million, up from $199 million in the third quarter, and establishing a new all-time record. Fourth quarter GAAP (loss) per share was $(0.11), which includes an approximate $(0.60) per share impact from U.S. corporate tax reform, resulting from a $26 million charge to the GAAP tax provision. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.93.\n\"We are very pleased to report outstanding fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial performance, including 10 percent year-on-year product revenue growth for Q4 and 11 percent for the year,\" said Tyson Tuttle, CEO of Silicon Labs. \"With the combined effort of our 1,300 employees and the support of our business partners and customers worldwide, we have transformed our business to address large, high-quality, sustainable and growing market trends in IoT, green energy and Internet infrastructure. Becoming a $1 billion company is within our sight.\"\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nIoT revenue established a record, increasing to $109 million, up 10% sequentially and 28% year-on-year.

Enabled Hager Group's building automation module solution based on Silicon Labs' EFR32 Wireless Gecko SoC. Announced new Si117x biosensors, which add electrocardiogram measurement and deliver high heart rate monitoring accuracy, while minimizing power consumption for all-day monitoring in health and fitness devices.\nBusiness Highlights\nAnnounced a definitive agreement to acquire Sigma Designs subject to certain closing conditions which, if not met, would revert to an asset sale of Sigma Designs' Z-Wave business. On January 23, 2018, Sigma Designs announced that the parties would revert to the asset sale of the Z-Wave business to Silicon Labs for $240 million, pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement and contingent upon approval by Sigma Designs' shareholders.
