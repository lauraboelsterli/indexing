FILE PHOTO - Pedestrians leave and enter the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall \nBritain's FTSE 100 .FTSE index closed up 0.3 percent at 7,696.50 after hitting a record of 7702.11 points after surveys showed Britain's dominant services sector rebounded strongly last month. \nThe data pushed sterling slightly higher, keeping pressure on earners of dollars. \nA rally in cyclical sectors such as financials and energy added about 22 points to the index, with BP ( BP.L ) and Shell ( RDSa.L ) rising 1.1 percent and one percent respectively. \nThe UK’s oil and gas index .FTNMX0530 was up one percent at its highest level since May 2008. \nThe British oil majors mirrored a move higher in oil prices, which were spurred to their highest since mid-2015 on the back of tensions in producer Iran. \nA supportive research note from Barclays also helped the energy sector, in which analysts said they expected European integrated oil and refining companies to be cash flow positive after dividends in the fourth quarter, thanks to a higher oil price. \nLikewise positive metals prices also drove shares in British miners. Shares in Glencore ( GLEN.L ), Anglo American ( AAL.L ) and BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) rose between 0.3 percent to 1.4 percent. \nThe mood was less positive among retail stocks, however, as shares in small cap Debenhams ( DEB.L ) closed down 17.7 percent after a profit warning following a difficult Christmas trading period. \nThis contrasted with Next’s ( NXT.L ) upbeat update on Christmas sales on Wednesday. \nShares in Debenhams posted their biggest one-day loss since March 2008, while blue chip Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ) was also down 3.6 percent at the bottom of the FTSE. \n“Ongoing structural challenges, a soft consumer environment, rising costs and increasing capex demands make for a difficult outlook (for Debenhams),” analysts at Liberum said in a note. \nThe real estate sector also suffered after data showed British house prices grew last year at their slowest since 2012 and fell in London for the first time in a full year since 2009. \nBritish Land Company ( BLND.L ) fell 3 percent and Hammerson ( HMSO.L ) 2.5 percent. \nFor a graphic on British oil majors, click - reut.rs/2CoopHy Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Janet Lawrence, William Maclean",
