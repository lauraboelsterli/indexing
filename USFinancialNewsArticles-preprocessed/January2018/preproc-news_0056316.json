The Notes will mature on February 1, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company’s option on or after February 1, 2020 upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable thereon for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to the date fixed for redemption. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per year, payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2018. The Notes are expected to be rated “A-” * by Egan-Jones Ratings Company. The Company has also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional $6.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes to cover overallotments, if any.\nThe offering is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close on February 2, 2018. The Notes are expected to be listed, and trade, on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “FDUSL” within 30 days from the original issue date.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under its existing credit facility with ING Capital LLC, an affiliate of an underwriter in this offering. However, the Company may re-borrow under its credit facility and use such borrowings to invest in lower middle-market companies in accordance with its investment objective and strategies and for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of January 29, 2018, the Company had $50.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility. The credit facility matures on June 16, 2019, and borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest on a per annum basis equal to (i) the alternate base rate plus 2.5% or (ii) the applicable LIBOR, which varies depending on the period of the borrowing under the credit facility, plus 3.5%. The alternate base rate is equal to the greater of (i) prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the three-month LIBOR plus 1.0%.\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company , is acting as sole bookrunner for the offering.
