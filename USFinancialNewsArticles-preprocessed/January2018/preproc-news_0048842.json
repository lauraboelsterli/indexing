    "text": "HOUSTON, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Luby's, Inc. (NYSE: LUB) (\"Luby's\") today announced unaudited financial results for its sixteen-week first quarter fiscal 2018, which ended on December 20, 2017. Comparisons in this earnings release for the first quarter fiscal 2018 are referred to as \"first quarter.\"\nFirst Quarter Key Metrics\n(comparisons to first quarter fiscal 2017)\nSame-store sales increased 0.8% Culinary Contract Services sales increased $3.2 million Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.1 million Three new Fuddruckers franchise locations opened (one international location in Mexico, and domestic locations in Florida and Pennsylvania) in the first quarter Capital expenditures decreased $0.7 million\nChris Pappas, President and CEO, commented, \"We are pleased to have generated positive same-store sales in the first quarter at both of our primary brands, Luby's Cafeteria and Fuddruckers, leading to a company-wide increase of 0.8% same-store sales.\n\"We are encouraged by the progress of the operational and guest initiatives that we began implementing last year to help improve guest services, store level profit and EBITDA while closely managing expenses. These efforts are contributing to same-store sales growth as well as improving cost controls. In the first quarter, we grew Adjusted EBITDA by over $1.0 million.\n\"Our team continues to focus on enhancing guest experiences across all of our brands, including through in-store operational efficiencies, menu variety and new offerings and speed of service.\n\"In Culinary Contract Services, revenue grew significantly in the first quarter and remains on track to show substantial growth in fiscal year 2018. We remain optimistic in our ability to strengthen our iconic brands, grow our Culinary Contract Services segment and continue to control costs company-wide.\"\nSame-Store Sales Year-Over-Year Comparison\nQ1\n2018 (3)\nQ1\n2017 (3)\nLuby's Cafeterias\n1.5%\n(2.2)%\nFuddruckers\n0.6%\n(1.6)%\nCombo locations (1)\n1.3%\n(2.3)%\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n(10.5)%\n(7.8)%\nTotal same-store sales (2)\n0.8%\n(2.3)%\n(1)\nCombo locations consist of a side-by-side Luby's Cafeteria and Fuddruckers Restaurant at one property location.\n(2)\nLuby's includes a restaurant's sales results into the same-store sales calculation in the quarter after that store has been open for six complete consecutive quarters. In the first quarter, there were 82 Luby's Cafeterias locations, 59 Fuddruckers locations, all six Combo locations, and all seven Cheeseburger in Paradise locations that met the definition of same-stores.\n(3)\nQ1 2018, Q1 2017 same-store sales reflect the change in restaurant sales for the locations included in the same-store grouping for each of the comparable periods.\nFirst Quarter Restaurant Sales:\n($ thousands)\nRestaurant Brand\nQ1\n2018\nQ1\n2017\nChange\n($)\nChange\n(%)\nLuby's Cafeterias\n$\n67,430\n$\n68,339\n$\n(909)\n(1.3)%\nFuddruckers\n26,914\n28,748\n(1,834)\n(6.4)%\nCombo locations\n6,712\n6,626\n86\n1.3%\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n3,527\n4,369\n(842)\n(19.3)%\nTotal Restaurant Sales\n$\n104,583\n$\n108,082\n$\n(3,499)\n(3.2)%\nLuby's Cafeterias sales decreased $0.9 million versus the first quarter fiscal 2017, due to the closure of four locations over the prior year partially offset by a 1.5% increase in Luby's same-store sales. The increase was the result of a 4.8% increase in average spend per guest partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in guest traffic. Fuddruckers sales at company-owned restaurants decreased $1.8 million versus the first quarter fiscal 2017, due to seven permanent restaurant closings and two temporary closures for post-Hurricane renovations partially offset by a 0.6% increase in same-store sales. The 0.6% increase in same-store sales was the result of a 4.5% increase in average spend per guest partially offset by a 3.9% decrease in guest traffic. Combo location sales increased $0.1 million, or 1.3%, versus first quarter fiscal 2017. Cheeseburger in Paradise sales decreased $0.8 million. The closure of one location reduced sales by $0.4 million and declines in sales at the remaining seven locations reduced sales by $0.4 million. Store level profit, defined as restaurant sales plus vending revenue less cost of food, payroll and related costs, other operating expenses, and occupancy costs, was $11.1 million, or 10.6% of restaurant sales, in the first quarter compared to $12.6 million, or 11.7% of restaurant sales, during the first quarter fiscal 2017. While higher menu pricing was sufficient to cover food commodity cost inflation and we achieved reductions in repairs and maintenance costs, store level profit margins were negatively impacted by certain expense items. The first quarter included approximately $0.3 million related to net uninsured losses and last year the first quarter fiscal 2017 benefited from an approximate $0.5 million decrease in workers' compensation expense. Store level profit margin was also negatively impacted, but to a lesser extent, from higher packaging and catering supplies related to an approximate 4.5% increase in holiday sales, and higher fees to third party delivery services associated with higher sales through this channel. Store level profit is a non-GAAP measure, and reconciliation to loss from continuing operations is presented after the financial statements. Culinary Contract Services revenues increased by $3.2 million to $7.5 million with 22 operating locations during the first quarter. New Culinary Contract Services locations and retail sales combined contributed approximately $4.3 million in revenue which was partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in revenue from locations that ceased operations and an approximate $0.3 million decrease in revenue at locations continually operated over the prior full year. Culinary Contract Services profit margin increased to 15.8% of Culinary Contract Services sales in the first quarter compared to 11.3% in the first quarter fiscal 2017. Franchise revenue increased $16 thousand, or 0.9%, in the first quarter compared to the first quarter fiscal 2017. In the first quarter, Franchisees opened three locations (one international location in Mexico, and domestic locations in Florida and Pennsylvania) and closed five locations (one international location in Italy and four domestic locations, one in each of Tennessee, North Carolina, South Dakota, and North Dakota) in the first quarter. Loss from continuing operations was $4.9 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $5.5 million, or a loss of $0.19 per diluted share, in the first quarter fiscal 2017. Excluding special non-cash items, loss from continuing operations was $3.7 million, or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter compared to a loss of $4.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter fiscal 2017. Loss from continuing operations, excluding special items, is a non-GAAP measure, and reconciliation to loss from continuing operations is presented below.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Expenditures\nWe ended the first quarter with a debt balance outstanding of $30.8 million (net of deferred financing costs of $0.3 million), up slightly from $30.7 million (net of deferred financing costs of $0.3 million) at the end of fiscal 2017. During the first quarter, our capital expenditures decreased to $4.3 million compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter fiscal 2017. At the end of the first quarter, we had $0.8 million in cash and $140.0 million in total shareholders' equity.\nRestaurant Counts:\nAugust 30,\n2017\nFY18 Q1\nOpenings\nFY18 Q1\nClosings\nDecember 20,\n2017\nLuby's Cafeterias (1)\n88\n—\n—\n88\nFuddruckers Restaurants (1)\n71\n—\n(3)\n68\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n8\n—\n(1)\n7\nTotal\n167\n—\n(4)\n163\n(1)\nIncludes 6 restaurants that are part of Combo locations\nConference Call\nLuby's will host a conference call on January 29, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss further its first quarter fiscal 2018 results.

The non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of income (loss) from continuing operations, before special items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.\nReconciliation of loss from continuing operations to loss from continuing operations, before special items (1,2) :\nQ1 FY2018\nQ1 FY2017\nItem\nAmount\n($000s)\nPer Share\n($)\nAmount\n($000s)\nPer Share\n($)\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(4,867)\n$\n(0.17)\n$\n(5,514)\n$\n(0.19)\nProvision for asset impairments\n558\n0.02\n189\n0.01\nNet loss (gain) on disposition of property and equipment\n147\n0.00\n56\n0.00\nFair value adjustment to performance awards liability\n(114)\n(0.00)\n60\n0.00\nLoss from closed stores (3)\n403\n0.01\n390\n0.01\nNet uninsured storm-related losses\n219\n0.01\n-\n0.00\nLoss from continuing operations, before special items\n$\n(3,654)\n$\n(0.13)\n$\n(4,819)\n$\n(0.17)\n(1)\nWe use income (loss) from continuing operations, before special items, in analyzing results, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Luby's has reconciled loss from continuing operations, before special items, to loss from continuing operations, the nearest GAAP measure in context.\n(2)\nPer share amounts are per diluted share after tax (adjustments assume an effective 34% tax rate)\n(3)\nLosses from closed store include store level profit (loss) less depreciation for stores that closed in fiscal 2017 (9 restaurants) and subsequent to fiscal 2017 year-end through January 29, 2018 (7 restaurants, 2 of which are temporarily closed for renovations).\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and excluding net gain (loss) on disposing of property and equipment, provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings, non-cash compensation expense, franchise taxes, and decrease / (increase) in fair value of derivatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors in valuing the Company and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our results to other competitors. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as computed by other companies. These measures should be considered supplemental and not a substitute or superior to other GAAP performance measures.\n($ thousands)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 20,\n2017\nDecember 21,\n2016\n(16 weeks)\n(16 weeks)\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(4,867)\n$\n(5,514)\nDepreciation and amortization\n5,353\n6,550\nBenefit for income taxes\n(9)\n(1,458)\nInterest expense\n649\n602\nInterest income\n(6)\n(1)\nNet loss on disposition of property and equipment\n222\n85\nProvision for asset impairments and restaurant closings\n845\n287\nNon-cash compensation expense\n558\n769\nFranchise Taxes\n59\n55\nDecrease (Increase) in Fair Value of Derivative\n(173)\n91\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,631\n$\n1,466\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lubys-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2018-results-300589264.html\nSOURCE Luby's, Inc.",
