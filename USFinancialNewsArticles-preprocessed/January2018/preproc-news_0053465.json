Cegedim expects the deal to be finalized in the first quarter of 2018, subject to approval by competition authorities (see press release dated December 14, 2017*). Consolidated 2017 revenues are presented according to IFRS 5, meaning both Cegelease and Eurofarmat are excluded from continuing activities.\nAll of the operating divisions contributed positively to the Group's year-on-year organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and over the full year 2017.\nRevenue trends by division\nFourth quarter 2017\nFourth quarter In € million 2017 2016 Chg.

Excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 0.4% and a 1.5% boost from acquisitions, revenues rose 5.2%.\nThe unfavorable currency translation effect of €0.5 million, or 0.4%, was chiefly due to the €0.3 million negative impact of the US dollar, which represents 2.8% of Group revenues, and the €0.1 million negative impact of the pound sterling, which represents 10.6% of revenues.\nThe €1.8 million positive impact from acquisitions, or 1.5%, was due to the acquisition of Futuramedia in France in November 2016.\nIn like-for-like terms, Health insurance, HR and e-services division revenues rose by 5.2%, and Healthcare professionals division revenues rose by 5.4%.\nFull year 2017\nFull year In € million 2017 2016 Chg.

Excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 0.9% and a 1.6% boost from acquisitions, revenues rose 5.9%.\nThe unfavorable currency translation effect of €4.1 million, or 0.9%, was chiefly due to the €3.7 million negative impact of the pound sterling, which represented 10.9% of revenues.\nThe €7.0 million positive impact from acquisitions, or 1.6%, was due to the acquisition of Futuramedia in France in November 2016.\nBoth of the divisions grew their like-for-like revenues.

There was no currency impact and no acquisitions or divestments.\nWithout applying IFRS 5, Group revenues would amount to €470.0 million, up 6.6% on a reported basis and 5.9% like for like compared with FY 2016.\nHighlights\nApart from the items cited below, to the best of the company's knowledge, there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group's financial situation.\nChanges to Cegedim SA's Board of Directors\nIn keeping with the wishes of Bpifrance, in March 2017 Ms. Anne-Sophie Hérelle was appointed to replace Ms. Valérie Raoul-Desprez on the Board of Directors. The permanent representative of Bpifrance is now Ms. Marie Artaud-Dewitte, Deputy Head of Legal Affairs at Bpifrance Investissements. She replaces Ms. Anne-Sophie Hérelle.\nNon-recourse factoring agreement\nOn May 22, 2017, the Group signed a factoring agreement with a French bank. The non-recourse agreement covers total receivables of €38.0 million. The agreement is for an open-ended time period.\nThe amount of trade receivables sold under the agreement came to €18.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nPartial interest rate hedging\nCegedim carried out two zero-premium swap agreements in the first half of 2017 under which it receives the 1-month Euribor rate if it exceeds 0%, receives nothing otherwise, and pays:\nA fixed rate of 0.2680% on a notional amount of €50 million starting February 28, 2017, and maturing on February 26, 2021. A fixed rate of 0.2750% on a notional amount of €30 million starting May 31, 2017, and maturing on December 31, 2020. GIE Isiaklé\nAs part of the BPO contract Cegedim signed with the Klesia group in September 2016, the two companies created an economic interest group (GIE), held 50/50. In January 2017, Cegedim lent Isiaklé €9 million for a period of 10 years at an interest rate of 1m Euribor plus a margin of 1.1%. The GIE is accounted for in Cegedim's consolidated accounts using the equity method.\nB.B.M. Systems and Adaptive Apps acquisitions in the UK\nOn February 23, 2017, Cegedim acquired UK company B.B.M. Systems through its Alliadis Europe Ltd subsidiary. B.B.M. Systems had 2016 revenues of around €0.7 million and earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group's scope of consolidation on March 1, 2017.\nOn May 3, 2017, Cegedim acquired UK company Adaptive Apps through its In Practice Systems Ltd subsidiary. Adaptive Apps had 2016 revenues of around €1.5 million and earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group's scope of consolidation in May 2017.\nLitigation\nOn February 10, 2017, Cegedim was ordered to pay €4,636,000 to the Tessi company for failing to meet certain obligations with respect to an asset sale made on July 2, 2007. The sum was paid on July 21, 2017. Cegedim has appealed the ruling.\nCegedim, jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health), is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has filed a motion claiming that IQVIA should be the sole defendant. After consulting with its external legal counsel, the Group has decided not to record any provisions.\nOn October 20, 2017, the court of Nîmes ordered Alliadis to pay a fine of €2 million as part of a case involving a pharmacist from Remoulins. A subsequent hearing on November 24 set the fine at €187,500. Cegedim has asked for the case to be dismissed and is appealing the ruling.\nDivestment of Cegelease and Eurofarmat\nThe terms of the deal are detailed in the press release dated December 14, 2017 http://www.cegedim.com/communique/Cegedim_Cegelease_signature_14122017_ENG.pdf .\nSignificant post-closing transactions and events\nTo the best of the company's knowledge, there were no events or changes after the accounts were closed that would materially alter the Group's financial situation.\nOutlook\nBased on its performance in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Group is revising significantly upwards its outlook for EBITDA from continuing activities in FY 2017. The Group now expects 2017 EBITDA from continuing activities to exceed €72 million.\nCegedim will discuss its outlook for 2018 when it announces its 2017 results on March 20, 2018, after the market close.\nThe Group does not communicate earnings estimates or forecasts.\nThe figures cited above include guidance on Cegedim's future financial performances. This forward-looking information is based on the opinions and assumptions of the Group's senior management at the time this press release is issued and naturally entails risks and uncertainty. For more information on the risks facing Cegedim, please refer to points 2.4, \"Risk factors and insurance\", and 3.7, \"Outlook\", of the 2016 Registration Document filed with the AMF on March 29, 2017, under number D.17-0255.\nPotential impact of Brexit\nIn 2017, the UK accounted for 10.9% of consolidated Group revenues from continuing activities. It represented 14.8% of consolidated Group EBIT before special items in 2016.\nCegedim deals in local currency in the UK, as it does in every country where it is present. Thus, Brexit is unlikely to have a material impact on consolidated Group EBIT before special items.\nWith regard to healthcare policy, the Group has not identified any major European programs at work in the UK and expects UK policy to be only marginally affected by Brexit.\nAdditional information\nRevenue figures for FY 2017 have not yet been audited by the Statutory Auditors.\nMarch 20, 2018, after the market close\nMarch 21, 2018, at 11:00 am CET\nApril 26, 2018, after the market close\nJune 19, 2018, at 9:30 am CET\nFY 2017 results\nAnalyst meeting (SFAF) in Cegedim's auditorium\nFirst-quarter 2018 revenues\nCegedim shareholders' meeting\nFinancial calendar, H1 2018\nJanuary 29, 2018, at 6:15pm (Paris time) The Group will hold a conference call hosted by Jan Eryk Umiastowski, Cegedim Chief Investment Officer and Head of Investor Relations.\nThe webcast is available at the following address: www.cegedim.fr/webcast\nThe presentation on FY 2017 revenues is available:\nThe website: http://www.cegedim.fr/finance/documentation/Pages/presentations.aspx\nThe Group's financial communications app, Cegedim IR.

The deal is expected to take effect following the release of this document, in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, the consolidated 2017 financial statements are presented according to IFRS 5, \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued\". IFRS 5 governs the accounting treatment for non-current assets held for sale.\nIn practice, their contribution to each line of Cegedim's consolidated income statement (before minority interests) is combined into the \"Net profit from activities sold or held for sale\" line, and the group share of their net profit is excluded from Cegedim's adjusted net profit. Earlier periods have also been restated so that the information presented is comparable.\nThe table below shows the impact of the restatement:\nin € thousands 2017 2016 Change Revenue from continuing activities 457,441 429,251 +6.6% Revenue from assets held for sale 13,001 12,537 +3.7% IFRS 5 restatement -490 -942 - Group revenues 469,952 440,846 +6.6%\nBPO (Business Process Outsourcing): BPO is the contracting of non-core business activities and functions to a third-party provider. Cegedim provides BPO services for human resources, Revenue Cycle Management in the US and management services for insurance companies, provident institutions and mutual insurers.\nBusiness model transformation: Cegedim decided in fall 2015 to switch all of its offerings over to SaaS format, to develop a complete BPO offering, and to materially increase its R&D efforts. This is reflected in the Group's revamped business model. The change has altered the Group's revenue recognition and negatively affected short-term profitability\nCorporate and others: This division encompasses the activities the Group performs as the parent company of a listed entity, as well as the support it provides to the three operating divisions.\nEPS: Earnings Per Share is a specific financial indicator defined by the Group as the net profit (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average of the number of shares in circulation.\nOperating expenses: Operating expenses is defined as purchases used, external expenses and payroll costs.\nRevenue at constant exchange rate: When changes in revenue at constant exchange rate are referred to, it means that the impact of exchange rate fluctuations has been excluded. The term \"at constant exchange rate\" covers the fluctuation resulting from applying the exchange rates for the preceding period to the current fiscal year, all other factors remaining equal.\nRevenue on a like-for-like basis: The effect of changes in scope is corrected by restating the sales for the previous period as follows:\nby removing the portion of sales originating in the entity or the rights acquired for a period identical to the period during which they were held to the current period; similarly, when an entity is transferred, the sales for the portion in question in the previous period are eliminated. Life-for-like data (L-f-l): At constant scope and exchange rates.\nInternal growth: Internal growth covers growth resulting from the development of an existing contract, particularly due to an increase in rates and/or the volumes distributed or processed, new contracts, acquisitions of assets allocated to a contract or a specific project. External growth: External growth covers acquisitions during the current fiscal year, as well as those which have had a partial impact on the previous fiscal year, net of sales of entities and/or assets.\nEBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. EBIT corresponds to net revenue minus operating expenses (such as salaries, social charges, materials, energy, research, services, external services, advertising, etc.). It is the operating income for the Cegedim Group.\nEBIT before special items: This is EBIT restated to take account of non-current items, such as losses on tangible and intangible assets, restructuring, etc. It corresponds to the operating income from recurring operations for the Cegedim Group.\nEBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is the term used when amortization or depreciation and revaluations are not taken into account. \"D\" stands for depreciation of tangible assets (such as buildings, machines or vehicles), while \"A\" stands for amortization of intangible assets (such as patents, licenses and goodwill). EBITDA is restated to take account of non-current items, such as losses on tangible and intangible assets, restructuring, etc. It corresponds to the gross operating earnings from recurring operations for the Cegedim Group.\nAdjusted EBITDA : Consolidated EBITDA adjusted, for 2016, for the €4.0m of negative impact from impairment of receivables in the Healthcare Professional division\nNet Financial Debt: This represents the Company's net debt (non-current and current financial debt, bank loans, debt restated at amortized cost and interest on loans) net of cash and cash equivalents and excluding revaluation of debt derivatives.\nFree cash flow: Free cash flow is cash generated, net of the cash part of the following items: (i) changes in working capital requirements, (ii) transactions on equity (changes in capital, dividends paid and received), (iii) capital expenditure net of transfers, (iv) net financial interest paid and (v) taxes paid.\nEBIT margin: EBIT margin is defined as the ratio of EBIT/revenue.\nEBIT margin before special items: EBIT margin before special items is defined as the ratio of EBIT before special items/revenue.\nNet cash: Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalent minus overdraft.\nGlossary\nAbout Cegedim:\nFounded in 1969, Cegedim is an innovative technology and services company in the field of digital data flow management for healthcare ecosystems and B2B, and a business software publisher for healthcare and insurance professionals.
