The appointment of our new industry-disrupting Directors will enhance our unconventional approach to finance, and we see them as a driving force supporting Happy Money’s innovation at the intersection of psychology and money to help people live happier lives.”\nAnjali Kumar currently serves as Chief People Officer and General Counsel for Cheddar, the financial news network live-streamed from the New York Stock Exchange. Kumar was formerly the Head of Social Innovation and Founding General Counsel at Warby Parker and prior to that served as Senior Counsel at Google. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of GloScience Professional, Amplifier, Edible Schoolyard NY and GrowNYC, and has been an advisor to the Malala Fund, IDEO.org and Organize.org . Kumar is currently an Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School and will release her first book, Stalking God: My Unorthodox Search for Something To Believe In, on January 16, 2018.\nRosie O'Neill is the Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Sugarfina, a luxury candy boutique featuring a collection of artisan sweets from around the globe. Named to Fast Company’s “100 Most Creative People” list and Goldman Sachs \"100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs,\" O’Neill and her team are disrupting the $200B confections space with an innovative approach to product and retail. Prior to Sugarfina, O’Neill served for seven years as Director of Marketing for Barbie at Mattel where she led a $600M global business unit that sold more than 50 million Barbie dolls annually.\nDonna Wells is a successful serial entrepreneur, an experienced Public and Private Board Director and an innovator in the financial services, FinTech and cloud software industries. Most recently, she served as the President, CEO and Board Director of Mindflash.com , a leading platform for online training. Prior to Mindflash, Wells had a nearly 20-year career in the financial services industry including serving as the CMO of Mint.com from product launch to company acquisition, as well as senior marketing roles at both American Express and Intuit. Wells’ teams’ work has won multiple Webbys and recognition as a Tech Pioneer by the World Economic Forum in Davos. She has been named a Top 25 Women in Tech to Watch by Accenture and a Marketing Executive of the Year Finalist by the Wall Street Journal. Wells currently serves on the Board of Directors of Boston Private Bank and the Board of Advisors of Mitek Systems.\nIn addition to Kumar, O’Neill and Wells, Happy Money’s existing board members include Bob Allison, founder of Innovate Partners; Joe Saunders, former CEO of Visa; Matt Wilson, former CFO of Happy Money; and Sean Park, founder of Anthemis Group.\nAbout Happy Money\nHappy Money is the only financial company that combines psychology and money to help people live happier lives.
