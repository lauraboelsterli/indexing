    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 6:41 PM / Updated an hour ago Jordan says Israel apologises for killing of two Jordanians in embassy incident- gov't spokesman Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAMMAN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday that Israel has formally apologized for the deaths of two of its citizens killed by an Israeli security guard last July in an incident that has soured ties and led to the closure of the Israeli embassy in Amman, state media said. \nGovernment spokesman Mohammad al Momani was quoted by state news agency Petra as saying the Israeli Foreign Ministry had sent a memorandum in which it sent its “deep regrets and apologies” and said Israel pledged to take legal steps in the case. \nJordan had said it will not allow Israel to reopen its embassy in Amman until it has launched legal proceedings against the Israeli security guard.
