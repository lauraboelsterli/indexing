    "text": "DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar’s central bank will consider the topic of virtual currencies and there may be an opportunity in the future to introduce them in Qatar, central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani said on Tuesday.\nSheikh Abdullah made the remark as he delivered a speech on Qatar’s plans to build a hub for financial technology.\nAsked about his stance towards bitcoin, Sheikh Abdullah said the central bank would not focus on a single virtual currency, but would look at how to set best practice for such currencies.\nThe governor also said the central bank is developing a strategy to create a fintech hub for start-ups.\nSheikh Abdullah said that the growth of fintech could force banks to change their business models.\nAlready facing competition, disruption from fintech could mean increased challenges for Qatar’s retail banking sector, he said.\nReporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh; writing by Andrew Torchia; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
