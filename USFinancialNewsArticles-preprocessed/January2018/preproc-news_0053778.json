(NYSE: EV), today announced an agreement to hire a five-person global fixed-income team led by Astrid Vogler that was formerly employed by Oechsle International Advisors, LLC (Oechsle), a privately held investment manager.

The group's strategy focuses on fundamental country analysis, rigorous security selection, portfolio construction and trade implementation, and a disciplined approach to risk management.\nPrior to joining Eaton Vance, Ms. Vogler was a Principal and Head of Fixed Income at Oechsle for 27 years.
