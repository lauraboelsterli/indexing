    "text": "BOSTON, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Eaton Vance Management (International) Limited (EVMI), a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE: EV), today announced an agreement to hire a five-person global fixed-income team led by Astrid Vogler that was formerly employed by Oechsle International Advisors, LLC (Oechsle), a privately held investment manager. The team joins Eaton Vance Management's Global Income group, which is co-led by Michael Cirami, CFA, and Eric Stein, CFA. Ms. Vogler joins as vice president and lead portfolio manager of EVMI, reporting to Messrs. Cirami and Stein. Roman Kostal joins as vice president and portfolio manager, reporting to Ms. Vogler. The team currently advises approximately $830 million and will continue to be based in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\"The hiring of the former Oechsle fixed-income team in Frankfurt is a meaningful extension of our global fixed-income investment management and client service capabilities,\" said Payson F.

The group's strategy focuses on fundamental country analysis, rigorous security selection, portfolio construction and trade implementation, and a disciplined approach to risk management.\nPrior to joining Eaton Vance, Ms. Vogler was a Principal and Head of Fixed Income at Oechsle for 27 years.
