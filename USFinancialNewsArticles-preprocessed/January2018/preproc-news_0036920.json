Its shares rose almost 3 percent in after-hours trading. \nIn the fourth quarter, United reported a 0.2 percent increase in passenger unit revenue, in line with the carrier’s earlier guidance. \nThe Chicago-based airline’s results follow a strong fourth-quarter performance and quarterly outlook by rival Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), which reported better-than-expected profit earlier this month.
