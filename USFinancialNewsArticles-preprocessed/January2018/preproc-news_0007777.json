    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s central bank said it will skip open market operations for the 11th straight trading day on Monday as liquidity levels in the banking system were “relatively high”.\nOn a net basis, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will drain 40 billion yuan ($6.17 billion) from the money market for the day, equal to the amount of reverse repos due to mature on Monday.\nThe PBOC drained a net 510 billion yuan from the money market last week.\nChina’s central bank drained 65 billion yuan on a net basis from money markets in 2017.\nReporting by the Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
