Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visits the Rolls Royce plant at Inchinnan, Scotland, Britain, December 11, 2017. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne \n“By roundabout the autumn of this year we should have some clarity about that future relationship,” Sturgeon told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “That’s when I will be able to look at that and make a judgment on what I think the next appropriate steps are for Scotland.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper, editing by Louise Heavens",
