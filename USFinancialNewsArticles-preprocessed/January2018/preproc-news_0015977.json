    "text": "GENEVA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - South Korea has asked the World Trade Organization for authorisation to impose annual trade sanctions worth at least $711 million on the United States, a filing published by the World Trade Organization showed on Friday.\nSouth Korea said the United States had failed to comply with a WTO ruling over U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on South Korean washing machines, and therefore it wanted to impose penalties on U.S. trade to get compensation.
