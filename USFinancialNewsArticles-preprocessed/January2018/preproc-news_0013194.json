REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/Files “That contingent that remains, the military infrastructure that remains, at the Hmeimim and Tartus military bases, they are completely capable of fighting these occasional terrorist acts,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said on Monday that militants had attacked its bases overnight on Jan. 6 using thirteen armed drones.\nReporting by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ",
