Several other papers reported that Air France was interested in buying Alitalia but had made no offer yet.\nSome of Lufthansa’s executives want to drop their bid for the Italian airline, or at least put it off until after a March 4 election, Il Messaggero reported on Saturday, without citing sources.\n(*) ATLANTIA The Italian motorway operator is in talks with India’s IRB Infrastructure Developers to acquire road assets in a $2 billion deal, the Economic Times reported.\n(*) FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES U.S. tax cuts could add about $1 billion a year to the car maker’s profits, CEO Sergio Marchionne told Bloomberg News in an interview, adding FCA could double profits by 2022 thanks to Jeep conquering one fifth of the SUV market.\nHe ruled out staying on as FCA’s CEO after early 2019 and reiterated his successor would be internal, but added his job at Ferrari was not done yet. About FCA’s search for a partner, Marchionne said: “If nobody wants you, then celibacy may be the only option. ... I adjusted to the notion of celibacy.”\nTELECOM ITALIA The phone group has pushed back a deadline for binding bids for its broadcasting services unit Persidera to give potential suitors more time to prepare offers, sources close to the matter said.\n(*) In order to help settle a legal spat between Vivendi and Mediaset over a failed pay-TV deal, Telecom Italia is preparing to approve a new version of its contents accord with Vivendi’s Canal+, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Saturday.
