But conservative critics argued the FSOC applied the power in an inconsistent and opaque fashion.\nIn November, the Treasury Department recommended the FSOC shift away from singling out specific companies, and instead focus on broader risks facing the financial system.\nAfter a handful of non-bank financial companies were designed as \"systemically important financial institutions\" meriting stricter rules under Obama, MetLife mounted a legal fight against the regulatory decision. The insurance company originally won a case at a U.S. district court, but the Obama administration appealed the ruling in 2016.\nThursday's agreement ensures MetLife will not face those stricter rules. The FSOC voted in September to remove a similar designation for American International Group Inc, and GE Capital was able to escape the label in 2016 after overhauling its business.\nPrudential Financial Inc now is the only non-bank SIFI still under stricter government oversight. That company is expected to argue for similar regulatory relief from the regulators in the months ahead. (Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker)",
