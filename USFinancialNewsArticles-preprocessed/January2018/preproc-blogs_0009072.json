The department store chain joined other retailers in raising its fiscal 2017 earnings and sales forecast. Getty Images Nordstrom Rack in downtown Seattle \nNordstrom on Tuesday joined a growing list of retailers reporting a strong holiday season, boosted by greater consumer confidence, lower unemployment and increased wages. \nThe department store chain said its net sales climbed 2.5 percent, while same-store sales rose 1.2 percent for the nine weeks ended Dec. 30, 2017, when compared with the same period a year ago. \nSame-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price Rack division, which has stumbled in recent months , climbed 2.9 percent, while net sales at Rack stores were up 8.2 percent during the November-December months, the company said. \nThe retailer's shares edged down slightly in after-hours trading Tuesday following the report. \nNordstrom said its e-commerce division also continued to grow, though it didn't break out revenue for that segment. \nBased on its strong holiday results, Nordstrom updated its fiscal 2017 outlook and is now calling for net sales to increase 4.2 percent, and for comparable sales to climb about 0.5 percent overall. \nNordstrom expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to fall within a range of $2.90 to $2.95, compared with a prior range of $2.85 to $2.95. The company said these adjustments don't yet incorporate any impact from the new U.S. tax laws. \nNordstrom is set to report fourth-quarter and full-year results on March 1.
