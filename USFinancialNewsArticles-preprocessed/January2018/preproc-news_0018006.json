Alexander’s”) today provided an update on the full year 2017 results of Ninety Nine Restaurant & Pub (“99 Restaurants”), in connection with J. Alexander’s previously announced acquisition of 99 Restaurants.\n“These results are in-line with projections included in our proxy materials and underscore our deep conviction in pursuing the acquisition of 99 Restaurants,” said Lonnie J.

We look forward to completing this accretive merger and capitalizing on the significant opportunities it provides to drive long-term, sustainable value for J. Alexander’s shareholders.”\nCannae Holdings, Inc.
