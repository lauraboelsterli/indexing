    "text": "GILROY, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pinnacle Bank (OTCQB: PBNK), headquartered in Gilroy, California, announced today unaudited net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $2,957,000, an increase of 20% over the same period in 2016 net income of $2,461,000, despite a $518,000 revaluation of deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter due to the recently passed tax reform legislation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $342.5 million, a 16% increase from the $295.6 million at December 31, 2016.\nLoans were $273.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $31.7 million (13%) from the December 31, 2016 balance of $241.4 million. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 was $3.8 million or 1.40% of loans compared to $3.2 million or 1.32% of loans at December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest bearing deposits at December 31, 2017, increased 30% to $159.8 million from $122.7 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits at December 31, 2017, were $304.6 million compared to $263.4 million at December 31, 2016, a 16% increase.\nCredit quality remained strong with nonperforming assets totaling $284,000 (0.08% of assets) at December 31, 2017 compared to $83,000 (0.03% of assets) a year earlier.\n\"The vibrant economy in our markets was the foundation for Pinnacle Bank's outstanding year in 2017. Our loans and deposits grew 13% and 16%, respectively over 2016 reflecting the success of our relationship banking approach in attracting and retaining clients. These client relationships helped drive our net interest income to a new high. Our experienced relationship managers and specialized lenders capitalized on the economy to originate a record amount of SBA 7(a) loans in 2017 that made us a top SBA lender in California and fueled the large increase in gains on the sale of SBA 7(a) loan guarantees. Our credit quality remained solid as loans grew and competition increased during the year,\" stated Jeffrey Payne, President and CEO. \"We appreciate the continued efforts and contributions of our outstanding bankers, our committed directors and advisors and our many loyal clients.\"\nThe Bank's capital position remains above regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had a total capital ratio of 11.99%. Book value per share at December 31, 2017 was $8.65. Net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.59%.\nPinnacle Bank is rated by Bauer Financial as Five-Star \"Superior\" for strong financial performance, the top rating given by the independent bank rating firm.
