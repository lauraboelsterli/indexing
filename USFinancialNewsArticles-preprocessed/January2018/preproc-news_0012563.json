FILE PHOTO - A show attendee passes by the LG Electronics booth during the 2009 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 9, 2009. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo \nLG, in a regulatory filing, estimated its October-December profit to be 367 billion won ($343.60 million) versus a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of 485 billion won from a poll of 14 analysts, and compared to a 35.2 billion won operating loss in the same quarter in 2016. \nRevenue likely rose 14.8 percent to 17 trillion won, compared to the 16.3 trillion won SmartEstimate. \nThe firm did not disclose further details of October-December operations, and will disclose full results at the end of January.
