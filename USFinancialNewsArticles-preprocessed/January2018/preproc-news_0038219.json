    "text": "FORT COLLINS, Colo., Jan. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) today reported financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending December 31, 2017. (All per share amounts are presented on a fully diluted basis.)\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Overview\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $470 million, compared to $443 million for the first quarter of last year, an increase of 6 percent from the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $18 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to $47 million, or $0.73 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 51.3 percent, compared to 1.1 percent in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter of the current year reflects a one-time expense of approximately $15 million, or $0.24 per share, as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation.\nTotal EBIT 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $44 million, compared to $53 million in the first quarter of the prior year.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $3 million, compared to cash generated of $52 million for the prior year. Free cash flow 1 was an outflow of $31 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to an inflow of $31 million for the same period of the prior year.\n“Our first quarter revenues reflected strong momentum in Aerospace, and ongoing challenges within our Industrial segment, although we continue to see growing pockets of strength in many of our industrial end markets. In line with our strategy to gain market share, we are investing in new programs which impacted our first quarter results,” said Thomas A. Gendron, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are encouraged by the recent U.S. tax legislation, which we anticipate will have a significant positive cash and earnings impact going forward. We expect to employ these benefits consistent with our existing capital allocation strategy.”\nCompany Results\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $470 million, compared to $443 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 51.3 percent, compared to 1.1 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 first quarter tax rate reflected additional tax expense of approximately $15 million, or $0.24 per share, due to the recent U.S. tax legislation. The 2017 first quarter tax rate reflected the favorable impact of repatriating certain foreign earnings. Our full fiscal year 2018 tax rate is now anticipated to be approximately 24 percent. Beyond 2018, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 22 percent as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation.\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $18 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to $47 million, or $0.73 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. EBIT was $44 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $53 million for the first quarter of 2017. In addition to the tax impact on net earnings of the new legislation, net earnings and EBIT were unfavorably impacted in the first quarter of 2018 by increased investment in research and development, as well as the timing of stock compensation expense.\nSegment Results\nAerospace\nAerospace segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $306 million, compared to $267 million for the first quarter a year ago. Segment earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $44 million, compared to $47 million for the same quarter last year. Segment earnings as a percent of segment net sales were 14.2 percent this quarter, compared to 17.6 percent in the same quarter of the prior year.\nCommercial aerospace sales benefited from the accelerating deliveries of key next generation aircraft. Commercial aftermarket sales were particularly strong due to initial provisioning for these aircraft programs and increased utilization of existing fleets. Defense OEM sales were boosted by continued momentum in smart weapons, as well as growing international demand for various other programs. Segment earnings benefited from the net impact of the higher sales volume in the quarter, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs related to increased production levels. Segment earnings were also negatively impacted by increased investment in research and development for both new awards and opportunities being pursued.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial segment net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $164 million, compared to $176 million for the first quarter a year ago. Segment earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $19 million, compared to $18 million in the first quarter a year ago. Segment earnings as a percent of segment net sales were 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 10.2 percent in the same quarter of the prior year.\nSales were strong for fuel systems related to natural gas vehicles in Asia and large gas engines. This was more than offset by significant weakness in both large gas turbine and renewables sales. The increase in segment earnings was primarily due to savings from cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by the effects of the lower sales volume.\nNonsegment\nNonsegment expenses totaled $19 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $11 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in nonsegment expenses was due to the timing of the recording of the majority of stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2018, whereas in the prior year this expense was recorded in the second quarter.\nCash Flow and Financial Position\nNet cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3 million, compared to cash generated of $52 million for the prior year. This difference was largely a result of quarterly variability related to working capital. Free cash flow was an outflow of $31 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to an inflow of $31 million for the same period of the prior year. Payments for property, plant, and equipment for the first quarter of 2018 were $28 million, compared to $21 million for the first quarter of 2017. For the full year, we now anticipate free cash flow to be approximately $230 million, which reflects the positive impacts of the U.S. tax legislation changes, partially offset by higher working capital.\nTotal debt was $650 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $613 million at September 30, 2017. The ratio of debt-to-debt-plus-equity was 31.7 percent at December 31, 2017, compared to 30.9 percent at September 30, 2017.\nOutlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, net sales are still expected to be between $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Earnings per share are now expected to be between $3.35 and $3.60, reflecting the anticipated effects of the change in U.S. tax legislation.\nConference Call\nWoodward will hold an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST, January 22, 2018, to provide an overview of the financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, business highlights, and outlook for fiscal 2018.

Management uses EBIT to evaluate Woodward’s operating performance without the impacts of financing and tax related considerations. Management uses EBITDA in evaluating Woodward’s operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios. Management uses free cash flow, which is derived from net cash provided by or used in operating activities less payments for property, plant, and equipment, in reviewing the financial performance of Woodward’s various business segments and evaluating cash generation levels. Securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flow in their evaluation of companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The use of any of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because EBIT and EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Management’s calculations of EBIT, EBITDA, and free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n2 Website, Facebook, Twitter: Woodward has used, and intends to continue to use, its Investor Relations website, its Facebook page and its Twitter handle as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nCONTACT:\nDon Guzzardo\nCorporate Director, Investor Relations & Treasury\n970-498-3580\nDon.Guzzardo@woodward.com\nSource:Woodward, Inc.",
