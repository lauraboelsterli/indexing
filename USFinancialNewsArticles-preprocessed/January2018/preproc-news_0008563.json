    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. specialty metals makers Arconic Inc said on Monday it would freeze defined benefit pension plans for all 7,900 of its U.S.-based salaried and non-bargained hourly employees, effective April 1.\nArconic said it expects its pre-tax pension-related expense in 2018 to be about $50 million lower than a year earlier.\nThe company expects its liabilities to fall by about $140 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to the reduction of future benefits.\nArconic said it would also record a pre-tax charge of about $5 million in the first quarter.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza\n ",
