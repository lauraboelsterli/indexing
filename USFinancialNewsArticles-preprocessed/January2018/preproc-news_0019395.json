    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apartment Investment and Management Company (\"Aimco\") (NYSE: AIV and AIVPrA) announced today the 2017 dividend allocation for federal income tax purposes for its Class A Common Stock and its Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock.\nAimcoâ€™s tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017, has not yet been filed. As a result, the income tax allocation for the dividends discussed below has been calculated using the best available information as of the date of this release. A portion of the Class A Cumulative Preferred Stock Dividend payable on January 16, 2017 was attributable to taxable income and gains recognized in 2016.\nPlease note that federal tax laws affect taxpayers differently, and the information in this release is not intended as advice to shareholders as to how dividends should be reported on their tax returns. Also note that state and local taxation of real estate investment trust dividends varies and may not be the same as the taxation under federal rules. Aimco encourages shareholders to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to federal, state and local income tax effects of these dividends.\nClass A Common Stock (CUSIP 03748R-10-1)\nRecord\nDate\nPayable\nDate\nDividend\nper\nShare\nTaxable\nOrdinary\nDividends\nQualified\nDividends\n(20% Rate)\nCapital\nGain\n(20% Rate)\nUnrecaptured\nSec. 1250\nGain\n(25% Rate)\nReturn of\nCapital\n2/17/17 2/28/17 $ 0.36 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % 5/19/17 5/31/17 $ 0.36 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % 8/18/17 8/31/17 $ 0.36 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % 11/17/17 11/30/17 $ 0.36 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % Annual $ 1.44 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % Aimco Preferred Stock\nClass A Cumulative Preferred Stock (CUSIP 03748R-76-2)\nRecord\nDate\nPayable\nDate\nDividend\nper\nShare\nTaxable\nOrdinary\nDividends\nQualified\nDividends\n(20% Rate)\nCapital\nGain\n(20% Rate)\nUnrecaptured\nSec. 1250\nGain\n(25% Rate)\nReturn of\nCapital\n1/1/17 1/16/17 $ 0.4297 41.88653 % 5.73528 % 35.70252 % 16.67567 % 0. % 4/1/17 4/17/17 $ 0.4297 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % 7/1/17 7/17/17 $ 0.4297 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % 10/1/17 10/16/17 $ 0.4297 51.59114 % 1.58060 % 35.65819 % 11.17007 % 0. % Annual $ 1.7188 49.16499 % 2.61927 % 35.66927 % 12.54647 % 0. % Aimco is a real estate investment trust focused on the ownership and management of quality apartment communities located in select markets in the United States.
