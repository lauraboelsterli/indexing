    "text": "NEW YORK, January 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nQ BioMed Inc. (OTCQB: QBIO) (\"Q BioMed\" or the \"Company\"), a commercial stage biotechnology acceleration development company is pleased to announce pricing of a public offering of an aggregate of 1,711,875 shares of common stock of the Company, together with warrants to purchase up to 1,711,875 shares of common stock of the Company, at a public offering price of $3.20 per share and associated warrant. Each warrant will have an exercise price of $3.20 and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be approximately $5.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.\nRoth Capital Partners is acting as lead placement agent and CIM Securities is acting as co-lead placement agent for the offering.\nThe offering is expected to close on or about February 1, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Company anticipates that the proceeds from the offering will provide Q BioMed the required capital to execute on several significant milestones in the first half of 2018 and beyond. These catalysts include;\nThe commercialization of our licensed FDA approved drug, Strontium Chloride 89 (SR89), a non-opioid therapeutic drug for the treatment of skeletal pain associated with metastatic cancers. Initiating the planning and IND filing for a Phase 4 post-marketing study to expand the indication of the approved SR89, labeling it as chemotherapeutic (a cancer therapy) for skeletal metastases, significantly improving the revenue potential for the drug. The filing of an IND for a pivotal phase ll/lll clinical program to test the efficacy of QBM-001, a pro-drug for the treatment of young children with a rare autistic spectrum disorder that severely inhibits their ability to communicate. Continued R&D on the novel chemotherapeutic drug for liver cancer. Completion of optimization and pre-clinical testing of the first-in-class glaucoma drug Man-01 for the treatment of open angle glaucoma, a disease affecting more than 60,000,000 people around the world.\nDenis Corin, Q BioMed Inc. CEO said, \"2018 is a catalyst-rich year for us. We have several major milestones on the near horizon and this capital provides the means to get there. In addition, given that we settled all our convertible debt at the end last year, this cash will boost our shareholder equity, further progressing us towards an uplisting on a senior national exchange.\"\nQ Biomed is a commercial stage biomedical acceleration and development company.
