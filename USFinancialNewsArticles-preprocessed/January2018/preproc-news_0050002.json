U.S. energy companies added 12 oil rigs drilling for new production last week, taking the total to 759, General Electric Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday.\nU.S. production is already on par with top exporter and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million bpd in 2017.\nThere are also signs that Canadian oil production, already at 335,000 bpd, could start to rise as investment in its shale sector picks up. Canada's overall crude production currently stands at 4.2 million bpd.\nOil major Total said on Monday that production at its Fort Hill oil sands project has started and that output would reach 180,000 bpd over the next few months.\nJP Morgan said it expected prices to fall towards the end of the year as markets become \"flush with oil from shale and other unconventional oils\".\nSTRONG OVERALL MARKET\nGrowing North American output has been one of few factors holding back oil markets.\nCrude has been propped up by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. These have coincided with strong demand on the back of healthy economic growth.\nAs a result, oil prices have risen by 60 percent since mid-2017 as investors pour cash into crude futures in expectation of higher prices.\nOil has also been supported by a weakening dollar.\n\"Loose fiscal policy in the U.S., a recovery in growth in Europe and an acceleration in EM (emerging market) growth have all combined to push the dollar lower and oil prices higher,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.\nU.S. bank JP Morgan said it had increased its 2018 average price forecast by $10 per barrel to $70 per barrel for Brent and by $10.70 per barrel for WTI to $65.63.\n\"We expect Brent to touch close to $78 per barrel towards end of Q1 2018 or early Q2 2018,\" it added.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Joseph Radford)",
