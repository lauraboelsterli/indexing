    "text": "MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- No. 10 Kansas was headed for a fifth consecutive loss at the WVU Coliseum until Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk and Devonte’ Graham cued a second-half rally.\nTheir late shooting helped the Jayhawks rally from 16 points down for a stunning 71-66 comeback win at No. 6 West Virginia on Monday.\nMykhailiuk scored 17 and Graham had 16 - and the pair combined for 24 after halftime as Kansas (15-3, 5-1) ended a four-year skid in Morgantown.\nSagaba Konate finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks for the Mountaineers (15-3, 4-2), who blew a double-digit lead for the second straight game.\nWest Virginia led 33-17 with 5:41 left in the first half before taking a 41-28 cushion to the locker room.\nThat lead melted in the second half when the Mountaineers had 11 turnovers and made only 10 field goals. That was an upside-down night for “Press Virginia,” which forced only 13 turnovers and committed 16.\nEsa Ahmad scored 15 points and Jevon Carter added 14 points on 4-of-15 shooting.\nKansas 7-footer Udoka Azubuike had 10 points and nine rebounds before fouling out late, but his team finished on an 8-of-10 shooting streak. The Jayhawks closed the game on a 17-6 run over the final 5:41.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
