    "text": "CHICAGO, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RSM US LLP (\"RSM\"), the nation's leading provider of audit, tax and consulting services focused on the middle market, announced today that the leaders and staff of SecureState, a national security and privacy consulting firm located in Cleveland, Ohio, will be joining RSM. The firms have signed a definitive agreement for RSM to acquire substantially all the assets of SecureState, and the transaction is expected to close on March 1, 2018 subject to certain terms and conditions.\nThis transaction expands RSM's consulting practice and its growing presence in the Ohio market by adding more than 50 talented individuals to the team. It also enhances the firm's growing security and privacy practice through SecureState's deep knowledge and expertise in information security – from compliance and risk awareness to incidents and breaches, as well as its state-of-the-art incident response lab. Ken Stasiak, founder and CEO of SecureState, will join RSM as a consulting principal, and his full team will transition to RSM upon closing.\n\"Cybersecurity is cited by middle market business leaders as one of the foremost risks to their business,\" said Brian Becker, national consulting leader for RSM US LLP. \"We have been experiencing tremendous growth in our security and privacy services due to clients' needs in this area.

Both firms offer superior service to clients in the middle market.\n\"We are thrilled to be joining RSM,\" said Stasiak. \"Our expertise and service offerings represent a perfect fit for RSM's growing security and privacy practice. We are excited to join the foremost provider of consulting services to middle market leaders, and we look forward to continuing to serve our client base while at the same time helping RSM's many clients achieve stronger levels of security within their businesses.\"\n\"Consulting has been an area of rapid growth for RSM during the last several years,\" said Joe Adams, managing partner and CEO of RSM US LLP. \"I am constantly impressed by the team's ability to innovate and stay ahead of the changing needs of our clients. We are particularly pleased to expand our ability to provide security and privacy consulting solutions, and we look forward to the knowledge and expertise the SecureState team will bring to our firm. This is another important step toward strengthening our position as the first-choice advisor to middle market leaders—globally.\"\nThe team from SecureState will continue to be located in their existing offices at 23340 Miles Road in Cleveland, after completion of the transaction.\nAbout SecureState\nSince 2001, SecureState has been a leader in providing organizations with management consulting services focused in the Information Security field.
