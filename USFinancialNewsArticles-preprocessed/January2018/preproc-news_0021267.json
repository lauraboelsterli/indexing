    "text": "RUTHERFORD, Calif., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VITE has completed its purchase of the historic Sullivan Vineyards in Rutherford, California. The acquisition encompasses the 26-acre estate and includes the winery, the vineyards planted primarily to Cabernet Sauvignon, the Sullivan Vineyards brand, as well as the inventory of sought after, estate produced Napa Valley wines.\nJuan Pablo Torres-Padilla, CEO of VITE, states: \"My partners and I are honored to build upon what the Sullivan family has created over the last five decades. Their deep commitment to the vineyards and sophisticated winemaking presents us with tremendous opportunity. The estate, located in the renowned Rutherford appellation, is particularly amazing and our inspiration for the future.\"\nFuture plans focus on continuing to craft the finest quality wines from its Napa Valley estate and further elevating the hospitality and wine club experiences. The Sullivan Estate has been a top Napa Valley destination and remains open for guests by reservation only.\nRoss Sullivan, General Manager of Sullivan Vineyards, comments: \"It's very rewarding to see Juan Pablo's acknowledgement of what we've accomplished over the years and that his 'life project' is coming to fruition. After more than 5 years of searching for the right property, we're thrilled by their desire to build upon our legacy.\"\nJeff Cole, Sullivan winemaker, states: \"We are really proud of the wines we have crafted and with the performance of our extraordinary Rutherford estate vineyard. I am excited to work with Juan Pablo, who shares our commitment to the constant pursuit of excellence and continued investment in creating the finest Napa Valley wines.\"\nTo this point, Torres-Padilla adds, \"I've enjoyed having dirt under my nails. My deep passion and knowledge for wine come from my time spent in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne working in the cellar - cleaning tanks, doing punch downs, pump overs and sorting fruit. Working towards my certificate degree in Enology and Viticulture from U.C. Davis has also been instrumental in pursuing this life dream. I am excited to work with Jeff on the upcoming vintage, and perhaps set aside a couple barrels of Cabernet Sauvignon for us to create a new wine.\"\nSean Maher, Founder and Managing Director of Aspect Consumer Partners ( http://aspectconsumer.com/ ), acted as exclusive financial advisor to VITE in this transaction.\nAbout VITE\nA private investment group with long-term horizons led by Juan Pablo Torres-Padilla, VITE was created with the purpose of entering the fine wine industry in Napa Valley.
