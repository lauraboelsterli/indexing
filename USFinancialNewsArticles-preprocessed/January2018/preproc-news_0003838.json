REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva \nSharapova, who won 6-3 6-3, struck 24 winners and five aces to stay on course for a title clash with top-ranked Simona Halep after the Romanian dismissed Aryna Sabalenka 6-2 6-2. \n“I‘m glad that I ended up being the winner of the match,” Sharapova said in a courtside interview. \n“I didn’t play my best tennis and there’s certainly a lot of things to improve on in the next. The great thing is that I‘m through and have another chance to play tomorrow.” \nThe five-times grand slam champion committed 22 unforced errors in the match but stepped up her game at decisive moments of the contest to get past her spirited rival.

It’s my fourth Chinese city in a few months,” Sharapova added. \n“It’s obviously been a great welcome here. It took many years for me to play this event but I‘m really glad that I did.” \nSharapova plays Katerina Siniakova next after the defending champion beat fellow Czech Kristyna Pliskova 6-2 6-2. \nEarlier, fourth seed Irina-Camelia Begu had to work hard to overcome Timea Babos 7-5 7-5 to set up a semi-final meeting with her compatriot Halep.
