    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inphi Corporation (NYSE:IPHI), a leader in high-speed data movement interconnects, today announced that Ford Tamer, president and CEO will be presenting at the 20 th Annual Needham Growth Conference on Thursday, Jan. 18 at 11:20 a.m. Eastern time at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel. Due to the ongoing slowdown in the China Long Haul and Metro markets - including associated inventory absorption, Q1 is expected to continue to be challenging. However, despite near term challenges, we currently expect 2H of 2018 will show improvement because of new products and new design wins with new cloud customers.\nThe presentation will be available via webcast at its referenced start time. Please visit the following link to listen to the webcast: http://investors.inphi.com\nThe company has also separately announced today its Q4 2017 earnings release date will be on Feb. 7 th , 2018 after the market close.\nAbout Inphi\nInphi Corporation is a leader in high-speed data movement.
