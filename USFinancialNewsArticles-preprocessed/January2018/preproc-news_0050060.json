(Photo: Business Wire)\nGlobal microdissection market segmentation by end-user and geography\nTechnavio’s report on the global microdissection market analyses the business dimensions and presents a comprehensive breakdown in terms of market segmentation by end-user, including academic and research centers and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. As projected in 2017, around 40% of the market share originated from academic and research centers. Due to the increasing number of ongoing research studies on chronic diseases and increased funds allocated by government agencies to promote research in fields such as oncology, neurology, and proteomics, the academic and research centers segment is dominating the market with the highest market share.\nBased on end-user, the global microdissection market has been segmented into APAC, the Americas, and EMEA. As of 2017, the Americas dominated the market.\n“Though the Americas dominated the market in 2017, the market share is expected to decline as it is a highly penetrated market. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the total healthcare expenditure in the US has increased. The market in EMEA is developing due to new trends in the pharmaceutical companies and CROs,” says a senior analyst at Technavio for orthopedics and medical devices research.\nSave more with Technavio.
