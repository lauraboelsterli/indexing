It’s like, let’s just see what happens. If you’re in the draw, you give yourself a chance. \n“That’s what happened for me last year. All ended up way better than I thought it would. Having no expectations was so nice after all these years always having expectations.” \nDespite being a year older Federer has higher expectations this year and says his build-up has been ‘perfect’. \nHe won all his four singles matches as he and Belinda Bencic helped Switzerland lift the Hopman Cup in Perth. \n“It was a great preparation last year. I think it’s going to be helpful again for me this year because the court plays exactly the same in Perth and here in Melbourne,” he said. \nFederer is bidding to win successive Australian Opens for the first time since 2006-07.
