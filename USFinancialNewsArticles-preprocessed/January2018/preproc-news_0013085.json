    "text": "The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline jumped 3 cents nationally over the past three weeks to $2.54.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the increase is due to higher crude oil costs.\nThe current gas price is 16 cents above where it was a year ago.\nGas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.22 a gallon. The lowest was in Tucson, Arizona , at $2.10 a gallon.\nThe U.S. average diesel price is $2.94, up 6 cents from three weeks ago.",
