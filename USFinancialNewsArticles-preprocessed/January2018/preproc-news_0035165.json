    "text": " 42 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago Iranian planes warned off two \"coalition vessels\" during military drill - Tasnim news Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Iranian warplanes warned off two “coalition vessels” during military drill in waters off the country’s southeast, an Iranian general was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency on Monday. \n“This morning and in the early hours of the military drill, two coalition vessels approached the area to monitor Iranian naval forces. Iranian drones identified the vessels, then Iranian planes flew over them and gave them a warning. The vessels left the area,” said Rear Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi, the spokesperson for the drills.
