    "text": "Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said researchers at Google made Intel aware of a widespread security exploit \"a while back,\" and the company is working on fixes that could start next week. \nHe said he's \"relatively confident\" that a leaked security issue has not been exploited, and that the industry has been working together for a couple of months to address it. Krzanich spoke to CNBC's Jon Fortt on \" Closing Bell \" on Wednesday.\n\"We've found no instances of anybody actually executing this exploit,\" he said, noting the fixes will prevent future issues.\nThe chipmaker and enterprise technology company endured a rollercoaster day on the stock market . Shares closed more than 3 percent lower after the company said it was working to fix a security issue that also affected other chip companies.\nIndustry blog The Register reported this week that a patch for a serious security flaw in Intel chips could impact their performance. The exploit has since been linked to \"many different vendors' processors and operating systems,\" according to Intel. It could impact public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, but CNBC has not received comment from those companies.\n\"This is an example of the industry working well together to police itself,\" he said. \nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
