    "text": "Matt Dumba scored two goals while Mikael Granlund added a goal and an assist as the Minnesota Wild defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 on Saturday night in Minnesota.\nThe Jets were coming off a tough 2-1 loss in Chicago and were trying to improve to 4-0 versus Minnesota.\nHowever, the Wild came out strong early, thanks to a 23-shot first period where it took an early lead, and Winnipeg couldn’t come back.\nThe Wild held a 2-0 lead after two periods but the Jets cut the lead in half when Mathieu Perreault scored 47 seconds into the third with assists from Blake Wheeler and Dustin Byfuglien.\nFor Byfuglien, that was his 300th career assist.\nHowever, Dumba answered with goals at 6:23 and 13:32. Dumba took a slick between-the-legs pass from Marcus Foligno to score his first goal and added the second for some insurance later in the period.\nWild goalie Devan Dubnak earned the victory with 32 saves as Minnesota held a 41-33 edge in shots\nFoligno and Charlie Coyle each added two assists.\nMinnesota controlled play throughout much of the first two periods. The Wild had three power plays in that first period and four in the first two, finding a number of scoring chances.\nGranlund helped with each of the first two goals. He scored the initial goal by redirecting a Ryan Suter shot past goalie Connor Hellebuyck 8:47 into the game.\nGranlund got good position right in front of the goalie and tipped Suter’s shot from near the right point past Hellebuyck for the power-play goal.\nThe Wild took advantage of a fortunate bounce for its second goal. Granlund fired a puck toward the goal from the right side and it went wide. However, the puck bounced off the end boards and came right to Jason Zucker for the easy tap-in and a 2-0 lead 5:40 into the second period.\nThat was the first time Zucker has scored a goal with a goalie in the cage in 17 games, His only other score during that stretch came on an empty-netter.\n-- Field Level Media\n ",
