    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a post on Twitter on Friday that he was making progress with lawmakers to avoid a shutdown and advocated a four-week funding extension.\nAlthough Trump said he had an excellent preliminary meeting with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer earlier Friday, a senior White House official said differences still remained, and they had not yet reached an agreement between extending funding for four weeks compared to a five-day option that Schumer has touted.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Makini Brice; Editing by Eric Beech\n ",
