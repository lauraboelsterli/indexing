    "text": "HIGH POINT, N.C., Jan. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stanley Furniture Company, Inc. (Nasdaq:STLY) announced today that it expects to report net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $11.9 million and a fourth quarter net loss of approximately $6.7 million, which includes receipt of $433,000 in CDSOA proceeds. Most of the fourth quarter net loss was attributable to non-recurring charges including approximately $3.3 million in charges for obsolete and slow-moving inventory, approximately $1.7 million in charges relating to the departure of the company’s former chief executive offer and two directors during the quarter (including approximately $0.5 million of non-cash accrued expense pursuant to the terms of the former chief executive officer’s separation agreement and approximately $0.9 million in non-cash charges associated with the vesting of restricted stock held by the former chief executive officer and directors) and approximately $0.8 million of transaction expenses in connection with the proposed sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets.\nIn addition, the Company announced today that it has entered into an amendment to its previously announced agreement to sell substantially all of its assets to Churchill Downs LLC (“Buyer”) providing for a revised purchase price consisting of a combination of cash and a subordinated promissory note aggregating $18.4 million, as well as a 5% equity interest in Buyer’s post-closing ultimate parent company. The cash portion of the revised purchase price will be at least $7 million, consisting of $3.5 million pursuant to Buyer’s equity financing agreements and the proceeds available at closing under Buyer’s loan agreement with North Mill Capital LLC to fund the cash portion of the purchase price. The principal amount of the subordinated promissory note of Buyer will be the difference between $18.4 million and the cash paid by Buyer at closing. The amended agreement continues to provide for Buyer to assume substantially all the Company’s liabilities. Under the amendment, the Company will retain certain assets, including cash in an amount of at least $0.6 million, net operating loss carryforwards, and any remaining payments under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. As previously disclosed, Buyer is a Delaware limited liability company formed by Walter Blocker, Chairman of Vietnam Trade Alliance in Ho Chi Minh City, to acquire the Stanley assets. In connection with the amendment, Walter Blocker agreed to provide an additional $500,000 in equity financing to fund a portion of the cash purchase price.\nIn addition to the revised purchase price, the amendment announced today provides the Company with a go-shop period during which it will actively solicit alternative proposals from third parties for the next 14 days concluding at 11:59 p.m. on February 5, 2018 and permitting the Company to continue discussions for an additional 16 days with any party submitting a proposal by that time if the Company’s board of directors determines that proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the agreement) without financing conditions. The amendment also provides for the Company to pay a termination fee of $375,000, rather than $750,000, if it terminates the agreement in connection with a proposal the Company’s board of directors determines to be a superior proposal during the go-shop period. There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. The Company does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the solicitation process unless and until its board of directors has made a decision with respect to terminating the agreement or changing its recommendation in connection with a superior proposal.\nThe closing of the asset sale, which is subject to approval by the Company’s stockholders, Buyer closing on financing pursuant to its existing financing agreements with North Mill Capital LLC, Endurance Capital Group and Walter Blocker, and other customary closing conditions, is still expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.\nUpon the signing of the agreement in November 2017, Buyer delivered into escrow a $750,000 deposit towards the cash consideration for the sale. If Buyer is unable to close on its financing or the agreement is terminated for certain other reasons, the Company is entitled to receive the deposit as a termination fee.\nAs previously announced, the Company does not intend to liquidate following the closing of the transaction. The Company’s board of directors will evaluate alternatives for use of the cash consideration, which are expected to include using a portion of the cash to either repurchase Company common stock or pay a special dividend to stockholders, and also using a portion of the cash to acquire non-furniture related assets that will allow the Company to potentially derive a benefit from its substantial net operating loss carryforwards. The Company anticipates transaction costs including professional fees and change in control payments to be approximately $2.5 million.\nAbout the Company\nEstablished in 1924, Stanley Furniture Company, Inc. is a leading design, marketing and overseas sourcing resource in the upscale segment of the wood residential market.
