In his new position, Gillespie will work with Insignia to pursue new platform investments in the baby food and products sector.\nGillespie has 25+ years of successful leadership experiences in Fortune 500, founder-owned and PE-backed consumer companies and more specifically, 13 years of executive experience in the juvenile products category.
