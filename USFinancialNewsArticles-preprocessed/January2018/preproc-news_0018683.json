    "text": "January 13, 2018 / 7:32 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago Record-breaking Kane fires Tottenham past Everton Shrivathsa Sridhar 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane became the London club’s top Premier League goalscorer with 98 goals after his second-half brace helped the hosts thump Everton 4-0 at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Everton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - January 13, 2018 Tottenham's Harry Kane scores their second goal REUTERS/Eddie Keogh \nThe in-form England international, who took his tally in all competitions this season to 28 goals, matched Teddy Sheringham’s feat after he tapped in Son Heung-min’s through ball after the restart before prodding in Eric Dier’s cross on the hour mark. \nMidfielder Son earlier scored in his fifth straight league game to put the hosts ahead 1-0 in the 26th minute after darting in to tap home Serge Aurier’s cross after Christian Eriksen found the right back with a floated pass in the 26th minute. \nWith Everton’s defence in tatters, Eriksen completed the rout by collecting fellow midfielder Dele Alli’s clever flick on before beating Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford with a crisp finish in the 81st minute.
