Slideshow (2 Images) \nCape Town told residents last week they would need to cut their daily water consumption by almost half from next month as authorities scramble to prevent the city running out of water. \nThe water crisis poses a risk to a vibrant tourist industry that sees almost 2 million visitors flock to Cape Town every year. \nSouth Africa, the world’s seventh biggest wine producer, is expected to see the smallest harvest in more than a decade in 2018 because of the drought.
