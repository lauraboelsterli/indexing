You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” he had said. \nRead: Jamie Dimon Should Do ‘Some Homework’ on Crypto, Says Blockchain Capital VC \nSeveral banks, exchange operators and companies have embraced bitcoins, fueled by increasing consumer and investor interest. \nDimon made the comments at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco .
