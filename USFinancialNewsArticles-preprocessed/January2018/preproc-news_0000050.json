    "text": "President Donald Trump distanced himself from his former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday, contending that \"he not only lost his job\" but also \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House. \nOn Wednesday, excerpts from an upcoming Michael Wolff book showed that Bannon called a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\" Bannon, who did not join the Trump campaign until August 2016, also said there was \"zero\" chance that then-candidate Trump did not meet with the attendees. \nIn a statement Wednesday, the president said Bannon — the nationalist firebrand — \"had very little to do\" with his electoral victory in 2016. Trump added that \"Steve doesn't represent my base — he's only in it for himself.\" \n\"Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was,\" Trump said.\n\"It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,\" he added. \nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
