In November the corresponding year-to-date numbers were down 23 percent for sales and down 1 percent for construction starts.\nInvestments in Norway’s housing sector have boomed in recent years as demand for new homes rose and prices hit all-time highs last April, but the market has weakened in recent months, resulting in lower sales.\nIn total, housing starts fell to 30,719 units in 2017 while total sales declined to 27,755.\n“The relatively high housing starts in 2017 were caused by a very good sale in 2016,” NHBA Chief Executive Per Jaeger said, adding that his association estimated a need for about 32,000 new homes annually based on current demographic trends.\nThe cost of buying a home is down about 6.7 percent on average since April, and has fallen by 11.5 percent in Oslo, according to data released earlier this month by Real Estate Norway.\nFears of a sharper decline in housing prices also resulted in a weakening of Norway’s crown currency in late 2017, although the crown has since partly recovered.\nThe 10 biggest home builders in Norway are OBOS, Mesterhus, Systemhus, Byggmann, Nordbohus, Blinkhus, Selvaag Bolig , Boligpartner and JM Norge. Other builders include AF Gruppen and Veidekke. (Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg, Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik)\n ",
