    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: UDR ) announced today that Thomas W. Toomey, Chief Executive Officer and President, has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company effective January 1, 2018. Mr. Toomey was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company in 2001 and was elected to the Company’s Board of Directors at that time. Mr. Toomey succeeds James D. Klingbeil who has served as Chairman since 2010.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors also established a Lead Independent Director position and appointed Mr. Klingbeil as Lead Independent Director.\n“Tom’s long-term leadership, his successful reshaping of UDR into a blue-chip REIT as President and CEO for the past 17 years, and his in-depth knowledge of the public multifamily space make him the right choice to lead the Board moving forward,” said Mr. Klingbeil. “I look forward to continuing to serve as the Lead Independent Director.”\nMr. Toomey said, “I want to thank Jim for his contributions to the Company as Chairman and am grateful to retain his continued leadership as Lead Independent Director.
