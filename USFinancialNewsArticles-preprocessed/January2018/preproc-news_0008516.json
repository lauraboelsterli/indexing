    "text": "KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan has renewed a complaint at the United Nations demanding Egypt hand over control of the “Halayeb Triangle” border territory, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\nRelations between Egypt and Sudan have been soured in recent months by disputes over the ownership of the triangle, and over the broader issue of use of water from the River Nile that passes through their territories.\nThe triangle lies between Egypt and its southern neighbour and the borders have been contested by Sudan since 1958. Cairo says it is Egyptian territory.\nThe Foreign Ministry did not say what action it wanted the United Nations to take, if any.\nEgypt rejected in 2016 a request from Khartoum to enter negotiations to determine sovereignty over the triangle or to seek international arbitration.\nSudan recalled its ambassador from its northern neighbour for consultations on Thursday. Egypt’s state news agency MENA later Quote: d the foreign minister saying the notification of withdrawal pointed towards the land dispute.\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz; Writing by Nadine Awadalla; editing by Ralph Boulton\n ",
