    "text": "Fitbit is reportedly working on a smartwatch for kids, according to Bloomberg , as the company faces increasing pressure from Apple's push into health tech . \nThe line of child-sized wearables has apparently been under discussion for months, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. \nIt's unclear how the smartwatch would differ from Fitbit wearables already on the market. The company offer fitness tracking and glucose monitoring through a partnership with Dexcom and a recent investment in start-up Sano . \nBut there's reason for Fitbit to expand its offering. \nApple continues to push into health tech with expanded features for the Apple Watch. \nThe FDA approved in November an Apple Watch band with embedded EKG monitoring technology. \nRead the full Bloomberg report here.",
