We are delighted that student enrollment has gone up 17% year–on-year with approximately 34,163 students enrolled at our schools as of November 30, 2017. We provide our students with premier education services that have consistently delivered outstanding academic outcomes. As of the date of this release, approximately 51.0% of students in the 2018 graduating class of our international schools have received over 350 offers from global top 50 institutions. We anticipate a growing proportion of our student body receiving offers from these elite institutions and continuous improvement in student grades across all age groups this academic year.\"\n\"We have delivered a very strong set of business and operational results and executed our business strategies well by remaining steadfast in our strategic priorities, maintaining rigorous discipline on maximizing profitability and focusing investments on long term profitable growth. Our revenue grew by 23.0% with further margin expansion as supported by continuous enhancement within existing schools in utilization, student/teacher ratio and effective cost management.\"\n\"Our results in first fiscal quarter demonstrate the continued progress we are making on our strategy. The rapid expansion of our network has never been more critical to our business success. We currently expect to open 12 new schools during fiscal 2018 of which eight commenced operation during the first fiscal quarter. In December 2017, we have entered into an agreement to acquire 75% equity interests in five kindergartens to further strengthen our foothold in Hubei province of China. We currently expect to complete the acquisition by the end of the second fiscal quarter.\"\n\"We could not have furthered our success without the support of our senior business and academic leaders and ongoing recruitment and retention of top talents, which are critical building blocks to our long term and sustainable business growth. On December 15, 2017, our board of directors granted share options to purchase approximately 900,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company or 17% of the total shares reserved under our current share incentive plan, to school principals and management team members with vesting period varying from 3 to 5 years. We expect the dilution impact to be less than 1% on a fully converted basis.\"\n\"We are very pleased with the positive industry trends, the encouraging regulatory environments and full year outlook for the business. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to pursue domestic and international strategic investment opportunities in network expansion, test preparation, college counselling and extra curriculum that would further strengthen Bright Scholar's position as the leader in the premium school market and will provide significant momentum to our continued growth.\"\n2018 FIRST FISCAL QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nRevenues for the first fiscal quarter were RMB465.2 million, representing 23.0% increase from RMB378.2 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nThe table below sets forth a breakdown of revenues:\nFirst Fiscal Quarter\nEnded November 30, 2017\nFirst Fiscal Quarter\nEnded November 30, 2016\nYoY % Change\n(RMB in million)\n(RMB in million)\nInternational Schools\n174.6\n149.9\n16.5%\nBilingual Schools\n155.5\n120.4\n29.2%\nKindergartens\n106.2\n88.5\n20.0%\nComplementary\n28.9\n19.4\n49.0%\nTotal\n465.2\n378.2\n23.0%\nInternational Schools: Revenue for the quarter was RMB174.6 million, representing a 16.5% increase from RMB149.9 million, accounting for 37.5% of total revenues as compared to 39.6% in the same period of last fiscal year, primarily due to a 15.3% increase in the average number of students from 6,266 to 7,227, and a 1.3% increase in the average tuition and fees from RMB23,900 to RMB24, 200 during the comparison periods.\nBilingual Schools: Revenue for the quarter was RMB155.5 million, representing a 29.2% increase from RMB120.4 million, accounting for 33.4% of total revenues as compared to 31.8% in the same period of last fiscal year. This was primarily due to a 17.1% increase in the average number of students from 13,126 to 15,371, and a 9.8% increase in the average tuition and fees from RMB9,200 to RMB10,100 during the comparison periods.\nKindergartens: Revenue for the quarter was RMB106.2 million, representing a 20.0% increase from RMB88.5 million, accounting for 22.8% of total revenues as compared to 23.4% in the same period of last fiscal year. This was primarily due to a 15.7% increase in the average number of students from 9,780 to 11,318, and a 4.4% increase in the average tuition and fees from RMB9,000 to RMB9,400during the comparison periods.\nComplementary: Revenue for the quarter was RMB28.9 million, representing a 49.0% increase from RMB19.4 million, accounting for 6.2% of total revenues as compared to 5.1% in the same period of last fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in the revenue of élan English learning centers from RMB18.1 million to RMB24.7 million, and an increase of RMB2.9 million in other categories of revenue (e.g., camps) during the comparison periods.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the quarter was RMB248.4 million, representing an 11.8% increase from RMB222.2 million in the same period of last fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase of RMB21.7 million in staff costs as a consequence of an increase in the headcount of teaching staff as our school network expanded. The average number of our teachers and instructors increased by 14.0% from 3,098 to 3,533 during the comparison periods.\nInternational Schools: Cost of revenues for the quarter was RMB89.0 million, representing a 2.9% decrease from RMB91.7 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nBilingual Schools: Cost of revenues for the quarter was RMB88.1 million, representing a 23.2% increase from RMB71.5 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nKindergartens: Cost of revenues for the quarter was RMB53.5 million, representing a 16.8% increase from RMB45.8 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nComplementary: Cost of revenues for the quarter was RMB17.8 million, representing a 34.8% increase from RMB13.2 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the quarter was RMB216.8 million, representing a 39.0% increase from RMB156.0 million in the same period of last fiscal year. Gross margin for the quarter was 46.6%, as compared to 41.2% in the same period of the last fiscal year. The margin expansion was primarily attributed to the scale growth of existing schools, an increase in average tuitions and fees, and improvements in operational efficiency.\nInternational Schools: Gross profit for the quarter was RMB85.6 million, representing a 47.1% increase from RMB58.2 million in the same period of last fiscal year.

However, periodic reports made to shareholders will include current period amounts translated into U.S. dollars using the then current exchange rates, for the convenience of the readers. Translations of balances in the combined and consolidated balance sheets, and the related combined and consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows from RMB into US dollars as of and for the year ended November 30, 2017 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB 6.6090, representing the noon buying rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on November 30, 2017. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on November, 2017, or at any other rate.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, including primarily adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as income from operations (which excludes interest income, income tax benefit and expense and depreciation and amortization expenses) excluding share-based compensation expenses and adjusted net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. We define adjusted SG&A as expense excluding share-based compensation expenses. We incurred share-based compensation in the 2016 fiscal year only, which was associated with the acquisition of Mr. Jerry He's equity interests in Impetus in January 2016.\nWe present the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Such non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation expenses and share-based compensation expenses, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income and income tax benefit and expenses. We also believe that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitate investors' assessment of our operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Interest income, income tax benefit and expenses, depreciation expenses and share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net income/(loss). Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\nAbout Bright Scholar Education Holdings Limited\nBright Scholar is the largest operator of international and bilingual K-12 schools in China*.
