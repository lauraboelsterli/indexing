A plane by Lufthansa passes a plane with the Air Berlin - Niki sign at the international airport in Munich, Germany, January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nNiki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian arm of insolvent Air Berlin, but a German regional court said earlier this week that Niki was not under German jurisdiction. \n“Niki filed for insolvency in Austria today,” a spokesman for administrator Lucas Floether said.
