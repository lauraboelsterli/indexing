    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 11:30 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Netflix shares hit record high after blockbuster results Muvija M 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Netflix Inc’s ( NFLX.O ) shares rose 13 percent to a record high on Tuesday after the video streaming service trounced Wall Street targets for new subscribers in the fourth quarter. \nAt least 16 brokerages raised their price targets for the company’s shares by as much as $72. Analysts at Bernstein were most bullish, setting targets of $302 compared to the $252 it traded at on Tuesday. \nThe video-streaming giant crossed $100 billion market value for the first time and was on track to add more than $10 billion if current prices hold. \nIn a statement after markets closed on Monday, Netflix said it added 6.36 million subscribers in international markets in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of 5.1 million, according to FactSet. \nIt now has 117.58 million streaming subscribers globally. \n“Overall, this was a ‘home run quarter’ for Netflix and should put any lingering worries to rest around sub(scriber) growth, international ramp, and the ‘negative’ possible effects from the (subscription) price increase,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said. \nThe company, which showcased popular returning series “Stranger Things”, “The Crown” and “Black Mirror” in the quarter, in October hiked its monthly fees for U.S. customers for the first time in two years.

The median price target for the stock was $275. \nHulu ended 2017 with 17 million subscribers while analysts estimate Amazon’s Prime service, which includes a free video subscription, has around 90 million customers. \nShares in Los Gatos, California-based Netflix were up 11.7 percent at $254.31 on the Nasdaq. At Tuesday’s session high of $257.71, the company was worth about $111.5 billion. Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Muvija M in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Anil D'Silva",
