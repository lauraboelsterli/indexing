    "text": " 14 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago U.S. to send record 242 athletes to Pyeongchang Games Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - The United States will send the largest team ever to attend a Winter Olympics, 242 athletes, to next month’s Pyeongchang Games, the U.S. Olympic Committee announced on Friday. \nAlpine skier Lindsey Vonn, figure skating favourite Nathan Chen and speedskater Shani Davis, the winner of four Olympic medals, headline the team of 107 women and 135 men who will be seeking to earn the United States their 100th Olympic gold and 300th medal. \nThe Americans won 28 medals, including nine golds, at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and with 103 Olympians returning, they are looking for an equally strong showing. \n“It’s been pretty brutal to wait for another Olympics,” said Vonn, who will be making her fourth appearance at a Games having missed out on a trip to Sochi in 2014 with a knee injury. \n“I am so excited, it is probably my last Olympics,” added the 2010 Vancouver downhill gold medallist who recently claimed a record 79th World Cup race. \nFor Chen, a prediction he made as a 10-year-old that he would become an Olympian is about to become a reality.
