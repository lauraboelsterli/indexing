    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 5:28 PM / Updated 17 hours ago England's Haskell handed four-week ban, will miss Six Nations start Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - England’s James Haskell will miss the start of the Six Nations after he was handed a four-week ban for a dangerous tackle in a European Champions Cup match last Saturday. \nA disciplinary panel of European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) on Wednesday found the Wasps flanker guilty of striking Harlequins’ Jamie Roberts in the head in the 76th minute and upheld his red card. \nThe panel reduced the initial six-week sentence given for striking a player in the head due to Haskell’s previous exemplary disciplinary record, his guilty plea and his early expression of remorse, the EPCR said in a statement. \nThe ban could end Haskell’s hopes of an England recall. The flanker last played for his country in the Six Nations fixture against Ireland in March. Both Haskell and the EPCR have the right to appeal the decision. \nHaskell, who has won 75 caps, can return to action on Feb. 12, eight days after England begin their Six Nations campaign against Italy. England then play Wales on Feb. 10. \nEngland head coach Eddie Jones is expected to name his squad for the defence of the Six Nations title on Thursday.
