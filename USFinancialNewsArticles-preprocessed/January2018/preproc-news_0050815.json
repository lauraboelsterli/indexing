    "text": "TAIPEI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Tuesday U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc will pay its first installment of a fine worth T$390 million ($13.35 million) for anti-trust violations.\nThe commission made the comments at a news conference on Qualcomm’s anti-trust case in Taiwan.\nThe first payment announced on Tuesday was part of the T$23.4 billion fine that the commission said in October it would impose on Qualcomm for the violations.\nEarlier, the Commission said Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to licence its technology to other industry players.\nQualcomm’s fine is the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc in court over many of the same legal issues.
