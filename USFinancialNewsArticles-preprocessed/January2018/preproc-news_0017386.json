    "text": "This $3,400 bitcoin-mining machine is a cornerstone of Kodak's crypto pivot At CES, Kodak was demonstrating the KashMiner, a bitcoin-mining machine. 15 Hours Ago | 01:01 \nKodak's stock has more than tripled this week , since the once-giant of photography announced a pivot into blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. \nPart of their move is a Kodak-branded mining rig called the KashMiner, which was showcased at this year's CES. It's created and run by a company called Spotlite, and has licensed the Kodak name. \nHere's how it works: Users pay $3,400 to rent the mining machine for two years. \nKodak claims the KashMiner will produce about $375 worth of new bitcoins every month, which would lead to estimated revenues roughly $9,000 over those two years. \nBut here's the catch: You have to give back half your profits. \nAnd others warn the $375 figure is exaggerated, as those bitcoin returns will diminish every month:",
