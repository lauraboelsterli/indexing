    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 1:35 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Danish submarine-owner charged with abusing journalist before killing her Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish inventor Peter Madsen tied up and abused Swedish journalist Kim Wall before murdering her on board his home-built submarine, according to the indictment published on Tuesday. \nMadsen planned the murder by bringing a saw, screwdrivers, strips and pipes, which were used to hit, cut and stab Wall while she was alive, the prosecutors said. \nThe cause of death is yet to be determined, but the prosecutors said she died by strangulation or cutting her throat. \nMadsen has admitted dismembering Wall on board his submarine and dumping her body parts in the sea, but he denies murdering or sexually assaulting her. \nOn Jan. 16, Madsen was charged with the murder and dismembering of Wall along with a charge of sexual assault without intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature.
