    "text": "NEW HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLNT), a commercial-stage company discovering, developing, and commercializing novel antibiotics to treat serious bacterial infections, today announced the appointment of Lisa DeFrancesco as senior vice president of investor relations (IR) reporting to Dan Wechsler, president and chief executive officer.\nDeFrancesco is a seasoned healthcare industry executive, with 18 years of experience in investor relations, finance and communications. She joins Melinta from Allergan where she served most recently as vice president of IR.\n“We are thrilled to have Lisa join our expanding executive leadership team as Melinta continues to grow and evolve as a world-leading antibiotics company,” stated Dan Wechsler, president and chief executive officer. “Her deep experience integrating IR, corporate finance, sell-side equity research, communications and proven track record in investor relations, will help us to capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead as we build a bigger, better Melinta, focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders.”\nDeFrancesco’s appointment follows the planned departure of John Bluth, executive vice president of investor relations and corporate communications, who left Melinta at the end of December.\n“John has served as the head of investor relations for both Cempra and Melinta over multiple years and has been indispensable during the integration of the two companies’ assets,” stated Mr. Wechsler. “The management team, board of directors and I would like to thank John for his dedication to his roles at Cempra and its merger with Melinta, and wish him well in his next endeavor.”\nAbout Melinta Therapeutics\nMelinta Therapeutics, Inc. is dedicated to saving lives threatened by the global public health crisis of bacterial infections, through the development and commercialization of novel antibiotics that provide new and better therapeutic solutions.
