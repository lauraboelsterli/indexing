Ratehub Inc. owns and operates financial product comparison site, Ratehub.ca , and CanWise Financial , a national mortgage brokerage which funds over $1 billion of annual mortgage volume.\n\"Canadians don't always look at all of their options when they need a new financial product, due to ingrained loyalty to their home bank,\" said Alyssa Furtado, co-founder of Ratehub Inc. and CEO of Ratehub.ca. \"We are looking forward to launching new and enhanced financial product comparisons, and to continuing to bring financial transparency to Canadians.\"\n\"Working with Elephant and Simon Nixon will be a tremendous asset in accelerating Ratehub Inc.'s future growth,\" said James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub Inc. and President of CanWise Financial. \"Elephant brings valuable connections and insight into developing a successful online brand, based on their experience at Warby Parker, Allbirds, Scopely, and other leading online brands.

They offer a compelling value proposition to both parties that doesn't otherwise exist in Canada,\" said Jeremiah Daly, co-founder and General Partner at Elephant. \"With this initial investment in Ratehub Inc., we're looking forward to seeing the company continue to scale and lead the Canadian market.\"\nRatehub Inc. is using the funds to build a digital platform that will allow Canadians to go through the entire mortgage process online.
