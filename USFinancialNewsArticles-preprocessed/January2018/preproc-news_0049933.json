That was down from a high of $1.2538 that the euro had reached on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said economic data pointed to “solid and broad” growth with inflation likely to rise in the medium term.\nDraghi also warned that the surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty and said the ECB might have to review strategy if U.S. comments on the benefits of a weak dollar lead to a change in monetary conditions.\nSterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.4163, but remained well below its peak on Thursday of $1.4346, which was the pound’s highest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 109.71 yen , having bounced from a four-month low of 108.50 yen struck on Thursday.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
