    "text": "Published: Jan 10, 2018 8:34 p.m. ET Share \nFull takeover not on the table, sources say Bloomberg News Xerox Corp.'s headquarters in Stamford, Conn. \nBy Dana Cimilluca Dana Mattioli \nXerox Corp. is in talks to potentially strike a major deal with Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp. as the U.S. document pioneer struggles to reinvent itself. \nThe two companies, which already have a joint venture, are discussing an array of possible deals that may or may not include a change of control of Xerox, according to people familiar with the matter. A full takeover of the Norwalk, Conn., company isn’t on the table, one of the people said. No deal appears imminent and one may not be reached. \nShould there be a change of control of Xerox, it would mark the end of the independence of a stalwart of American industry that was an early technological trailblazer that has been bedeviled by a drop off in demand for office printing. A deal would give both Fujifilm 4901, -1.79% and Xerox a chance to root out costs and make their legacy businesses more efficient, some of the people said. \nXerox shares XRX, +0.53% , which topped out at more than $150 in the late ’90s, now trade at just over $30 amid a continued slump in sales and profit. Xerox’s market value stands at roughly $7.7 billion; it also has more than $4 billion of net debt.",
