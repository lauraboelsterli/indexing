    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s central bank may lower its key rate once Russians get accustomed to macro-economic stability, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday.\n“We have managed to lower inflation to a historic minimum of 2.5 percent... People need to get used to the fact that the situation is stable. Then the bank will start lowering its rate,” the president said.\nReporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Christian Lowe\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
