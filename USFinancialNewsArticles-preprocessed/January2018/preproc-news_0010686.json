As Deputy Commissioner of the Investigations Division, he oversaw all aspects of criminal investigations into corrupt, illegal, or unethical conduct, including those focused on financial fraud, theft, organized crime, bribery, narcotics, and political corruption. He provided executive oversight for the agency's 11 Investigative Squads and its Digital Forensics Unit, Special Operations Unit, and Vendor Integrity Unit; managed staff that conducted background investigations on contractors and subcontractors seeking to do business with the City; oversaw internal DOI investigations involving allegations of criminality and/or misconduct; and directed outside investigative consultants providing integrity monitoring services for the DOI on large-scale construction projects. He also served as Commanding Officer of the DOI's Training Academy.\n\"Michael brings substantial experience in public-sector investigations, including monitorships connected to environmental, health, housing, and large-scale construction projects. I'm confident that he will be a strong contributor to our Investigations and Disputes practice,\" said Robert Brenner, chief operating officer for K2 Intelligence.\n\"Michael's expertise in criminal investigations into corrupt, illegal, or unethical conduct as well as his in-depth knowledge of eradicating fraud in public infrastructure will be an important addition to our team as we are continuing to expand our construction and real estate service offering,\" said Snežana Gebauer, executive managing director and head of K2 Intelligence's U.S. Investigations and Disputes practice.\nMr. Carroll joined the DOI in 2004 and over the last 13 years has served as Chief Investigator, Deputy Inspector General, Inspector General, Assistant Commissioner, and Associate Commissioner. He assumed his current role at the DOI in 2015. Before joining the DOI, he served as manager of investigations/corporate security for JetBlue Airways, where he managed all investigations in the United States (including investigations into theft, embezzlement, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, security breaches, and employee misconduct), frequently liaising with local, state, and federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies. Mr. Carroll began his career in the New York City Police Department, where he was a Detective Investigator.\nHe is a frequent speaker to U.S. law enforcement agencies, as well as to the law enforcement agencies of foreign governments. He also served as an adjunct professor of criminal justice at St. Thomas Aquinas College.\nMr. Carroll received his M.A. in criminal justice from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and his B.A. in psychology from the College of Mount Saint Vincent.
