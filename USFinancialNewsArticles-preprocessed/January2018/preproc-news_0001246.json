LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 10,473.00, trading up 0.05 percent from its previous close The Indian rupee will likely edge steady to higher against the dollar in early trade, tracking overnight losses in the greenback, as the euro hovered near a three-year high on positive investor sentiment over Eurozone's economic outlook. Indian government bonds are expected to edge lower, tracking a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and firm crude oil prices that make emerging market debt less attractive for investors. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 percent bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.36 percent-7.40 percent band today, a trader with a primary dealership said. The bond closed at 96.02 rupees, yielding 7.38 percent, yesterday. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks rose in the first session of the new year and the Nasdaq closed above 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday as investors were optimistic that 2018 will bring more gains for the market. • Asian stocks struck a fresh decade high as risk appetites were whetted by a bevy of upbeat manufacturing surveys that confirmed a synchronised upturn in world growth was well under way. • The euro traded within sight of its highest level in three years on Wednesday, underpinned by optimism about the euro zone's economic outlook. • U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday on strong Wall Street gains and in line with European government yields after a European Central Bank official said the ECB's massive bond purchase program may not be continued later this year. • Oil prices were stable, not far off mid-2015 highs reached the previous session, as strong demand and ongoing efforts led by OPEC and Russia to curb production tightened the market. • Gold prices edged up, hitting over 3-1/2-month highs, driven by a softer dollar.
