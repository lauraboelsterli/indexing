    "text": "Jan 29 (Reuters) - German car rental company Sixt said it had agreed to sell its stake in car-sharing service DriveNow to joint venture partner BMW Group for 209 million euros ($259.1 million).\nSixt and BMW currently each own 50 percent in DriveNow, Sixt said on Monday.\nThe company also said it would generate an extraordinary pre-tax profit of about 200 million euros in 2018 due to the transaction.\nBMW and fellow German carmaker Daimler are close to agreeing to combine their car-sharing services Car2Go and DriveNow, a senior executive at one of the carmakers told Reuters last week.
