    "text": "Here is President Donald Trump 's full statement regarding former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon :\nSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.\nNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn't represent my baseâ€”he's only in it for himself.\nSteve pretends to be at war with the media,which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.\nWe have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down.\nRead more from CNBC:\nTrump disavows Steve Bannon: 'He not only lost his job, he lost his mind' \nSteve Bannon says he's certain that Trump met with Russians who were at Trump Tower in 2016 \nBannon calls Trump Tower meeting 'treasonous,' says Russia investigation will 'crack Don Junior like an egg'",
