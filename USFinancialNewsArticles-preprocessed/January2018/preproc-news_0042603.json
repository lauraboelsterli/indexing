    "text": "Jrue Holiday, who had a big fourth-quarter stretch, and Anthony Davis both scored 19 points as the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Charlotte Hornets 101-96 on Wednesday night at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.\nDeMarcus Cousins added 16 points and 13 rebounds and E‘Twaun Moore had 11 points for the Pelicans, who won for the sixth time in their last seven games. They were playing their lone road game during a six-game stretch.\nDwight Howard, a 32-year-old center appearing in his 1,000th regular-season game in the NBA, posted 22 points and 16 rebounds for Charlotte. Howard also was assessed his 10th technical foul of the season.\nKemba Walker added 20 points for the Hornets, who also benefited from Frank Kaminsky’s 16 points and Marvin Williams’ 14 points and season-best 14 rebounds.\nThe game was tied seven times across the first 14 minutes of the second half.\nThe Pelicans held a slim lead for most of the fourth quarter before Walker’s 3-pointer at the 3:07 mark tied the game at 92.\nHoliday answered with the next two baskets and later made two free throws at the 30-second mark for a 98-95 edge.\nWalker made only the first of a two-shot foul with 23 seconds left. Davis followed with a pair of free throws and a steal to help the Pelicans seal the outcome.\nNew Orleans held a 56-53 halftime lead despite 10 turnovers. The Pelicans shot 23-for-44 (52.3 percent) from the field by the break.\nDavis scored all 10 of his first-half points in the opening quarter, as the Pelicans built a 32-21 lead going into the second.\nThe Hornets, who were playing the fourth game of a five-game homestand, took the lead by beginning the second quarter on a 16-4 run. They lost for the fourth time in their last 10 games after finishing 6-for-21 on 3-pointers.\nHornets forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist returned to action after missing Monday night’s game because of an arm injury. He scored seven points in 23 minutes.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
