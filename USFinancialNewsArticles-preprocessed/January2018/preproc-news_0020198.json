    "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- (NASDAQ:HFWA) Heritage Financial Corporation (\"Heritage\"), the parent company of Heritage Bank, announced that effective January 16, 2018, it completed its previously announced acquisition of Puget Sound Bancorp, Inc. (\"Puget Sound\"), Bellevue, Washington and the merger of Puget Sound Bank, the bank subsidiary of Puget Sound, into Heritage Bank.\nBrian L. Vance, Chief Executive Officer of Heritage and Heritage Bank, stated, \"We are fortunate to have the opportunity to partner with Puget Sound Bank, located in Bellevue, Washington, which is one of the fastest growing markets in the Northwest and expands our presence in King County. We are very pleased to welcome Puget Sound's customers and employees to Heritage Bank and look forward to continuing to provide quality services and opportunities to them.\"\nHeritage will issue an aggregate of 4,112,347 shares of its common stock in the transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the exchange ratio has been computed based on the closing prices of Heritage's common stock for a period prior to closing and as a result shareholders of Puget Sound immediately prior to the merger will receive 1.1688 shares of Heritage's common stock with cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares. Puget Sound shareholders will receive information shortly on how to exchange their Puget Sound shares for Heritage shares.\n\"We are also pleased to welcome Stephen A. Dennis to the Boards of Directors of Heritage and Heritage Bank,\" said Brian Charneski, Chairman of the Boards. \"He was a founding member of the Puget Sound Board of Directors and has extensive leadership experience and business acumen. He is also actively involved in the community and appreciates the importance of community banking relationships.\" Mr. Dennis received his undergraduate degree in construction management from the University of Washington and an MBA from the University of Colorado.\nAbout Heritage\nHeritage Financial Corporation is an Olympia-based bank holding company with Heritage Bank, a full-service commercial bank, as its sole wholly-owned banking subsidiary.
