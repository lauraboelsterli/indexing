    "text": "January 10, 2018 / 4:32 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Djokovic back with a bang at Kooyong Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic returned to competitive tennis with a bang on Wednesday, bringing a six-month spell on the sidelines to an end with a thumping 6-1 6-4 win over world number five Dominic Thiem at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament.

It’s a great joy, I love this sport, it’s a great passion of mine so I missed it. \n“I wasn’t that nervous, although I had that matchplay attitude ... I wanted to be back on court, unfortunately the elbow wouldn’t let me last week.” \nThe 30-year-old, who won the year’s first grand slam five times in six years until 2016, did not have it all his own way in a tighter second set and it went with serve to 5-4 when Djokovic broke again to wrap up the victory in 42 minutes. \nNow ranked 14th in the world after his long absence, the 12-times grand slam singles champion will be one to avoid in Thursday’s draw for the Australian Open. \n“This has been a tough period for me, obviously injury is the greatest enemy a professional athlete can have,” the Serbian added. \n”You can’t do anything about it except try to recover as quickly as you can. \n“The Australian Open is the big one, it’s the one I wanted to be ready for. It’s a great start.” \nAnother former grand slam champion, Marin Cilic, did not have such a good day at the former venue of the Australian Open with the Croatian world number six losing 6-7(3) 6-4 7-5 to Australian Matthew Ebden.
