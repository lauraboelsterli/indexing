The group based in Kilchberg on Lake Zurich will report full earnings on March 6.\nIt kept its outlook of 6-8 percent organic sales growth and increasing margins by 20-40 basis points.\nThe company described its performance as “good” coming amid largely saturated chocolate markets around the world and increasing pressure on prices. Lindt said organic sales in Europe rose 6.2 percent, while growth increased by 12.4 percent in the rest of the world.\nBut North America remained a headache, with sales falling 1.6 percent in the market where Lindt advanced to the number three position in chocolate with its Russell Stover buy in 2014.\nLindt said Russell Stover, the maker of Whitman’s Sampler boxes of chocolates, suffered a decline in sales, caused by a weaker market in general and difficulties experienced by some of its retailers, including drug stores and department stores.\nLindt has also been trimming Russell Stover’s product lineup and cutting back on unprofitable promotions as it aims to turn around the business which has weighed on its overall performance.\nA bright spot however was the expansion of Lindt’s own retail outlets, with 50 new stores opened last year, taking the number of stores it operates globally to 410.\nThe chocolate maker known for its gold-foil-wrapped Easter bunnies has been expanding its retail offering to tap into the growing market for customers seeking a premium experience rather than just a simple chocolate bar.\n$1 = 0.9637 Swiss francs Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
