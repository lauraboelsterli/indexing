(“Navios Midstream”) (NYSE:NAP), an owner and operator of tanker vessels, reported its financial results today for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nAngeliki Frangou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Navios Midstream, stated, “We are pleased to report results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we reported $16.3 million of EBITDA and $4.3 million of net income. For the full year of 2017, we reported $57.9 million of EBITDA and $14.6 million of net income. We also announced a distribution of $0.4225 per unit, representing an annualized yield of about 17%.”\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCash Distribution\nThe Board of Directors of Navios Midstream declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.4225 per unit. The cash distribution is payable on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of February 9, 2018.\nNavios Midstream’s ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to it. The ability of Navios Midstream’s subsidiaries to make distributions to it may be restricted by, among other things, the provisions of existing and future indebtedness, market conditions, applicable partnership and limited liability company laws and other laws and regulations.\nLiquidity\nIn January 2018, Navios Midstream received $11.5 million of backstop payment, reflecting the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2017, from a total estimated backstop commitment of $16.4 million incurred in 2017.\nOn a pro forma basis, adjusting for the receipt of the backstop payment of $11.5 million, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2017, increased from $37.1 million to $48.6 million.\nLong–Term Cash Flow\nNavios Midstream has entered into long-term charter-out agreements for its vessels, with a remaining average term of 3.3 years, which are expected to provide a stable base of revenue and distributable cash flow. Navios Midstream has currently contracted out 100% of its available days for 2018 and 40.8% for 2019 expecting to generate revenues, including the backstop commitment provided by Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation, of approximately $86.6 million and $40.8 million for 2018 and 2019, respectively. The average expected daily charter-out rate for the fleet is $39,559 and $45,613 for 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the following results and the selected financial data presented herein, Navios Midstream has compiled condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The information for the quarterly and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective periods. EBITDA and Operating Surplus are non GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or substitution for Navios Midstream’s results.\nSee Exhibit 3 under the heading, “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, for a discussion of EBITDA and Operating Surplus, and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable measures calculated under U.S. GAAP.\n(in $‘000 except per unit data) Three Month\nPeriod ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) Three Month\nPeriod ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(unaudited ) Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(unaudited) Revenue $ 22,700 $ 22,781 $ 83,052 $ 91,834 Net income 4,299 6,049 14,631 24,890 Net cash provided by operating activities 6,600 13,519 18,368 49,738 EBITDA 16,309 16,365 57,936 66,170 Earnings per common unit (basic and diluted) 0.20 0.28 0.70 1.19 Operating Surplus 10,920 10,007 36,524 40,609 Maintenance and replacement capital expenditure reserve 2,461 3,580 9,844 14,321 Three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 decreased by less than $0.1 million to $22.7 million, as compared to $22.8 million for the same period in 2016. Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) was $40,391 for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and $40,719 for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was $4.3 million compared to $6.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income of approximately $1.8 million was due to a: (a) $1.4 million increase in interest expenses and finance cost mainly due to a $1.3 million write-off of deferred finance cost; (b) $0.4 million increase in direct vessel expenses; and (c) $0.1 million decrease in EBITDA; partially mitigated by a $0.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization.\nEarnings per common unit were $0.20 for the three month period ended December 31, 2017.\nEBITDA decreased by $0.1 million to $16.3 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in EBITDA was due to a: (a) $0.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses; (b) $0.1 million decrease in revenue; and (c) $0.1 million increase in time charter expenses; partially mitigated by a $0.3 million decrease in other expense.\nThe reserve for estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively (please see “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures-4.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nNavios Midstream generated an Operating Surplus for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 of $10.9 million. Operating Surplus is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions (please see “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures-4.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nYear ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $8.8 million to $83.1 million, as compared to $91.8 million for the same period in 2016, mainly due to the decrease of profit share by $4.3 million as a result of prevailing market conditions and certain unscheduled off-hires among which was the prolonged drydock of one of our vessels. TCE was $39,401 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $42,625 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $14.6 million compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income of approximately $10.3 million was due to: (a) an $8.2 million decrease in EBITDA; (b) a $1.6 million increase in interest expenses and finance cost mainly due to a $1.3 million write-off of deferred finance cost; (c) a $0.8 million increase in direct vessel expenses; and (d) a $0.1 million decrease in interest income; partially mitigated by a $0.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization.\nEarnings per common unit were $0.70 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEBITDA decreased by $8.2 million to $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $66.2 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in EBITDA was mainly due to an $8.8 million decrease in revenue. The above decrease was partially mitigated by a: (a) $0.3 million decrease in time charter expenses; (b) $0.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses; (c) $0.1 million decrease in management fees; and (d) $0.1 million decrease in other expense.\nThe reserve for estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $9.8 million and $14.3 million, respectively (please see “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures-4.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nNavios Midstream generated an Operating Surplus for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $36.5 million. Operating Surplus is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions (please see ﻿“Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures-4.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nFleet Employment Profile\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators of Navios Midstream’s core fleet performance for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree Month\nPeriod ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) Three Month\nPeriod ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(unaudited) Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(unaudited) FLEET DATA Available days (1) 552 552 2,077 2,120 Operating days (2) 545 551 2,049 2,113 Fleet utilization (3) 98.7 % 99.9 % 98.6 % 99.7 % Vessels operating at period end 6 6 6 6 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time Charter Equivalent per day (4) $ 40,391 $ 40,719 $ 39,401 $ 42,625\n(1) Available days for the fleet represent total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Midstream’s possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with scheduled repairs, drydock or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which a vessel is capable of generating revenues.\n(2) Operating days is the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\n(3) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Midstream’s vessels were available for revenue generating available days, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure efficiency in finding employment for vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, drydock or special surveys.\n(4) TCE rates are defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels on various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet.

EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income before interest and finance costs, before depreciation and amortization and income taxes. We use EBITDA as a liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most comparable liquidity measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). EBITDA in this document is calculated as follows: net cash provided by /(used in) operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of: (i) net increase /(decrease) in operating assets; (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities; (iii) net interest cost; (iv) amortization of deferred finance charges and other related expenses; (v) provision for losses on accounts receivable; (vi) equity in affiliates, net of dividends received; (vii) payments for drydock and special survey costs; (viii) gain /(loss) on sale of assets/subsidiaries; and (ix) impairment charges. Navios Midstream believes that EBITDA is the basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and presents useful information to investors regarding Navios Midstream’s ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and make cash distributions. Navios Midstream also believes that EBITDA is used: (i) by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nEBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Midstream’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. As a result of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Midstream’s performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\n2. Operating Surplus\nOperating Surplus represents net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash interest expense and estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, Navios Midstream’s capital assets.\nOperating Surplus is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Operating Surplus is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n3. Available Cash\nAvailable Cash generally means for each fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of the quarter:\nless the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors to: provide for the proper conduct of Navios Midstream’s business (including reserve for maintenance and replacement capital expenditures); comply with applicable law, any of Navios Midstream’s debt instruments, or other agreements; or provide funds for distributions to the unitholders and to the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters; plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. Working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under any revolving credit or similar agreement used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners.\nAvailable Cash is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Available cash is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n4.
