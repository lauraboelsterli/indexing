    "text": "(Reuters) - Defending champion Stephane Peterhansel led the Dakar Rally into Bolivia on Thursday but Peugeot team mate Carlos Sainz trimmed the Frenchman’s lead with his first stage win of this year’s event.\nPeterhansel ended the sixth stage from the Peruvian city of Arequipa to La Paz with a 27-minute advantage over the Spaniard, a two-times world rally champion and father of the Formula One driver with the same name.\nSainz beat Peterhansel by four minutes and six seconds in the 313km stage, split into two sections with a 238km neutralized stint to the shores of Lake Titicaca and the Bolivian Altiplano.\nThe first 118km section of the stage ended at an altitude of 4,722 meters.\nToyota’s Dutch driver Bernhard Ten Brinke was third but falling further back and more than an hour and 20 minutes behind.\nDakar Rally - 2018 Peru-Bolivia-Argentina Dakar rally - 40th Dakar Edition stage six, Arequipa to La Paz - January 11, 2018.
