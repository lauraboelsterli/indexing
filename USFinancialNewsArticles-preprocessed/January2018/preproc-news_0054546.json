    "text": "Metlife shares drop more than 6 percent after postponing earnings Published 9 Mins Ago Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk outside the MetLife building in New York. \nMetlife previewed earnings on Monday that fell far short of Wall Street expectations and rescheduled its fourth-quarter release. \nThe company said it sees adjusted earnings between 61 cents and 66 cents a share. \nShares of Metlife dropped as much as 10 percent in after-hours trade. They have since recovered some of those losses, but were still trading about 5 percent below their closing price of $54.40. \nThis story is developing. Please check back for updates.
