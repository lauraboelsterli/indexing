Woida will serve as co-CIO alongside the firm's CEO Ray Sturm, who will act as both CEO and co-CIO.\nFollowing the recent closing of their $4.1 million seed investment round led by Point72 Ventures and Resolute Ventures, AlphaFlow continues to build its team with Woida joining as a key senior appointment to its executive leadership.\n\"Chris' innovation and leadership in the investment community, particularly in systematic investing, alternatives and data analytics, brings tremendous strategic value to AlphaFlow,\" said Sturm. \"We are excited to have Chris onboard our executive team as the company continues to grow into a premier real estate investment service for investors, RIAs and wealth managers.\"\nWoida brings over 10 years of experience in the financial services industry, previously helping build BlackRock's smart beta and factor-based platforms and serving as the lead investment strategist for its flagship style-factor hedge fund during his seven years with the company. Most recently, he served as Managing Director, Head of Index Solutions at Axioma, a provider of enterprise market risk and portfolio analytics solutions.
