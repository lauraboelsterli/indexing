    "text": "HERSHEY, Pa. and AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) (“Hershey”) today announced the successful completion of the previously announced tender offer by Alphabet Merger Sub Inc., a subsidiary of Hershey (“Purchaser”), for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. (NYSE:BETR) (“Amplify”) at a price of $12.00 per share in cash.\nAmerican Stock Transfer & Trust Co., LLC, the depositary for the tender offer, has advised Hershey that, as of 12:00 midnight, New York City time, at the end of January 30, 2018, the expiration of the tender offer, approximately 71,970,009 shares of common stock of Amplify, representing approximately 95.1391% of Amplify’s currently outstanding shares of common stock, were validly tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer (including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures). As a result, the condition to the tender offer that a majority of Amplify’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis be validly tendered and not withdrawn has been satisfied. Purchaser has accepted for payment all shares of common stock of Amplify validly tendered and not withdrawn and will promptly pay for such shares.\nHershey expects to complete the merger of Purchaser into Amplify under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware today. As a result of the merger, all remaining Amplify shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than any (i) shares held in the treasury of Amplify, (ii) shares owned by Hershey or Purchaser, or their subsidiaries, (iii) shares irrevocably accepted for purchase in the tender offer and (iv) shares held by Amplify stockholders who properly demanded and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $12.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without any interest, but subject to and reduced by any required withholding of taxes (i.e., the same price that was paid in the tender offer). As a result of the merger, Amplify will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Hershey, and Amplify common stock will cease to be traded on The New York Stock Exchange.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains .
