    "text": "January 28, 2018 / 1:27 PM / Updated 10 hours ago Rallying-Defending champion Ogier claims season opener in Monte Carlo   \nPARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Sebastien Ogier of France opened the defence of his rallying world title with a commanding victory in the Rally Monte Carlo, his 41st in WRC, on Sunday. \nThe M-Sport Ford driver, winner of the last five world titles, started the fourth and final leg with a 33.5-second lead over Toyotaâ€™s Ott Tanak and it proved a comfortable enough cushion. \nHe extended his lead over the Estonian up to almost a minute ahead of the final stage and Tanak ended up second 58.3 seconds behind at the end of the four days. \nFinn Jari-Matti Latvala took third place, one minute 52 seconds off the pace. \nOgier joined M-Sport last season after Volkswagen, with whom he won his first four titles, pulled out as part of a strategic shift to help the German carmaker overcome a costly emissions scandal. \nThe Frenchman won only four of the 17 stages, including three of the first four, but always had his rivals in check in sometimes muddy conditions. \nThe next leg of the world championships is the Rally Sweden from Feb. 15-18.
