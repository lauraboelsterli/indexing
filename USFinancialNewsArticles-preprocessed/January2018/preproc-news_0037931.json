    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Board nominee Marvin Goodfriend said on Tuesday he felt current policy was “more or less” correct and should allow the central bank to hit its inflation target in a year or so.\nGoodfriend, peppered by questions from Senate Banking Committee Democrats about his earlier warnings that low interest rates risked a breakout of inflation, said that he now feels the Fed “is more or less on the right path going forward....We should get to 2 percent (inflation) in a year or so.”\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ",
