    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings was treated on Friday for a bacterial infection in his knee at a Maryland hospital, his office said in a statement.\nDoctors at Johns Hopkins hospital drained the infection in a minor procedure, it said. “He is resting comfortably and expects a full recovery,” the statement said.\nCummings, 66, has represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District since 1996 and is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nLast spring, Cummings was absent from Congress for several months after undergoing heart surgery.\nAlso on Friday his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, announced on Facebook her withdrawal from the Maryland governor’s race “due to personal considerations.” She did not elaborate on the considerations or say if they were linked to her husband’s hopsitalization.\nRockeymoore Cummings was running against seven other candidates in a crowded contest to become the Democratic nominee and take on current Republican Governor Larry Hogan in November’s election.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Eric Walsh, Susan Thomas and David Gregorio\n ",
