    "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bank of the Ozarks (the “Bank”) (NASDAQ:OZRK) today announced that net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $146.2 million, a 66.5% increase from $87.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were a record $1.14, a 58.3% increase from $0.72 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year of 2017, net income was a record $421.9 million, a 56.3% increase from net income of $270.0 million for the full year of 2016. Diluted earnings per common share for the full year of 2017 were a record $3.35, a 29.8% increase from $2.58 for the full year of 2016.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, the Bank revalued its net deferred tax liability position to reflect the reduction in its federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This revaluation resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $49.8 million, or $0.39 of diluted earnings per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Bank’s annualized returns on average assets, average common stockholders’ equity and average tangible common stockholders’ equity for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 2.81%, 17.23% and 21.84%, respectively, compared to 1.92%, 12.62% and 17.08%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Bank’s returns on average assets, average common stockholders’ equity and average tangible common stockholders’ equity for the full year of 2017 were 2.15%, 13.49% and 17.49%, respectively, compared to 1.89%, 13.05% and 16.25%, respectively, for the full year of 2016. The calculation of the Bank’s return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity and the reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are included in the schedules accompanying this release.\nGeorge Gleason, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to report our excellent results for 2017, including annual records for net income, diluted earnings per share and net interest income, excellent asset quality and continued strong growth in both the funded and unfunded balance of our non-purchased loans.”\nKEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS\nTotal loans, including purchased loans, were $16.04 billion at December 31, 2017, a 10.2% increase from $14.56 billion at December 31, 2016.
