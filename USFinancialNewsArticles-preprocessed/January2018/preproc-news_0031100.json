    "text": "PHOENIX, Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Uptick Newswire “Stock Day” podcast keeps investors up to date on the latest penny stock news by bringing transparency in the micro-cap side of the market. Follow “Stock Day” and connect to over 600+ interviews from CEO’s on the OTC, Pink Sheets and micro-cap news from around the world by following “Stock Day” on YouTube, Google Play and iTunes. Everett Jolly, CEO and host of “Stock Day”, has been focusing on the industrial hemp industry and today Mr. Jolly welcomes back Mr. Howard Baer, advisor and consultant of Northsight Capital Inc. (OTCQB:NCAP) (“Northsight” or “Company”).\nRecently the Company has acquired Crush Mobile Apps to help further the development of Nothsight’s Joint Lovers dating site, which is specific to the cannabis industry. Crush Mobile Apps has close to 1 million members and Northsight is confident that this partnership may help attract more members to its proposed “Joint Lovers” Cannabis dating site that should be ready to launch in the next 6 to 8 weeks. Continuing the interview, Mr. Baer elaborates on the specific individualized screening process for what type of cannabis companies Northsight has its eyes on. With over 28,000 registered cannabis companies that may be looking for a future exit strategy there are some very strategic acquisitions available. Many of these companies cannot become public on their own, but can by joining Northsight’s growing media platform. Northsight is also seeking a new management group, including CEO and VP of Marketing. Mr. Jolly congratulated Mr. Baer on Northsight recently upgrading to the QB on the OTC Markets and asks how the Company plans on growing its revenues in 2018. An easy question for Mr. Baer since cannabis companies are Federally and socially regulated on where they can advertise. The company plans, through acquisition of additional cannabis media companies and qualified management, on building Northsight Capital into the lead media platform for all aspects of the cannabis industry.\nIn closing Mr. Baer states, “The Cannabis industry is one of the fasting growing in the country. Northsight’s goal is to continually add investor value through sales, revenue, growth and earnings.\nListen to the interview by clicking here or the following link: https://upticknewswire.com/featured-interview-founder-howard-baer-of-northsight-capital-inc-otcqb-ncap\nAbout Uptick Newswire and the “Stock Day Podcast”\nUptick Newswire is a private company reaching out to the masses keeping investors and shareholders up to date on company news and bringing transparency to the undervalued, undersold, micro-cap stocks of the market and is the sole producer of the Uptick Network “Stock Day” Podcast.
