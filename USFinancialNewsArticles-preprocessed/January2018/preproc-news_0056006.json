    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech (all times local):\n3:55 p.m.\nMany congressional Democrats are giving their guest passes for President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address to young immigrants known as \"Dreamers,\" who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nMore than 20 Dreamers are expected in the House gallery Tuesday night to put a face on the toll of the congressional stalemate on immigration policy.\nThey are the guests of high-profile Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and potential 2020 presidential candidates including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\nTrump ended Obama-era protections for such immigrants. He now says he wants to grant them a path to citizenship, but Congress has been unable to come up with a legislative solution for an issue at the center of the recent government shutdown.\n2:50 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump has told news anchors from all the major TV networks at a White House lunch that he is striving to bring the country together.\nJournalists from outlets including PBS, CNN and Fox News say Trump told the group Tuesday that there is \"tremendous divisiveness\" in the country that has existed for years.\nHe says if he could unite the country, he would consider it a great achievement.\nThe lunch is an annual White House tradition ahead of the president's State of the Union address.\nFox News host Bret Baier said on the \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino\" that the lunch menu featured smoked tomato soup, thyme roasted chicken and orange merengue pudding. Baier says the rest of the lunch was off the record.\n12:30 p.m.\nFour of the Supreme Court's nine justices are expected to attend the State of the Union address.\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch are expected at the speech. Roberts, Breyer and Kagan regularly attend, as do justices appointed by the president who is speaking. Trump nominated Gorsuch a year ago.\nAmong the justices who will not be in the audience, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito haven't attended a State of the Union speech in years. Alito last went in 2010, when he was captured on camera mouthing the words \"not true\" in response to President Barack Obama's criticism of the court's then new ruling in the Citizens United campaign finance case.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy's long-standing travel plans have him in California. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in Rhode Island and Justice Sonia Sotomayor is in Panama.\n12:18 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump's top economic and national security advisers help with his State of the Union address.\nA White House official says national security adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn contributed to the speech Trump plans to deliver Tuesday night at the Capitol. The official says they were assisted by policy adviser Stephen Miller, staff secretary Rob Porter and other speechwriters.\nThe official stressed that the speech is the president's and that Trump has spent months giving his aides \"tidbits\" on lines he wants to use.\nThe White House has said Trump will use the speech to discuss economy and national security, as well as trade, immigration and infrastructure.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss internal White House deliberations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n1:27 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump will herald a robust economy and push for bipartisan congressional action on immigration in Tuesday's State of the Union address.\nThe speech marks the ceremonial kickoff of Trump's second year in office and is traditionally a president's biggest platform to speak to the nation. However, Trump has redefined presidential communications with his high-octane, filter-free Twitter account and there's no guarantee that the carefully crafted speech will resonate beyond his next tweet.\nStill, White House officials are hopeful the president can use the prime-time address to Congress and millions of Americans watching at home to take credit for a soaring economy. Trump argues that the tax overhaul he signed into law late last year has boosted business confidence and will lead companies to reinvest in the United States.",
