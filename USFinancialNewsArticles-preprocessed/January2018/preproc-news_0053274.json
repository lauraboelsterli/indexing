Beesley has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Advisors. General Beesley will be responsible for spearheading the development and marketing of the Company’s cyber security platform for the defense industry.\n“I am pleased and honored to lend my abilities and networks to Optium Cyber Systems Inc. as they establish and develop the global standard for cyber security,” stated General Beesley. “Cyber security is a must for operations of all companies and individuals today and forever in the future. I am excited about the development involved and on-going future that has been laid out for Optium Cyber Systems. Every day great attention must be paid to operating on the global web in order to protect an individual and a company’s operations and reputation.
