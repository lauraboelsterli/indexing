But the government has insisted it is respecting due process and that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally.

Riyadh hopes to recover about $100 billion (£70.6 billion) of illicit funds and expects a small number to be prosecuted. \nIn late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official. \nAnother top businessman who has been held at the Ritz-Carlton is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE. A Saudi official told Reuters this week that he was negotiating a possible settlement but so far had not agreed on terms. \nThe attorney general’s statement said those who were released are free to move without restrictions.
