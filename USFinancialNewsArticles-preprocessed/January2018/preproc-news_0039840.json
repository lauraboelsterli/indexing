After that, the father and son will continue to work side-by-side, with Patrick O’Shaughnessy reporting to Jim O’Shaughnessy. They both will remain in their portfolio management roles at OSAM. Chris Meredith, CFA, will continue as OSAM’s Director of Research, and Chris Loveless will continue as the firm’s President, both reporting to Patrick.\n“More than twenty years after I founded the firm, it is my honor and privilege to name Patrick CEO of O’Shaughnessy Asset Management,” says Jim O’Shaughnessy, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, OSAM. “Patrick has enhanced our investment process, enriched our client service and opened new doors of opportunity for the firm. Now, he will lead our team as we expand upon what we have spent decades building – and pave the way for an even stronger future for OSAM and our clients.”\nIn his role as CEO, Patrick O’Shaughnessy will oversee the day-to-day business of the firm. He will direct OSAM’s initiatives in the areas of research and portfolio management, investor education and client service and relationships.\n“The asset management industry looks very different today than it did when OSAM started managing money in 1996,” says Patrick O’Shaughnessy, CEO, OSAM. “What hasn’t changed is our commitment to conducting the best new research we can on behalf of our clients – and to implementing our strategies with extreme discipline. These founding principles have been baked into our DNA for more than twenty years – and this history gives us a distinct advantage.\n“In the years – even decades – to come, we will focus on further improving our investment strategies, delivering an extraordinary and unique client experience grounded in transparency and education – and identifying new ways to use our research platform to help our clients engineer better overall portfolios. I am thrilled to have this opportunity to work with the entire OSAM team to achieve these perpetual goals,” adds Patrick O’Shaughnessy.\nAbout Patrick O’Shaughnessy\nPromoted to CEO from principal and portfolio manager Joined OSAM in 2007 Chartered Financial Analyst Author of Millennial Money: How Young Investors can Build a Fortune Patrick’s podcast, “Invest Like the Best,” has been downloaded more than two million times and was named among “5 Investment Podcasts You Should Listen To” by The Wall Street Journal Holds a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Notre Dame Lives in Greenwich, Conn., and is married with two children\nAbout O’Shaughnessy Asset Management\nBased in Stamford, Conn., O’Shaughnessy Asset Management (OSAM) is a quantitative money management firm that provides a broad range of equity portfolios to institutional investors and the high-net-worth clients of financial advisory firms and independent financial advisors.
