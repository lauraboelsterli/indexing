    "text": "LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - German government bond yields rose to their highest levels in over half a year as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said euro zone inflation should rise in the medium term.\nThe yield on 10-year German government bonds, the benchmark for the bloc, hit a 6-month high at 0.56 percent, unwinding earlier falls.\nGerman 2-year bond yields rose to their highest in over six months at minus 0.56 percent, up 3 basis points on the day.\nSouthern European bond yields also unwound earlier falls and all traded higher on the day, alongside other euro zone bond markets.
