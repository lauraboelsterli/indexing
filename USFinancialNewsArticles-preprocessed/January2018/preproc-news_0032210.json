Generally, the words \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"assumes,\" \"targets,\" \"goals,\" \"projects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors which are difficult to predict, may be beyond VEREIT's control and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. If a change occurs, VEREIT's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, VEREIT's expectation that it will file its and the Operating Partnership's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and host an earnings conference call on the announced date, and VEREIT's plans, market and other expectations, objectives, intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Additional factors that may affect future results are contained in VEREIT's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . VEREIT disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in these materials whether as a result of changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vereit-to-issue-2017-annual-report-and-host-earnings-conference-call-on-thursday-february-22-2018-300584186.html\nSOURCE VEREIT, Inc.",
