    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was a stable genius and that he eats good quality food.\nWhen asked by Britain’s ITV about his health and some perceptions that he was insane and physically unfit, Trump said: “I am a stable genius.”\nWhen asked about eating burgers and drinking Coke, Trump said: “I eat fine food, really from some of the finest chefs in the world, I eat healthy food, I also have some of that food on occasion... I think I eat actually quite well.”\nHe said he would consider staying in the Paris climate accord but that it would have to be a good deal for the United States.\nReporting by Andy MacAskill, editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
