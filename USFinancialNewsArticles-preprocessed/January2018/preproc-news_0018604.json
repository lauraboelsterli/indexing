    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - China’s new-energy vehicles (NEVs) are expected to see sales growth of around 40 percent in 2018, an industry association said on Thursday.\nSales of NEVs would definitely top 1 million vehicles this year, one official from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) told a press conference.\nChina’s finance ministry said in December it will extend a tax rebate on purchases of NEVs until the end of 2020, a boost for hybrid and electric car makers amid a shift by policy-makers away from the traditional internal combustion engines.
