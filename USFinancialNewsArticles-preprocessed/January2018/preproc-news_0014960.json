    "text": "President Donald Trump 's mental fitness for office is not up for debate, according to the president's personal physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson . \nThat's because Trump scored a perfect 30/30 on a test called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Jackson told the White House press corps on Tuesday. \nDeveloped in 1996, the MoCA uses 30 questions to test for mild cognitive impairment in adults. It takes about 10 minutes to do, and requires one administrator per test taker. The questions range from identifying certain kinds of animals, to repeating back specific sets of words. \nIf you want to take the test, find someone to administer it, and then have them c lick here to read the instructions for administering the MoCa. \nIf you're the test taker, here it is. \nGood luck.
