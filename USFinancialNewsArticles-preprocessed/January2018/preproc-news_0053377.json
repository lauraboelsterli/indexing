    "text": "Published: Jan 29, 2018 3:00 p.m. ET Share \nEuropean investment fund JAB Holding to become controlling shareholder in combined company Bloomberg News Cara Lombardo Zeke Turner \nThe maker of Keurig coffee machines is acquiring Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., a takeover that will give shareholders nearly $19 billion in cash, blur the lines between makers of hot and cold beverages and go down as the largest soft-drink deal ever. \nThe transaction is being driven by JAB, one of Europe’s biggest investment firms, which took control of Keurig two years ago and has spent more than $40 billion over the past decade to scoop up coffee and U.S. restaurant brands, including Peet’s Coffee, Panera Bread and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. \nThe complex transaction will give JAB control of a newly public company, Keurig Dr Pepper, that it could use to continue to strike additional deals and make investments, analysts said. Shareholders of Dr Pepper Snapple DPS, +24.45% will own about a 13% stake in the merged company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThe deal is estimated to be worth $18.9 billion, excluding debt, according to Dealogic, which said it would top the previous record for a soft-drink acquisition -- JAB’s 2015 takeover of Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion. \nThe combination gives Keurig, best known for its K-Cup coffee systems, an express lane to get its bottled coffee drinks into coolers at convenience stores, drugstores and other retailers at a time when ready-to-drink coffee sales are growing rapidly.",
