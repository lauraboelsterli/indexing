Manchester City vs Watford - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - January 2, 2018 Manchester City's Sergio Aguero in action with Watford's Molla Wague Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff \nAfter a goalless draw at Crystal Palace on Sunday ended their 18-match winning run, City, who lead second-placed Manchester United by 15 points, took 38 seconds to get in front when an unmarked Raheem Sterling turned in a low cross from Leroy Sane at the back post. \nBelgian Kevin De Bruyne had a free kick tipped on to the bar and it was his low cross in the 13th minute which was turned into his own net by Watford defender Christian Kabasele to make it 2-0. \nAndre Gray tested Ederson after a rare break from the visitors but City wrapped up victory in the 63rd minute when Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes fumbled a low De Bruyne cross and Sergio Aguero pounced to slot home the loose ball. \nGray got a consolation for Watford in the 82nd minute, slotting home a low cross from Andre Carillo.
