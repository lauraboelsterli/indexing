    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iraq will comply with the OPEC output reduction deal even though it is working hard to increase its oil export capacity from both the country’s south and north, its oil minister said on Monday.\nJabar al-Luaibi told a Chatham House conference in London Iraq’s total capacity has reached 5 million barrels per day (bpd), including 4.6 million bpd from the south.\nHe said Iraq hoped to more than double production from the northern Kirkuk oilfields with the help of BP.\nReporting by Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
