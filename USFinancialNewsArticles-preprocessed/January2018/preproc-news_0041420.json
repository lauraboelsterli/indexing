    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 11:30 AM / in 24 minutes Sri Lanka rupee slips on importer dollar demand Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee closed slightly weaker on Monday as dollar demand from importers and banks surpassed mild selling of the U.S. currency by exporters, dealers said. \nThe spot rupee ended at 154.00/10 per dollar, compared with Friday’s close of 153.90/154.00. \n“The demand (for dollars) from smaller banks was there today. The sellers were not willing to come down and sell,” said a currency dealer. \nThe rupee might witness volatility with the government’s heavy debt repayment this year, said dealers. \nSri Lanka raised $470.6 million on Thursday via development bonds, the central bank said, as the government faces unprecedented debt repayment this year. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans, and a total of $5.36 billion of interest. \nForeign investors had sold 3.2 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 10, central bank data showed. \nThe currency fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nThe central bank, while announcing its key economic policies for the year on Jan. 3, said it has allowed more flexibility in determining the exchange rate based on the present market conditions. \nIt added intervention policies will be adopted consistent with a flexible exchange rate regime and supportive of improving foreign exchange market functionality, and maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be an important objective.
