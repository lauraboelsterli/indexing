Adjusted diluted EPS in 2017 was $0.48, up 37% compared to 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss was $40 million and, as mentioned above, was affected by the $92 million charge for Venezuelan operations deconsolidation, the $123 million charge due to the U.S. Act and other tax legislation changes, as well as a $8 million charge on early redemption of notes. The adjusted net income was $197 million for the quarter, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.14, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating profit of Industrial Activities was $1,519 million for the full year 2017 compared to $1,291 million in 2016, with an operating margin of 5.8%, up 0.3 percentage points (\"p.p.\") compared to 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, operating profit of Industrial Activities was $468 million, compared to $412 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, with an operating margin of 6.0% (6.2% in 2016).\nFor the full year 2017, income taxes were $455 million ($298 million in 2016), including the $123 million non-cash tax charge. Adjusted income taxes (1)(2) for the full year 2017 were $348 million ($265 million in 2016). The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) (1)(2) improved by 2 p.p. to 37%, when compared to 2016. For 2018, we expect the adjusted ETR to be in the range of 30% to 32%, reflecting the positive impact of the recently enacted rate reductions in the U.S. and several other jurisdictions.\nNet industrial debt was reduced to $0.9 billion at December 31, 2017, down $1.7 billion and $0.7 billion compared to September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, as a result of strong cash flow performance mainly arising from reduced working capital levels. Total debt was $25.9 billion at December 31, 2017, up $0.6 billion compared to December 31, 2016, with third party debt in Industrial Activities down $0.2 billion from December 31, 2016 to $6.5 billion (or down $0.8 billion at constant currency).

Operating profit of Financial Services (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as revenues less selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and certain other operating expenses.\nAgricultural Equipment 's net sales increased 10% for the full year 2017 compared to 2016 (up 8% on a constant currency basis). In LATAM, the increase was mainly due to higher industry volume, market share gains, a favorable mix of higher horsepower products and net price realization. Net sales increased in APAC mainly driven by favorable volume in Australia, Russia and South East Asia. In EMEA, net sales increased due to higher industry volume, a favorable product mix and net price realization. In NAFTA, net sales decreased as a result of de-stocking actions in our dealer network, primarily with the high horsepower tractors and the hay and forage product lines. NAFTA industry volumes were flat overall, with the row crop sector higher, offset by lower livestock sector volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Agricultural Equipment's net sales increased 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 11% on a constant currency basis). Net sales increased in EMEA, primarily driven by higher combine sales in preparation of the 2018 season and positive price realization. Net sales also increased in APAC and in LATAM. In NAFTA, net sales were flat.\nFull year 2017 operating profit was $949 million, a 16% increase compared to $818 million in 2016, mainly due to the favorable volume and product mix in all regions except NAFTA. One percent net price realization more than offset increases in raw material cost and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. Agricultural Equipment also increased spending in research and development, primarily related to our new precision farming solutions, and in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily associated with the increased sales activity. Operating margin increased 0.4 p.p. to 8.5%. In the fourth quarter of 2017, operating profit was $279 million ($272 million in the fourth quarter of 2016), with an operating margin of 8.6% (operating margin of 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016). Favorable volume, net price realization and lower warranty costs were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix, higher manufacturing costs in EMEA as a result of the transition to new regulatory requirements and an overall increase in research and development spending.\nConstruction Equipment 's net sales increased 14% in the full year 2017 compared to 2016 (up 13% on a constant currency basis), due to higher industry volume in all regions except EMEA, and net price realization, primarily in NAFTA and LATAM. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 33% on a constant currency basis), driven by market growth in all regions.\nFull year 2017 operating profit was $21 million compared to $2 million in 2016, with an operating margin of 0.8% (up 0.7 p.p. compared to 2016). The increase was due to higher volume including a positive overhead absorption and net price realization, partially offset by increases in raw material cost, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts on product components, and increased production costs. In the fourth quarter of 2017, operating profit was $13 million compared to an operating loss of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Higher industry volume and positive price realization, partially offset by ramp-up costs to accommodate increased production (up more than 50% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2016), to meet retail sales in the quarter, led to these improved results. Operating margin increased 6.9 p.p. to 1.7%. The global order book in Construction Equipment remains solid with an increase year-over-year of over 30%.\nCommercial Vehicles ' net sales increased 9% in the full year 2017 compared to 2016 (up 7% on a constant currency basis) as result of higher truck and bus sales in EMEA, higher volume and mix in APAC, and recovering truck sales in LATAM, mainly in Argentina. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 8% on a constant currency basis). In EMEA and APAC, net sales increased primarily as a result of higher volume and favorable mix. In LATAM, net sales were flat.\nFull year 2017 operating profit was $272 million compared to $333 million in 2016, with an operating margin of 2.6% (down 0.9 p.p. compared to 2016). Operating profit increased in LATAM and APAC, mainly due to higher volume and favorable pricing. In EMEA, operating profit decreased as favorable volumes were more than offset by unfavorable mix, primarily associated with fleet-related channel sales, Euro 6 emission content costs, and the negative impact of the British pound devaluation. Increased spending in research and development on new product programs was more than offset by favorable manufacturing efficiencies. In the fourth quarter of 2017, operating profit was $94 million ($131 million in the fourth quarter of 2016), with an operating margin of 2.9% (down 1.8 p.p. compared to the fourth quarter of 2016). Favorable volume was more than offset by unfavorable mix, primarily associated with fleet-related channel sales, increases in product content costs and new product introductions, higher spending in research and development, and the unfavorable impact of the British pound devaluation.\nPowertrain 's net sales increased 18% in the full year 2017 compared to 2016 (up 16% on a constant currency basis), due to higher volumes. Sales to external customers accounted for 48% of total net sales (47% in 2016). In the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 13% on a constant currency basis), due to higher sales volumes to both captive and external customers.\nFull year 2017 operating profit was $362 million, a $130 million increase compared to 2016, with an operating margin of 8.3%, up 2.0 p.p. compared to 2016. The improvement was due to higher volumes and manufacturing efficiencies. In the fourth quarter of 2017, operating profit was $102 million, a $41 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, as result of higher volumes, favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Operating margin increased 2.4 p.p. to 8.8%, the highest quarterly margin ever reported in Powertrain's history, reflecting the profitability of a well-balanced portfolio of engine applications.\nFinancial Services ' revenues totaled $1,625 million in the full year 2017, an increase of 4% compared to 2016 (up 1% on a constant currency basis), due to higher activity in all regions except NAFTA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues totaled $420 million, an increase of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 3% on a constant currency basis).\nIn 2017, retail loan originations (including unconsolidated joint ventures) were $9.1 billion, flat compared to 2016. The managed portfolio (including unconsolidated joint ventures) of $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 (of which retail was 61% and wholesale 39%) increased $2.0 billion compared to December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the managed portfolio increased $0.6 billion compared to 2016.\nFull year 2017 net income was $452 million, a $118 million increase compared to 2016 primarily attributable to an improvement in income taxes as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities following the U.S. Act enactment. Excluding the favorable tax impact, net income was flat compared to 2016, as stronger performances in the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions were offset by a weaker result in NAFTA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net income was $192 million, an increase of $109 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly attributable to the revaluation of the U.S. deferred tax liabilities.\nDividends and Share Buy-back\nThe Board of Directors of CNH Industrial N.V. intends to recommend to the Company's shareholders a dividend of €0.14 per common share, representing an increase of 27% over the prior year dividend, and totaling approximately €191 million ($237 million). Subject to the approval of the upcoming Annual General Meeting (expected on April 13, 2018), the exdividend date would be set at April 23, 2018.\nThe Board of Directors also intends to recommend to the Company's shareholders the renewal of the authorization to repurchase up to a maximum of 10% of the Company's issued common shares. After such authorization and subject to general and market conditions, the Company intends to launch a buy-back program up to $700 million, representing an increase of $400 million versus the current program.\nNeither the renewal of the authorization, nor the launch of the program obliges the Company to repurchase any common shares and the program may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason and without previous notice, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n2018 Outlook\nWorldwide demand for agricultural equipment is expected to improve with all regions flat to up 5% on average. Farm incomes are expected to remain stable, leading to no significant changes in planted acreage. Construction equipment demand is forecasted to be up 5-10% in LATAM and APAC while remaining relatively flat to up slightly in EMEA and NAFTA. Commercial vehicle demand is expected to be up about 15% in LATAM and flat to slightly down in EMEA and APAC.\nAs a result of the forecasted improvement in product demand conditions, and the positive impact of changes in the Company's capital structure, the Company is setting its full year 2018 guidance as follows:\nNet sales of Industrial Activities of $27 billion to $28 billion; Adjusted diluted EPS (1) of $0.63 to $0.67; Net industrial debt at the end of 2018 at $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion.\n(1)\nOutlook is not provided on diluted EPS, the most comparable GAAP financial measure of this non-GAAP financial measure, as the income or expense excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS and instead included in the calculation of diluted EPS are, by definition, not predictable and uncertain.\nAbout CNH Industrial\nCNH Industrial N.V.

More information can be found on the corporate website: www.cnhindustrial.com\nAdditional Information\nToday, at 4:00 p.m. CET / 3:00 p.m. GMT / 10:00 a.m. EST, management will hold a conference call to present 2017 fourth quarter and full year results. The call can be followed live online at: http://bit.ly/CNH_Industrial_FY_Q4_2017 and a recording will be available later on the Company's website ( www.cnhindustrial.com ). A presentation will be made available on the CNH Industrial website prior to the conference call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nCNH Industrial monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH Industrial's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its results and allow management and investors to assess CNH Industrial's operating trends, financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning presented in U.S. GAAP or EU-IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences between the companies in calculations. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and they should not be considered as substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and/or EU-IFRS.\nCNH Industrial non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:\nOperating Profit under U.S. GAAP: Operating Profit of Industrial Activities is defined as net sales less cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. Operating Profit of Financial Services is defined as revenues less selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and certain other operating expenses. Trading Profit under EU-IFRS: Trading Profit is derived from financial information prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS and is defined as net revenues less cost of sales, selling, general and administrative costs, research and development costs, and other operating income and expenses. Operating Profit under EU-IFRS: Operating Profit under EU-IFRS is computed starting from Trading Profit under EU-IFRS plus/minus restructuring costs, other income (expenses) that are unusual in the ordinary course of business (such as gains and losses on the disposal of investments and other unusual items arising from infrequent external events or market conditions). Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities. Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH Industrial share-based payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end. Adjusted Income Taxes: is defined as income taxes less the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items and non-recurring tax charges. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a) adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less restructuring expenses and non-recurring items. Net Debt and Net Debt of Industrial Activities (or Net Industrial Debt): Net Debt is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and derivative hedging debt. CNH Industrial provides the reconciliation of Net Debt to Total Debt, which is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities using Net Debt of Industrial Activities. Available Liquidity: is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash and undrawn committed facilities. Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH Industrial discusses the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nForward-looking statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this earning release including statements regarding our competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements.
