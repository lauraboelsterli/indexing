    "text": "  Updated 6 minutes ago Biathlon: Frenchman Fourcade wins last race before Olympics Reuters Staff 1   France’s Martin Fourcade underlined his Olympic biathlon credentials when he won the last race before the Pyeongchang Games, the mass start in Antholz-Anterselva in Italy on Sunday. \nFourcade, the World Cup overall leader, made two mistakes at the first shooting session, before getting his composure back and taking a comfortable victory. His main rival, Norway’s Johannes Boe, finished a distant sixth. \nThe 29-year-old, who already has two Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles, snatched his 15th podium finish in as many World Cup races this season. \n“I raced smartly, and I even spared myself for the last lap but I didn’t even need that energy,” said Fourcade.
