    "text": "KIEV, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has nominated acting central bank chief Yakiv Smoliy to be governor on a permanent basis, parliament’s website showed on Thursday, ending months of uncertainty after the resignation of Smoliy’s predecessor.\nIt is Poroshenko’s duty to nominate the head of the central bank, but his choice of Smoliy must be approved by lawmakers who are meeting on Friday for a final session before a three-week recess.\nIt is not yet clear if they will vote on the nomination on Friday.\nReporting by Natalia Zinets and Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
