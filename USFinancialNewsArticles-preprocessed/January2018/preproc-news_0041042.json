Together, they will deliver a broad range of investment banking services including public offerings, private placements and financial advisory services for emerging and established companies in the cannabis industry.\nShannon Soqui has close to two decades of investment banking and advisory experience, with deep industry relationships and robust transaction and advisory experience.
