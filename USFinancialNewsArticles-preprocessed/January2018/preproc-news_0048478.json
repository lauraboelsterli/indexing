    "text": "ABU DHABI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank posted a 7 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit on Sunday, bolstered by a rise in net interest and Islamic financing income.\nThe emirate’s second-largest bank by assets made a net profit attributable to shareholders of 1.07 billion dirhams ($291.3 million) in the three months to Dec.31, compared to 1.0 billion dirhams in the fourth quarter of the previous year, according to its financial statement.\nSICO Bahrain and EFG Hermes forecast a fourth quarter profit of 942.5 million dirhams and 1.17 billion dirhams, respectively.\nADCB’s board proposed a dividend of 42 percent of the bank’s capital for 2017, compared to 40 percent in 2016.\nNet interest and Islamic financing income reached 1.72 billion dirhams during the quarter, up by 9 percent from the same period of the previous year.
