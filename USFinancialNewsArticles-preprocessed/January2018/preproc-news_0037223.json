He   with monetary policy views closely aligned with Yellen's.\nHe has served on the Fed's board since 2012 and over time became increasingly supportive of the consensus forged by Yellen for gradual interest rate increases, a slow but steady decrease in the asset holdings the Fed accumulated in fighting the crisis, and a stated willingness to take extraordinary steps again if crisis re-emerges.\n  He later came to see Yellen's go slow approach as important to helping the jobs market recover, and to share her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious   hiked rates three   (Reporting by Howard Schneider; editing by Tim Ahmann, Phil Berlowitz and Tom Brown)",
