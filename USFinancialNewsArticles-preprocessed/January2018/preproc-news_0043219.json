    "text": "(Reuters) - The president of Michigan State University said on Wednesday she is tendering her resignation after facing a barrage of criticism for not doing enough to halt the abuse by a doctor who worked at the school and was convicted of molesting U.S. gymnasts.\n“As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger,” Lou Anna Simon said in a resignation letter.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
