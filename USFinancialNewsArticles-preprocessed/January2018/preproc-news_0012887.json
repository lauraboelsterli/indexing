The NCD is expected to be finalized during the first quarter of 2018. Grew the biopharma business with new and expanded collaborations for molecular information solutions including companion diagnostics, molecular profiling, data insights, and biomarker discovery. Presented validation data for a novel assay measuring tumor mutational burden in blood (bTMB) providing evidence that response to immunotherapy can be predicted using a blood sample. Based on these findings, Foundation Medicine’s bTMB assay is being integrated as part of Roche/Genentech's prospective, randomized Phase III Blood First Assay Screening Trial (BFAST) as a companion diagnostic assay investigating the use of bTMB as a non-invasive biomarker of response to first-line atezolizumab in advanced NSCLC patients. Received approval from the State of New York Department of Health for FoundationACT ® , the company’s liquid biopsy assay. Announced a collaboration with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to identify patients for its Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) study. Announced a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group to identify patients for the NCI-Match (Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice) study. Increased FoundationCORE™, the company’s molecular information database, to nearly 180,000 clinical cases. Expanded the company’s global footprint and patient access to personalized healthcare by commencing operations at the company’s laboratory in Penzberg, Germany. The Penzberg location is supporting continued growth and expansion in Europe through the company’s commercial collaboration with Roche.
