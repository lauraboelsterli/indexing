    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Altice, the telecoms and cable group in the middle of a restructuring aimed at cutting its debt, said it was reducing its share capital in a move that could help to improve its overall returns.\nAltice said it would cancel 370,000,000 common shares A, in addition to the 416,000,000 common shares A and 1,307,716 common shares B it had resolved to cancel on Dec. 4, 2017.\nEarlier this month, Altice said it would spin off its U.S. arm, which owns the countryâ€™s No.4 cable operator, to existing investors, and would prioritize efforts to turn around its European operations including French telecoms operator SFR.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
