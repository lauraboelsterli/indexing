    "text": "Ametek : \"What I want to tell you is don't sell. Don't sell. I actually had been working on a big piece about it, so it kind of took the thunder out of things, but you've got a winner there.\"\nHormel Foods : \"Hormel and Smucker are both working here. I like Hormel. And I'm also going to throw in General Mills. That's a twofer.\"\nApplied Materials : \"It sold off because people feel that there's not enough demand now for flash and that DRAMs are going to fall. I say that it's spent enough time in the wilderness and it's OK to buy.\"\nNabors Industries : \"That's the worst one of them, but the chart's good. I guess it can go to $9 if oil goes to $65.\"\nSouthern Co. : \"Not crazy about Southern. I don't like that nuclear power stuff. Why don't you upgrade to AEP ?\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Don't sell the stock of Ametek. It's a winner 20 Hours Ago | 02:54 ",
