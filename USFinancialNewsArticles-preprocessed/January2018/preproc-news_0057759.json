    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 7:29 AM / in 7 hours Earthquake kills child, injures dozens in Pakistan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nKABUL (Reuters) - A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck northeast Afghanistan on Wednesday, shaking large parts of the region and killing a child and injuring several people in neighboring Pakistan, officials said. \nThe quake, which rattled buildings in the Afghan capital and was also felt in parts of India, struck 270 km (167 miles) northeast of Kabul in the Hindu Kush mountains, at a depth of 180 km, the European Mediterranean Seismological Center said. \nA baby girl was killed and 10 people were injured when roofs of mud-walled houses collapsed in the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, a district deputy chief, Shabbir Megnal, said. \nThere were no immediate reports of any serious damage or casualties in Afghanistan. \nLarge parts of the region are seismically active because a tectonic plate, known as the Indian plate, is pushing north into the Eurasian plate. \nA 7.6-magnitude quake in northern Pakistan in October 2005 killed about 75,000 people.
