The distinction recognizes the U.S. companies which are succeeding in building a happier culture and positive work environment for their employees.\nThe list includes well-known companies including American Express, Apple, Microsoft and Nike, as well as other large and mid-size companies. \nFor this year's happiest companies list, CareerBliss analyzed data from more than 41,000 independent employee reviews. The CareerBliss board of workplace PhD advisors, which include experts in organizational behavior, psychology and computer science, determined 10 key factors that determine workplace happiness: company culture, growth opportunities, people you work with, person you work for, rewards you receive, support you get, the way you work, work setting, CEO rating and overall company rating. \nReviews are then quantified into what the website calls a \"BlissScore\" with five being the most positive score and one being the least positive.\n\"Our data shows that happiness can impact productivity, employee loyalty and overall employee success,\" CareerBliss CEO Heidi Golledge told CNBC Make It in a statement. \"Happiness at work should be one of the first factors we account for when thinking about who we want to work for and how we want to work.\"\nGolledge adds that happiness is a metric which can be used to help employers and employees alike determine the best company for their individual needs. \nHere are 25 companies with the happiest employees, along with average salaries and CEO approval ratings, according to CareerBliss:\n25.
