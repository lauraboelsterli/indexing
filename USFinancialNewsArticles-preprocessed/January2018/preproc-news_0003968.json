(TSX: CCA) announced today that its subsidiary Atlantic Broadband has completed the acquisition of cable systems owned by Harron Communications, L.P. and operating under the MetroCast brand name (“MetroCast”).\nAtlantic Broadband raised US$1.85 billion of secured debt through a combination of term loan B and revolving credit facility financings as well as US$315 million of equity through an investment by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) for a 21% interest in Atlantic Broadband’s holding company.
