    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CorVel Corporation (NASDAQ:CRVL) announced the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $141 million, an increase of 10% from revenues of $128 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $0.50, an increase of 39% from earnings per share of $0.36 in the same quarter of the prior year.\nRevenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 were $415 million, up 8% from $385 million in the same period of the prior year. Earnings per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.41 and were $1.09 for the same period of the prior year.\nRevenue growth for the quarter was driven by an increase in the Company’s claims management services. The successful implementation and evolution of the Company’s adjuster interface, Care MC Edge SM , has gained interest in the marketplace. The Company’s Network Solutions sold in the wholesale market increased revenues as well. The solutions, particularly in the CERiS segment, continue to expand services into the clinical and coding areas of line item hospital bill payment integrity.\nThe Company is launching a Managed Accounts Payable Automation service under its Symbeo business franchise. The Treasury and fulfillment service under Symbeo eliminates the manual functions associated with preparing invoices for payment. The Company remains committed to the strategy of using technology to differentiate the solutions delivered to customers, integrating previously siloed information to improve financial and healthcare outcomes.\nA bout CorVel\nCorVel Corporation is a national provider of innovative workers’ compensation, liability, auto, and health solutions for employers, insurance companies, third party administrators and government agencies seeking to control costs and promote positive outcomes.
