On a sequential basis, Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group (AMS) revenues increased 37.4% led by the Imaging Product Division which registered, as expected, triple-digit sequential growth. Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG) revenues were up 5.9% and Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group (MDG) revenues increased 5.6%.\nOn a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased by 32.6% on double-digit growth across all product groups with strong traction of new products. Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group (AMS) fourth quarter revenues grew 70.1% year-over-year due to triple-digit growth in Imaging, a sharp recovery in Analog and solid growth in MEMS. Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group (MDG) fourth quarter revenues grew 21.4% year-over-year on very strong growth for general purpose microcontrollers, in part offset by lower sales of businesses undergoing phase-out. Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG) fourth quarter revenues increased 14.6% compared to the year-ago quarter on strong results for both Automotive and Power Discrete.\nBy region of shipment, revenues grew on a sequential basis across all regions. Specifically, Asia Pacific revenues grew by 24.5%, EMEA increased by 2.2% and the Americas was up by 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, Asia Pacific revenues were up by 43.1%, EMEA increased by 21.5% and the Americas grew by 8.0%.\nFourth quarter gross profit was $1.00 billion and gross margin was 40.6%. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased 110 basis points due to improved product mix and increased manufacturing efficiency, partially offset mainly by normal price pressure and negative currency effects, net of hedging. Gross margin increased 310 basis points year-over-year largely driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and better product mix partially offset mainly by normal price pressure as well as negative currency effects, net of hedging.\nCombined R&D and SG&A expenses were $592 million compared to $558 million and $570 million in the prior and year-ago quarter, respectively, increasing mainly due to seasonality and inflationary dynamics.\nFourth quarter other income and expenses, net, registered income of $18 million compared to $5 million in the prior quarter due to higher than anticipated R&D funding.\nImpairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter were $20 million compared to $14 million and $24 million in the prior and year-ago quarter, respectively, mainly related to the set-top box restructuring plan announced in January 2016.\nOperating income in the fourth quarter rose sharply on a sequential and year-over-year basis to $408 million compared to $278 million and $129 million in the prior quarter and year-ago quarter, respectively. By product group, MDG operating margin increased to 19.6% from 17.9% in the prior quarter. ADG operating margin improved to 12.3% compared to 10.9% in the prior quarter. AMS operating margin expanded to 20.9% from 13.2% in the prior quarter, benefiting from an improved product mix, as well as leveraging higher revenues and improved manufacturing performance.\nFourth quarter operating income before impairment and restructuring charges (1) increased sequentially by $136 million to $428 million, equivalent to 17.3% of net revenues, driven by a higher level of revenues and improved gross margin and resulted in a return on invested capital of 35.7%. On a year-over-year basis, operating income before impairment and restructuring charges (1) increased by $275 million reflecting higher revenues, manufacturing efficiencies and improved product mix.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $46 million as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States. This charge results from the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter net income increased significantly both on a sequential and year-over-year basis to $308 million, or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $236 million, or $0.26 diluted earnings per share, in the prior quarter and net income of $112 million, or $0.13 diluted earnings per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n(1) Non-U.S. GAAP measure. See Appendix for additional information and reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.\nFull Year 2017 Review\nNet revenues for the full year 2017 increased 19.7% to $8.35 billion from $6.97 billion in 2016.

Gross margin improved by 400 basis points to 39.2% from 35.2% in full year 2016. Specifically, the 2017 gross margin benefited from manufacturing efficiencies, better product mix, and improved fab loading partially offset by normal price pressure.\nCombined R&D and SG&A expenses increased 1.7% to $2.29 billion in 2017 compared to $2.25 billion in 2016.\nOther income and expenses, net, registered income of $55 million in 2017 compared to $99 million in 2016 mainly due to a lower level of R&D grants.\nIn 2017, impairment and restructuring charges were $45 million compared to $93 million in 2016, mostly related to the set-top box restructuring plan.\nOperating income in 2017 improved by $779 million to $993 million compared to 2016.\nFull year 2017 operating income and operating margin before impairment and restructuring charges (1) increased sharply to $1.04 billion, equivalent to 12.4% of net revenues, compared to $307 million, equivalent to 4.4% of net revenues in 2016, on higher revenues, gross margin expansion and strong operating leverage.\nIncome tax expense in 2017 was $143 million, including the one-time impact related to tax reform in the United States, reflecting an effective tax rate of 15.0%.\nFull year 2017 net income was $802 million, or $0.89 fully diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $165 million, or $0.19 fully diluted earnings per share for the full year 2016.\n(1) Non-U.S. GAAP measure. See Appendix for additional information and reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet Highlights\nReflecting the strong growth in revenues and improvement in operating profitability, net cash from operating activities was $587 million and $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. Full Year 2016 net cash from operating activities was $1.04 billion.\nCapital expenditure payments, net of proceeds from sales, were $407 million and $1.30 billion during the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively. Full year 2016 capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales, were $607 million.\nFree cash flow (1) was $145 million and $338 million during the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, favorably impacted by improved operating results and higher than expected revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year 2016 free cash flow was $316 million.\nInventory was $1.33 billion at December 31, 2017. Inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017 was at 4.4 turns or 82 days compared to 3.9 turns or 92 days in the third quarter.\nThe Company paid cash dividends to shareholders of $54 million and $214 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. In addition, the Company launched and completed over the course of 2017, a share buy-back program of 18.6 million shares for an aggregate amount of $297 million.\nST's net financial position (1) was $489 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $446 million at September 30, 2017. At December 31, 2017, ST's total financial resources were $2.19 billion; total financial debt was $1.70 billion; and total equity, including non-controlling interest, was $5.47 billion.\nIn 2017, ST issued a $1.5 billion dual-tranche offering at 0% of new senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2022 and 2024. The proceeds, net of the cost of the share buyback, were partially used to early redeem, via net share settlement, both the 2019 and the 2021 convertible bonds issued in 2014 for a total of $1 billion and 26.8 million shares from Treasury stock. As of the end of the year, the Company has significantly reduced its overall cash cost of debt to 0.44%.\n(1) Non-U.S. GAAP measure. See Appendix for additional information and reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nMr. Bozotti commented, \"We exited 2017 with very strong revenue growth, and significant improvement in our operating profitability and net income. In 2018, our objective is to leverage our achievements to continue to drive sustainable and profitable growth thanks to our product leadership.\n\"We continue to see solid demand across product groups and geographies and in the first quarter we anticipate a better than seasonal trend for Smart Driving and Internet of Things applications, and the unfavorable seasonal dynamics for smartphone applications. Based upon that, as well as our much stronger than expected revenue growth in the previous quarter, we anticipate first quarter revenues to decrease by about 10% on a sequential basis, representing year-over-year growth of about 22% at the mid-point of our guidance range. We expect the gross margin to decrease to about 39.5% at the mid-point.\n\"In order to support our anticipated product portfolio mix and to fuel strong revenue growth in the second half of 2018 compared to the first half, we expect to invest this year approximately $1.0 to $1.1 billion. \"\nThe Company expects first quarter 2018 revenues to decrease about 10% on a sequential basis, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Gross margin in the first quarter is expected to be about 39.5% plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.\nThis outlook is based on an assumed effective currency exchange rate of approximately $1.18 = €1.00 for the 2018 first quarter and includes the impact of existing hedging contracts. The first quarter will close on March 31, 2018.\nRecent Corporate Developments\nOn November 22, ST has been awarded a position on 2017 \"A\" List for water and \"A-\" List for climate change by CDP, the non-profit global environmental disclosure platform.

S. GAAP - Non-U.S. GAAP Reconciliation\nIn Million US$ Except Per Share Data\nThe supplemental non-U.S. GAAP information presented in this press release is unaudited and subject to inherent limitations. Such non-U.S. GAAP information is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measurements. Also, our supplemental non-U.S. GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled non-U.S. GAAP measures used by other companies. Further, specific limitations for individual non-U.S. GAAP measures, and the reasons for presenting non-U.S. GAAP financial information, are set forth in the paragraphs below. To compensate for these limitations, the supplemental non-U.S. GAAP financial information should not be read in isolation, but only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOperating income (loss) before impairment and restructuring charges and one-time items is used by management to help enhance an understanding of ongoing operations and to communicate the impact of the excluded items, such as impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs. Adjusted net earnings and earnings per share (EPS) are used by management to help enhance an understanding of ongoing operations and to communicate the impact of the excluded items like impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs attributable to ST and other one-time items, net of the relevant tax impact.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information for investors and management because they measure the Company's capacity to generate profits from its business operations, excluding the effect of acquisitions and expenses related to the rationalizing of its activities and sites that it does not consider to be part of its on-going operating results, thereby offering, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financials, (i) the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's on-going operating results, (ii) the ability to better identify trends in the Company's business and perform related trend analysis, and (iii) an easier way to compare the Company's results of operations against investor and analyst financial models and valuations, which usually exclude these items.\nQ4 2017\n(US$ millions, except per share data ($)) Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings Corresponding EPS U.S. GAAP 1,002 408 308 0.34 Impairment & Restructuring 20 20 Estimated Income Tax Effect (1) Non-U.S GAAP 1,002 428 327 0.36\nQ3 2017\n(US$ million, except per share data ($)) Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings Corresponding EPS U.S. GAAP 845 278 236 0.26 Impairment & Restructuring 14 14 Estimated Income Tax Effect (1) Non-U.S GAAP 845 292 249 0.28\nQ4 2016\n(US$ millions, except per share data ($)) Gross Profit Operating Income Net Earnings\nCorresponding EPS U.S. GAAP 698 129 112 0.13 Impairment & Restructuring 24 24 Estimated Income Tax Effect 1 Non-U.S GAAP 698 153 137 0.15\n(Appendix - continued)\nNet financial position: resources (debt), represents the balance between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, and our total financial debt includes short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, all as reported in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe our net financial position provides useful information for investors and management because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net indebtedness or net cash position by measuring our capital resources based on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness. Net financial position is not a U.S. GAAP measure.\nNet Financial Position (in US$ millions) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 1,759 2,188 1,629 Marketable securities 431 433 335 Total financial resources 2,190 2,621 1,964 Short-term debt (118) (486) (117) Long-term debt (1,583) (1,689) (1,334) Total financial debt (1,701) (2,175) (1,451) Net financial position - Non-U.S. GAAP 489 446 513 Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities minus net cash from (used in) investing activities, excluding payment for purchases (proceeds from the sale of) marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash. We believe free cash flow provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operating activities. Free cash flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. In addition, our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nFree cash flow (in US$ millions) Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 FY 2017 Q4 2016 Q3 2016 Q2 2016 Q1 2016 FY 2016 Net cash from operating activities 587 463 369 289 1,707 378 332 192 141 1,043 Net cash used in investing activities (442) (482) (317) (227) (1,468) (243) (230) (144) (110) (727) Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities, investment in short-term deposits, restricted cash - 99 - - 99 - - - - - Free cash flow - Non-U.S. GAAP 145 80 52 62 338 135 102 48 31 316 Attachments:\nhttp://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/78ef2b15-56ef-42b4-8ec0-bf2b7e0fcf24\nSource:STMicroelectronics N.V.",
