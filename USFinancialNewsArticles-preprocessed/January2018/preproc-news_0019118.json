However, Trump, who has vowed to scrap the pact, was expected to give the U.S. Congress and European allies a deadline for improving it, the person said.\nTrump canceled a trip to London scheduled for next month to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse what he understood was an Obama-era decision to move out of the old one.\nThe search for survivors from a devastating Southern California mudslide that has killed at least 17 people moved into its third day, with some 700 rescue workers expecting to find more dead victims.\nPakistan\nA surprise New Year’s Day tweet by President Donald Trump in which he appeared to decree an end to U.S. aid for Pakistan, sent U.S. officials scrambling to suspend security assistance without even knowing how much aid they were freezing, four U.S. officials said.\nPakistan’s army chief told a top U.S. general the nation “ felt betrayed” at criticism that it was not doing enough to fight terrorism, the military said, after Trump accused Pakistan of “lies and deceit”.\nSpecial report\nFormer workers describe troubling practices at a mortuary-body broker, including allegations of deceptive marketing and an account of how gold dental work was removed from corpses and sold. Authorities are now investigating.\nThe body trade : Read the full series\nWorld\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed after all-night talks to a blueprint for formal coalition negotiations , party sources said, raising prospects of an end to months of political uncertainty.\nTunisian authorities arrested another 150 people including local opposition leaders over unrest against price and tax rises that prompted troop deployments to restive towns, and activists called for renewed rallies at the weekend.\nThe European Union and Turkey will see no progress in their relations as long as Turkey holds journalists in prison, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said.\nAn increased offensive in Syria’s rebel-held Idlib province will spark a new migration wave , Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said, calling on Russia and Iran to warn Syrian authorities over attacks.\nReuters TV : Ecuador grants Julian Assange citizenship\nKhansa, the Singapore Zoo's 46th orangutan baby, clings to its mother Anita during a media tour to showcase newborn animals at the Singapore Zoo January 11, 2018.
