( bit.ly/2DiQNQ4 ) \nLast month, Smiths Falls-based Canopy said it would supply cannabis to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The company also said it would establish a production facility in the province capable of producing 12,000 kg of marijuana per year. \nCanopy Growthâ€™s expansion comes as Canada is set to legalize recreational marijuana by July, becoming the second country in the world to do so after Uruguay.
