    "text": " 09 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Zidane still motivated to manage crisis-hit Madrid Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Embattled Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said on Friday that he would resign immediately if he felt he was no longer able to get through to his players at the crisis-hit club. \nThe stumbling European and Spanish champions were sent packing from the King’s Cup by Madrid minnows Leganes after losing 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. \nThey sit fourth in the league standings, a remarkable 19 points adrift of runaway leaders Barcelona. \n“If I thought my message wasn’t getting through I would leave here tomorrow,” Zidane told a news conference ahead of Real’s game away to Valencia on Saturday. \nThe Frenchman was only recently hailed as a master manager of Madrid’s famously tempestuous dressing room for leading the team to historic back-to-back Champions League triumphs as well as ending a five-year wait for a league title. \nHis qualities as a coach have been thrown into doubt this season, however, as he has been unable to resuscitate his side, who have lost three and drawn two of their last eight games in all competitions. \nReal’s only realistic chance of saving their woeful season is in the Champions League, where they face runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris St Germain in the last 16. \n“Football is full of good and bad moments and I have to try and turn this situation around and I still feel strong,” Zidane added. \n”If I didn‘t, then there would be a problem. I am going to try and continue doing this job with hope and keep trying to improve as a coach. No-one is going to take away my enjoyment of working until the last day. \n“It’s the same for the players, this is not their fault. There are many factors to consider, not just the result.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis",
