According to that document, which has not been independently verified by Apple, the company will charge customers $29 for a battery replacement on all out-of-warranty iPhone 6 or newer handsets that are not otherwise damaged. \nAccording to 9to5Mac, which earlier reported on the move, some consumers say they visited Apple Stores and were not allowed to get a $29 iPhone battery replacement because their batteries were “ineligible.” In those cases, Apple Store employees performed a diagnostic test on the respective iPhone’s battery and because it had greater than 80% capacity left, some employees said it wouldn’t qualify, according to the report. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nNow, though, Apple has apparently changed that and will allow anyone with the right iPhone to take advantage of the $29 fee. \nSo, what does it take to actually get a new battery for your iPhone and what will you need to do in order to qualify?
