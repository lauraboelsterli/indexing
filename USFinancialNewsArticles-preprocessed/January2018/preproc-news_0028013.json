    "text": "Dallas-based Comerica Bank has been hit with a lawsuit accusing it of aiding a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme run by a Sherman Oaks, California businessman that collapsed in December when his companies stopped paying investors and filed for bankruptcy.\nThe proposed class action was filed Wednesday in Los Angeles federal court seeking damages for investors affected by the alleged fraud by the California-based Woodbridge Group.
