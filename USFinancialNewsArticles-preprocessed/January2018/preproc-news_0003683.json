    "text": "NEW YORK, Sanford Heisler Sharp LLP today announced promotions and new leadership roles for many of the firm's lawyers across its U.S platform.\n\"These personnel changes reflect the exceptional performance of our lawyers and their commitment both to our clients and to our firm,\" said David Sanford, the firm's Chairman. \"We consistently attract lawyers from the top ranked law schools in the country and provide them with an unparalleled opportunity to excel at the highest levels of the profession. These are very talented lawyers and we are delighted to see them advance at Sanford Heisler Sharp.\"\nSanford Heisler Sharp promoted:\nJeremy Heisler to Vice -Chairman of the nationwide firm;\nRussell Kornblith from Senior Litigation Counsel to Partner and Managing Partner of the firm's New York office;\nAli Harwin from Senior Litigation Counsel to Partner and co-chair of the national Title VII Practice. Ms. Harwin will co-chair the Title VII practice with partner Kate Mueting in Washington, D.C.\nMr. Heisler, a founding partner, is involved in most of the firm's litigation matters with a special focus on the firm's cases reaching appellate courts. Russell Kornblith, Harvard Law School '12, will lead the firm's New York office. Mr. Kornblith represents nearly 700 opt-in Plaintiffs in Kelli Smith et al. v. Merck & Co., Inc., et al, a major gender discrimination class action where a collective action was conditionally certified in April 2016. Rule 23 class certification briefing is currently pending. In United States ex rel. Nargol & Langton v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., Mr. Kornblith successfully argued an appeal obtaining reversal of a district court's decision dismissing the Relators' case. The qui tam matter is one of the first to successfully allege false claims based on manufacturing defects in a medical device. Alexandra Harwin, Yale Law School '11, will co-chair Sanford Heisler Sharp's National Title VII Practice.

She is also co-lead counsel in a sexual harassment case against Columbia, which is scheduled to go to trial in July 2018. Ms. Harwin is also litigating against fashion houses Zara and Giorgio Armani in discrimination and retaliation suits brought by their former general counsels. Kate Mueting, Iowa College of Law '07, has been a Partner since January 2016 and currently serves as lead counsel in the hard-fought Donna Kassman et al. v. KPMG LLP, the nation's largest gender discrimination class and collective action. Ms. Mueting leads a team of more than a dozen women fighting to challenge gender discrimination at the Big Four accounting firm. Since winning conditional certification of the Equal Pay Act claims in July 2014, more than 1100 female employees have joined the litigation as a means of securing fair and equitable compensation. Ms. Mueting also provides counsel to individual employees facing discrimination, including numerous C-Suite executives and several Big Law partners challenging gender discrimination, and to date she has garnered nearly $15 million on behalf of her clients.\nIn addition, Ella Zheng was promoted from Associate to Senior Counsel in the San Francisco office and Christine Dunn and Saba Bireda were promoted from Associate to Senior Litigation Counsel in Washington, D.C.\nMs. Zheng, Zhejiang University Bachelor of Law '09 and Thomas Jefferson School of Law, Masters of laws '10 , currently works on individual and class litigation involving wage and hour violations, discrimination and other civil rights claims, and leads several pre-litigation employment discrimination cases.

Ms. Bireda has also worked on two other class actions while at the Firm, Donna Kassman v. KPMG LLP and Fogg v.
