Britain Soccer Football - Wolverhampton Wanderers v Blackburn Rovers - Sky Bet Championship - Molineux - 22/4/17 Wolves manager Paul Lambert Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Alan Walter Livepic \nThe former Aston Villa and Norwich City coach replaced Mark Hughes, who was sacked this month with Stoke lying in the relegation zone and knocked out of the FA Cup by fourth tier Coventry City. \n“Paul greatly impressed us with his knowledge of our squad and had a clear plan of how he would improve our results,” chairman Peter Coates said on the club’s website. \n“He’s a man who backed himself as a player... and it’s obvious he adopts the same approach as a manager.” \nCaretaker manager Eddie Niedzwiecki will remain in charge of the team for Stoke’s league match against Manchester United later on Monday.
