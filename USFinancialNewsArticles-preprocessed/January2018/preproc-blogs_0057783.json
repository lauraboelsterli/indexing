    "text": "U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in advanced talks to buy a minority stake in India’s leading homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper said on Tuesday.\nWalmart could acquire a stake of 15% to 20% in Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart, the main challenger to U.S. tech giant Amazon.com Inc’s India ambitions, the daily said, citing two anonymous sources.\nWalmart has held intermittent talks with Flipkart over the past two years, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, asking not to be identified as the talks are confidential.\nThe two companies signed a non-disclosure pact in 2016 that was renewed last year, one of the sources said.\nIn September 2016, Reuters reported Walmart was in talks to buy a minority stake in Flipkart.\nWalmart is likely to make a significant investment in Flipkart if the talks lead to a deal, both sources said, adding, however, that buying a stake of 15% to 20% in the online marketplace could be pricey and difficult as it recently raised funds.\nLast year, Japan’s SoftBank Group invested nearly $2.5 billion in Flipkart through both primary and secondary investments. Flipkart also secured $1.4 billion from China’s Tencent, online marketplace eBay and software giant Microsoft .\nSoftBank owns roughly a fifth of Flipkart, while U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management owns a stake of slightly less than 20%, one of the sources told Reuters.\nA Walmart-Flipkart deal could be finalized as early as March, and may involve a direct investment and secondary sales by some longstanding Flipkart investors, the Indian paper said.\nIt makes little sense for Walmart to buy a stake in Flipkart unless it is looking to fully acquire the firm, said Harminder Sahni of retail consultant Wazir Advisors.\nA potential union of SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce player Alibaba and Flipkart would pose a more formidable challenge to Amazon, he added.\nBetting on Flipkart, though, will intensify Walmart’s battle with Amazon that has hurt brick-and-mortar rivals like it in their home U.S. market, pushing them to invest in online retail, offer discounts and improve the in-store shopping experience.\nSpokesmen for Flipkart and Walmart declined comment, saying the firms do not respond to market rumors or speculation.",
