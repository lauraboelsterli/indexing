    "text": " 08 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Magnitude 7.6 quake strikes off Central America: USGS Gustavo Palencia 2 Min Read \nTEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near remote Caribbean Islands belonging to Honduras on Tuesday, sparking a tsunami warning for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. \nThe quake rattled windows in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa roughly 323 miles (519 km) to the east, but no damage was immediately reported. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.8, was centered 125 miles (202 km)northeast of Barra Patuca in Honduras and 191 miles (307 km)southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands. \nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said a tsunami advisory was in effect for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after the earthquake and warned of possible waves up to 1 meter (3 feet) above tide level. \nThe quake was very shallow, at only 6.2 miles (10 km), which would have amplified its effect. \nIt was also lightly felt in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo north of Honduras, according to Mexicoâ€™s civil protection director.
