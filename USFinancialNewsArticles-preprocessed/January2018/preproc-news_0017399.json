In developing our future partnership we will want to continue working together to promote the long-term economic development of our continent. This will include continuing to take part in specific policies and programs where that is in our joint interest, making an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved.” Reporting Elizabeth Piper, writing by William James",
