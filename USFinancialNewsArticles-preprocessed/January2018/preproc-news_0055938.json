The Company has reached a new milestone with our pro forma total net acreage count approaching 20,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin and production approaching 5,000 Boepd,\" said Ronald Ormand, Lilis's Executive Chairman. \"The acquired acreage represents a consolidated position with offset operators that have and continue to materially de-risk this position. As we look forward into 2018, we intend to focus on delineation of our acreage position. We intend to do this through development of our eastern acreage and drilling of additional benches, including the Wolfcamp A, B, XY and 2 nd Bone Springs. We intend to drill four wells in New Mexico under our current 2018 budget targeting the Wolfcamp A and XY, which could be expanded.\"\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nConcurrent with the Company's entry into the purchase and sale agreement for the Acquisition, Lilis agreed to issue $100 million of newly created Convertible Preferred Stock to certain private funds affiliated with Varde Partners, Inc.

In addition, the Company holds optional redemption and forced conversion rights. Closing of the sale of the Preferred Stock is anticipated to occur later today on January 31, 2018. Proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock will fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Acquisition, as well as a portion of the Company's 2018 drilling program. Lilis expects to be cash flow neutral, on a drilling and completion basis, by 2019.\n\"We are excited to expand our relationship with Varde through the placement of this Preferred Stock. This transformative capital funds the cash portion of our acquisition, provides additional liquidity to our balance sheet and provides Lilis the ability to delineate our existing acreage position in order to continue seeking out accretive opportunities with significant upside potential,\" said Joseph Daches, Chief Financial Officer of the Company. \"This financing gives the Company increased operational and financial flexibility that will allow for accelerated and efficient development of our assets.\"\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey acted as exclusive financial advisor to Lilis in connection with the Acquisition.
