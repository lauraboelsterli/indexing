    "text": "In a world-wide first, Chinese scientists cloned two monkeys by transplanting donor cells into eggs, they said on Wednesday, a feat that could lead to genetically engineered primates for drug testing, gene editing and brain research.\nThe cloned macaque monkeys are the latest application of a test-tube technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer pioneered 20 years ago with the creation of the cloned sheep named Dolly. It has been used to clone 23 species from rodeo bulls to polo ponies and pet cats. But the ability to clone... ",
