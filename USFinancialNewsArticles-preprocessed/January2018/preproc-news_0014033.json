    "text": "January 10, 2018 / 1:13 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Teva Pharm agrees with workers on closing Jerusalem inhaler plant Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTEL AVIV, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with workers on closing its inhaler factory in Jerusalem by the end of 2019, ending weeks of labour unrest at the facility. \nThe plant is slated to be shut as part of a global restructuring in which the world’s largest generic drugmaker will cut more than a quarter of its workforce, or 14,000 jobs. \nSince the cost-cutting plan was announced last month, workers from the inhaler plant have been disrupting operations. \nUnder the agreement reached between Teva, the Histadrut labour federation and company unions, up to 60 workers will leave the company by the end of February, while the remaining 180 will remain until the facility is shut in December 2019. \nEmployees will return to work on Thursday. Teva said it will provide them with training and counselling to find alternative employment. \nEarlier this month workers from an adjacent tablet plant, which employs 500 people, reached an agreement with Teva on closing that factory by the end of 2019. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked the company not to close the Jerusalem site - a request Teva rejected. \nUnder a two-year plan, Teva aims to reduce costs by $3 billion by the end of 2019, from about $16.1 billion in 2017.
