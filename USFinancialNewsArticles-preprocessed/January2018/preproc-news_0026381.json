    "text": "Kristaps Porzingis scored 26 points as the New York Knicks dominated the fourth quarter en route to a 119-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday afternoon at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\nMichael Beasley added 13 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter for the Knicks, who opened a seven-game road trip by outscoring the Nets 36-23 in the final 12 minutes.\nBeasley, whose minutes were reduced the previous two games because of Tim Hardaway Jr’s return from a leg injury, shot 10 of 18 as the Knicks rested Hardaway. He also grabbed 10 rebounds.\nThe forward helped the Knicks gain separation after DeMarre Carroll hit a buzzer-beating jumper in the third quarter to cut New York’s lead to 83-81.\nBeasley scored seven points in the first 5:07 of the fourth until Porzingis returned. The Knicks scored the first 11 points of the fourth and opened the quarter with an 18-7 spurt until Porzingis returned.\nPorzingis helped the Knicks finish off their fifth road win and third against the Nets with a dunk that made it 109-90 with 5:02 remaining.\nCarroll led the Nets with 22 points and nine rebounds and his buzzer-beater capped a slow-moving third quarter that featured a combined 20 fouls and 36 free throws.\nReserve Caris LeVert added 20 and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson contributed 16 but the Nets shot 36.8 percent (32 of 87), missed 10 of their first 13 shots in the fourth quarter and lost for the fifth time in six games.\nThe Knicks took a 26-24 lead in the final seconds of the first quarter on a layup by Beasley. They began pulling away midway through the second quarter with a 13-2 run that gave the Knicks a 46-34 lead on a Beasley hook shot with 4:04 remaining.\nNew York carried a 52-42 lead into the half when rookie Frank Ntilikina hit two free throws after getting fouled by rookie Jarrett Allen, who blocked the guard’s drive through the lane with 26.4 seconds remaining.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
