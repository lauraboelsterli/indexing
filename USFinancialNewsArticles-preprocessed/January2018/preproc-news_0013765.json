Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net TECH IN FOCUS AS ASML BEATS EXPECTATIONS (0634 GMT) The richly valued tech sector is one to watch this morning after the Dutch supplier of equipment to key chip makers reported a better-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter. Several customers asked for early delivery of products amid a booming semiconductor industry, helping ASML's net profit rise to 644 million euros from 524 million euros. Analysts polled for Reuters had expected profit of 454 million euros. Tech stocks are leading sectoral gainers in Europe over the last 12 months but some investors say the sector's golden era may be over. (Danilo Masoni)",
