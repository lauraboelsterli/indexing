The ASN authorised their restart in March 2017.\nA review of manufacturing documentation at EDF-owned nuclear foundry Creusot Forge was now 50 percent complete and should be finished by year-end, Chevet said.\nWorries about the falsification of the documentation sparked a major review of the paperwork in 2016 and led to the closure of two reactors, of which one, in Fessenheim, northeast France, remains closed.\nChevet said that the financial restructuring of the French nuclear industry was also positive for nuclear safety.\nAfter years of losses wiped out the equity of nuclear group Areva, the firm was split up and recapitalised by the French state in an operation that was finalised late last year.\nAreva’s nuclear reactor unit has been sold to EDF while its nuclear fuel and uranium mining activities have been split off into a separate unit and rebranded Orano.\nChevet confirmed that the ASN would give a final ruling on the lifespan extension of EDF’s nuclear reactors in 2021, with an initial ruling due in 2020.\nEDF wants to extend the lifespan of its reactors from 40 to 50 years but needs ASN approval in principle as well as individual approval for each reactor,\nThe ASN wants EDF to upgrade safety at each of the reactors, including studying the possibility of adding a core catcher, a giant ashtray-like concrete bowl below the reactor that can contain the nuclear fuel in case of a meltdown.
