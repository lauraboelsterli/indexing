    "text": "LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks fell for a third day and many currencies were under pressure, weighed down by a stronger dollar and jitters over trade protectionism as markets digested the recent rally.\nMSCI’s emerging market benchmark declined 0.3 percent in a third day of falls, pulled lower by heavyweight South Korea where stocks fell 0.5 percent while bourses from Turkey to South Africa chalked up losses.\nMarkets were jittery following a Reuters report saying Canada increasingly believes U.S. President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) treaty.\nNerves had also been frayed by a report that China was considering slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, which sent U.S. yields higher, though Beijing’s foreign exchange regulator said the report may be based on erroneous information.\nTom Hainlin, global investment strategist at Ascent Private Capital Management, said the move in Treasury yields was not expected to hit emerging markets, which had started to look “aggressive, if not overbought” following a stellar start to the year.\n“This seems like a natural consolidation,” he said, adding that fundamentals still looked good and he expected a decent 2018 in China, the biggest emerging market country.\n“As you move into 2018 you are seeing record upgrades on earnings estimates so that’s a pretty solid base for emerging market investors,” he said.\nEmerging currencies painted a mixed picture on the day against a stronger dollar.\nSouth Africa’s rand weakened 0.3 percent in a second day of losses after the new leadership of the ruling ANC said on Wednesday it did not discuss President Jacob Zuma’s future, disappointing investors who hoped the party would seek to remove him from power.\nMexico’s peso weakened for a fourth straight session over concerns for the future of NAFTA.\nBut Russia’s rouble eked out small gains, propped up by rising crude oil prices while the Thai baht hit a 3-1/2 year high.\nHowever, currencies such as the yuan, the rand, the rouble, the peso and Turkey’s lira were all on track for weekly losses following a multi-week rally.\nIn emerging Europe, Serbia’s central bank was expected to keep rates on hold at 3.5 percent thanks to a strong currency and tame inflation.\nHungary’s central bank chief said interest rates must stay at a record low of 0.9 percent to reach the central bank’s 3 percent target by mid-2019.\nBudapest also announced it would hold its 2018 parliamentary election on April 8. Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s ruling Fidesz party holds a comfortable lead over the main opposition according to the latest polls.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2017, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1194.90 -2.63 -0.22 +3.15\nCzech Rep 1102.55 +0.82 +0.07 +2.26\nPoland 2511.52 +0.25 +0.01 +2.04\nHungary 39608.15 -43.08 -0.11 +0.59\nRomania 8091.05 +56.20 +0.70 +4.35\nGreece 835.37 -0.91 -0.11 +4.11\nRussia 1237.30 +2.66 +0.22 +7.18\nSouth Africa 52757.84 -410.12 -0.77 +0.43\nTurkey 13196.54 -392.91 -0.35 -1.85\nChina 3425.57 +3.74 +0.11 +3.58\nIndia 34499.84 +66.77 +0.19 +1.30\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.53 25.55 +0.08 -0.02\nPoland 4.17 4.17 -0.01 +0.02\nHungary 308.86 309.19 +0.11 +0.54\nRomania 4.63 4.64 +0.05 +0.91\nSerbia 118.64 118.70 +0.05 -0.20\nRussia 56.99 57.04 +0.09 +1.17\nKazakhstan 330.06 330.37 +0.09 +0.83\nUkraine 28.46 28.34 -0.43 -1.11\nSouth Africa 12.46 12.43 -0.24 -0.82\nKenya 103.05 103.00 -0.05 +0.05\nIsrael 3.42 3.43 +0.07 +1.60\nTurkey 3.80 3.80 -0.06 -0.26\nChina 6.51 6.51 -0.02 -0.01\nIndia 63.66 63.62 -0.06 +0.27\nBrazil 3.23 3.23 +0.00 +2.61\nMexico 19.31 19.29 -0.14 +1.73\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 300 0 .14 8 07.38 1\nAll data taken from Reuters at 09:57 GMT.
