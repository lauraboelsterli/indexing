    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is sending investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ) vehicle, apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode, and a fire truck in California, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.\nThe move follows an announcement on Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that it was sending two investigators to the scene to conduct a “field investigation” to examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday’s accident in which the driver said the vehicle was operating in “Autopilot” mode.\nTesla declined to comment on the new probe.\nThe government probes escalate the risk for Tesla and automakers at a time when the industry is seeking federal legislation that would ease deployment of self driving cars.\nThe NTSB can make safety recommendations but only the NHTSA can order automakers to recall unsafe vehicles or fine automakers if they fail to remedy safety defects in a timely fashion. Before the agency could demand a recall from Tesla, it must open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken.\nThe NTSB probe is the safety board’s second into a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, the automaker’ s semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.\nTesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel “at all times” before they can use Autopilot.\nThe Culver City, California fire department tweeted on Monday that an engine was struck by a Tesla “traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.”\nThe NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.\nIn September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle’s semi-autonomous system.\nThe first fatality in a Tesla vehicle operating in Autopilot mode raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.\nIn January 2017, an NHTSA probe of the fatal Autopilot crash found no evidence of defects.\nTesla shares fell 1.7 percent to $346.94 late Wednesday afternoon.\nTesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang\n ",
