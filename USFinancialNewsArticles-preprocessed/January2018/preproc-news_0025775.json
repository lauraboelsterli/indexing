    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jan 12 (Reuters) - A 20-year-old man from Florida’s Gulf Coast claimed a $451 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot and opted to receive a one-time payment of nearly $282 million, Florida lottery officials said on Friday.\nShane Missler, of Port Richey, had a ticket with the five winning numbers and a “Mega Ball” number drawn on Jan. 5. The larger jackpot figure would be the estimated value had Missler chosen to take payments over time for the nationwide lottery.
