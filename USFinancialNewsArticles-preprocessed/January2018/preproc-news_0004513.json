    "text": "By Chris Morris January 3, 2018 \nMike Tyson, whose career has spanned from world heavyweight champion to actor to pop culture icon, is adding another title: Marijuana kingpin. \nThe man once known as Iron Mike could soon be known as Stoned Mike as he has broken ground on a 40-acre ranch in California that aims to be a “ cannabis resort ” for growers and enthusiasts of the drug. \nLocated in the Mojave Desert, some 110 miles north of Los Angeles and just a stone’s throw from Edwards Air Force base, Tyson Ranch will set aside 20 acres for marijuana cultivation by “master growers” to develop new strains, reports The Blast . It also plans to offer an “edibles factory,” an amphitheater and an upscale campground. \nTyson has been a cannabis advocate for years and is a big proponent of using cannabidiol (or CBD), which has the same non-hallucinogenic properties as marijuana, to help veterans who suffer from PTSD. \nTyson’s not the only person looking to make a marijuana-themed destination for enthusiasts. Lat year, American Green bought the town of Nipton, CA , transforming the ghost town into a marijuana tourist destination, with plans to also use it as a production hub for cannabis-based products – including CBD-infused water. The company says it plans to spend $2.5 million by early 2019 to build out the town. \nTyson has not yet announced a scheduled opening date for Tyson Ranch. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
