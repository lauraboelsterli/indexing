Iain will succeed Dr. David Plans, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer, who has successfully led the development of BioBeats transformational digital health app, Hear and Now , as well as being instrumental in closing five funding rounds and building solid commercial partnerships with the likes of global insurance and financial powerhouses AXA and BNP Paribas.\nSince being founded in 2013, BioBeats has developed revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and software.

We are currently building computational models which are focused on discovering how stress affects people's wellbeing. Critically, these innovations will help users track and improve their overall wellbeing through the continuous monitoring of physical and mental stress in real-time. Our ultimate goal is to help users avoid chronic conditions that arise from unmanaged stress, such as heart disease. The world of digital health, and to an even further extent, the mindfulness and wellbeing industries, are in the midst of a step change that will profoundly shift how we address the chronic nature of stress - and I am proud to work with BioBeats as the pioneers in this effort.”\nIain has a wealth of experience gathered from more than 20 years’ in senior commercial, marketing, operational and technical roles. He is currently Chairman of My1stYears.com , an online retailer of personalized baby and toddler products.\nBefore joining BioBeats, Martin was Managing Director of Moonpig for nearly a decade.
