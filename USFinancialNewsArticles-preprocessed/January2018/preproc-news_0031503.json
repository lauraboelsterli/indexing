    "text": "SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Singaporeâ€™s on-year non-oil domestic exports (NODX) growth slowed more than expected in December due to a contraction in electronics exports and shipments to China, official data showed on Wednesday.\nExports rose 3.1 percent in December year-on-year, data from the trade agency International Enterprise Singapore showed, slowing from the 9.1 percent rise the month before.\nThe slowdown was worse than the 8.7 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.\nOn a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports contracted 5.0 percent in December after growing a revised 8.6 percent in November. The poll called for a 4.5 percent contraction from the month before. (Reporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by Sam Holmes)\n ",
