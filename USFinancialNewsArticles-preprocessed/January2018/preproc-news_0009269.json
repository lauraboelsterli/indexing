    "text": "January 14, 2018 / 12:11 AM / Updated 9 hours ago At least eight killed, dozens hurt in fire, stampede in Portugal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLISBON (Reuters) - At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured in a fire and stampede in a local leisure association in the town of Vila Nova da Rainha in northern Portugal on Saturday night, officials said. \nMayor Jose Antonio de Jesus said in televised remarks that over 60 people had been taking part or watching a card tournament in the two-storey popular gathering place of the town 260 km northeast of Lisbon when the fire erupted. \n“Several dozen people have been injured, some lightly and others gravely, and are still being assisted,” he said. \nHe would not say what had caused the fire, but local media cited firefighters on the spot as saying that an explosion of a heating boiler was the likely cause. \nPortugal suffered from its deadliest ever forest fires last year, which killed a total of over 100 people - the worst loss of human lives in living memory in the country.
