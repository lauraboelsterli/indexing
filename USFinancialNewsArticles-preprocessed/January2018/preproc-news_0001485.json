    "text": "January 2, 2018 / 1:59 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Moldova leader pans 'shameful' court decision to suspend his powers Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Moldovan President Igor Dodon on Tuesday criticized a decision by the country’s constitutional court to suspend his powers temporarily due to a wrangle between him and the pro-Western government over ministerial appointments. FILE PHOTO: Moldovan President Igor Dodon exits a car before a meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov \n“The court once again confirmed its image of an obedient political instrument, not a constitutional body. This is a shameful and regrettable fall for a state that claims to be democratic,” Dodon said in a Facebook post. Reporting by Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk; editing by John Stonestreet",
