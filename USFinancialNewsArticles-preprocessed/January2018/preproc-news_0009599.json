    "text": "BANGKOK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Thailand’s exports are expected to rise 5.5 percent this year after increasing at least 10 percent in 2017, a group of Thai shippers said on Tuesday.\nThe Thai National Shippers’ Council said Thailand’s exports are climbing thanks to improved global demand.\n“This year we have a conservative forecast at 5.5 percent,” Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, council chairwoman, told a briefing.\nExports, a key driver of Thai growth, rebounded strongly in 2017 after three years of contraction.\nIn the first 11 months of 2017, exports increased 10 percent from a year earlier, according to customs data, even though the baht has strengthened significantly. The currency hit a 40-month high against the dollar on Monday. (Reporting by Satawasin Staporncharnchai; Writing by Orathai Sriring; Editing by Richard Borsuk)\n ",
