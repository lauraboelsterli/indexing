    "text": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. (NYSE American: ORM) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Freestone Capital Management, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, \"Freestone\") to repurchase the 810,937 shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by Freestone. The Company agreed to repurchase the shares for $19.25 per share in a private, accretive transaction representing more than a 10% discount to the $22.12 per share GAAP book value of the Company's common stock as of September 30, 2017.\nThe aggregate purchase price was $15,610,537.25, approximately $4.1 million of which was paid with the remaining balance of the Company's $10 million stock repurchase plan previously announced on June 13, 2017. As a result of the shares already repurchased in the open market and the repurchase from Freestone, the Company's repurchase plan, which had been set to expire on January 15, 2018, has been terminated.\nBryan H. Draper, President and Chief Executive Officer of Owens Realty Mortgage, said, \"We are pleased to have reached this agreement, which will allow us to continue to prudently execute the business strategy of liquidating our real estate assets and investing the proceeds into commercial real estate loans in order to maximize value for our stockholders.\"\nThe repurchase represents a reduction of approximately 8 percent of the 10,041,938 shares outstanding on November 3, 2017, as reported in the Company's most recently filed Form 10-Q. As of December 29, 2017, the Company has repurchased approximately $31.5 million of its stock, not including commissions and fees, representing approximately 1,961,000 shares or 17.5 percent of the shares outstanding on May 20, 2013, at an average price of $16.06 per share.\nAs previously disclosed, the Board's Compensation Committee continues to analyze and evaluate a range of strategic options related to its external management structure, including amending the existing management agreement or internalizing the management function. While this review continues, the Company has negotiated a reduction of its management fee, effective as of July 2017.\nPremierCounsel LLP and Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. are representing Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc.\nAbout Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc.\nOwens Realty Mortgage, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance mortgage company organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that focuses on the origination, investment, and management of commercial real estate mortgage loans.
