    "text": "Net Sales Increased 11.4% to $160.0 Million\nDecember 2017 Comparable Sales Increased 7.9%\nLYNNWOOD, Wash., Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zumiez Inc. (NASDAQ:ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women today announced that total net sales for the five-week period ended December 30, 2017 increased 11.4% to $160.0 million, compared to $143.6 million for the five-week period ended December 31, 2016. The Company's comparable sales increased 7.9% for the five-week period compared to a comparable sales increase of 3.4% in the year ago period.\nDue primarily to stronger than expected quarter-to-date sales and product margin performance, the Company is increasing guidance and now expects fiscal 2017 fourth quarter comparable sales growth of approximately 7%, and earnings per share between $0.88 and $0.90. This compares to the previous guidance for comparable sales growth between 3% and 5%, earnings per share between $0.78 and $0.84 and excludes any potential impact of recently passed tax reform.\nTo hear the Zumiez prerecorded December sales message, please dial (201) 689-8483 or (877) 523-5612, followed by the passcode # 986439 (ZUMIEZ).\nAbout Zumiez Inc.\nZumiez is a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods for young men and women who want to express their individuality through the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear, and other unique lifestyles.
