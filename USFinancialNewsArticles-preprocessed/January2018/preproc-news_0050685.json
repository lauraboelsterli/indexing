    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 2:35 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Cricket-De Villiers ruled out of first three ODIs vs India Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Free-scoring batsman AB de Villiers has been ruled out of the first three one-day internationals against India through injury, Cricket South Africa announced on Tuesday. \nDe Villiers bruised an index finger attempting to take a catch in the 63-run defeat in the third test against the tourists in Johannesburg. \nHe will need at least two weeks for a full recovery, ruling him out of the 50-over ODIs in Durban, Pretoria and Cape Town, starting on Thursday. \nDe Villiers has scored 9,515 runs in 225 ODIs at an average of more than 54 and a strike rate of 101. He holds the record for the fastest century in the format, reaching the milestone off only 31 balls against the West Indies in 2015. \nThe South Africa selectors have not named a replacement, hoping he will be fit in time for the fourth match in the six-game series in Johannesburg on Feb. 10.
