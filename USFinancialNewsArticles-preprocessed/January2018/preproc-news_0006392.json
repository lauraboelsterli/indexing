Newly-signed Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder attends first training session at the Nice soccer club in Nice, France, August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet \nFormer Inter Milan and Real Madrid midfielder Sneijder was released by Turkish club Galatasaray in July and played five games for Ligue 1 outfit Nice this season. \n“Welcome @sneijder101010,” the Qatari club said on Twitter alongside a picture of the midfielder. The 33-year-old, who is the most capped Dutch player of all time (133), has signed an 18-month deal with the club. \nSneijder won the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010, the same year he helped his country finish as runners-up at the World Cup. He has also won league titles in the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
