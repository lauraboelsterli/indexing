    "text": "1. Salt Lake City, UT \nJob opportunities: 5.01 percent John Pulsipher | Getty Images Salt Lake City, Utah \nSalt Lake City, Utah topped WalletHub's list. With a population of 193,744 , Salt Lake City has an unemployment rate of just 2.6 percent , far below the national average. \nSeveral regions are represented in the top 10, making it easy for workers across the country to find a job in one of these cities. Even though there may be great jobs in a city nearby, WalletHub found that fewer people are moving across state lines in search of work. \nStephanie Thomas , Economics Lecturer at Cornell University, says that the decline in geographic mobility is due to aging populations that do not want to leave their communities and younger generations that are more specialized than ever before. \n\"Older individuals tend to have stronger attachments to their local communities,\" she tells WalletHub . \"Many younger individuals are earning postsecondary and graduate degrees , and are investing in a greater amount of specialized training. This increase in 'specialization' among younger individuals means that they are entering their chosen career relatively earning in their work life. This, in turn, can create better 'matches' between workers and employers, decreasing the likelihood of worker turnover.\" \nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook \nDon't miss: ",
