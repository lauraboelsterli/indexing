    "text": "CLEVELAND, Jan. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Electronic Merchant Systems (EMS) announced today that it will be relocating its corporate headquarters to Downtown Cleveland in mid-2018 as its business continues to expand. EMS has signed a lease with Bedrock for approximately 48,000 square feet of office space in the 250 West Huron Building at Tower City Center. This ideal location occupies the entire fourth floor and a portion of the fifth floor of Tower City Center's former Chase Financial Plaza, and will comfortably accommodate EMS' growing work force, which is currently based outside of downtown Cleveland in Independence, Ohio.\n\"We're excited to start the process of creating a new headquarters that reflects our winning culture and will help us attract and retain great talent in Cleveland,\" said Daniel Neistadt, CEO. \"Our growth has been significant, and we were drawn to the 250 West Huron building because of its central location, which will enable our employees to fully experience the city of Cleveland and what it has to offer, as well as Bedrock's reputation for outstanding management and tenant relations. This first-class space will be large enough to accommodate our current needs, as well as those driven by EMS' continuing growth.\"\n\"The decision by Electronic Merchant Systems to move over 180 jobs to Cleveland is a welcomed decision,\" said Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson. \"Their choice to relocate to our great City will provide them with an environment where they can continue to grow, recruit talent and create jobs.\"\n\"Electronic Merchant Systems is an exciting addition to downtown Cleveland's commercial landscape,\" said Bedrock's chairman and founder, Dan Gilbert. \"Tower City is at the core of Bedrock's Cleveland investments, and is the perfect location for a FinTech leader like EMS. As more and more people choose downtown to live work and play, we are looking forward to helping meet the growing demand for modern, tech-friendly office space and building Cleveland's profile as a true destination for flourishing new economy businesses.\"\nAbout Electronic Merchant Systems\nElectronic Merchant Systems ( www.emscorporate.com ) has been helping small to mid-sized business owners realize their full potential since 1988.
