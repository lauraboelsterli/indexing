Alpine Skiing - FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup - Men's Slalom - Wengen, Switzerland - January 14, 2018 - Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway celebrates on the podium. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nThe Austrian, who will be aiming to add a first Olympic gold in Pyeongchang next month to his glittering array of titles, won by 0.93 seconds from long-suffering Norwegian rival Henrik Kristoffersen. \nHirscher was fastest in both legs as he claimed his fifth successive slalom win. \nKristoffersen has finished runner-up in seven races this season, five of those behind Hirscher. \nAndre Myhrer of Sweden was third on a difficult, icy course which saw more than 20 skiers fail to finish the first run. \nAlthough Hirscher has won 53 World Cup races, it was his first success at Wengen, considered one of the circuitâ€™s classic events, and where Kristoffersen won for the past two seasons. \nHirscher tops the overall standings with 974 points and extended his lead over Kristoffersen, who is second, to 174. Alexis Pinturault of France is third on 579. \nHirscher has won eight races altogether this season, with the other three in giant slalom. Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Toby Davis",
