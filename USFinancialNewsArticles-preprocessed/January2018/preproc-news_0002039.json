    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) announced today it has acquired Stabiplan B.V. based in Bodegraven, Netherlands, a 3D Computer Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) software and Building Information Modeling (BIM) content provider for the Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) industries in Europe. The Stabiplan acquisition broadens Trimble's existing construction solutions for MEP contractors and engineers that enable automated estimating, project management, modeling, detailing, layout and construction. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nStabiplan's solutions include Stabicad software and the MEPcontent BIM content library. Stabicad is a 3D CAD/CAE software solution for Revit and AutoCAD, which integrates design, drawing and engineering calculation/analysis, supporting workflows from engineering to construction. MEPcontent.com is an open online BIM library for MEP contractors and engineers in Europe. With MEPcontent, MEP engineers and contractors can deliver technically accurate models and drawings while including manufacturer-specific content, to ensure that a model contains uniform and accurate information for fabrication and documentation.\nThe construction industry is evolving quickly with new technologies and improved methods to transform every phase of construction projects. MEP contractors and engineers are now able to eliminate waste and rework with fully-constructible and actionable models. With intelligent data to fuel fabrication, prefabrication and lean construction, contractors are improving productivity and profitability across the project. Trimble's building solutions extend the design data created in the office to field-level systems for precise delivery of construction elements.\n\"Stabiplan's strength lies in its ability to offer localized construction software applications and provide users with intuitive work processes for optimal efficiency and productivity in the office,\" said Lawrence Smith, general manager of Trimble's MEP Division. \"The Stabiplan portfolio complements our existing products for the European MEP market, including Trimble Plancal nova and Trimble Amtech ProDesign, to provide European contractors with a robust set of design tools from a single source.\"\n\"Stabiplan provides a core competency in CAD/CAE and BIM design software and content for MEP contractors and engineers to augment Trimble's current portfolio of solutions for the European MEP contractor,\" said Gijs Willem Sloof, CEO of Stabiplan. \"The acquisition allows us to further develop our best-in-class solutions with Trimble's resources and offer our solutions on a more global scale. Together with Trimble, we will continue to develop enhanced BIM solutions to enable better collaboration between our customers and their clients.\"\nThe Stabiplan business will be reported as part of the Buildings and Infrastructure Segment.\nAbout Stabiplan\nSince its founding in 1990, Stabiplan has grown to become a leader in the development and sales of design software for MEP engineering in Europe.
