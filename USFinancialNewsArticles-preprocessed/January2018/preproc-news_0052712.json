    "text": " 24 AM / in 26 minutes Britain's UDG Healthcare expects 18-21 pct growth in full-year profit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 30 (Reuters) - UDG Healthcare said it expects adjusted earnings per share to increase by 18-21 percent in 2018, driven by a strong first-quarter and benefits from the U.S tax reform. \nThe company, which provides outsourced sales and marketing, drug distribution and packaging services to healthcare companies, said pre-tax profit in the first quarter of the year was well ahead of last year, helped by recent acquisitions. \nUDG said it would gain from a reduction in the headline US federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
