    "text": "Strongest First Quarter Earnings Per Share Since Fiscal 2011\nSignificant Year-Over-Year Performance Improvements Driven by Higher Volumes and Margins\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: SCHN) today reported results for its first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended November 30, 2017. The Company reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.64 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, both of which include an adverse impact of $0.14 per share related to a legacy environmental liability of $4 million. These results compare to fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.65 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, and the prior year first quarter loss per share from continuing operations of $0.05 and adjusted loss per share of $0.03. For a reconciliation of the adjusted results to U.S. GAAP, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures provided after the financial statements in this document.\nAuto and Metals Recycling (AMR) achieved its best first quarter performance since fiscal 2011 with operating income of $35 million, or operating income per ferrous ton of $44, both of which are more than double the results of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. AMR’s higher year-over-year operating income and operating income per ferrous ton reflect the benefits of operating leverage from 11% higher ferrous sales volumes and expanded metal margins as well as higher average net selling prices and contributions from sustained productivity improvements.\nCascade Steel and Scrap (CSS) delivered first quarter operating income of $8 million representing a significant improvement from the prior year first quarter operating loss of $3 million which included an adverse impact of approximately $2.5 million from downtime associated with a major equipment upgrade. CSS’s improved operating performance was driven primarily by higher finished steel sales volumes and metal spreads and also benefited from lower levels of rebar steel imports, increased selling prices driven by higher raw material costs, and productivity improvements from the recent integration of our steel manufacturing and Oregon metal recycling operations.\nConsolidated financial performance in the first quarter included Corporate expense of approximately $17 million, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior year first quarter primarily due to the recognition of the legacy environmental liability and higher incentive compensation accruals from improved operating performance.\n“In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we delivered our strongest first quarter performance since fiscal 2011. AMR’s operating income per ferrous ton exceeded $40, a level last reached during fiscal 2011 when both volumes and scrap prices were significantly higher than today. This performance demonstrates our continuous focus on increasing productivity and efficiency in our core operations which, combined with the success of our commercial initiatives to grow volumes, allowed us to take full advantage of the stronger market conditions,” commented Tamara Lundgren, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Cascade Steel and Scrap business also achieved significantly improved performance compared to the prior year first quarter, with operating margin expansion driven by higher volumes, reduced pressure from low-priced rebar imports, and continuing productivity improvements.”\nSummary Results ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Quarter 1Q18 1Q17 Change 4Q17 Change Revenues $ 483 $ 334 45\n%\n$ 494 (2 )% Operating income $ 26 $ 1 NM $ 22 20 % Other asset impairment charges (recoveries), net — — NM — NM Restructuring charges and other exit-related activities — — NM — NM Recoveries related to the resale or modification of previously contracted shipments — — NM — NM Adjusted operating income (1) $ 26 $ 1 NM $ 22 20 % Net income (loss) attributable to SSI $ 18 $ (1 ) NM $ 18 1 % Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to SSI $ 18 $ (1 ) NM $ 18 — % Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to SSI (1) $ 18 $ (1 ) NM $ 18 1 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to SSI $ 0.64 $ (0.05 ) NM $ 0.64 — % Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to SSI $ 0.64 $ (0.05 ) NM $ 0.65 (1 )% Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to SSI (1) $ 0.63 $ (0.03 ) NM $ 0.63 — % (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

Volumes: Ferrous sales volumes in the first quarter increased 11% compared to the prior year first quarter, and decreased 8% sequentially driven primarily by seasonal impacts on demand. Nonferrous sales volumes were 3% higher compared to the prior year first quarter, benefiting from higher production, while decreasing 14% sequentially primarily due to seasonality.\nExport customers accounted for 70% of total ferrous sales volumes. Our products, including ferrous, nonferrous and recycled auto parts, were shipped to 18 countries in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with Turkey, Bangladesh and Thailand the top export destinations for ferrous shipments.\nPricing: Average ferrous net selling prices increased $98 per ton, or 51%, compared to the prior year first quarter, reflecting stronger market conditions, and were up $30 per ton, or 11%, sequentially. Average nonferrous net selling prices increased 26% compared to the prior year quarter, and 14% sequentially, reflecting the stronger markets.\nMargins: Operating income of $35 million increased $11 million, or 47%, sequentially, and operating income per ferrous ton of $44 increased 59% sequentially, both of which were more than double the prior year first quarter. The improved operating income was driven by stronger market conditions including metal margin expansion from higher priced shipments, increased supply flows, initiatives focused on broadening our supplier base, and sustained benefits from our productivity initiatives. First quarter operating results did not include a material impact from average inventory accounting, which compares to a favorable impact in the ",
