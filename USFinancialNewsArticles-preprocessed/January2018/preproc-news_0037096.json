    "text": "LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskomâ€™s 2021 dollar-denominated Eurobond rose to 2-1/2-month high on Monday after a new board was appointed at the weekend.\nThe 2021 issue was up 1.4 cents to trade at 100.9 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb data, its highest since early November.\nState-run Eskom has been in a leadership crisis after several board members, including the chairman and chief executive, resigned in 2017 amid growing governance concerns. . Analysts said they saw the appointments as part of the reform promised by new ruling party head Cyril Ramaphosa. (Reporting by Claire Milhench; editing by Sujata Rao)\n ",
