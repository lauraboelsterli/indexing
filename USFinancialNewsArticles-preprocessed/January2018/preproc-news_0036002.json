    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Turkey’s foreign minister said on Tuesday, as Turkey pushed on with its offensive against the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG in Syria’s Afrin region.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Paris, Mevlut Cavusoglu said he had told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that U.S. support for the YPG must come to an end for the NATO allies to cooperate in Syria.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Cavusoglu said Turkey sought to avoid any clash with U.S., Russian or Syrian forces but will take any steps needed for its security, on the fourth day of its air and ground offensive against Kurdish forces in northwest Syria.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
