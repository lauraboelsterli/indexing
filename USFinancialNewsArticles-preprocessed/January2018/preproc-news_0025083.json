    "text": "Pepsi to promote two new products in a 60-second Super Bowl ad Pepsi is backing two new products in a 60-second ad for this year's Super Bowl. The new products are Dorito's Blaze and Mtn Dew Ice. Pepsi is among the sponsors of the NFL championship game, a branding opportunity worth $32 million , according to Apex Marketing Group. 4 Hours Ago | 04:28 \nHollywood's Morgan Freeman and \"Game of Thrones\" star Peter Dinklage will be facing off in a PepsiCo Super Bowl commercial. \nIn a 60-second spot, the snack and beverage giant will promote both Mtn Dew Ice and Doritos Blaze. It's the first time Pepsi has taken this approach. \nPepsi is also a sponsor of the Super Bowl, a role that gives it an opportunity to advertise the brand through its on-screen logo, during halftime and in promotions in first and second quarters. The value of that branding exposure is $32 million, according to Apex Marketing Group. \nMeantime, if the winning coach is dunked in Pepsi-owned Gatorade, that's an extra $2.2 million of branding, according to Apex. \nSuper Bowl LII takes place on Feb. 4, and will air on NBC. \nDisclosure: NBC and CNBC are owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal unit.
