    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kay Anderle, a nationally prominent attorney and managing partner of Keller/Anderle LLP in Irvine, has been named to the Criminal Defense and White Collar Criminal Defense categories of the 2018 \"Southern California Super Lawyers.\"\nWith over two decades of experience and 100 cases to jury verdict, Kay Anderle is among the region's leading trial attorneys. Kay began her legal career over 26 years ago in the Orange County District Attorney's Office, where she spent 12 years prosecuting criminal cases. She was one of its most respected prosecutors, and was assigned to several of its most prestigious trial units.\nIn 2009, Kay worked with Ms. Keller in a business fraud trial in which the jury awarded $350 million, the largest jury verdict in California that year. In 2011, she worked with Ms. Keller in the retrial of the epic doll battle Mattel v. MGA, in which MGA was defending against copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims and prosecuting its own trade secret misappropriation action against Mattel. The jury rejected all of Mattel's claims of copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation and awarded $85,000,000 in damages to MGA Entertainment; the judge added another $85 million in punitive damages and $139 million in attorneys' fees. (Although the judgment was reversed on appeal, the attorneys' fee award remained.)\nIn 2013, she was co-lead plaintiff counsel on a business fraud trial which resulted in a jury award of over $3,375,000 in economic and over $1,465,000 in punitive damages.\nSince that time Kay has worked on cases involving shareholder oppression, allegations of human trafficking against a Saudi princess, successful defense of a claim her client breached a $1 billion oral partnership for real estate investment, and a white collar criminal case alleging bribery of public officials by a developer that then-Attorney Jerry Brown called \"the largest corruption case in the history of San Bernardino County, and possibly California.\" After a nine-month jury trial the defendant was acquitted of all charges. Kay is also focused on defending a number of health care fraud cases brought by the Orange County District Attorney, and has special expertise in defense of state court white collar cases.\nContact:\nKay Anderle\nManaging Partner\nAddress:\n18300 Von Karman Ave., Suite 930\nIrvine, California 92612-1057\nPh. 949.476.8700\nFax 949.476.0900\nkanderle@kelleranderle.com\nwww.kelleranderle.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kay-anderle-named-to-list-of-southern-california-super-lawyers-300589190.html\nSOURCE Keller/Anderle LLP",
