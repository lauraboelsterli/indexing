    "text": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sientra, Inc. (NASDAQ:SIEN) (“Sientra” or the “Company”), a medical aesthetics company, today announced that on January 19, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved equity award grants under the Sientra Inc. Inducement Plan to 46 new employees, including to 39 new employees in connection with the Company’s acquisition of miraDry, Inc. (f/k/a Miramar Labs, Inc.).\nThe new employees were granted restricted stock units representing a total of 257,235 shares of common stock. The restricted stock units will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the grant date. In each case, the vesting of shares is contingent upon the individual’s continued employment with the Company through each vesting date.\nThe grants were made as an inducement that was a material component of each person’s compensation and subsequent acceptance of employment with the Company or joining Sientra’s subsidiary following Sientra’s acquisition of miraDry, Inc. and was granted as an employment inducement award pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) approved by the Compensation Committee.\nAbout Sientra\nHeadquartered in Santa Barbara, California, Sientra is a medical aesthetics company committed to making a difference in patients’ lives by enhancing their body image, growing their self-esteem and restoring their confidence.
