    "text": " 13 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Patriots, Eagles ready for Super Bowl showdown Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - The New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles have set up a second Super Bowl showdown after both teams won their respective conference championships with contrasting victories on Sunday. \nThe reigning NFL champion Patriots overcame a stubborn Jacksonville Jaguars 24-20 in the AFC title game, while the Eagles crushed the Minnesota Vikings 38-7 in the NFC decider to set up a Feb. 4 clash in Minneapolis. \nNew England enjoyed the upper hand when the two last contested an NFL title game in 2005, winning 24-21, and should the favoured Patriots repeat that triumph, they will secure a record-tying sixth Super Bowl victory. \nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are currently the only team with more NFL championships than the Patriots, who will be making their 10th appearance in the title game. \nPhiladelphia has never won a Super Bowl, the Eagles also losing in 1981 before that Patriots defeat 13 years ago. \nOverall, the teams have met have 13 times through the years, with the Eagles winning seven of the games, the last in 2015.

Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports \nTom Brady, despite an injured hand, rallied New England from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter with two touchdown passes to Danny Amendola to beat Jacksonville, \nPhiladelphia had its own quarterback star to thank for their victory when Nick Foles passed for three touchdowns as the Eagles scored 38 unanswered points.
