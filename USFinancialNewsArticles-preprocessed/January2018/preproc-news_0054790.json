    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The Southern District of Texas Houston Division, case no. 4:18-cv-0259, on behalf of shareholders of Civeo Corporation, (\"Civeo\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CVEO) who held Civeo securities and have been harmed by Civeo and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S,C. §§78n(a) and 78t(a) respectively, and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9 in connection with acquisition of Noralta Lodge Ltd. (\"Noralta\") by Civeo through a merger transaction as alleged in detail herein (\"Proposed Transaction\").\nThe complaint alleges that the Merger Consideration appears excessive, and the process by which Defendants agreed to consummate the Proposed Transaction is fundamentally unfair to Plaintiff and Civeo's other public stockholders. In particular, the 14A contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) financial projections for the Company, Noralta, and the synergies expected to result from the Proposed Transaction; (ii) the valuation analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisor, Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (\"Lazard\"); and (iii) the background process leading up to the Proposed Transaction.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
