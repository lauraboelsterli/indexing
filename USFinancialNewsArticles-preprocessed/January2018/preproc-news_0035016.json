    "text": "Published: Jan 22, 2018 4:52 p.m. ET Share \nRum giant plans wider distribution of the premium tequila Getty Images Patrón is now the premium-tequila industry’s leader, with U.S. sales of $1.6 billion in 2016. \nBy Cara Lombardo \nBacardi Ltd. is buying the maker of Patrón tequila in a deal that values the premium brand at $5.1 billion, said people familiar with the matter, one of the biggest liquor deals in years as rivals scramble to own more top shelf spirits. \nBacardi, best known for its namesake rum, has held a roughly 25% stake in Patrón Spirits International AG for nearly a decade, the people said. Bacardi is now buying full control with plans to distribute the Mexican-made liquor more widely and cash in on demand for high-end tequila, they added. \nThe two privately held companies are expected to announce the transaction as soon as Monday, the people said. \nOver the last decade, global liquor makers have tried to adjust their portfolios to keep up with changing consumer tastes, especially as overall volumes fall and drinkers shift away from beer, vodka and rum. As part of that effort, producers have tried to change tequila from an inexpensive party drink to a more refined spirit comparable to a single-malt Scotch.",
