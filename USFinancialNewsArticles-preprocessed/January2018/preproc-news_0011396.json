Soccer Football - Football Association of Wales - Ryan Giggs Press Conference - Hensol Castle, Vale of Glamorgan, Britain - January 15, 2018 New Wales manager Ryan Giggs poses with a Wales shirt after the press conference REUTERS/Rebecca Naden \nThe 44-year-old takes over from Chris Coleman, who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals but quit the job in November to take charge of English Championship (second tier) side Sunderland. \nGiggs won 64 caps between 1991 and 2007 but was unpopular with some Wales fans for missing many internationals, especially friendlies. \nHe ended his playing career in 2014 and was Louis van Gaal’s assistant at Old Trafford for the following two seasons before leaving United in 2016 after Jose Mourinho was appointed as manager.
