Master Blenders 1753 business with the coffee business of Mondelez International Inc.\nThe information below is compiled from JAB statements and company websites.\nDR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP Location: Plano, Texas Founded: Spun off from Cadbury Plc in 2008 Transaction: Keurig Green Mountain Inc said it would buy the soda maker in a deal worth more than $21 billion, with Dr Pepper Snapple retaining 13 percent of the new company. JAB will be the controlling shareholder of the new, publicly-traded Keurig Dr Pepper, while Keurig shareholder Mondelez will own about 13-14 percent. Market presence: In addition to its namesake brands, Dr Pepper Snapple sells 7UP, Canada Dry, Schweppes, Hawaiian Punch, Mott’s and Vita Coco coconut water. It has a market capitalization of $17.3 billion, as of Friday’s close.\nAU BON PAIN Location: Boston Founded: 1981 Transaction: Panera Bread said in November 2017 it had entered an agreement to buy Au Bon Pain Holdings Co.
