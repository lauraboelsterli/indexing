    "text": " 43 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Standard Chartered creates fintech investment unit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) said on Wednesday it had established a business unit to invest in financial technology and promote innovation. \nDubbed SC Ventures, it will include internal consultants to help the rest of the group solve problems with technology and a team to sponsor and oversee new disruptive technology ventures owned by StanChart. \nAnother part of the new unit will focus on managing the bank’s minority investments in ‘fintech’ and seeking new ones to back. \n“As new technology continues to play an ever more important role in banking, there is a huge opportunity for us to promote more innovation,” said Michael Gorriz, group chief information officer. \nStanChart already backs Ripple, a payments company built on distributed ledger technology, and data firm Paxata. \nThe unit will be managed by Alex Manson, previously global head of transaction banking at StanChart.
