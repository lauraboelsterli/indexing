What the politicians don’t understand is these are people,” Colm Kelleher told a conference in Dublin, in reference to Britain’s planned exit from the European Union in March 2019. \nAsked if the bank would need to know by the end of March the terms of the transition agreement that will ease Britain out of the bloc, Kelleher said that was “pretty fair” and that the size of any moves would depend on the shape of the Brexit deal.
