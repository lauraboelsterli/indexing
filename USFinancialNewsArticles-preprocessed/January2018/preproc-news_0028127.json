On Thursday night, the chamber appeared to lack the vote to pass the House-passed measure as many Democrats and a few Republicans announced their opposition to it.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then set the stage for a Friday vote, to put more pressure on members to pass the legislation or risk shutting down the government.\nThe GOP bill would fund the government through Feb. 16, reauthorize the popular Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and delay some Affordable Care Act taxes. Republicans hold control of the House, Senate and White House.\nRead more:\nTrump warns shutdown could be coming as Senate fights over spending plan",
