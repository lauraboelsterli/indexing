    "text": "(Reuters) - Most emerging Asian currencies climbed on Wednesday, with the yuan touching a more than two-year high, as the dollar extended its weak run against a basket of major currencies to a fresh three-year low.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, slipped below 90 for the first time since December 2014.\nThe dollar touched a four-month low against the yen on Wednesday, pressured by simmering concerns that the U.S. currency’s yield advantage will start to erode as major central banks head toward unwinding their massive stimulus.\n“I couldn’t put it (Asian currencies’ gain) down to any specific reasons for any specific currencies; it is more a broad-based dollar weakness against most Asian currencies,” said Nizam Idris, head of strategy, fixed income and currencies, at Macquarie Bank Ltd, Singapore.\nIn emerging currencies, the Taiwan dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent, while the Thai baht was on track to gain for five straight sessions, up as much as 0.4 percent to more than a four-year high.\nThailand’s central bank will not intervene in the baht for trade advantage but will act only to smooth out its excessive moves, the governor said on Tuesday.\nBoth currencies were the best performers in the region.\nChina’s yuan edged up as much as 0.4 percent, its firmest since December 2015.\nThe Malaysian ringgit rose for a fourth straight session, up as much as 0.2 percent to a nearly two-year high, while the Philippine peso inched up as much as 0.3 percent after a weak session on Tuesday.\nThe Indian rupee scaled as much as 0.2 percent, while the Singapore dollar, also up as much as 0.2 percent, hit a three-year high.\nYUAN China’s yuan on Wednesday rose for a seventh straight session and reached its strongest in more than two years against the U.S. dollar, which continued to weaken.\nContinued dollar weakness has driven gains for the yuan to about 1.8 percent this year. In 2017, the Chinese currency strengthened around 6.8 percent, following three years of depreciating against the dollar.\nPrior to market opening, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set its official yuan midpoint at the strongest level in more than two years at 6.3916 per dollar.\nIn the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.3983 per dollar and rose to 6.3850 per dollar at one point in morning trade, the strongest since Dec. 4, 2015.\nThe following table shows rates for Asian currencies against the dollar at 0525 GMT.\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR Currency Latest bid Previous day Pct Move\nJapan yen 109.910 110.29 +0.35\nSing dlr 1.315 1.3169 +0.16\nTaiwan dlr 29.260 29.402 +0.49\nKorean won 1069.300 1070.2 +0.08\nBaht 31.704 31.83 +0.40\nPeso 51.010 51.1 +0.18\nRupiah 13323.000 13320 -0.02\nRupee 63.643 63.77 +0.20\nRinggit 3.915 3.925 +0.26\nYuan 6.391 6.4084 +0.28\nChange in 2018\nCurrency Latest bid End 2017 Pct Move\nJapan yen 109.910 112.67 +2.51\nSing dlr 1.315 1.3373 +1.71\nTaiwan dlr 29.260 29.848 +2.01\nKorean won 1069.300 1070.50 +0.11\nBaht 31.704 32.58 +2.76\nPeso 51.010 49.93 -2.12\nRupiah 13323.000 13565 +1.82\nRupee 63.643 63.87 +0.36\nRinggit 3.915 4.0440 +3.30\nYuan 6.391 6.5069 +1.82\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aaron Saldanha; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
