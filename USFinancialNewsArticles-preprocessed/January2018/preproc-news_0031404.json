    "text": "January 19, 2018 / 1:51 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago Former world champion Fury has licence suspension lifted Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury is set to resume his career after the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) lifted his suspension subject to medical clearance. \nThe BBBC had suspended the 29-year-old’s licence in 2016, citing anti-doping and medical issues, and he has not fought since beating the previously undefeated Wladimir Klitschko to claim the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles in November 2015. \nFury accepted a backdated two-year doping ban last December and this month announced that he was applying to have his licence reinstated. \n“Following an interview with Tyson Fury at the British Boxing Board of Control offices earlier today, the suspension of his British Boxing Board of Control boxer’s licence will be lifted subject to receipt and clearance of all medical requirements,” the BBBC said on its website.

Along with the sunshine there has to be a little rain sometimes! There will be no victory without pain.” \nFury has previously scheduled his possible return for April, by when IBF and WBA champion Anthony Joshua will have met WBO title holder Joseph Parker in a unification bout.
