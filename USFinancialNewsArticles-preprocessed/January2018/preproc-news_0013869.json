    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO) fourth quarter comparable sales to date have increased 8%. The company is reiterating its previously issued fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $0.42 to $0.44 per diluted share. This compares to Adjusted EPS* of $0.39 last year.\nJay Schottenstein, Chief Executive Officer commented, “We are extremely pleased to report a successful holiday season with record sales and strong momentum across the American Eagle and Aerie brands. Customers responded well to our merchandise offerings, which fueled positive traffic both online and in stores.”\nEarnings guidance excludes the impact of tax reform and potential asset impairment and restructuring charges. The company will release fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results on March 8, 2018 and will host a conference call to review financial results on that date.\n*Adjusted amounts are based on Non-GAAP results, as presented in the accompanying GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release includes information on non-GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP” or “adjusted”), including earnings per share information and the consolidated results of operations excluding non-GAAP items. These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The company believes that this non-GAAP information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate the company’s operating performance, when reviewed in conjunction with the company’s GAAP financial statements. These amounts are not determined in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be used exclusively in evaluating the company’s business and operations.\nAbout American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE: AEO) is a leading global specialty retailer offering high-quality, on-trend clothing, accessories and personal care products at affordable prices under its American Eagle Outfitters® and Aerie® brands.

All forward-looking statements made by the company involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond the company's control.
