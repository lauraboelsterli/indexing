    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 2:16 PM / Updated an hour ago Coke bottler proposes shake-up to cost a net 167 UK jobs Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Drinks bottler Coca-Cola European Partners CCE.N is proposing to close a UK factory and distribution centre, resulting in the loss of 288 jobs. \nAt the same time, the seller of Coca-Cola ( KO.N ) drinks plans to transfer production and warehousing to other sites in Britain, creating 121 jobs. \nThe net result would be the loss of 167 jobs. \n“We believe the proposed changes are necessary as they would provide significant productivity improvements and create greater efficiency across our manufacturing and distribution operations in Great Britain,” a spokesman said. \nThe closures, of a factory in Milton Keynes and a distribution centre in Northampton, are planned for 2019. \nThey are the result of a strategic review of the company’s production network aimed at boosting efficiency, according to a spokesman. \nSoft drink sales have been sluggish for years as health-conscious consumers cut back. Britain’s sugar tax, which comes into effect in April, is expected to add further pressure. \nAs UK businesses grapple with the expected implications of Brexit, several companies have announced job cuts, including Britvic ( BVIC.L ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ), which are exiting a joint site in Norwich.
