    "text": "I recently read an article in The New York Times that detailed how, over the past 12 years, the number of women who have achieved \"millionairess\" status has doubled.\nMoodboard | Getty Images Also, based on a recent Fidelity report that surveyed 15 million 401(k) plan participants, 20 percent of respondents with $1 million or more in retirement accounts are women. They invested wisely in stocks, saved more than 18 percent of their salaries and developed a consistent habit of contributing to their 401(k) plans. Many earn less than $150,000 annually, which makes the ability to reach this benchmark even more impressive.\nAchieving this goal doesn't change who you are, but it can change how you plan for your future. You worked hard and saved more, and now you have options. I've consulted with clients who have achieved this level of financial success. They've reached an incredible goal, and if you're a member of the 401(k) Millionairess Club along with them, congratulations are in order.\nCelebrate yourself, but know that you're not done. The discipline and tenacity that carried you into the retirement savings elite will elevate you to your next set of financial goals.\nHere are some other areas that you can now focus on:\nActively fund a Roth 401(k) plan. You may now look at setting aside money in a Roth 401(k). By putting money there, you will have the option to withdraw your funds tax-free when you retire. Under current tax law, as long as your money has been held in the account for five years, you can access it tax-free after you turn 59½ and — as an added bonus — you do not have to take required minimum distributions.\nMore from Investor Toolkit:\nAdvisors turn to life coaches and counselors",
