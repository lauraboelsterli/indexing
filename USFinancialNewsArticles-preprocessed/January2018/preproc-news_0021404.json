Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - FC Nantes vs Paris St Germain - The Stade de la Beaujoire - Louis Fonteneau, Nantes, France - January 14, 2018 Nantes' Diego Carlos is shown a red card by referee Tony Chapron REUTERS/Stephane Mahe \nDuring stoppage-time, Chapron bumped into Carlos and fell over with TV footage showing him swinging his leg towards the running defender’s shins. \n“The technical direction of refereeing and the federal commission of refereeing have decided on the withdrawal of Tony Chapron, who had been appointed for Wednesday’s Ligue 1 game between Angers and Troyes, until further notice,” the French federation said in a statement on Monday. \nChapron will also be summoned before the league’s disciplinary committee. \nA few seconds after the incident, Chapron gave Carlos a yellow card, which resulted in the player being sent off as he had also been booked in the first half. \nChapron apologised to Carlos on Monday. \n“This clumsy gesture was inappropriate. I therefore wish to apologise to Diego Carlos,” he was quoted as saying in French media. \nNantes said in a statement that they asked the league to cancel Carlos’s red card after the French federation said Chapron had amended his match report to explain that the player’s move was not intentional. \n“I know that refereeing is tough, but the referee sometimes need to put himself into question,” Nantes forward Valentin Rongier said. \n“If we do something like this, we get a 10-game suspension.” \nNantes president Waldemar Kita told L‘Equipe: “It’s a joke. I got 20 SMS from all over the world telling me that this referee is a joke. What do you want me to tell you? If I talk too much, I’ll be summoned by an ethics committee.” Reporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Ed Osmond",
