    "text": "The secretary of the Homeland Security Department is testifying under oath that she \"did not hear\" President Donald Trump use a certain vulgarity to describe African countries. But she says she doesn't \"dispute the president was using tough language.\"\nTrump has been accused of using the word \"s--thole\" to describe African countries during an Oval Office meeting Thursday with a bipartisan group of six senators, according to people briefed on the conversation.\nSecretary Kirstjen Nielsen is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt., asked her specifically if she heard the vulgarity used or a \"substantially similar word\" to describe certain countries.\nNielsen says the conversation was impassioned and the president was using tough language. She says \"others in the room were also using tough language.\"",
