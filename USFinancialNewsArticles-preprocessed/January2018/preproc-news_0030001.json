The two reports are due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nThe Federal Reserve said on Wednesday the U.S. economy and inflation expanded at a modest-to-moderate pace from late November through the end of 2017, while wages continued to push higher.\nAlcoa fell about 6 percent after the aluminum producer’s quarterly earnings missed estimates as a drought in Brazil hit bauxite production and higher power prices in Spain boosted expenses.\nIBM and American Express are expected to report after market close.
