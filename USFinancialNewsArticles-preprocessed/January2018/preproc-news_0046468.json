    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 11:17 AM / in 6 minutes Atlas Copco misses fourth-quarter profit expectations, forecasts stable demand Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Atlas Copco ( ATCOa.ST ) on Friday missed fourth quarter profit forecasts and forecast stable demand this quarter, knocking shares in the Swedish engineering company. \nThe maker of compressors and underground mining equipment said operating profit rose to 6.23 billion Swedish crowns ($791 million) from 5.79 billion, falling short of the 6.51 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. \nAdjusted operating profit was up 13.5 percent to 6.64 billion, topping the 12.6 percent advance expected by analysts. \nThe Swedish firm, which is planning to spin-off its mining and civil engineering business under the name Epiroc this year, proposed an ordinary dividend of 7 crowns per share and an extra payout of 8 crowns through a mandatory share redemption. \nAnalysts had expected a dividend of 8.26 crowns, including some expectations for a special dividend. \nOrders in the fourth quarter were up 14 percent year on year on an organic basis at 30.4 billion crowns, in line with the 30.3 billion forecast by analysts. \nIt said it expected overall demand for the group to remain at the “current high level”. \nThe shares, up nearly 30 percent in the past 12 months, were down 4 percent at 1251 GMT. \n”A flat outlook indicates that things may have peaked given the extremely strong first quarter order intake last year, Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Peder Frolen said. \n“I also think there were expectations for an even larger dividend payout out there, and those two things are weighing on the stock.” \nExpectations were boosted ahead of Atlas Copco’s results by forecast-beating results from mining equipment maker Caterpillar ( CAT.N ) on Thursday.
