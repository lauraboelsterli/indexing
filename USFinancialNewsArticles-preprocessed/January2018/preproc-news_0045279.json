    "text": "SINGAPORE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a four-month low against the yen on Wednesday, pressured by simmering concerns that the U.S. currencyâ€™s yield advantage will start to erode as major central banks head toward unwinding their massive stimulus.\nThe dollar touched a low of 110.06 yen at one point, its lowest level since Sept. 15, and was last trading at 110.16 yen, down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday.
