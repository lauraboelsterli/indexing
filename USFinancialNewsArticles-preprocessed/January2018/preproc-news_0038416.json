Such delays often occur at this time of year.\nIraq has been boosting exports from its southern terminals, which handle most exports to offset a halt in shipments from its northern Kirkuk oilfields in mid-October after Iraqi forces seized control of fields from Kurdish fighters.\nNorthern exports have averaged 320,000 bpd so far in January, compared with an estimated 310,000 bpd in December, according to shipping data and the industry source. That is far below levels of more than 500,000 bpd in some months of 2017.\nTotal exports from Iraq in January were 3.76 million bpd, down 90,000 bpd from December.\nNorthern exports could rise slightly if Iraq goes ahead with a plan to export Kirkuk oil to Iran before the end January. Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that initially about 30,000 bpd would be trucked to an Iranian refinery.\nOPEC, Russia and other producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018 in an effort to get rid of a global crude glut and support prices.\nIraq showed less compliance to the supply deal than its OPEC peers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, for much of 2017, but the drop in Kirkuk output boosted Iraqi and overall compliance.\nReporting by Alex Lawler; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
