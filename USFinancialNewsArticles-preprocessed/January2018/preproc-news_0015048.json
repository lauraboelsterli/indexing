The acquisition increases the number of Crunch locations in Massachusetts five-fold, growing the club base from two clubs to ten in the Boston area.\nThe eight Boost fitness centers, located in Auburn, Oxford, Fitchburg, Franklin, Hudson, Tewksbury, Westford and Worcester, were converted to Crunch Fitness clubs and began operating under the Crunch brand on January 1, 2018.\nThe deal nearly doubles the number of Fitness Holdings clubs, bringing the total club count to 18, with 80,000 members across Massachusetts and the Tri-State area. As part of the acquisition, Mark Federico, who founded Boost Fitness in 2005, will join Fitness Holdings as a partner.\nAccording to Fitness Holdings, LLC partner Steve Viscardi, \"The Boost acquisition represents a unique opportunity to provide our existing and new members with the high quality, affordable fitness experience Crunch is known for.
