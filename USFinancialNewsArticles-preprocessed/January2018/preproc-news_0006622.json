    "text": "DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTD Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq:FTD) (“FTD” or the “Company”), a premier floral and gifting company, today announced the appointment of Steven Barnhart, a veteran financial and e-commerce leader, as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective Jan. 8, 2018. Barnhart brings to FTD extensive prior experience as a public company chief financial officer and has a track record of delivering growth and profitability, maximizing shareholder value, and developing and executing on corporate strategy at leading consumer and e-commerce organizations.\nMost recently Barnhart served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Bankrate, Inc., a leading publicly traded internet publisher, aggregator, and distributor of personal finance content, from Sept. 2014 until the sale of the company in Nov. 2017. Prior to Bankrate, from 2012 to 2014, Barnhart served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, a leading appliance retailer, completing the rights offering that separated that business from Sears Holdings. From 2010 to 2012 he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Bally Total Fitness, which was a leading operator of fitness centers across the United States. From 2003 to 2009, Barnhart served in several roles with Orbitz Worldwide, an online travel company, including President and Chief Executive Officer, board member, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Planning. As President and CEO from 2007 to 2009, Barnhart led its public offering in 2007 while operating as a division of Travelport. Before joining Orbitz, he worked in a variety of finance and strategy roles over 13 years with PepsiCo. He has a Master of Business Administration in Finance from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Chicago.\n“We are excited to welcome Steven to our team. His extensive experience across e-commerce and consumer goods companies will be valuable to our organization as we embark on an ambitious strategic agenda,” commented John Walden, FTD’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Steven is a well-regarded public company financial executive with significant leadership experience managing financial and accounting functions in environments of rapid change, as well as driving strategic business performance. He will be a strong addition to our leadership team and a fantastic business partner.”\nWalden continued, “I also would like to thank Brian Cooper for his contributions. He swiftly stepped in as interim Chief Financial Officer in September of 2017 and has been an effective and professional leader.”\nSteve Barnhart commented, “I am excited to join FTD with its leading family of floral and gifting brands. I look forward to working closely with John and the entire FTD team as we execute on our future strategic initiatives to create value for our shareholders.”\nAbout FTD Companies, Inc.\nFTD Companies, Inc. is a premier floral and gifting company.
