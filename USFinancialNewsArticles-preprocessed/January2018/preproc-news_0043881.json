    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 9:25 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Illumina wins $26.7 million in patent fight with Roche unit Ariosa Jan Wolfe 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Gene testing company Illumina on Thursday won a $26.7 million jury verdict in a U.S. lawsuit accusing rival Ariosa Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Roche Holdings AG, of using patented prenatal testing technology without authorization. \nA federal jury in San Francisco said Ariosaâ€™s Harmony non-invasive prenatal test kits infringed on two Illumina patents. \nIllumina and Ariosa compete in the growing market for non-invasive prenatal tests, which screen for chromosomal conditions like Down syndrome. \nSan Diego, California-based Illumina had sought more than $100 million in damages. \nThe jury rejected a counterclaim by Ariosa that Illumina had breached a contract between the companies by bringing the lawsuit. Ariosa had sought $88 million in damages from Illumina on that counterclaim. \nIllumina and Ariosa did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nRoche acquired San Jose, California-based Ariosa for $625 million in January 2015.
