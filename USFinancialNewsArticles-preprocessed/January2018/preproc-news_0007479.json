While there, David is credited with a long list of accomplishments, from building an integrated multiple-site physical therapy practice to directing the design and construction of two AAAHC accredited ambulatory surgical facilities to provide increased access to the area's growing need for high-quality orthopaedic surgical services and care.\nIn addition, Davies' prior leadership role as CEO of Mercy Regional Health System in Altoona, Pennsylvania, a 182-bed flagship hospital and regional referral facility for oncology, spine care, vascular, geriatric psychiatry and rehabilitation services, greatly shaped his deep understanding of the importance of consistently delivering exceptional patient experiences and quality outcomes.\n\"It is a true honor to be selected as the next leader of POA,\" said Davies. \"This is an outstanding organization with a long history of excellence. In coming here, I know I have joined a team that together will continue its steadfast focus on delivering a level of orthopaedic care and rehabilitation services to the communities we serve normally reserved for academic medical centers.\"\nAbout Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates\nPeninsula Orthopaedic Associates is a multi-specialty orthopaedic practice that has been offering communities across the Delmarva Peninsula an expansive continuum of orthopaedic services for over 50 years.
