    "text": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is running for re-election this year and President in 2020, and apparently he thinks his killer app is opposition to the GOP tax bill. Judging by his proposals so far, we’d say this is going to be harder than he thinks.\nThe Governor last week released his 2018 budget along with proposals to “reform” New York’s taxes that on their face appear to conflict. On the one hand, Mr. Cuomo wants to minimize the effects of the GOP bill’s $10,000 state-and-local-tax deduction limit on his state’s high earners. ",
