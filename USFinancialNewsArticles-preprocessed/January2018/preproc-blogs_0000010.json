    "text": "Published: Jan 2, 2018 5:59 p.m. ET Share \nFew mainstream investors have bought large sums of bitcoin, scared off by concerns about cybersecurity and liquidity Getty Images \nBy Rob Copeland \nOne of the biggest names in Silicon Valley is placing a moonshot bet on bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.72% . \nFounders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm’s most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. \nFounders and Thiel, 50 years old, are well-known for early investments in companies like Facebook Inc. FB, +2.81% that sometimes take years to come to fruition. The bitcoin bet is quickly showing promise. Founders bought around $15 million to $20 million in bitcoin, and it has told investors the firm’s haul is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the digital currency’s ripping rise in the past year. \nIt isn’t clear if Founders has sold any of its holdings yet. The bet hasn’t been previously reported.",
