    "text": "6:01 AM EST \nTiffany Haddish’s love for Groupon is sending her to the Super Bowl. \nThe Girls Trip actress went viral last summer, when she told Jimmy Kimmel a story about taking co-star Jada Pinkett-Smith and husband Will Smith on a Groupon swamp tour while filming in New Orleans. \nThe hilarious re-telling, which included the revelation that the Smiths had no idea what Groupon (grpn) was, apparently spread quickly through the ranks of the discount e-commerce site. The company decided that they wanted to work with the actress and offered her a role as spokesperson. Now, she’ll be featured in a series of ads for the company, including its first Super Bowl commercial in seven years, which will air during the fourth quarter of the game. \nRead: Want to Get Paid to Attend the 2018 Super Bowl? Here’s How \nAccording to Groupon’s head of marketing for North America, Jon Wild , when the company looked into Haddish, they not only found that the actress is a bonafide fan of its service, but that she is actually in the top 1% of most frequent purchasers. “She knows our product better than a lot of Groupon employees,” Wild said. “She could name what she’d done, the experience she had and how much she’d saved.” \nThat expertise not only landed Haddish the spokesperson gig, but also effectively made her an honorary employee. Groupon has also given Haddish her own section of the site, given her access to the employee app, and “ put some Groupon bucks in her account .” \nWatch Haddish’s announcement here: SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
