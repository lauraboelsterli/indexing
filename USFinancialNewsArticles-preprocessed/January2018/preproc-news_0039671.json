    "text": "MOLINE, Ill., Jan. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QCR Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCRH) announced today that its 2017 fourth quarter earnings results will be released at the close of market on February 1, 2018. As previously announced, the Company completed the acquisition of Guaranty Bank and Trust Company during the fourth quarter. The finalization of the purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition and the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, as discussed further below, will cause the Company to release fourth quarter earnings results at that time.\nThe Company will host an earnings call/webcast on February 2, 2018 at 10 a.m. central time. Douglas M. Hultquist, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Todd A. Gipple, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will conduct the teleconference/webcast. Shareholders, analysts and other interested parties are invited to join.\nThe earnings call will be broadcast over the internet on the Company’s website, or interested parties may listen to the Company’s earnings call via teleconference. Participants should visit the Company’s website or call in to the conference line set forth below at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start of the call.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act introduces tax reform that reduces the current corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, among other changes. The corporate tax rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018. The Company has determined that the Tax Act requires a revaluation of its net deferred tax asset. Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense as changes in tax laws are enacted.\nThe Company has determined that, based on current information, the Tax Act's impact will be to increase the value of the Company's net deferred tax asset by approximately $2.9 million, which will be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017. While the Company is in a net deferred tax asset position, certain tax credits that are components of the net deferred tax assets do not require revaluation. Excluding these tax credits the Company is in a net deferred tax liability position and this net deferred tax liability position will now be valued at the Company’s new lower corporate income tax rate of 21%. The impact is an increase in fourth quarter 2017 earnings of approximately $0.21 per share and a 1% increase in tangible book value as of December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to increasing earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Act is expected to be an ongoing benefit to the Company. Management plans to comment on the impact of the new lower corporate tax rate during the fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe Company’s revaluation of its net deferred tax asset and other relevant details remain subject to modifications as the Company finalizes its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as information and analysis regarding the Tax Act and other relevant factors emerge.\nTeleconference:\nDial-in information for the call is toll-free 1-888-317-6016 (international 1-412-317-6016). Participants should request to join the QCR Holdings, Inc. call. The event will be archived and available for digital replay through February 16, 2018.
