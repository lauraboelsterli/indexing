    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 8:41 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago European shares pull back as trading updates disappoint   \nMILAN (Reuters) - Earnings updates and dealmaking activity drove the biggest share price moves in Europe on Wednesday as the broader market followed U.S. stocks lower following a strong start of the year. \nBritain’s Informa ( INF.L ) dropped 5.4 percent after it made a paper and cash offer to buy UK events organiser UBM ( UBM.L ), which shot up 16 percent. \nLuxury fashion brand Burberry ( BRBY.L ) and educational publishing company Pearson ( PSON.L ) were among the top fallers in Europe after disappointing trading updates. \nTheir losses along with weakness in the heavyweight financial and healthcare sectors dragged the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.3 percent by 0814 GMT. The UK's FTSE .FTSE also fell by 0.3 percent. \nBritish contractor Interserve ( IRV.L ) tumbled 10 percent after the Financial Times reported that government ministers are “very worried” and have set up a team of officials to monitor the company following the collapse of competitor Carillion. \nTech .SX8P was among the few sectors in positive territory, underpinned by a 3.6 percent surge in ASML ( ASML.AS ). \nThe Dutch chipmaking equipment supplier posted better-than-expected net profit in the fourth quarter as customers asked for early delivery of products as semiconductor demand booms. \nDespite Wednesday’s decline, the STOXX remains close to the 2 1/2 year high hit early this month on confidence over the region’s economic recovery and the upcoming earnings season. \n\"Conditions for a recovery of European equities are there but the over-extension of gains on the S&P 500 .SPX represent a risk in the short term,\" said Anthilia Capital fund manager Giuseppe Sersale.
