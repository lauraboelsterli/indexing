    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First GREEN Bank , a local bank with a global mission, announces today its 2017 annual earnings of $4,536,000. This was an increase of 250 percent from the bank’s 2016 earnings of $1,300,000. These impressive earnings are after a one-time charge related to the tax law change of $377,000. The growth in earnings is the result of the bank’s expansion into South Florida, in addition to the continued high performance of the Central Florida offices.\n“Our team of outstanding bankers continues to impress me through their ability to out maneuver their larger and usually cheaper competition on lending to small and mid-sized companies,” said Keith Costello, president & CEO of First GREEN Bank. “It truly is a testament to the fact that business owners still recognize the value of a local banking relationship.”\nAssets of the bank also increased substantially from $542 million to $702 million from the end of December 2016 to end of December 2017. This 30 percent balance sheet growth was seen in loan as well as deposit growth.\n“With our country’s increased nationalism, erosion of our governmental institutions and the corresponding decrease in democracy, First GREEN Bank continues to operate as one of the few values-based financial institutions in America,” said founder and chairman of First GREEN Bank, Ken LaRoe. “We proudly operate with total transparency and good corporate governance.”\nFirst GREEN Bank is a full-service financial institution, offering personal and commercial banking services such as loans, mortgages, checking and savings, CDs, IRAs and money markets.
