    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- St. Claire Consultants is pleased to announce that it arranged the debt financing and assisted with the due diligence of Wentworth Management Services LLC's acquisition of Albany-based Purshe Kaplan Sterling Investments, an independent broker-dealer with 485 offices in 50 states.\nDail St. Claire , Founder, St. Claire Consultants & Advisory Director, Park Avenue Finance, New York, states: \"The private debt market historically provides capital to businesses generally not served by banks, thereby fueling jobs and local economies.\" Ms. St. Claire adds, \"Tax reform will have a significant impact on the evolution of the private debt markets. The limitation on the deductibility of interest expense is going to drive financial innovation around different types of lending.\"\nMonroe Capital LLC acted as sole lead arranger and administrative agent on the funding of a $43.5-million senior credit facility to support the acquisition.
