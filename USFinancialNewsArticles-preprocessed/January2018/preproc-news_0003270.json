    "text": "FALLS CHURCH, Va., Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kastle Systems International, the industry leader in innovative managed security solutions and services, today announced that they have acquired Urban Alarm, a local DC-based security provider.\nFounded in 2003, Urban Alarm's clients include a mix of high-end, single-family residential homeowners, as well as commercial, institutional, and property management organizations throughout the metro DC area. Urban Alarm is the security provider and patrol service to several of the area's most prestigious single-family residential neighborhoods, such as Woodland Normanstone, and is responsible for many specialized security environments including embassies and ambassador residences. The company has also completed security projects for several large developers and properties including, in partnership with Kastle, The Wharf's 3 million square foot mixed-use development. Urban Alarm has grown quickly due to its reputation for exemplary security service providing access control, video surveillance, guard patrol services, remote video monitoring and NICET certified fire and life safety services.\n\"We are thrilled to bring Urban Alarm into the Kastle family and to expand our business into several new areas including the single-family residential market. Our customer bases, product offerings and geographic coverage are extremely complementary, which will provide significant growth opportunities going forward,\" said Mark Ein, Chairman of Kastle Systems. \"Above all and most importantly, Kastle and Urban Alarm share a culture, passion and reputation for providing the highest levels of service for clients with sophisticated security needs.\"\nBecause of this acquisition, Kastle now has a unique opportunity to take its innovations in technology and service, developed for commercial and multifamily real estate owners, into DC's single-family residential homeowner market. Kastle has consistently earned the distinction of being named DC's #1 Security Company by the Washington Business Journal. With this acquisition, Kastle will not only expand its market presence and skilled workforce but also enable a unified, seamless security experience for customers, who will now be able to use a single electronic credential for both their home and their office.\nThe acquisition includes several important synergies including the ability to leverage Kastle's UL listed, TMA Five Diamond-certified central stations for alarm and video monitoring of Urban Alarm's customers and providing Urban Alarm's NICET certified fire and life safety services to Kastle's extensive local customer base. Additionally, the combination of key talent and intellectual property will provide both companies the ability to comprehensively address the growing security needs across all sectors of the metro DC market.\n\"This is a great opportunity for our business, our employees and our clients,\" said Miles Fawcett, CEO of Urban Alarm. \"By joining Kastle, we are part of an organization with a long-term perspective that will enable us to offer the same premium customer experience, and introduce new, innovative offerings that I know our clients will love.\"\nFor more information about Kastle Systems or Urban Alarm, contact Jennifer Graham, Vice President of Marketing at 703-247-0298 or jennifer@kastle.com .
