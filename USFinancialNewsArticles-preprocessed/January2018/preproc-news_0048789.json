    "text": "PARIS/NICE (Reuters) - France’s highest administrative court on Monday overturned a ban on breeding killer whales and dolphins in captivity after ruling there had been irregularities in the decree putting the legislation into place.\nThe ban was imposed in May as part of the previous administration’s attempts to improve the living conditions of captive marine mammals in marine parks.\nIt mirrored a move in California to outlaw breeding of killer whales and which was aimed at bringing an end to the practice of holding the creatures in tanks for human entertainment.\nFILE PHOTO: A dolphin performs during a press visit at the Marineland zoo in Antibes before its reopening, six months after the flooding that affected the French Riviera in October 2015, in Antibes, France, March 17, 2016.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo But several marine parks opposed the measure, saying that putting the ban into practice could be cruel.\n“This is great news for our animals and zoos. This decree could have been a threat to our institutions,” said Pascal Picot, chief executive of Marineland Antibes in southern France, the largest marine park in Europe.\n“We want to update the regulation for cetaceans, which dates back to 1981, with the government and experts, on scientific grounds and not based on convictions,” he said in reference to animal rights groups.\nAccording to activists at uk.whales.org, there are around 3,000 whales and dolphins held in aquariums, zoos and marine parks globally.\nReporting by Matthias Galante; Writing by John Irish; Editing by Richard Lough\n ",
