    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), an industry leader in automated, scalable and secure networks, today announced an expansion of its capital return plan. Juniper today announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increase of its quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share to be paid on March 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2018. This reflects an increase of 80% compared to previous quarterly dividends. The Company intends to grow its dividend over time.\nAdditionally, the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion buyback authorization, which replaces the existing authorization. Juniper plans to enter into a $750 million accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter of this year, and intends to be opportunistic with its share repurchases thereafter.\n“Our expanded capital return program reinforces our ongoing commitment to delivering total shareholder value,” said Ken Miller, chief financial officer, Juniper Networks. “The new buyback authorization, anticipated ASR program and increased dividend announced today reflect our confidence in Juniper’s long-term strategy.”\nIn fiscal year 2017, Juniper repurchased $720 million worth of shares, including $330 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, and paid $150 million in dividends.\nJuniper will continue to review its capital return policy over time, subject to capital availability, company financial performance, economic outlook and other relevant considerations. Additional details of the new capital return program will be discussed during Juniper’s fourth quarter earnings call today, January 30, 2018, at 2:00 pm PT.\nJuniper today also reported preliminary financial results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and provided its outlook for the three months ending March 31, 2018.
