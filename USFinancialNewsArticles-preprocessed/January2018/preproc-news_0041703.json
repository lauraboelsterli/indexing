    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 12:46 PM / a minute ago Celgene's profit, sales beat on continued Revlimid strength Akankshita Mukhopadhyay 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s ( CELG.O ) quarterly profit and sales topped analysts’ estimates on strong demand for its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, sending its shares up more than 2 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. \nCelgene gets more than 60 percent of its revenue from its blockbuster drug Revlimid. Sales of which grew 21 percent to $2.19 billion, slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of $2.18 billion, according to Cowen & Co. \nThe beat comes at a time when Celgene announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics Inc ( JUNO.O ) and privately held Impact Biomedicines in efforts to reduce reliance on Revlimid by bulking up its cancer pipeline. \nCelgene, which had cash and cash equivalents of $12.04 billion as of Dec. 31, said it would buy Juno for $9 billion in cash and Impact for as much as $7 billion, contingent on milestones. \nSales of Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla came in at $371 million, well above the consensus estimate of $337 million. \n“Otezla U.S. strength suggests plenty of room for global growth,” Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note. \nCelgene posted a net loss of $81 million, or 10 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from a profit of $429 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. \nThe U.S. biotechnology company took a $1.21 billion income tax charge in the quarter due to the U.S. tax code overhaul. \nExcluding items, the company earned $2 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose 16.9 percent to $3.48 billion, ahead of analysts’ estimate of $3.46 billion. \nCelgene, which preannounced its 2017 and 2018 unaudited results earlier this month, reiterated its 2018 forecast.
