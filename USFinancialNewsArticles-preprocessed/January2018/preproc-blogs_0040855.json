Though the winners typically boast pricey rates, a handful have a history of being discounted in late winter and early spring. So now is your chance to book some Instagram-worthy accommodations.\nHere are five to check out.\nThe Nantucket Hotel & Resort — Nantucket, Massachusetts \nTripAdvisor's No. 1 hotel in the U.S. is described as \"grand and historic,\" and offers ocean and harbor views. The Nantucket Hotel & Resort has two heated pools, an outdoor hot tub, shuttles to ferries and beaches and overnight trips to its sister resort on Martha's Vineyard.\nAccording to TripAdvisor, the average annual price of the hotel is $530 per night, but in March and April, rates drop to $195 per night. Though the weather may be chilly, early spring has been touted as the best time to visit the charming island, due to the location's budget-friendly prices and thin crowds.\nHotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection — Manhattan, New York \nWhile New York City has hotels on almost every street corner, Hotel Giraffe stands out, and ranks seventh on TripAdvisor's list. Located on Park Avenue South and 26th Street in Manhattan, the hotel offers wine and cheese every evening, live piano music on weeknights and passes to New York Sports Club.\nThe hotel's average annual rate is $414 per night, but drops to $317 per night in February.\nFrench Quarter Inn — Charleston, South Carolina \nThis boutique hotel , located in the heart of downtown Charleston, snags the third spot on the list. The quaint inn offers complimentary breakfast, beach cruiser bikes stocked with sunscreen and souvenirs, sweet tea and snacks.\n\"Enter our cozy lobby, with its plush sofas, elegant fireplace and cut flowers, and you know you've discovered a hidden gem,\" its website states .\nThe average annual price is $457 per night, but in February, its most affordable month, rates drop to $393.\nThe Langham, Chicago — Chicago, Illinois \nThis luxurious Chicago hotel ranks ninth and is located minutes from Chicago hot spots like the Loop, Grant Park, the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and Navy Pier.\nIts club, on the top floor of the hotel, offers panoramic views of Chicago, Langham's famous afternoon tea and butler service. Its average annual price, according to TripAdvisor, is $538 per night, but in February, the price is slashed to $389 per night.\nStephanie Inn — Cannon Beach, Oregon \nThis \"iconic Pacific Northwest landmark,\" according to TripAdvisor, ranks fifth on the list. The inn is located about 80 miles from Portland and has views of the Pacific Ocean and Haystack Rock. Every guestroom has a gas fireplace and there's a complimentary late evening \"goodnight cap\" in the oceanfront library . The inn is just 28 steps from the beach.\nStephanie Inn's average annual price is $497 per night, but in March it's $408 per night.\nAverage nightly hotel rates are based on prices available on TripAdvisor from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2017, and the most affordable month to go rates are based on prices available on the site from Feb. 1 to Dec. 31, 2017. TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice awards are based on millions of reviews and opinions collected in a year from TripAdvisor travelers worldwide.\nDon't miss: Airbnb's most-liked Instagram listings for 2017 include an Atlanta treehouse and Cape Town penthouse \nshow chapters Travel trends: 2018 looks strong for the tourism industry      4:29 PM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 03:00 Like this story?
