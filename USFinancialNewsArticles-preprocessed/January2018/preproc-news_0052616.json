That compares with the average national home price of 334.4 million won, up 5.2 percent over the same period. \nLast week, home prices in Seoul rose 0.3 percent from the week before, far outpacing moves in national prices, the KB Kookmin Bank data showed. \nIn South Korea, taxes on property transactions, such as capital gains taxes, are much higher than taxes on property ownership.
