    "text": "Preliminary information on Metso's fourth quarter 2017 results - Minerals' profitability weaker than expected\nMetso Corporation, stock exchange release, January 15, 2018 at 09:15 EET\nMetso's fourth quarter 2017 sales are estimated to total EUR 710 million, representing an increase of 5 percent from Q4/2016. However, profitability of the Minerals segment came in weaker than expected, due to a higher than estimated share of equipment sales compared to services sales and a weak margin of the services business. Metso's adjusted EBITA is estimated at EUR 64 million corresponding to a margin of 9.1 percent (Q4/2016: EUR 64 million and 9.4%). Metso's fourth quarter orders received are estimated at EUR 684 million (Q4/2016: EUR 672 million).\nMetso will publish its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results on Friday, February 2, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. EET. Until that, the company will refrain from giving additional details on its results due to the ongoing silent period.\nMETSO GROUP Preliminary and unaudited EUR million, except when noted ORDERS RECEIVED 10-12/2017 10-12/2016 1-12/2017 1-12/2016 Minerals 527 536 2,308 2,115 Flow Control 157 136 675 609 Metso total 684 672 2,982 2,724 SALES 10-12/2017 10-12/2016 1-12/2017 1-12/2016 Minerals 540 522 2,070 1,956 Flow Control 170 155 636 631 Metso total 710 676 2,706 2,586 ADJUSTED EBITA 10-12/2017 10-12/2016 1-12/2017 1-12/2016 Minerals 48.2 47.4 167.9 190.3 Flow Control 26.6 25.7 93.1 95.0 Group Head Office and other -10.5 -9.3 -17.3 -11.3 Metso total 64.3 63.8 243.7 274.0 ADJUSTED EBITA, % OF SALES 10-12/2017 10-12/2016 1-12/2017 1-12/2016 Minerals 8.9 9.1 8.1 9.7 Flow Control 15.6 16.6 14.6 15.1 Metso total 9.1 9.4 9.0 10.6 Metso is a world leading industrial company serving the mining, aggregates, recycling, oil, gas, pulp, paper and process industries.
