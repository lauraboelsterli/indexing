    "text": "(Adds details of lawsuit, background, byline)\nJan 25 (Reuters) - Gene testing company Illumina on Thursday won a $26.7 million jury verdict in a U.S. lawsuit accusing rival Ariosa Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Roche Holdings AG, of using patented prenatal testing technology without authorization.\nA federal jury in San Francisco said Ariosa's Harmony non-invasive prenatal test kits infringed on two Illumina patents.\nIllumina and Ariosa compete in the growing market for non-invasive prenatal tests, which screen for chromosomal conditions like Down syndrome.\nSan Diego, California-based Illumina had sought more than $100 million in damages.\nThe jury rejected a counterclaim by Ariosa that Illumina had breached a contract between the companies by bringing the lawsuit. Ariosa had sought $88 million in damages from Illumina on that counterclaim.\nIllumina and Ariosa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRoche acquired San Jose, California-based Ariosa for $625 million in January 2015.\n(Reporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Richard Chang)",
