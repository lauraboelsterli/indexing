    "text": "By Emily Price January 17, 2018 \nYou’re not going to find the newest version of Samsung’s Note 8 in a Best Buy . \nThe Korean company unveiled a new version of the popular smartphone Tuesday evening, a special Olympic Games Limited Edition to commemorate the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games . \nRather than sell the handset in stores, Samsung will instead be passing the phone out as a gift to all of the athletes participating in games. That means it’s made a little over 4,000 of the phones. \nThe special Olympic-branded version of the phone will offer the same features as the traditional Note 8 available to all consumers, including a 6.3-inch infinity display and a built-in S Pen. The back of the phone will be a shiny white to celebrate the winter season and will have gold Olympic Rings on it, inspired by the Olympic Torch. \nThe phones will also come pre-loaded with Olympic wallpapers as well as useful apps” to “help cultivate the utmost Olympic Games Experience.” So, we’re guessing that means Lyft and Grubhub, right?
