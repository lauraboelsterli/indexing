(referred to below as “JCB”).\nTo expand into Hong Kong, Discover Global Network was able to leverage the existing acquiring partnership between JCB and First Data to accept all cards that run on Discover Global Network including Discover, Diners Club and affiliate network cards through Discover’s current net-to-net relationship with JCB.\n“This is a great example of partners working together to bring value to both customers and merchants,” said Amy Parsons, senior vice president of global acceptance at Discover. “Our strong existing relationships with First Data and JCB allow us to grow faster and reach merchants that are important to our customers.”\nFirst Data has a robust roll-out plan and will enable acceptance for Discover and Diners Club cards including key international restaurant chains, Airport duty free stores and national department stores to benefit cardholders visiting Hong Kong.\n“This unique relationship with Discover and JCB leverages First Data’s global footprint, scale, and innovative solutions to provide key merchants in Hong Kong with the ability to accept Discover and Diners Club Cards,” states Ivo Distelbrink, EVP, Head of Asia Pacific region for First Data. “At First Data, we are committed to enabling commerce for businesses around the world so they can, in turn, offer flexible payment options to their customers. We are delighted to collaborate with Discover and JCB to further this effort.”\nDiscover currently works with First Data as its acquiring partner in both the United States and Europe to grow acceptance of all cards that run on Discover Global Network.\nDiscover and JCB have worked together since 2006 and continue to increase acceptance of JCB cards on the Discover Network in the U.S., and of Discover cards on the JCB network in Japan. This is the third joint acquirer agreement between JCB and Discover following Kazakhstan and Republic of South Africa, leveraging Discover’s current net-to-net relationship with JCB with First Data.\n“JCB and Discover’s alliance has now stepped into a new stage opening up a new territory in Asia Region other than our mother market, Japan,” said Kimihisa Imada, President & COO of JCB International. “Thanks to First Data for their outstanding cooperation. This project allowed us to widen our technical collaboration with First Data and further business possibilities.”\nDiscover Global Network has over 42 million merchant acceptance locations and 1.9 million ATM and cash access locations across 185 countries and territories, Discover Global Network includes Discover, Diners Club International, PULSE and affiliated networks.\nAbout Discover Global Network\nDiscover Global Network, the global payments brand of Discover Financial Services, processes millions of cardholder transactions each day.
