    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans oppose changing the chamber’s rules so that legislation to fund the government and end the current shutdown could pass with a simple majority, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday.\nThe spokesman was responding to a question about President Donald Trump’s comment on Twitter that if the shutdown stalemate continued, Republicans should fund the government by changing Senate rules that currently require a super-majority for appropriations bills to pass. Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate.\n“The Republican Conference opposes changing the rules on legislation,” the spokesman for McConnell said in an email.\nReporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ",
