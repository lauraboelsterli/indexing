    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. and NEW YORK, Jan. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LANE , a Finn Partners Company, has released its 2018 Food & Beverage Beat. The agency's ninth annual report (found here: http://www.lanepr.com/2018-food-beverage-beat/ ) reveals trends that are rising – and some that are receding – in the food and beverage industry in the year ahead. LANE tapped six experts to weigh in on issues that will resonate with consumers and the industry, from flavors that will dominate menus, to the implications of price versus value, to perceptions about beer in cans.\n\"The food and beverage industry is a constant source of innovation and inspiration. Chefs, proprietors and producers are constantly evolving their offerings to not only meet the changing tastes of consumers but deliver some unexpected surprises that capture the imagination and grow into the next big thing,\" said Wendy Lane Stevens, managing partner at LANE. \"We're excited to share what some influential voices consider to be critical to the direction of the industry in the coming year.\"\nKey findings indicate continued focus on individual, environmental health\nEthnic foods provide an introduction to a wide variety of flavors, textures and preparations, and consumers will be hungering for new culinary experiences in 2018. Experts think exploration of ethnic cuisines will increase, particularly with culinary offerings from regions in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia that have been relatively underrepresented. As a result, diners can expect to encounter more spice and more vegan and vegetarian options. Additionally, this exploration dovetails nicely with Americans' desire to adopt more plant-based foods into their diets, for both health and environmental reasons. Restaurants should do their part, as some adopt efforts to \"close the loop\" by composting food waste to grow fresh produce for their establishments.\nThe seemingly growing disparity between America's haves and have-nots should also command attention in the coming year as it relates to diet, nutrition and overall health. Panelists anticipate more discussion around price and nutritional value, as well as the trade-offs of low-cost food in terms of health issues such as obesity and diabetes. While this may be the year for Americans to head back to the kitchen to cook something good, it will be important to recognize the barriers facing those without the means to take advantage of better-for-you ingredients.\nSome additional trends and issues anticipated to take center stage in 2018 include the following:\nA slight shift away from prescribed diets and toward more intuitive eating and drinking as consumers start paying closer attention to what their bodies indicate they need. Persistent popularity of meal planning and meal prep services as consumers continue to be pressed for time but are inspired to cook meals at home that are simple, nutritious and delicious. Greater attention paid to hard cider, craft beer in cans, Pacific Northwest wines and a Brazilian spirit, cachaça. Continued importance of technology in driving consumers to try restaurants, bars and other establishments, but balanced by an increased realization that loyalty depends on creating an individualized experience and customized feel.\nLANE drew upon the expertise of half a dozen individuals with unique perspectives on the industry, who weighed in with viewpoints from the culinary, medical and media fields. The following individuals participated in the 2018 Food & Beverage Beat panel:\nJulie Arnan , a Seattle-based freelance writer specializing in the \"good life.\" She recently passed the introductory course of the Court of Master Sommeliers and is working toward sommelier certification.
