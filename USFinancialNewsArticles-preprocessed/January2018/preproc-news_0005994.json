    "text": "Raytheon : \"You should buy Raytheon. Stop talking, start buying. The stock was down yesterday. I thought it was unbelievable that that stock was even down for a day with what we've got going on geopolitically.\"\nPG&E Corporation : \"Man, that's too risky, to be honest. We've got Dominion down big off this Scana [deal] . I'd rather do that than the open-ended losses for [PG&E].\"\nFlex : \"I put that in the bullpen for club members of ActionAlerts and I never pulled the trigger and it's been my bad and the stock's not done going higher. I think it's real good.\"\nBank of America : \"Yes. Going through $30's actually a sign of health, not a sign of animal spirits. It's just getting back on its game.\"\nGrubHub : \"I think that this is indispensable. This company is indispensable. And they also won like Planet Fitness won . I think GrubHub's a buy. I think they're very smart guys.\"\nSquare : \"I think Square's run a lot. It's got to kind of bide its time. It's too linked to crypto, not enough linked to what it really does, which is [to] help small- to mid-size businesses do well. It's got to get out of the crypto world.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Stop talking, start buying Raytheon 20 Hours Ago | 04:02 ",
