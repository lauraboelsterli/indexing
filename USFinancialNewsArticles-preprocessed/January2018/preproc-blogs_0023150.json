The market cap, and the price of some coins recovered slightly from that low, but are still significantly lower.\nshow chapters Major cryptocurrencies sell off after talk of tougher regulation 8 Hours Ago | 03:18 The sell-off appeared to be sparked by worries over tighter regulation in the key markets of South Korea and China.\nLast week, South Korea's justice minister said that his ministry was preparing a bill that could ban trading via some cryptocurrency exchanges .
