An Air India Airbus A320neo plane takes off in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \nThe debt-laden airline would be divided into core airline business, regional arm, ground handling and engineering operations, the report added. \nThe core airline business comprising Air India and Air India Express, the low-cost overseas arm, will be offered as one company, and the process will be completed by the end of 2018, Bloomberg reported, quoting Junior Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha. bloom.bg/2DxrCWF \nLast week, India had cleared a proposal to allow foreign investors to own up to 49 percent in the carrier. \nAir India could not be immediately contacted for comments.
