REUTERS/Franck Fife/Pool \nSainz, father of the Formula One driver of the same name, won the 425km timed section of the 727km seventh stage from La Paz to Uyuni to lead Toyota’s Qatari driver Nasser al-Attiyah by an hour and 11 minutes. \nPeterhansel, who had been 27 minutes ahead of Sainz after leading the rally from Peru into Bolivia, hit trouble while trying to overtake a motorbike at the 186km mark and came to a halt. \nThe Peugeot’s left rear wheel, upper suspension link, shock absorber and radiator were all damaged. \nThe Frenchman was helped back on the road by compatriot and team mate Cyril Despres, the five-times Dakar winner who had long dropped out of contention for the overall victory.

REUTERS/Franck Fife/Pool \nPeterhansel ended the stage third overall, an hour and 20 minutes off the lead. \nPeugeot, who are pulling out of the South American event after this year, will now be hoping 2010 Dakar winner and two-times world rally champion Sainz keeps out of trouble in motorsport’s most gruelling endurance test.
