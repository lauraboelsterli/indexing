    "text": "January 10, 2018 / 3:00 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Akzo Nobel continues talks with 3-4 possible buyers for chemicals business Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Akzo Nobel( AKZO.AS ) , the maker of Dulux paint, is continuing talks with three to four possible buyers of its specialty chemicals division, a spokesman said on Wednesday. \nAndrew Wood said the company still planned to either sell or seek a separate stock market listing for the division by mid-April. \nThe plans are part of efforts to placate investors after the Dutch paintmaker rejected a takeover offer from rival PPG Industries ( PPG.N ) last year. \nSpecialty chemicals account for a third of Akzo’s sales and earnings and its value is estimated at roughly 9 billion euros ($10.8 bln). \nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that private equity firm Carlyle, Dutch investor Hal Investments, private equity firm Apollo together with chemicals company Lanxess, and private equity team Advent International and Bain Capital were still in the running to buy the chemicals arm. \nThe companies all either declined comment or could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. \nWood could not confirm the bidders’ identities, but said they included a mix of private equity and strategic buyers.
