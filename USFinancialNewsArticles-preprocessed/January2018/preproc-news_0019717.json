Its customers are mainly in the automotive industry. \nMetal Trade Comax is based in Velvary near Prague and produces about 200,000 tonnes of steel and aluminum products annually. It also has an aluminum recycling business producing about 30,000 tonnes annually which will be merged with Oetinger. Reporting by Michael Hogan, editing by David Evans",
