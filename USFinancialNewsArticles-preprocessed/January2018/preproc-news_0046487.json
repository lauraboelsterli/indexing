Slideshow (6 Images) \nThe win was Mladenovic’s second major women’s doubles title after she won the 2016 French Open crown with compatriot Caroline Garcia. \nThe Russians pushed hard to prise break points from Mladenovic as she served out the match but the French-Hungarian duo held firm to close out the match in one hour and 20 minutes.
