It reports full results on March 1 along with forecasts for 2018. \nAs Amazon has made a big push into fashion, Zalando has been investing heavily in logistics and technology, denting its profitability and prompting analysts to question its medium-term target to improve its operating margin. $1 = 0.8185 euros Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Ludwig Burger",
