    "text": "DUBLIN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Ryanair pilots at each of its 15 UK bases, including its largest company-wide base at London Stansted, have voted to accept pay increases of up to 20 percent that many had rejected last year, the Irish airline said on Thursday.\nThe reversal follows Ryanair’s decision to recognise unions for the first time in its 32-year history in order to avoid a Christmas strike after it was forced to cancel 20,000 flights earlier in the year due to a shortage of standby pilots.\nRyanair added that it had asked the one-third of its Dublin pilots yet to accept the pay increases to vote on its proposals by Jan. 17 and was disappointed that no such vote was organised.\nDiscussions with the pilots’ unions are progressing slowly, it said.
