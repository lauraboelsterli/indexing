U.S. crude rose 20 cents to $61.83 and also touched the highest since May 2015.\n\"The protests in Iran add more fuel to the already bullish oil market mood,\" said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.\n\"We believe that today's oil prices project an overly rosy picture, stick to our cautious view and see the market at risk of profit-taking,\" Rucker added.\nFreezing weather in the United States has spurred short-term demand, especially for heating oil.\nAside from the spike in May 2015, oil is trading at its highest since December 2014 - the month in which the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to stop cutting output, a move that deepened a price collapse.\nAnalysts at JBC Energy said the price reaction to the Iranian unrest was overdone.\n  lift prices by removing a glut built up in the previous two years.\nTheir cuts started   have decided to extend the deal until the end of 2018.\nOPEC's cuts are helping reduce global inventories.
