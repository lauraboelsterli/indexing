The company reported net income of $1,295,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $376,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per weighted average common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.25 compared to a loss of $0.07 for the fourth quarter 2016.

The company's book value per share was $17.84 and $17.27 at year end 2017 and 2016.\nFounded in 1896, with $650 million in assets as of December 31, 2017, The Peoples Bank operates 18 branches along the Mississippi Gulf Coast in Hancock, Harrison, Jackson and Stone counties. In addition to offering a comprehensive range of retail and commercial banking services, the bank also operates a trust and investment services department that has provided customers with financial, estate and retirement planning services since 1936.\nThe Peoples Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peoples Financial Corporation, listed on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol PFBX.
