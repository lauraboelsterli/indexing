Pedestrians walk past a Marks & Spencer store on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris, France, November 8, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer \nAl-Futtaim, which already operates 72 M&S stores across 11 markets in Asia and the Middle East, purchased 27 shops in the deal, which completed on Dec. 30, M&S said. \nThe move follows a strategic review by M&S in November 2016, in which the company laid out plans to shut more than 80 stores at home and abroad as well as to seek joint ventures and franchise partnerships.
