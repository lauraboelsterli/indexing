    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif. & YOKNEAM, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX), a leading supplier of high-performance, end-to-end smart interconnect solutions for data center servers and storage systems , today confirmed that affiliates of Starboard Value have nominated nine director candidates to stand for election to the Board of Directors at Mellanox’s 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Company issued the following statement:\nWe maintain an open dialogue with our shareholders and welcome constructive input toward our shared goal of enhancing shareholder value. Members of our Board of Directors and senior management team have held numerous discussions and meetings with Starboard during the past several months, including an in-person meeting at our facilities in Israel just Monday of this week. Despite our ongoing discussions and open engagement, however, Starboard made no attempt to discuss their nominees with us before publicly nominating director candidates, which we were first made aware of through the media today.\nThe Mellanox Board is comprised of nine highly qualified and experienced directors, all of whom are committed to creating value for Mellanox shareholders. The Board believes that it brings a diverse range of valuable and relevant skills, expertise and perspectives to drive performance and provide effective oversight. Further, Mellanox is strongly committed to best-in-class corporate governance and is recognized by ISS governance analysis as possessing the best governance profile, including the highest board structure score, amongst its peers.\nThe Mellanox Board takes its fiduciary duties seriously, is strongly committed to enhancing shareholder value and will continue to act in the best interests of the Company and all shareholders. Under the direction of our Board and management team, and with the support of our 2,900 talented employees worldwide, Mellanox has become a leader in innovative end-to-end solutions for connecting servers and storage platforms, and we hold the #1 or #2 position in many of the key markets in which we operate. In addition to our track record of sustained market leadership, the Company’s success under our leadership is also demonstrated by our solid financial performance.\nThe Mellanox Board is confident in the Company’s strategy to accelerate growth, transform our business and enhance shareholder value. We look forward to further discussing our key focus areas on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results conference call to be held Thursday, January 18, 2018, at 2 p.m. Pacific Time.\nThe Mellanox Board and management team have and will continue to act in the best interests of the Company and all shareholders.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nAll statements included or incorporated by reference in this release, other than statements or characterizations of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including statements related to our business and strategy.
