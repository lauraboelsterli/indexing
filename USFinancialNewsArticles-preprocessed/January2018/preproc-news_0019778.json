    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday condemned a U.S. sanctions-busting case against a Turkish bank executive as a “political coup attempt” and a joint effort by the CIA and FBI to undermine Ankara.\nA U.S. jury last week convicted the executive of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank of evading Iran sanctions, capping a trial that has strained relations between the NATO allies.\nErdogan, speaking to members of his ruling AK Party in parliament, said the CIA, the FBI and the network of the U.S.-based cleric Turkey blames for a 2016 coup were together using the case to undermine Ankara.\nReporting by Ercan Gurses; Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
