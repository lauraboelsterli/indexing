    "text": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC Lisa T. Su, CEO of Advance Micro Devices. \nAMD stock fell as much as 7 percent after hours on Tuesday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company will hold a conference call with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time. EPS : Excluding certain items, $0.08 in earnings per share vs. $0.05 in earnings per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $1.48 billion vs. $1.41 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. \nWith respect to guidance, AMD said in a statement that it's expecting $1.55 billion in revenue, plus or minus $50 million, in the first quarter of 2018. Analysts were expecting guidance of $1.25 billion in revenue for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. \nAMD's Computing and Graphics revenue of $958 million came out above the FactSet consensus estimate of $878.7 million, while the company's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business segment of $522 million came in below the consensus estimate of $529.9 million, according to StreetAccount. \nThe company said in a filing that it received a one-time tax credit of $18 million as a result of recently passed U.S. tax reform. Some other companies have had to pay one-time charges because of the tax changes. AMD expects a 10 percent tax rate on pre-tax income for all of 2018. \nAMD has been busy dealing with fallout from the disclosure earlier this month of a security vulnerability called Spectre. \nInitially, AMD had said its chips were not affected by Spectre and another vulnerability, Meltdown, which has been shown to have an impact on several generations of chips from AMD rival Intel . But then, a few days later, AMD said the Spectre vulnerability does affect its chips . \nAMD stock is up nearly 26 percent since the beginning of the year. \nThis is breaking news.
