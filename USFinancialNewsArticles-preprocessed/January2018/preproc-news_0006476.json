    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - France’s ambassador to the United Nations told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday that recent protests in Iran do not threaten international peace and security, in what may be an implicit criticism of the United States for calling the meeting.\n“However worrying the events of the last few days in Iran may be they do not constitute per se a threat to international peace and security,” Ambassador Francois Delattre said. “We must be wary of any attempts to exploit this crisis for personal ends, which would have the diametrically opposed outcome to that which is wished,” he said.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Mohammad Zargham\n ",
