    "text": "In a surprise decision, the U.S. International Trade Commission has ruled against aerospace giant Boeing in a bitter trade case it brought against Bombardier over passenger jets its Canadian rival sold to Delta Air Lines .\nThe dispute stems from Bombardier's roughly 100-seat C Series jets, which Boeing complained to the U.S. government were sold to Delta below their cost of production and that the program received illegal subsidies from Canadian government. \nLast month, the U.S. Commerce Department upheld duties of nearly 300 percent on the C Series passenger jets made by Bombardier, a win for Boeing. The trade commission was tasked with determining whether Boeing was or could be harmed by Bombardier.\nThe decision had escalated the bitter trade dispute between the two aircraft manufacturers. It has also added to tensions between the U.S. and Canada, as the Trump administration seeks to renegotiate terms in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\nThis is a breaking news story, please check back for updates.",
