LaMarcus Aldridge hit for 10 points and 10 rebounds while collecting his 20th double-double of the season, and Kyle Anderson also scored 10 for San Antonio, which has lost three of its past four games.\nIndiana led 81-65 with 7:33 to play before the Spurs made a last run, getting five points from Forbes and Davis Bertans to help cut the advantage to 83-76 at the 5:03 mark.\nHowever, the Pacers did more than enough down the stretch to salt away the game and hand San Antonio its first home loss since Nov. 10. The Spurs a 19-3 mark at AT&T Center.\nThe Pacers rode a 13-point half from Oladipo (11 of which came in the second quarter) to grab a 46-43 lead at intermission. Indiana’s advantage would have been more if not for a steal and layup by Anderson at the second-quarter horn. The first half featured 10 lead changes and five ties.\nGasol led the Spurs with 11 points in the half on 5-of-6 shooting.\nThe Pacers expanded their lead to 71-59 at the end of the third quarter on the strength of a 18-7 run over the final seven minutes of the quarter, with most of the damage done by Indiana’s bench players.\nAl Jefferson’s cutting dunk with 10 minutes to play pushed the Indiana lead to 77-60 and forced the Spurs into desperation mode.\nSan Antonio reserve guard Manu Ginobili was ruled out of the game a few hours before tipoff with a right thigh contusion. The Spurs were already without Rudy Gay, who has right heel bursitis, and Kawhi Leonard, who is continuing to rehab from an offseason quad injury that has kept him out of all but nine contests this season.\nIndiana played without forward Myles Turner, who has an elbow injury.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
