    "text": "(Reuters) - Waymo, Alphabet Inc’s self-driving car unit, would start testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta, it said on Twitter on Monday.\n\"Atlanta is a major hub for technology and innovation, and a natural fit for Waymo's testing program,\" Waymo said on Twitter. ( bit.ly/2DyOp6W )\nWith over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology, and is already testing vehicles in suburban Phoenix, Michigan, Silicon Valley and San Francisco.\nWhile self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
