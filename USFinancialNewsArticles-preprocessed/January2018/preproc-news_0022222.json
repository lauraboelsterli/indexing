    "text": "BOGOTA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - At least nine construction workers were killed and five injured when a partially-constructed bridge collapsed in central Colombia on Monday, an official from the disaster response agency said.\nThe bridge, located in Chirajara on the border of Cundinamarca and Meta provinces, was to be part of the highway that connects the capital Bogota and the city of Villavicencio, and was not yet in public use.\nThe cause of the collapse, which sent pieces of the bridge down into a canyon below, is under investigation, Reinaldo Romero, head of disaster response for Meta province, told Reuters.\n“Up to now there are nine dead and five injured,” Romero said. “We are doing a check to rule out other victims.”\nReporting by Bogota newsroom; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
