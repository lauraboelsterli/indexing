FILE PHOTO - Musician Kanye West (L) and wife Kim Kardashian arrive at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala (Met Gala) to celebrate the opening of \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\" in the Manhattan borough of New York, May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo \n“Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,” Kardashian said in a message on her app. \nThe couple thanked the unidentified surrogate “who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give.” \nThey said the baby was born on Monday. \nKardashian and West are already parents to North, 4, and Saint, 2. The reality and social media star has said she decided to use a surrogate after doctors warned of serious health risks if she became pregnant again.
