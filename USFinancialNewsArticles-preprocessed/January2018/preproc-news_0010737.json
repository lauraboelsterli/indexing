    "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech lower house voted on Wednesday to adjourn a session due to hold a confidence vote on a minority government led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis until Jan. 16.\nMembers of the Czech Parliament stand as President Milos Zeman arrives to attend a confidence vote for the newly appointed government led by Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, in Prague, Czech Republic January 10, 2018. REUTERS/David W Cerny Babis, a billionaire businessman and leader of the anti-establishment ANO party, was expected to lose the vote after other factions in parliament said they would not back the cabinet due to a police investigation of alleged subsidy fraud by Babis. He denies any wrongdoing.\nReporting by Petra Vodstrcilova; Writing by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
