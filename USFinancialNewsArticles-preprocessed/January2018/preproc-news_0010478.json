    "text": "January 12, 2018 / 12:00 PM / Updated 6 hours ago Tennis-Penpix of the top women's contenders at Australian Open Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \nJan 12 (Reuters) - Penpix of the top womenâ€™s contenders at the 2018 Australian Open, which begins on Monday: \nSimona Halep (Romania) \nBorn: Sept. 27, 1991 (Age 26) \nHeight: 1.68 metres \nGrand slam titles: 0 \nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 5-0 \nAfter rising to the top of the rankings at the end of last year, top seed Halep has continued her ruthless form to win the season-opening Shenzhen Open trophy. The Romanian, who reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park in 2014 and 2015, now has the chance to win her maiden grand slam title and assert her dominance after first-round exits in the last two editions. \nElina Svitolina (Ukraine) \nBorn: Sept. 12, 1994 (Age 23) \nHeight: 1.74 metres \nGrand slam titles: 0 \nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 5-0 \nSvitolina won five singles titles last season and has started the current campaign in fine form by winning her 10th career title at the Brisbane International, dropping just one set in the process. The Ukrainian has not fared well at grand slams and will be eager to get past the third round at Melbourne Park for the first time. \nVenus Williams (U.S.) \nBorn: June 17, 1980 (Age 37) \nHeight: 1.85 metres \nPlays: Right-handed \nGrand slam titles: 7 (Wimbledon 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, U.S. Open 2000, 2001) \nVeteran Williams is among the top contenders to win her eighth grand slam and first Australian Open title following a successful campaign last year, where she finished runner-up at Melbourne Park, Wimbledon and the WTA Finals, in the absence of her sister Serena. The 37-year-old has lost to her sister in two previous Australian Open finals. \nCaroline Wozniacki (Denmark) \nBorn: July 11, 1990 (Age 27) \nHeight: 1.77 metres \nGrand slam titles: 0 \nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 4-1 \nWozniacki is showing no signs of slowing down since winning her 27th singles title at the ATP Finals last October as the Dane charged to the Auckland Classic final, where she lost to Julia Goerges after a tough match. The 27-year-old is yet to win a major and will be keen to better her record at Melbourne Park, where she reached the semi-finals in 2011. \nMaria Sharapova (Russia) \nBorn: April 19, 1987 (Age 30) \nHeight: 1.88 metres \nPlays: Right-handed \nGrand slam titles: 5 (Wimbledon 2004, French Open 2012, 2014, Australian Open 2008, U.S. Open 2006) \nWTA match record in 2018 (won-lost): 3-1 \nThe resurgent Russian is among the few contenders at Melbourne Park this year to have a major title to her name. The 30-year-old returned from a doping ban last season and went on to win the Tianjin Open. Sharapova kicked off the current season with a run to the semi-finals of the Shenzhen Open last week and is in prime position to get back to her ruthless best and win her first grand slam since 2014. \nJelena Ostapenko (Latvia) \nBorn: June 8, 1997 (Age 20) \nHeight: 1.77 metres",
