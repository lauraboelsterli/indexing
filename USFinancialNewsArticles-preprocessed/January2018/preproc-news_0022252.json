    "text": "  minute ago Ryanair wants to buy parts of Austrian airline Niki Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nVIENNA (Reuters) - Irish airline Ryanair ( RYA.I ) said on Monday it had contacted the Austrian administrator of insolvent holiday airline Niki to express its interest in buying some of its assets. A pilot disembarks a Ryanair flight at Stansted airport in London, Britain September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nNikiâ€™s German administrator said earlier on Monday he still wanted to sell the leisure carrier to British Airways parent IAG ( ICAG.L ), despite a battle between Austria and Germany over where insolvency proceedings should be handled. \nFormer Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda has also re-emerged as a potential bidder for Niki ahead of a Jan. 19 deadline for fresh offers the Austrian court has set.
