    "text": "Sales (-0.6%) and core operating profit (-8.8%) decreased due to the impact of certain items such as the transfer of the global dermatology business in April 2016 and the transfer of long-listed products in Japan in April 2017. Excluding these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales decreased -1.3% and core operating profit -2.6%, respectively. Sales of key global products such as XTANDI ® for the treatment of prostate cancer and Betanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® for the treatment of overactive bladder (“OAB”) grew. Operating profit (-22.3%) and profit for the period (-20.2%) on a full basis decreased mainly due to the impact of one-time impairment losses and charges associated with the review of development project plans and the wind-down of research operations of subsidiary Agensys, Inc. being recorded during the first six months of FY2017.\nTOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Astellas Pharma Inc. (TSE: 4503, President and CEO: Yoshihiko Hatanaka, “Astellas”) today announced the financial results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 ending March 31, 2018 (“FY2017”).\n“Key global products including XTANDI ® continued to demonstrate steady growth in the first nine months of FY2017. We achieved many milestones including the acquisition of Mitobridge, Inc. in January 2018 by exercising the option right to acquire Mitobridge. The transaction accelerates Astellas’ research and development in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions,” said Yoshihiko Hatanaka, president and CEO, Astellas. “We remain committed to creating innovative medical solutions and delivering value for patients and all stakeholders, as we continue to advance our strategic plan by maximizing the value of our products, creating innovation and pursuing operational excellence.”\nConsolidated Financial Results (April 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017) (core basis)\n(Millions of yen)\nFirst nine months of FY2016 First nine months of FY2017 Change\n(%) Sales 1,005,587 999,443 -6,144\n(-0.6%)\nCore operating profit 241,837 220,459 -21,378\n(-8.8%)\nCore profit for the period 177,189 167,877 -9,312\n(-5.3%)\nQuarterly Revenue Highlights\nSales in the first nine months of FY2017 decreased 0.6% compared to those in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year (“year-on-year”) to ¥999.4 billion due to the impact of certain items such as the transfer of the global dermatology business in April 2016 and the transfer of long-listed products in Japan in April 2017.\nOncology franchise\nSales of XTANDI ® increased 16.2% year-on-year to ¥219.9 billion. Sales grew steadily in all regions including Japan, the Americas, EMEA 1 and the Asia and Oceania region.\nUrology OAB franchise\nSales of Betanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® increased 30.0% year-on-year to ¥93.1 billion. Sales increased in all regions of the world. Sales of Vesicare ® , however, decreased 12.1% year-on-year to ¥78.5 billion.\nTransplantation franchise\nSales of Prograf ® increased 5.6% year-on-year to ¥150.2 billion, and continued to grow in Japan, EMEA and the Asia and Oceania regions.\nOther new and key products\nIn the Japanese market, continued growth was achieved for products such as Celecox ® for the treatment of inflammation and pain, Symbicort ® for the treatment of bronchial asthma, Suglat ® for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Cimzia ® for the treatment of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Meanwhile, we are working to further penetrate the hypercholesterolemia market following our launch of Repatha ® , which occurred in April 2016, and of LINZESS ® for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, which launched in March 2017. In the Americas, sales of azole antifungal CRESEMBA ® grew.\n(Billions of yen)\nFirst nine months of FY2016 First nine months of FY2017 Change Oncology franchise 232.3 260.8 +12.3% XTANDI ® 189.2 219.9 +16.2% Urology OAB franchise 160.9 171.6 +6.6% Vesicare ® 89.3 78.5 -12.1%\nBetanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® 71.6 93.1 +30.0% Transplantation franchise 142.2 150.2 +5.6% Sales by Region 2\nSales in Japan and EMEA decreased, while sales in the Americas and the Asia and Oceania region increased. As for the Japanese market, sales decreased 13.7% year on year to ¥309.0 billion largely due to the impact of transferring 16 long-listed products in April 2017, and the introduction of generics for Micardis ® for the treatment of hypertension in June 2017. In EMEA, sales decreased due to the impact of transferring the dermatology business in April 2016, yet sales showed an increase when calculated excluding this impact.\nFY2017 Guidance\nThe company’s business forecasts for FY2017 remain unchanged from the consolidated full-year business forecasts announced in October 2017.\nStrategic Quarterly Highlights\nAstellas continues to create sustainable growth over the mid-to-long term through the pursuit of three main strategies: “Maximizing the Product Value,” “Creating Innovation” and “Pursuing Operational Excellence.” The company achieved multiple accomplishments against these strategies as outlined below:\nMaximizing the Product Value\nContinued to maximize the growth of the Oncology franchise centered on XTANDI ® and the Urology OAB franchise including Vesicare ® and Betanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® with new launches across various countries and a growth in franchise sales globally.
