    "text": "(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ) missed Wall Street estimates for third quarter revenue on Friday and said wine and spirit sales for the full-year would be at the low end of a previous forecast, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent. \nIts stock recouped some of the losses later in the day after Chief Executive Robert Sands said the company was seeing no real impact on alcohol sales from the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in six U.S. states. \nThe comments come two months after Constellation said it took a nearly 10 percent stake in Canada’s biggest cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp ( WEED.TO ), becoming the first major beer and spirits company to invest in legal cannabis. \n“We really can’t see any impact in terms of how it’s (cannabis) affecting beverage alcohol in general and even in the 6 states, including California,” Sands said on a conference call with analysts. \nHe also said it was too early to tell whether Constellation’s investment in the Canadian company would be “cannibalistic or complementary”. \n“There’s just not enough information I think to really say how that’s going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward,” Sands said. \nConstellation said that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would reduce its net deferred tax liabilities by $300-$400 million, a non-cash benefit that would be reported in the current quarter. \nThe company also announced a $3 billion share buyback program and raised in its full-year profit forecast. \nIts shares, up around 50 percent last year, were down 1.9 percent at $221.5 in afternoon trading. \nWINE AND SPIRITS DISAPPOINT Wine and spirit sales, which make up a little less than a half of Constellation’s total revenue, fell 10.3 percent in the third quarter, due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, wildfires in California and a drop in demand from retail customers. \nThe drop in sales also reflects the divestiture of the company’s Canadian wine business in December 2016. \nThe company said it now expects sales of wine and spirits, which include Robert Mondavi wines and Svedka Vodka, to be at the lower end of a prior forecast that already called for a decline of 4-6 percent for the full-year. \nRationalization of lower-margin wines and spirit brands alone will cause a 1 percentage point fall, Chief Financial Officer David Klein said on the call. \nBeer sales, the company’s biggest business, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter. \nNet income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.89 per share. \nNet sales fell marginally to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion. ( bit.ly/2F3QAxl ) \nThe company also raised its full-year profit forecast to $8.40-$8.50 per share. Analysts were expecting $8.43. \nReporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto and Patrick Graham\n ",
