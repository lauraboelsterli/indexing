    "text": "OTTAWA—Canada’s unemployment rate dropped to a four-decade low in December and job creation exceeded expectations by a wide margin for a second straight month, likely increasing pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates in early 2018.\nThe Canadian economy added a net 78,600 jobs in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, Statistics Canada said Friday, which nearly matched the previous month’s employment gain of 79,500. This marked the best two-month performance in Canada’s labor market since April 2012.\n ",
