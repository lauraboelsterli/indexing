    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 9:51 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Beijing treated to super lunar eclipse not seen since Qing dynasty Ryan Woo 2 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Millions of people across the Chinese capital were treated to a “super blood blue moon” eclipse on a cold but clear night on Wednesday, a phenomenon not seen since the late Qing dynasty more than 150 years ago. \nThe eclipse coincided with a so-called blue moon - or the   calendar month - and a super moon, when the moon is at, or near, its closest to Earth. \nAbout 400 super-keen skywatchers dressed in thick coats queued patiently outside the Beijing Planetarium to peer into eight telescopes mounted on tripods. \nBeijing was among a number of locations in the country and on the Pacific Rim that will witness the total lunar eclipse. The super blue moon is seen between British and Chinese flags raised at Tiananmen square in Beijing as British Prime Minister Theresa May visit China's capital, January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj \nThe entire passage will take more than three hours, during which the moon will turn a coppery red as sunlight going   bounces off its surface. \n(For a graphic - Once in a   click tmsnrt.rs/2EoZDc2 ) Slideshow (2 Images) \nSkywatchers across western North America set their alarms to wake before dawn on Wednesday, with hundreds expected to view the phenomenon from a Los Angeles mountaintop.. \nThe rare eclipse was also visible in Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia. \nThe “lunar trifecta”, as it is described by NASA, last took place in the Western hemisphere on March 31, 1866, when the second dome of the United States Capitol had just been completed and H.G. Wells, author of “The Time Machine”, was born. Reporting by Ryan Woo;   Joyce Zhou in BEIJING; Editing by Darren Schuettler and Nick Macfie",
