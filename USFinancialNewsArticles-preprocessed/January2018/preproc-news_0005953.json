    "text": "Amazon announced new tools on Friday that will allow gadget-makers to include the smart voice assistant in a whole array of new products.\nAlexa is Amazon 's smart voice assistant, and it has slowly made its way from the Amazon Echo into third-party speakers, refrigerators and, soon, even microwaves . Now, with Amazon's Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, device makers will be able to build Alexa into headphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers and more.\nThat means you may soon be able to look down at your wrist and ask Alexa the weather or to remind you to pick up eggs at the grocery store.\nSome firms have already started to build smart voice assistants into products. Bose's new QC35 II headphones have Google Assistant built in, for example, and the Apple Watch has long offered support for Siri.\nAmazon said Bose, Jabra, iHome, Beyerdynamic and Linkplay plan to bring Alexa to products this year.",
