    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a bill to renew the National Security Agencyâ€™s warrantless internet surveillance program for six years and with minimal changes, overcoming objections from civil liberties advocates that it did too little to safeguard the privacy of Americans.\nThe legislation, which easily passed the House of Representatives last week, is expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump by Friday.\nReporting by Dustin Volz Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
