    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s finance ministry said on Thursday it was working on legislation that would regulate crypto-currency transactions without fully banning them, although it would not let digital FX be used as a mean of payment in Russia.\nThe finance ministry said its legislation on crypto-currencies and ‘initial coin offerings’ envisages allowing such deals only through digital exchanges.\nThe ministry said its plan to regulate the crypto-currency market would support the budget, while a full ban on such instruments would create condition for using them for illegal purposes.\nReporting by Andrey Ostroukh; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
