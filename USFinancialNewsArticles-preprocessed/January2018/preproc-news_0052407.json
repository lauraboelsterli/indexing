Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, NI recognized a one-time charge of $70 million in Q4 from the estimated impact of the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This one-time charge is being excluded from NI's non-GAAP results. EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, was $74 million for Q4.\nIn Q4, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 76 percent and total GAAP operating expenses were $207 million, up 5 percent year over year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were up 2 percent year over year at $193 million. GAAP operating margin was 16 percent in Q4, with GAAP operating income of $57 million, up 16 percent year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21 percent in Q4, the highest quarterly result in 20 years. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million, up 22 percent year over year.\n“I am proud of what we accomplished in 2017. We set goals to drive revenue and make significant progress toward our operating model, and through focus we met those goals,” said Alex Davern, NI president and CEO. “Our employees did a tremendous job in 2017 executing on key business decisions. I believe we have an opportunity to continue to drive both growth and improved profitability in 2018.”\nKaren Rapp, NI CFO, said, “I am pleased with our record performance in Q4 and for the year. We delivered record revenue and operating income, made significant progress toward our operating model, and reported the highest non-GAAP net income in company history. We plan to continue executing on our disciplined capital allocation strategy.”\nGeographic revenue in U.S. dollar terms for Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016 was up 3 percent in the Americas, up 9 percent in APAC and up 8 percent in EMEIA. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, revenue was up 3 percent in the Americas, up 8 percent in APAC and up 5 percent in EMEIA. Historical revenue from these three regions can be found on NI’s investor website at www.ni.com/nati .\nIn Q4 2017, the value of the company’s total orders was up 5 percent year over year; orders under $20,000 were up 3 percent year over year; and orders over $20,000 were up 7 percent year over year.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, NI had $412 million in cash and short-term investments. During Q4, NI paid $27 million in dividends. The NI Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.23 per share payable on March 5, 2018, to stockholders of record on Feb. 12, 2018.\nThe company’s non-GAAP results exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related transaction costs, taxes levied on the transfer of acquired intellectual property, foreign exchange loss on acquisitions, restructuring charges, and tax reform charges. Reconciliations of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results are included as part of this news release.\nFY 2017 Highlights\nRevenue of $1.29 billion, up 5 percent year over year GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 75 percent GAAP net income of $52 million, down 37 percent year over year Non-GAAP net income of $160 million, up 33 percent year over year Fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.40 Fully diluted non-GAAP EPS of $1.22 EBITDA of $219 million Dividends paid of $110 million, or $0.84 per share\nIn 2017, GAAP operating expenses were $815 million, up 3 percent year over year, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $769 million, flat year over year. GAAP net income in 2017 was $52 million, down 37 percent year over year, and non-GAAP net income in 2017 was $160 million, up 33 percent year over year.\nGuidance\nNI currently expects Q1 revenue to be in the range of $305 million to $335 million, which would be a new Q1 record at the midpoint. The company currently expects that GAAP fully diluted EPS will be in the range of $0.11 to $0.25 for Q1, with non-GAAP fully diluted EPS expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.33. For 2018, NI estimates its non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17 percent.\nNon-GAAP Presentation\nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, NI discloses certain non-GAAP operating results and non-GAAP information that exclude certain charges. In this news release, the company has presented its gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, income before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net income and basic and fully diluted EPS for the three-month and 12-month periods ending Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. NI is also providing guidance on its non-GAAP fully diluted EPS and expected effective tax rate. The company is not able to provide guidance on its GAAP tax rate or a related reconciliation without unreasonable efforts since its future GAAP tax rate depends on its future stock price and related information that is not currently available.\nWhen presenting non-GAAP information, the company includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to the GAAP results. Management believes that including the non-GAAP results assists investors in assessing the company’s operational performance and its performance relative to its competitors. The company presents these non-GAAP results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP, and these results should not be regarded as a substitute for GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability and performance of its business and does not consider stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related transaction costs, taxes levied on the transfer of acquired intellectual property, foreign exchange loss on acquisitions, restructuring charges, and tax reform charges in managing its operations. Specifically, management uses non-GAAP measures to plan and forecast future periods; to establish operational goals; to compare with its business plan and individual operating budgets; to measure management performance for the purposes of executive compensation, including payments to be made under bonus plans; to assist the public in measuring the company’s performance relative to the company’s long-term public performance goals; to allocate resources; and, relative to the company’s historical financial performance, to enable comparability between periods. Management also considers such non-GAAP results to be an important supplemental measure of its performance.\nThis news release discloses the company’s EBITDA for the three-month and 12-month periods ending Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016. The company believes that including the EBITDA results assists investors in assessing the company’s operational performance relative to its competitors. A reconciliation of EBITDA to GAAP net income is included with this news release.\nConference Call Information and Availability of Presentation Materials\nInterested parties can listen to the Q4 2017 earnings conference call with NI management today, Jan. 30, at 4:00 p.m. CT at www.ni.com/call .
