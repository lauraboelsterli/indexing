    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday sold $34 billion of five-year government notes at a yield of 2.434 percent, which was the highest yield at an auction of this debt maturity since April 2010, Treasury data showed.\nThe ratio of bids to the amount of five-year Treasuries offered was 2.48, the strongest reading since September. This measure of overall auction demand was 2.36 at the previous five-year note sale held in December. (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by James Dalgleish)\n ",
