Earnings call may attract some investors, but I think they have a long road ahead of them.”\nShares of the Dow component had taken a beating in the past week, falling more than 3 percent this year, compared with a 6 percent rise for the blue-chip index.\nUnited Technologies dipped 0.9 percent and General Dynamics dropped 2.05 percent following their results.\nAt 8:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 98 points, or 0.37 percent, with 27,874 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 9 points, or 0.32 percent, with 146,561 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 20.5 points, or 0.29 percent, on volume of 35,731 contracts.\nThe dollar hit fresh lows on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the World Economic Forum that he welcomed the currency’s weakness and on a strong start to the euro zone economy.\nWorries about a protectionist stance have added to the dollar’s woes after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday.\nThe dollar’s latest decline follows prolonged weakness in 2017.\n“I think it helps the stock market. When you have a pick-up in global economic activity with leading suppliers here in the United States whose sales are being helped along by a weaker dollar, you probably be buying from companies here,” said Pavlik.\nEarnings growth for S&P 500 companies for the fourth-quarter is expected at 12.4 percent through Tuesday morning, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOf the 68 companies in the benchmark index that have posted results, 76.5 percent have topped Wall Street expectations.\nAmong decliners, Qualcomm slipped 1 percent after European antitrust regulators slapped a $1.23 billion charge on the chipmaker for paying Apple to use only Qualcomm chips.\nUnited Continental tumbled 7 percent after the airline said it plans to increase capacity, likely threatening its profit margin. American Airlines fell 5.7 percent while Delta Air Lines dropped 5 percent.\nData on existing home sales for December is expected at 10:00 a.m. ET. The data is likely to show home sales fell to 5.7 million units from 5.81 million units in November.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
