Slideshow (5 Images) \nThe danger zone around the 2,462-metre (8,077-foot) volcano has been expanded to a radius of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles). Bichara said about 40,000 residents have sought temporary shelter in evacuation centers. \n“Some people outside the danger zone are afraid, so we also have to accommodate them,” he added. \nThe volcano, which draws many tourists, last erupted in 2014. \nGraphic: Volcanoes in the Philippines - tmsnrt.rs/2D6PYFu Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez",
