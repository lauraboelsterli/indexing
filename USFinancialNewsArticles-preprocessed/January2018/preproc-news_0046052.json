Soccer Football - Spanish King's Cup - Quarters Final Second Leg - FC Barcelona vs Espanyol - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - January 25, 2018 Barcelona’s Lionel Messi in action with Espanyol’s David Lopez REUTERS/Albert Gea \nHis every touch was loudly cheered on a night when Barca bade farewell to their versatile Argentine Javier Mascherano who is joining Chinese Super League side Heibei China Fortune. \nMascherano was given a guard of honour before the game in recognition of his seven-and-a-half years at the Nou Camp. Slideshow (6 Images) \nSuarez levelled the score in the tie after eight minutes, nodding in Aleix Vidal’s cross from close range to put Barca ahead on the night before Messi’s deflected effort from distance in the 25th ensured place in the last four. \nEspanyol produced a spirited late comeback but were almost caught on the break when Messi headed against the post. \nBarca join Real Madrid’s conquerors Leganes, Valencia, who on Wednesday beat last season’s runners-up Alaves on penalties, and Sevilla, who thrashed Atletico Madrid, in Friday’s draw for the semis, with the first legs to be played next Wednesday.
