    "text": "Around a dozen injured people were carried on stretchers out of the Indonesia Stock Exchange on Monday, eye witnesses said, after reports of a collapsed structure inside the building.\nDozens of police officials were cordoning off the two-tower, multi-storey complex as many people ran away and others were seen sitting on steps outside the lobby.\nDirector of the stock exchange Alpino Kianjaya declined to comment on the incident. Markets are currently in midday break and are scheduled to reopen at 1.30pm local time.\nImages circulating on social media showed a mangled metal structure that had collapsed around a Starbucks cafe near the entrance to the lobby.\nJakarta police said they were seeking more information on the incident.",
