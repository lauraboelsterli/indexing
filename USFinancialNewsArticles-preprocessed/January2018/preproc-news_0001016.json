LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 10,512.50, trading down 0.4 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, as local shares are expected to slip with global investors returning from New Year holiday, while rising crude oil prices will also hurt sentiment. Indian sovereign bonds are likely to rise in early trade, as the central bank announced the auction of a new 10-year paper this week, which will spur overall demand, traders said. The benchmark bond yield is likely to trade in 7.28 percent-7.34 percent band today, a trader with a private bank said. Yesterday, the note closed at 96.33 rupees, yielding 7.34 percent. GLOBAL MARKETS • There were no fireworks on Wall Street for the last trading day of the year, as U.S. stocks closed out their best year since 2013 on a down note, with losses in technology and financial stocks keeping equities in negative territory for the session. • Asian shares scaled a decade peak after a survey of Chinese manufacturing proved surprisingly upbeat, while the euro lurked within striking distance of its 2017 top against an ailing U.S. dollar. • The dollar fell to its lowest in over three months against a basket of major currencies on Friday, marking its steepest annual drop since 2003, on doubts over durability of a pickup in U.S. economic growth in wake of last week's tax overhaul. • Year-end demand helped U.S. Treasuries prices end the year stronger on Friday, before a heavy week of data, though volumes were light before Monday's New Year's Day holiday. • Oil prices had their highest January opening since 2014, with Brent and WTI crude prices rising to mid-2015 highs, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as strong demand. • Gold prices hit over 3-month highs, supported by technical factors after the precious metal broke through strong resistance last week.
