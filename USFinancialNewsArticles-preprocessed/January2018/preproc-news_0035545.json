    "text": "MUNICH, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The recently hired chief executive of scandal-plagued ride hailing giant Uber said on Monday that he was focused on what he called “responsbile growth” as he seeks to put an end to the take-no-prisoners’ culture he inherited in joining the company.\nSpeaking at a technology conference in Munich, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said he was “focused on going from growth-at-all-costs to responsible growth” and that the company was seeking to make a fresh start in Germany.
