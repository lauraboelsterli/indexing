    "text": "LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Germany’s 10-year bond yield hit its highest level since the October European Central Bank meeting, when policymakers first announced the extension of its bond-buying scheme, with one trader citing heavy supply as main cause behind today’s move.\nWith 10-year U.S. Treasury yields reaching 2.57 percent overnight for the first time since March last year, most euro zone 10-year govt bond yields were 1-2 basis points higher at the open on Wednesday.\nThe yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the bloc, was 2 bps higher at 0.48 percent.\nGerman Bund futures dropped as much as 30 ticks at the open, briefly touching the 161.00 mark before rising once again to 161.08.
