JAB will be the controlling shareholder of the new, publicly-traded Keurig Dr Pepper, while Keurig shareholder Mondelez will own about 13-14 percent.\nMarket presence: In addition to its namesake brands, Dr Pepper Snapple sells 7UP, Canada Dry, Schweppes, Hawaiian Punch, Mott’s and Vita Coco coconut water.
