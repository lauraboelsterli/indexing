    "text": "(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday declared unconstitutional Idaho’s bans on shooting secret videos and lying to enter factory farms to expose animal abuse, but revived other parts of the state’s law to curb undercover probes into the practice. \nThe decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle reversed part of a lower court ruling that Idaho’s 2014 “ag-gag” law was unconstitutional on free speech grounds. \nWriting for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown called the video ban a “classic example of a content-based restriction that cannot survive strict scrutiny.” \nShe also said the ban on making misrepresentations to enter facilities was void because it could criminalize innocent behavior, suffered from “staggering” overbreadth, and was largely “targeted at speech and investigative journalists.” \nBut the appeals court said Idaho could criminalize making misrepresentations to obtain records of agricultural facilities, and to obtain employment there with the intent of causing economic harm. \nIdaho’s Republican governor, C.L. “Butch” Otter, signed the ag-gag law in February 2014. \nThe law was passed after activists had released a video showing workers at a dairy beating and abusing cows, including when a tractor was used to drag a cow chained at the neck. \nJustin Marceau, a lawyer representing the Animal Legal Defense Fund in the case, called the appeals court decision a “mixed bag” for animal rights advocates. \n“It is a landmark decision because it upholds the right to record on factory farms and other private property,” he said in an interview. “Until today no federal circuit court had recognized (that right) outside the public sphere.” \nMarceau also said the ALDF will review its options on the parts of the law that were revived. \nThe office of Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, which defended the law, is reviewing the decision, spokesman Scott Graf said. \nAgricultural groups have pressed U.S. states to enact ag-gag laws to stop activists and journalists from secretly probing animal abuse at farms, dairies, feedlots and slaughterhouses. \nEleven states had such laws as of October 2017, though four faced legal challenges, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \nIn Thursday’s decision, McKeown also rejected the argument that Idaho’s ban on obtaining employment through misrepresentations was too broad because it could cover people who merely inflate their credentials, saying they lacked the needed intent to injure. \nThe dissenting judge, Carlos Bea, would have upheld more of the Idaho law. \nThe case is Animal Legal Defense Fund et al v Wasden, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-35960. \nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
