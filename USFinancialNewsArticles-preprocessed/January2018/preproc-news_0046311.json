He will be a member of the Management team, and will initially be based in Paris.\n“Julio’s broad experience in developing global marketing strategies and launching new drugs, notably in rare diseases, is a brilliant addition to the management team at GenSight,” said Bernard Gilly , cofounder and Chief Executive Officer. “As we are now about to read out our first Phase III topline results of GS010 in just a few months, and have the ambition to go to market on our own, we need to transform the Company and gear up.”\nPrior to joining GenSight, Mr. Benedicto was a Principal at IQVIA, based in its Munich office, where he was a member of the Brand and Commercial Strategy and Launch Excellence centers of excellence. He also worked at Monitor Group (now Monitor Deloitte) in its New York and London offices and at Booz & Company (now Strategy&, the consulting subsidiary of PwC) in its Berlin office.\nMr. Benedicto received a B.A. in Economics summa cum laude from Yale University (USA), and an M.A. and an M.Phil. in Economics from Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (USA).\n“I am energized to join the GenSight team at such an important time in the company’s evolution,” said Mr. Benedicto . “Turning the promise of path-breaking science into a novel life-changing treatment for patients is a complex but rewarding challenge, one that I am eager to help the company’s talented teams to navigate.”\nAbout GenSight Biologics\nGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders.
