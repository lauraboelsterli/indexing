(TSX: CMED) ( “CanniMed” or the “Company” ) today announced that Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ( “ISS” ), a leading independent proxy voting advisory firm, has recommended that CanniMed shareholders vote “FOR” the acquisition of Newstrike Resources.\nIn reaching its recommendation that CanniMed shareholders vote “FOR” the acquisition of Newstrike Resources, ISS stated:\n“[CanniMed Shareholders should] vote FOR the proposed acquisition of Newstrike, which will allow the company to access the recreational cannabis market while also significantly expanding its production capacity and diversifying its geographic footprint. The transaction is expected to be accretive on a 2019 estimated EBITDA-per-share basis and may have a positive branding impact.”\nISS also recognized that with Aurora’s hostile bid, the offer has “a $24 offer cap that has effectively halved the exchange ratio and CanniMed's expected ownership stake in the combined entity… turning the transaction into a dilutive one for CanniMed shareholders.”\nWelcoming ISS’ favourable recommendation, Brent Zettl President and CEO, CanniMed, stated: “We are pleased that ISS has recommended shareholders vote in favour of the Newstrike acquisition. We thank our shareholders for their ongoing support and unanimously recommend they follow the recommendations of ISS and the Board, by voting FOR the acquisition of Newstrike and saying NO to Aurora by not tendering and not voting on the blue proxy.”\nShareholders are reminded every vote counts regardless of how many shares they own and to vote their green proxies by January 19 th , 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time)\nIf you have any questions, please contact Kingsdale Advisors at 1-888-518-1554 toll-free in North America, or 416-867-2272 outside North America or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com .\nAbout CanniMed Therapeutics Inc.\nCanniMed is a Canadian-based, international plant biopharmaceutical company and a leader in the Canadian medical cannabis industry, with 17 years of pharmaceutical cannabis cultivation experience, state-of-the-art, GMP-compliant production process and world class research and development platforms with a wide range of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products.
