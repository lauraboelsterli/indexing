    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average soared to a level not seen since November 1991 on Thursday morning after exporters such as electronics components manufacturers surged, tracking the strength on Wall Street overnight.\nThe Nikkei rose 0.4 percent to 23,962.11 in midmorning trade, after hitting 24,084.42, the highest level since November 1991.\nU.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday as investors’ expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.\nJapanese chip making equipment manufacturers jumped, with Advantest surging 5 percent and Tokyo Electron soaring 3.4 percent.\nElectronic components makers Kyocera surged 1.3 percent, TDK soared 2.5 percent and motor maker Nidec advanced 1.9 percent.\nDrugmakers, on the other hand, lost ground, with Eisai falling 1.7 percent and Astellas Pharma sliding 1.3 percent.\nThe broader Topix, however, shed 0.1 percent to 1,889.62.
