    "text": " 26 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago Rolls-Royce to review strategic options for L'Orange​ Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain’s Rolls-Royce Holdings will review strategic options for its diesel parts maker L‘Orange, including a possible sale, it said on Monday in response to recent media speculation. \nThe group said that irrespective of the outcome of this review it would maintain close ties to L‘Orange, either as an owner or as a key customer. \nRolls-Royce said the review would have no impact on the remainder of the Rolls-Royce Power Systems business. \nIt said any decision about the future of L‘Orange would be subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board of Rolls-Royce Power Systems.
