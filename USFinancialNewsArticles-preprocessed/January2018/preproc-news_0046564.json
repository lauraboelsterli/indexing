I have spoken with everyone around the team and, for me, it is exciting to play in the Premier League. I spoke with the coach and for me, I am really happy to be training for an amazing coach.” \nMario scored three goals in 47 appearances since joining Inter from Sporting Lisbon in Aug. 2016. \nHe has 31 international caps and featured in all seven matches as Portugal won Euro 2016.
