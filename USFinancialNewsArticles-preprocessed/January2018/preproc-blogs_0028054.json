Williams took over as the head of the San Francisco Fed in March 2011, succeeding current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Stephen Lam | Reuters John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \nPresident Donald Trump is considering San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams to be the central bank's next vice chair, a source told CNBC. \nA separate source told CNBC that no decision had been made, adding that one is unlikely to be made next week with Trump traveling to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nWilliams took over as the head of the San Francisco Fed in March 2011, succeeding current Fed Chair Janet Yellen. He started his career at the Fed in 1994. He is also a voting member of the central bank's policymaking committee this year. \nThis would be the latest change to the U.S. central bank by President Trump. Late last year, he nominated Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become the next Fed chair. \nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the interest in Williams for the vice chair job.",
