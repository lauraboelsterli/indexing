The EU's single market allows the free movement of goods, people, capital and services between EU nations. Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images \n\"Unless you have got to invest, why would you invest (in Britain) now?\" Venables said. \nHe argued that companies from all over the world were \"much more likely\" to delay investments into the U.K. as a result of the \"massive uncertainty\" created by Brexit. 'Odd one out' \nGrowth in the U.S. and the euro zone — the U.K.'s major trading partners — is forecast to accelerate over the next few years to \"well above\" the averages of recent years, Kallum Pickering, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a research note published Thursday. \nPickering said that while the U.S. and Europe were well-positioned to fully enjoy the tailwind from the synchronized global upswing in economic growth, the uncertainty from Brexit would likely leave Britain as the \"odd one out.\" Sam Meredith Digital Reporter, CNBC.com Playing",
