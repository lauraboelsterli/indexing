    "text": "Believes Current Offer Dramatically Undervalues NXP\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ramius Advisors LLC (\"Ramius\"), an institutional investment manager and shareholder of both NXP Semiconductors (\"NXP\") (NASDAQ: NXPI) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), announced today its intention to reject Qualcomm's current tender offer for NXP shares. Ramius has communicated to the management and Board of Directors of NXP that it believes Qualcomm's offer dramatically undervalues NXP.\nRamius believes that the successful completion of the NXP acquisition will significantly enhance the value of Qualcomm, with or without the consummation of the conditional takeover bid from Broadcom. Should Qualcomm fail to complete its acquisition of NXP, Ramius believes that Qualcomm shareholders will seriously question the ability of Qualcomm to execute its strategy as an independent entity.\nAbout Ramius Advisors LLC\nRamius is an institutional asset manager, based in New York City.
