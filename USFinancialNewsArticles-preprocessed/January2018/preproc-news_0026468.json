    "text": "STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Jan. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) announced today that it commenced its previously scheduled extraordinary meeting of shareholders (“EGM”) to approve proposals related to the acquisition of Songa Offshore SE. The EGM is continuing to allow for the tabulation of votes required to meet a quorum.\nTransocean shareholders have shown overwhelming support for the transaction, with approximately 97% of the shares for which proxies have been submitted and counted indicating approval of the proposals. Unless a quorum is reached, the company will be unable to complete this transaction. The company expects to announce results of the EGM on or about January 17, 2018.\nAbout Transocean\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. The company specializes in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services, and believes that it operates one of the most versatile offshore drilling fleets in the world.\nTransocean owns or has partial ownership interests in, and operates a fleet of 39 mobile offshore drilling units consisting of 26 ultra-deepwater floaters, seven harsh environment floaters, two deepwater floaters and four midwater floaters. In addition, Transocean has three ultra-deepwater drillships under construction or under contract to be constructed. The company also operates two high-specification jackups that were under drilling contracts when the rigs were sold, and the company continues to operate these jackups until completion or novation of the drilling contracts.\nFor more information about Transocean, please visit: www.deepwater.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements in this release that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
