One hit the ground and killed six children and wounded two,” Ghazni police chief Mohammad Zaman told reporters. \nMohammad Radmanish, a spokesman for the defense ministry, also blamed Taliban for the attack: “We can say clearly that it was a rocket by the enemy forces.” he said. \n“The person who fired the rockets was killed by our forces and we seized his rocket.” \nHowever local people said the children died in an air strike by Afghan security forces, which have been conducting an increasing number of air operations as their fledgling air force has grown over the past year. \nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the air strike had killed seven civilians, wounded six and destroyed four houses. \nA defense ministry official in Kabul said three civilians had been killed in an air strike near Ghazni but it was not clear whether they were children. \nAccording to the latest report from the United Nations, 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 wounded between January and September last year, with more than a third killed in ground engagements. Armed conflict killed 689 children and wounded another 1,791 during the period.
