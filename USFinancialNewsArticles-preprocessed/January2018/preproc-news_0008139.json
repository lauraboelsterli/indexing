Together, our strong engineering talent, leading technology and deep domain expertise will unlock incredible innovation, choice and value for customers around the world.”\nThe legacy Silver Spring Networks business is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron, Inc. and will be integrated and reported as a new business segment, Itron Networked Solutions.\nItron will provide total consolidated company revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for full-year 2018, inclusive of the addition of Silver Spring Networks, in conjunction with its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results.\nAbout Itron\nItron is a world-leading technology and services company dedicated to the resourceful use of energy and water.
