    "text": "WILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE:CRL) today announced the appointment of Jean-Paul Mangeolle, former President of AB SCIEX, to its Board of Directors. Mr. Mangeolle’s extensive experience leading global life science and bioscience companies, with a specific focus on high-end instrumentation, will provide Charles River with a unique combination of expertise. As a member of the Board, he will serve on the Audit and Compensation Committees.\n“Mr. Mangeolle’s background leading global organizations and expanding into key international markets will enhance the expertise of Charles River’s Board and play a valuable role as we strategically expand Charles River’s unique portfolio of early-stage drug research products and services,” said James C. Foster, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Charles River. “His extensive experience with the conception, design, manufacture, and marketing of high-end instrumentation will be particularly helpful as we continue to build our Microbial Solutions business.”\nMr. Mangeolle has more than 35 years of experience in life science and bioscience on a global scale. He has extensive experience building teams and profitable businesses across the globe in multiple market segments, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic research laboratories, microelectronics manufacturing, and OEM companies. He retired recently from AB SCIEX (an operating company of Danaher Corp.), where he had held the position of president since 2014. In that role, he was responsible for Sciex’s and Phenomenex’s global operations. Previously, he was Executive Vice President for the Process Solutions Business Unit of Merck KGaA Millipore. Mr. Mangeolle spent more than 25 years with Millipore in progressively larger roles, culminating in the role of President, Bioprocess Division, where he was also a member of the Corporate Executive Committee and an elected corporate officer.\n“I am pleased to join Charles River’s Board of Directors and look forward to contributing to the future success and growth of this recognized global leader in early-stage drug discovery and development,” said Mr. Mangeolle. “In particular, I am looking forward to providing strategic counsel to Charles River’s Microbial Solutions business, drawing on my manufacturing experience to support its future growth.”\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
