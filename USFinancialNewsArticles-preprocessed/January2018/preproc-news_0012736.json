(NES), since NES received FDA clearance for reprocessing the popular vein ablation catheter in 2011.\nThe ClosureFast ® Catheter is one of the most widely used devices in the United States for performing endovenous treatment of venous reflux disease, a serious medical condition affecting blood circulation in the lower legs that causes varicose veins.\n“As we approach the sixth anniversary of the launch of our reprocessing service and mark the attainment of another significant milestone in the number of ClosureFast ® Catheters that have been successfully reprocessed, we are proud of the exceptional value this service continues to deliver to our customers,” said Stewart Strong, President and General Manager of the Interventional business unit of Teleflex. “The reprocessing service is designed to help hospitals and vein clinics reduce costs and cut down on medical waste, objectives that are at the very core of Teleflex’s commitment to cost-effective healthcare.”\nTeleflex is offering the ClosureFast ® Catheter reprocessing service under contract with NES, an established third-party reprocessor of medical devices. NES received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on November 30, 2011 for reprocessing the ClosureFast ® Catheter. Since the reprocessing service was introduced jointly by NES and Vascular Solutions, Inc. in January 2012, several hundred U.S. hospitals and vein clinics have enrolled in the program.\n“Since Teleflex’s acquisition of Vascular Solutions in February 2017, we have been very pleased to be working in collaboration with NES. We share the commitment to helping hospitals and vein clinics reduce costs and cut down on medical waste,” said Strong. “We have recently augmented the level of customer service for the ClosureFast ® Catheter reprocessing program by introducing an in-house sales team to support the ongoing efforts of our direct sales force.”\nCraig Allmendinger, Chief Executive Officer of NES, commented, “We are gratified by the achievements of the ClosureFast ® Catheter reprocessing service. The reprocessed vein ablation catheters have demonstrated an excellent record for a sustained period of time and the program has earned the respect of a growing number of vein clinic practitioners. With Teleflex’s vast experience in the vein clinic market and its focus on the needs of its physician customers and patient outcomes, we look forward to the continued success of the program.”\nIn addition to offering the reprocessing service for ClosureFast ® Catheters, Teleflex markets a full range of accessory products that are needed to perform both RF- and laser-based vein ablation procedures. The company offers procedure packs designed for either RF or laser procedures, micro-introducers and 7F micro-HV kits, 0.018” and 0.025” guidewires, 18G echogenic needles for percutaneous entry, products for administering tumescent anesthesia, and disposable vein hooks for use in phlebectomy procedures.\nAbout Northeast Scientific\nNortheast Scientific, Inc.
