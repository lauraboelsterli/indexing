Everyone is doing well here.” REFILE - QUALITY REPEAT Vehicles are seen during a tsunami warning evacuation in Kodiak, Alaska, U.S., January 23, 2018 in this still image obtained from social media video. Instagram @JUPITERTHEPRODUCER.ASTORIA via REUTERS \nLong lines of traffic formed in coastal communities including Homer and Seward, Alaska, residents warned on social media. \nIn Homer, a few hundred cars were packed into its high school parking lot. Shawn Biessel, a 32-year-old park ranger, and his mother were in the lot, a few hundred feet above sea level. \n“It was a really obvious, pretty strong, long quake. A good rumbler,” Biessel said in a phone interview. “It went on for a solid minute and after a while we thought we should get outside.” \nPolice drove through Biessel’s neighborhood with flashing lights to alert residents to evacuate, Biessel said. \n“Please heed local warnings to move inland or to higher ground,” Alaska Governor Bill Walker said in a statement. \nSan Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management briefly warned residents within three blocks of the Pacific Ocean or five blocks of San Francisco Bay to prepare to evacuate. That warning was lifted when the tsunami watch was lifted. \nAn initial tsunami watch for Hawaii was canceled. \nJapan’s meteorological agency said it was monitoring the situation but did not issue a tsunami alert.
