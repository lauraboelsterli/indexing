    "text": " 32 PM / in 8 minutes UPDATE 1-Juniper Networks' 1st-qtr forecast disappoints, shares slide Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds Q1 forecast, share price) \nJan 30 (Reuters) - Network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc on Tuesday forecast earnings and revenue for the current quarter well below analysts’ forecasts, as its large cloud computing customers delay deployments. \nShares of Sunnyvale, California-based Juniper fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. \nFor the quarter ending March 31, Juniper expects adjusted earnings of around 25 cents per share and revenue of around $1.05 billion. \nAnalysts were expecting earnings of 42 cents per share and revenue of $1.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nJuniper said the forecast reflected “deployment delays as Juniper expects its large cloud customers to continue their architectural transition, which is expected to result in below normal seasonality.” \nHit by softness in the switches and routers markets, Juniper, like bigger rivals including Cisco Systems Inc , has been focusing on other areas such as cloud computing. \nBut Juniper’s cloud revenue fell 37 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. \nThat contributed to the worst decline in overall revenue in at least four quarters. \nTotal revenue fell 10.5 percent to $1.24 billion. Analysts on average had expected $1.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nJuniper posted a net loss of $148.1 million or 40 cents per share, reflecting a $289.5 million one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding one-time items, Juniper earned 53 cents per share, edging past analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent. \nThe company announced an 80 percent increase to its quarterly dividend and a $2 billion share repurchase plan. \nIt plans to repatriate about $3 billion as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform.
