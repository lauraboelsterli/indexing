    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNO), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced the appointment of Cindy Elkins as Chief Information Officer (CIO). Elkins will report to Hans Bishop, Juno’s President and CEO.\n“Cindy is a leader with a track record of increasing the impact of information technology in the biotech industry, focusing on innovation and delivering advanced technologies that support the discovery of breakthrough therapies,” said Mr. Bishop. “Her talent, passion and experience will help us advance our mission to bring better medicines to patients.”\nMs. Elkins served most recently as Vice President, IT for the Americas at Genentech, where she led the US commercial technology integration following the acquisition of Genentech by Roche. Under her leadership, Genentech became the first biotech company to implement several key technology platforms at scale, and her teams consistently provided exceptional user experience to over 44,000 people. Prior to her tenure at Genentech she was Vice President and General Manager at Ariba, a software and information technology services firm, where she helped create the world’s largest web-based trading community.\n“I am delighted to join Juno, a company that reflects my passion for vibrant, accountable, high-performing organizations seeking to transform and innovate at scale,” said Ms. Elkins. “It is an honor to be a part of a mission to fundamentally change the way cancer and other diseases are treated, and to provide the tools and infrastructure to allow Juno’s employees to do their best work.”\nShe is a member of the Board of Directors of Weight Watchers, and earned her MBA from Santa Clara University and BS in Applied Mathematics from UCLA.\nAbout Juno\nJuno Therapeutics is building a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer. Juno is developing multiple cell-based product candidates to treat a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Several product candidates have shown compelling clinical responses in clinical trials in refractory leukemia and lymphoma conducted to date. Juno's long-term aim is to leverage its cell-based platform to develop new product candidates that address a broader range of cancers and human diseases. Juno brings together innovative technologies from some of the world's leading research institutions, including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Seattle Children's Research Institute (SCRI), the University of California, San Francisco, and The National Cancer Institute. Juno Therapeutics has an exclusive license to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital patented technology for CD19-directed product candidates that use 4-1BB, which was developed by Dario Campana, Chihaya Imai, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Juno’s product candidate JCAR017 was developed in collaboration with SCRI and others.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding Juno’s mission, progress, and business plans; the ability of Juno’s executive team to advance Juno as a global leader in T cell engineering and manufacturing; and the potential of Juno’s therapies to eradicate and cure certain types of cancers and other serious diseases.
