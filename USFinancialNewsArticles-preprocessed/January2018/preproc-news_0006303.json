    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 6:14 AM / in 7 hours Tennis: Auckland Classic set for Sunday finish after further rain Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - The Auckland Classic will be extended by a day with the final now scheduled to be played on Sunday after persistent rain washed out play for a second consecutive day on Friday. \nHeavy rain prevented an entire day’s play on Thursday, with similar weather conditions 24 hours later forcing all singles matches to be postponed once more. \nThe quarter-finals and semi-finals will now be played on Saturday with the final taking place a day later. \nCzech third seed Barbora Strycova will square off against Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-wei in the first quarter-final, while German second seed Julia Goerges plays Polona Hercog of Slovenia in the revised schedule. \nTop seed Caroline Wozniacki will meet American wildcard Sofia Kenin, while fourth seed Agnieszka Radwasnka faces American Sachia Vickery in the other quarter-final matches.
