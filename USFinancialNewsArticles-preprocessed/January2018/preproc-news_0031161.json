    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jernigan Capital, Inc. (NYSE:JCAP) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 1,500,000 shares of its newly designated 7.00% Series B cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") at a public offering price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds, after the underwriting discount but before estimated expenses of the offering payable by the Company, of approximately $36.3 million.\nThe offering is expected to close on January 26, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 225,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company has applied to list the shares of Series B Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"JCAP PR B.\" If the application is approved, the Company expects trading to commence 30 days after initial delivery of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of an investment in bridge financing with respect to five self-storage facilities located in the Miami, FL MSA for which the Company has executed a non-binding term sheet, or if such investment is not consummated, for other existing or future investments in our development portfolio and operating property loan portfolio and for general corporate purposes.\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering and B. Riley FBR, Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp. and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. are acting as co-managers.\nThis offering may only be made by means of a prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus.

The ultimate occurrence of events and results referenced in these forward-looking statements is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statement. For example, the fact that the offering has priced may imply that the offering will close, but the closing is subject to conditions customary in transactions of this type and may be delayed or may not occur at all. In addition, the fact that the underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares may imply that this option will be exercised. However, the underwriters are not under any obligation to exercise this option, or any portion of it, and may not do so. Investors should not place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements. Further, no assurance can be given that the net proceeds from the offering will be used as indicated.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180119005798/en/\nJernigan Capital, Inc.\nJohn Good, 901-567-9517\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\njohn@jernigancapital.com\nSource: Jernigan Capital, Inc.",
