A damaged car is seen in Sidon, Lebanon January 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ali Hachicho \nThe targeted official was Mohamed Hamdan, also known as Abu Hamza, the sources and al-Manar said. He was “slightly wounded” in the attack, a Hamas official in Sidon, Ayman Shanaa, told a Palestinian television station, Paltoday. \nThe blast destroyed Hamdan’s silver BMW and sent a column of smoke into the sky over Sidon, 40 km (25 miles) south of Beirut, television footage from the scene broadcast by Lebanese television stations showed. \nWitnesses said the man targeted in the attack appeared to have been wounded in the leg. He was transported to hospital where he was being treated for his wounds. \nSidon is home to two of Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian refugee camps. The attack took place in a residential area in northern Sidon. Reporting by Tom Perry; Additional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi; Editing by Lousie Heavens and Dale Hudson",
