    "text": "BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that he made several new bets, including a “large” one on Brighthouse Financial, late last year and that he made money on automaker General Motors but lost money on Amazon and Tesla .\nEinhorn’s Greenlight Capital bought into Brighthouse Financial, MetLife’s former U.S. retail life-insurance business at an average cost of $57.92, according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters. The stock is now trading at $63.90.\nThe fund manager also said General Motors, which was his firm’s biggest winner last year, remains “significantly under valued” given the automaker’s “impressive fundamental performance.” (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
