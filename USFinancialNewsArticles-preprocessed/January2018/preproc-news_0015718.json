Mr. Porzelt, who joined the bank on November 1, 2017, fills the role vacated by Timothy King, who retired on December 31, 2017.\n\"We are excited about having someone of Chris's caliber join Dime and further build out and strengthen our already robust risk culture,\" said Mr. Mahon. \"The changing nature of risk in our industry and throughout the bank requires a highly integrated and proactive approach to enterprise risk management (\"ERM\"), and having a leader such as Chris, with his depth and diversity of experience, will be highly valuable.\"\nMr. Porzelt has over 25 years of audit and financial services experience and joins the bank from EisnerAmper LLP, where he was Managing Director of the Consulting Services Group. In this role, Mr. Porzelt engaged with financial services companies to protect value and enhance outcomes and performance through practical and cost-effective solutions, including the coordination and utilization of people, processes and technology, as well as the translation of complex challenges and regulatory requirements into sound strategies.

The ERM group was further strengthened by two recent additions, Kevin Corbett and Alex Leon. Mr. Corbett, who serves as Chief Credit Officer, was most recently Chief Credit Officer of Astoria Bank and Chairman of the Executive Loan Committee. Mr. Leon, who serves as Chief Information Security Officer, was previously at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation as Head of Information Technology/Information Security Business Management.\nABOUT DIME COMMUNITY BANCSHARES, INC.\nThe Company had $6.44 billion in consolidated assets as of September 30, 2017, and is the parent company of the bank.
