    "text": "January 16, 2018 / 7:56 PM / in 14 minutes Brazil's president calls for Caixa VPs to step down for 15 days Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRASILIA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer on Tuesday called for the vice presidents of state lender Caixa Econômica Federal to step down for 15 days to defend themselves from accusations of wrongdoing. \nProsecutors and the central bank had previously demanded the ouster of Caixa’s 12 vice presidents following a series of corruption probes. If they are not replaced by a Feb. 26 deadline, Temer could be charged with administrative measures, the prosecutor-general’s office said on Tuesday. \nRepresentatives for Caixa declined to comment earlier in the day.
