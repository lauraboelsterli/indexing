Six of its 10 main groups were in positive territory.\n* BlackBerry jumped 12.9 percent to C$16.95, hitting its highest level since 2013, after saying it will provide the foundational operating system for search engine company Baidu's autonomous vehicle platform, the latest in a string of recent automotive design wins.\n* Canadian cannabis producers extended sharp rallies in heavy volume as California opened the largest U.S. state market for legal marijuana, with Canada expected to follow by mid-2018.
