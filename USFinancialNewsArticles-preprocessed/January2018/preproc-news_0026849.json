    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump had a normal score on a cognitive exam and is in excellent health, although he could benefit from a lower-fat diet and more exercise, the White House physician said on Tuesday.\n“In summary, the president’s overall health is excellent,” Ronny Jackson told reporters. “He continues to enjoy the significant long-term cardiac and overall health benefits that come from a lifetime of abstinence from tobacco and alcohol.” (Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe; Writing by Makini Brice)\n ",
