    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkNewsWire — NetworkNewsWire (\"NNW\"), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company, today announces the publication of an editorial featuring Standard Lithium Ltd. (TSX.V:SLL) (FRA:S5L) (OTCQX:STLHF), a client of NNW that is building one of the largest portfolios of high quality, domestic U.S. lithium brine assets.\nTo view the full publication, titled “More Lithium Juniors Could Get Swallowed by Majors in 2018,” visit: https://www.networknewswire.com/lithium-juniors-get-swallowed-majors-2018/\nStandard Lithium Ltd. ﻿ (TSX.V:SLL) (FRA:S5L) (OTCQX:STLHF)﻿ launched in 2017 and is led by a management team harboring decades of experience in the lithium mining space. Standard Lithium stands out in this market because SLL is one of the few small cap investment options available in lithium mining that offers a pure play in the U.S. lithium market. This gives Standard Lithium a key strategic advantage when the U.S. market begins to seek domestic sources of metals like lithium, as per Trump’s executive order .\nIn the Bristol Dry Lake area, Standard Lithium is working quickly to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium, as it outlined in a mid-December update ( http://nnw.fm/1Cc5Z ). Standard Lithium installed a total of six new test evaporation ponds at the Bristol Dry Lake property in order to further assess the role that short-duration passive solar evaporation may play in pre-concentrating the near surface lithium brines encountered at the project. Standard Lithium also took samples of lithium brine from all surface pits in the Bristol Dry Lake property, with results expected in the coming weeks. The Cadiz Dry Lake property will be assessed in a similar manner.\nThe Smackover Project consists of up to 33,000 acres of brine leases located in a key brine production fairway in southern Arkansas, at the disposal of Standard Lithium for exploration, production, and extraction focus on lithium. Based on historical data, these areas have reported values of 370-424 mg/L of lithium in the brines. This elevates the Smackover Formation as a lower-risk exploration opportunity, which will aid in Standard Lithium’s endeavors to accelerate new production sources of lithium such as this one.\nAbout Standard Lithium\nStandard's value creation strategy encompasses acquiring a diverse and highly prospective portfolio of large-scale domestic brine resources, led by an innovative and results-oriented management team with a strong focus on technical skills. The company is currently focused on the immediate exploration and development of the Bristol Dry Lake Lithium Project located in the Mojave region of San Bernardino County, California; the location has significant infrastructure in-place, with easy road and rail access, abundant electricity and water sources, and is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities. The company is also commencing resource evaluation on its 33,000 acres of lithium brine leases located in the Smackover Formation.\nFor more information, visit the company's website at www.StandardLithium.com .\nAbout NetworkNewsWire\nNetworkNewsWire (NNW) is an information service that provides (1) access to our news aggregation and syndication servers, (2) NetworkNewsBreaks that summarize corporate news and information, (3) enhanced press release services, (4) social media distribution and optimization services, and (5) a full array of corporate communication solutions.
