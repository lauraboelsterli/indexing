For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating earnings were $102.2 million ($2.30 per share) compared to $92.4 million ($2.08 per share) for the 2016 fiscal year.\nFourth Quarter Year to Date Earnings Per Diluted Share 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 1.29 $ 0.72 $ 2.36 $ 2.59 Operating earnings (1) $ 1.21 $ 0.56 $ 2.30 $ 2.08 (1) See discussion below of non-GAAP and performance measures. Highlights for the quarter included:\nUnderwriting income (1) of $9.0 million, resulting in a combined ratio (1) of 95.2. 11% increase in gross premiums written and 10% increase in investment income. Favorable development in prior years’ loss reserves resulting in a $5.2 million net increase in underwriting income. $0.63 per share increase to net earnings from recent tax reform. Special dividend of $1.75 per share, representing $77.3 million returned to shareholders.\nHighlights for the year included:\nUnderwriting income of $26.8 million, resulting in a combined ratio of 96.4. 1% growth in gross premiums written. Losses from hurricanes resulting in a $31.7 million net decrease to underwriting income. Favorable development in prior years’ loss reserves resulting in a $37.5 million net increase in underwriting income. 22 nd consecutive year of a combined ratio below 100. Book value per share of $19.33, an increase of 17% from year-end 2016, inclusive of dividends.\n“RLI’s strong customer focus, financial performance and rewards to shareholders continued to distinguish us in 2017,” said RLI Corp. Chairman & CEO Jonathan E. Michael. “The 96 combined ratio included 4 points from hurricane losses, which was within our expectations for events of this magnitude. Despite exiting a few underperforming product lines and re-underwriting our transportation business, we ended the year with a 1% increase in gross premiums written, which was supported by an 11% increase in premium in the fourth quarter. Our investment portfolio and minority investment in Maui Jim contributed significantly to earnings and book value growth in 2017. At year end, we paid another special dividend, reinforcing our commitment to shareholders.”\n“We enter 2018 well positioned to capitalize on market conditions with a talented team, diverse product portfolio, disciplined underwriting and service-oriented culture,” said Michael.\nUnderwriting Income\nRLI had $9.0 million of underwriting income in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a 95.2 combined ratio, compared to $18.2 million of underwriting income on a 90.3 combined ratio in the same quarter for 2016.\nFor the year, RLI had $26.8 million of underwriting income on a 96.4 combined ratio, compared to $76.1 million on an 89.5 combined ratio in 2016. The third quarter of 2017 was impacted by hurricane losses with a $31.7 million net decrease in underwriting income due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Results for both years include favorable development in prior years’ loss reserves which totaled $37.5 million and $36.4 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table highlights underwriting income and combined ratios by segment.\nUnderwriting Income (1) Combined Ratio (1) (in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Casualty $ 3.9 $ 36.3 Casualty 99.2 92.0 Property (11.9 ) 12.8 Property 108.6 91.6 Surety 34.8 27.0 Surety 71.2 77.8 Total $ 26.8 $ 76.1 Total 96.4 89.5 (1) See discussion below of non-GAAP and performance measures. Tax Reform Impact\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among other provisions, the TCJA lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% starting January 1, 2018. As a result, RLI revalued deferred tax items as of year-end 2017 to reflect the lower rate. Most significantly, lower future taxes applicable to unrealized gains on investments and other deferred tax items resulted in a reduction in our net deferred tax liability of $32.8 million. This change lowered tax expense in the quarter, increasing net earnings and operating earnings by $0.63 per share, inclusive of the effect of performance-related incentive and profit sharing expenses. Performance-related amounts impact policy acquisition, insurance operating and general corporate expenses, increasing the expense ratio by 3.7 points in the fourth quarter and 1.0 point for the full year, respectively.\nOther Income\nRLI’s net investment income for the quarter increased 9.8% to $14.4 million, compared to the same period in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, investment income was $54.9 million versus $53.1 million for the same period in 2016. The investment portfolio’s total return was 1.4% for the quarter. The bond portfolio’s return was 0.4% in the quarter, while the equity portfolio’s return was 5.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the investment portfolio’s total return was 6.6% with the bond portfolio returning 4.4% and equities returning 15.8%.\nComprehensive earnings, which include after-tax unrealized gains/losses from the investment portfolio, were $61.8 million for the quarter ($1.39 per share) compared to -$2.9 million (-$0.06 per share) for the same quarter in 2016. Full-year comprehensive earnings were $140.3 million ($3.15 per share), compared to $113.8 million ($2.56 per share) in 2016.\nEquity in earnings of Maui Jim, Inc., a producer of premium sunglasses, was $0.8 million (reflecting seasonal sales results) for the quarter. Equity in earnings of Prime Holdings Insurance Services, Inc., a specialty E&S insurance company, was $1.0 million. Comparatively, in the fourth quarter of 2016, equity in earnings of Maui Jim was -$0.1 million and offset $0.1 million of earnings from Prime. For the year ended December 31, 2017, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees from Maui Jim and Prime was $14.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, compared to $9.7 million and $1.1 million from Maui Jim and Prime, respectively, for the prior year. Maui Jim announced a $9.9 million dividend, which resulted in a tax benefit on dividends from affiliates of $1.4 million ($0.03 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSpecial and Regular Dividends\nOn December 27, 2017, RLI paid a special cash dividend of $1.75 per share, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.9 million ($0.04 per share) as dividends to the ESOP are fully deductible, and a regular quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share for a combined total of $86.5 million. RLI has paid dividends for 166 consecutive quarters and increased regular dividends in each of the last 42 years. Over the last 10 years, the company’s regular quarterly dividend has grown an average of 6.2% per year.\nNon-GAAP and Performance Measures\nManagement has included certain non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in presenting the Company’s results. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures better explain the Company’s results of operations and allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s business. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, our definitions of these items may not be comparable to the definitions used by other companies.\nOperating earnings and earnings per share (EPS) from operations consist of our GAAP net earnings adjusted by the net realized gains/(losses) and taxes related thereto. Net earnings and net earnings per share are the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to operating earnings and EPS from operations. A reconciliation of the operating earnings and EPS from operations to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the 2017 financial highlights below.\nUnderwriting income or profit represents the pretax profitability of our insurance operations and is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expenses, policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses from net premium earned, which are all GAAP financial measures. The combined ratio, which is derived from components of underwriting income, is a performance measure commonly used by property and casualty insurance companies and is calculated as the sum of loss and settlement expenses, policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned.\nOther News\nAt 10 a.m. central standard time (CST) tomorrow, January 25, 2018, RLI management will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results with insurance industry analysts. Interested parties may listen to the discussion through the Internet at https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/3koihhpq .\nExcept for historical information, this news release may include (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) including, without limitation, statements reflecting our current expectations about the future performance of our company or our business segments or about future market conditions. These statements are subject to certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
