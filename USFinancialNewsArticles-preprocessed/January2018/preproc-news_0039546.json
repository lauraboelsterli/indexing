    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 11:54 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Alpine skiing - Shiffrin skids out in Kronplatz after rare slip Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nKRONPLATZ, Italy (Reuters) - Runaway World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin made a rare slip on Tuesday when she skidded off the course and failed to complete the first leg of the giant slalom at Kronplatz in Italy. \nShiffrin had nearly finished her run but took one risk too many, causing her to fall. The American, who has won 10 World Cup races this season, quickly got back up and looked annoyed with herself.   \nShe leads the overall standings on 1,477 points, ahead of Liechtenstein’s Tina Weirather in a distant second on 601. \nThe 22-year-old is a favourite for next month’s Winter Games in Pyeongchang, where she is widely expected to retain the slalom title she won at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, as well as having a shot at gold in both the giant slalom and Super G. \nNorwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel was fastest on the first leg.
