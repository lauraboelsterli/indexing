    "text": "Salvatore Liguigli / Eyeem | Getty Images Washington DC \nUnsurprisingly, WalletHub found that the District of Columbia will bear the greatest impact. Washington, D.C., has the highest share of federal jobs and the highest percentage of residents who depend on federal contracts. Maryland, which came in second on the list, will be impacted for similar reasons. \nStates with high percentages of children who receive health insurance through CHIP also ranked highly on the list of the states most impacted by the shutdown. WalletHub calculated that California and Montana had the highest share of kids who depend on CHIP. \nOverall, WalletHub found that red states and blue states would be similarly impacted but that red states would be hit harder. The average score for a state that voted majority republican during the 2016 presidential election was 28.17, and the average score for state that voted majority democrat was 22.90. \nLike this story?
