    "text": "Ripple , the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by value, hit a record high on Wednesday as its strong rally continues.\nThe digital coin jumped 29 percent to an all-time high of $3.20 in afternoon trading, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple, or XRP, now has a market capitalization of $122.7 billion and remains solidly in second place to bitcoin , which has a market value of about $251 billion, the website showed.\nRipple 12-month performance\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nThe website showed ripple has gained more than 49,500 percent over the last 12 months, and more than 160 percent over the last week.\nWhat is ripple? Unlike bitcoin, Ripple is a company that has created coin known as XRP that is aimed at enterprises.\nRipple markets itself as a cross-border payments solution for large financial institutions based on blockchain technology.\nshow chapters This payment service wants to work with banks 7 Hours Ago | 02:25 Currently, an international payment may take a few days to complete, and at a high cost. A headache for banks is high-volume, but low-value, transactions â€” the kind that Facebook might pay out to app makers, for example. These can often be expensive and unprofitable for banks because it takes a lot of effort to move the money and the percentage cut won't be as high as for a larger transaction.\nRipple is trying to solve this problem via its technology. XRP can be used by enterprises to get instant liquidity needed in a high-value transaction, without having to pay fees.\nXRP acts as a bridge between fiat currencies during a transaction. Ripple said transactions in XRP can be settled in four seconds, faster than any major cryptocurrency right now.\nWhy is it rallying? Ripple has been conducting trials with a number of financial institutions , including American Express and Santander.\nIts price was also helped by news in December that Japan's SBI Holdings and SBI Ripple Asia, which was formed as a partnership between the two firms in 2016, created a consortium with Japanese credit card companies to utilize blockchain.\nBlockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, including Ripple.\nshow chapters What is Blockchain? 7:14 AM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 | 04:44 There is also a sense that investors are looking at alternative digital tokens beyond bitcoin. Bitcoin's dominance of the cryptocurrency market hit its lowest level ever on Tuesday, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.",
