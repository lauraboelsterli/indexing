Devotees try to reach the unbalanced image of the Black Nazarene during an annual procession at Luneta grandstand, Metro Manila, Philippines January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco \nAround 380,000 people were in the Manila procession, based on an early afternoon estimate by police, excluding those waiting elsewhere along the parade route. \nExplaining the strong Filipino devotion, Monsignor Sabino Vengco, a prominent Catholic priest, told CNN Philippines: “People will suffer sickness, old age...so pain and suffering will always be there,” he said.
