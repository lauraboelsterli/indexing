    "text": " 30 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago UK competition watchdog raises concerns about Refresco bottling deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority on Wednesday said it is concerned that Refresco’s ( RFRG.AS ) $1.25 billion purchase of Canada-based Cott Corp’s ( BCB.TO ) bottling activities could result in higher prices or lead to lower quality standards. \nThe UK regulator will refer the acquisition by the Netherlands-based drinks bottler for an in-depth investigation unless Refresco offers undertakings that would assuage its worries, the watchdog said. \nThe CMA noted that both Refresco and Cott have sizeable businesses in Britain.
