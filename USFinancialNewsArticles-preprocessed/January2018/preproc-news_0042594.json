    "text": "(Reuters) - Nearly half of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group’s [HNAIRC.UL] listed units have suspended trading in their shares since November as the group faces rising financing costs after a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years.\nSeven HNA firms, with a combined market value of $30.6 billion, halted trading of their shares, pending announcements. Investors are jittery about further suspensions as the group’s debt-fueled acquisitions and opaque ownership structure have sparked global regulatory scrutiny.\nThe U.S. government will not approve any investment by HNA until it provides adequate information on who its shareholders are, a source familiar with the situation said.\nThis week, the head of the aviation leasing arm of China Development Bank said the policy bank was willing to help HNA Group as the Hainan-based group has solid airline operations and it would serve nobody’s interest to see it collapse.\nBelow are lists of the units under trading halts and those still trading:\nUNDER TRADING SUSPENSIONS: 1.
