    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday co-operation is the only “correct direction” for the China-U.S. trade relationship, amid growing trade frictions between the world’s two biggest economies.\nCommerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng made the comments during a regular weekly briefing in Beijing.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday the United States is not starting a trade war but trying to level the playing field of global commerce and fend off Chinese protectionism, including a “direct threat” in high-tech goods.[nL8N1PJ5SO]\nReporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
