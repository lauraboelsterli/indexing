    "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos could end up changing the health-care system just as he did with retail, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday.\nEarlier Tuesday, e-commerce giant Amazon , J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway announced a partnership to improve U.S. employee health care and cut health-care costs.\nDetails were sketchy, but the first goal will be to target technology solutions to simplify the health system.\nCramer speculated whether Bezos could come up with a pricing model for prescription drugs, charging only a $50 fee on Amazon Prime subscriptions. Prime service currently grants perks for its users, including faster shipping and access to Amazon Video.\n\"Amazon Prime could make it so you pay a lot less for a lot of drugs,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street .\"\nCramer cited Bezos' impact on other sectors, most notably retail.\n\"Think about what he did to every other business. How about that? Would you pay that to your premium because he's going to be the biggest buying group?\" said Cramer, the host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\"\nCNBC has previously reported Amazon was in talks with generic drugmakers about a potential entry into the pharmacy space.\nIn the announcement Tuesday, Bezos said: \"The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty.\"\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
