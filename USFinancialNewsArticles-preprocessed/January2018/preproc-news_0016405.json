Furthermore, the Company anticipates its effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5% to 25.5% for the year ending December 31, 2018, which reflects the newly enacted federal tax rate of 21%, projected 2018 nontaxable income, the estimated benefit of deductions for equity-based compensation and the Company’s historic effective state and local income tax rates.\nAdditionally, the Company announced today that it will release its 2017 fourth quarter and year end results on Monday, January 22, 2018, after the close of the market. The Company will host a fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, January 23, 2018. The earnings conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet at https://services.choruscall.com/links/fbk180123AWsp51Nq.html . For investors or analysts who want to participate during the call, the listen only dial-in number is 888-299-7209. For those unable to listen live, an online replay of the webcast will be available approximately an hour following the conclusion of the live broadcast. A link to these events can be found on the Company’s website at https://www.firstbankonline.com/ .\nAbout FB Financial Corporation\nFB Financial Corporation (NYSE: FBK) is a bank holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.
