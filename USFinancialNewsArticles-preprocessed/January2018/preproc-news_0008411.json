(“Alphatec” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ATEC), a provider of innovative spine surgery solutions with a mission to improve patient lives through the relentless pursuit of superior outcomes, today announced preliminary estimates of revenue for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also provided several corporate updates.\nPreliminary, Unaudited Revenue\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Total revenue $25.9 million to $26.3 million $101.4 million to $101.8 million U.S. commercial revenue $20.8 million to $21.0 million $86.8 million to $87.0 million During the fourth quarter, preliminary U.S. commercial sales generated by dedicated agents and distributors expanded to more than 40%, in line with expectations, and up significantly from about 5% at the start of the year.\nThe Company ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $22.5 million. Operating cash burn improved for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n“The fourth quarter marked continued execution of our strategy to build top line predictability and sustainability by strengthening the ATEC distribution channel,” said Terry Rich, Chief Executive Officer of Alphatec. “Our team has substantial work ahead of us as we transform Alphatec, but I am confident that our unmatched organizational spine expertise and relentless dedication to better surgical outcomes will drive continued progress in this new year.”\nClosing of Equity Investments in Alphatec Common Shares\nIn December 2017, the Company generated cash proceeds of $4.0 million as the result of personal financial commitments made by Patrick Miles and Quentin Blackford pursuant to common stock purchase agreements granted in conjunction with their appointments on October 2, 2017. Per the agreements, Mr. Miles purchased 1.3 million shares of common stock and Mr. Blackford purchased 0.4 million shares of common stock, all at a purchase price of $2.26 per share (the consolidated closing bid price of Alphatec common shares on September 29, 2017).\nAdditional Spine-Experienced Talent Joins Leadership Team\nLance DeNardin Named Area Vice President, West\nDeNardin strengthens Alphatec’s distribution channel in the West, contributing his 30 years of expertise in the spine and medical device industry to the sales and distribution transformation that is well underway.
