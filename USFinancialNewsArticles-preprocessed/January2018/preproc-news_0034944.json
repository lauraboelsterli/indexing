    "text": "Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management has invested more than $1 billion in Britain’s Barclays Plc , the Financial Times reported on Sunday.\nThe hedge fund had bought most of its about 2.5 percent stake in the UK-based bank in November, FT reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. on.ft.com/2G2ihqK\nTiger Global Management is also extending a vote of confidence in Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley’s plans to strip back the bank to concentrate on its U.S.-led investment banking operations and its UK-based consumer banking business, the report said.\nBarclays did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. Tiger Global Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nStaley has championed investment banking amid calls from some analysts and investors to ditch a business which has in recent years struggled to match the profitability of Barclays’ more mundane retail and credit card units.\nInvestment banks globally have struggled in recent years to make returns in excess of their cost of capital, as tighter regulations, pressure on fees from automation and low global interest rates combined to squeeze profits.\nBarclays is cutting up to 100 senior jobs at its investment banks, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\nIn 2016, around 1,000 jobs were cut from Barclays’ investment banking business worldwide in an attempt to reduce costs and boost revenues. Barclays cut a total of 10,000 staff that year alone. (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft)\n ",
