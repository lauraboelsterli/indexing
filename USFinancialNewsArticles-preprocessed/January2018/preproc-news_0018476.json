    "text": "EditorsNote: adds UCF’s record in fourth graf\nForward Gary Clark recorded 17 points and 14 rebounds for his sixth double-double of the season to lead No. 12 Cincinnati to its eighth consecutive win, 49-38 over UCF Tuesday night in Orlando.\nThe Bearcats (16-2, 5-0 American Athletic Conference) were held to a season-low point total, but made up for that by also holding the Knights (12-6, 3-3) to a season low.\nGuard Jacob Evans III was the only other Bearcat in double figures with 10 points.\nThe Knights (12-5, 3-2) did not have a double-figure scorer, but three players -- center Tacko Fall, guard Terrell Allen and guard Dayon Griffin -- scored seven points each.\nThe Bearcats trailed the entire first half and didn’t get their first lead until early in the second half when forward Kyle Washington put them up 23-22 on a 3-pointer at the 17:13 mark. But it lasted less than a minute when Allen answered with a triple of his own.\nCincy took the lead for good when guard Cane Broome’s 3-pointer at the 12:47 mark broke a 30-30 tie. That basket also sparked an 8-0 run that put the Bearcats up 38-30 with just over eight minutes remaining.\nUCF cut that in half on Fall’s two short shots, but the Bearcats responded and Clark’s dunk with 3:56 remaining put them up 45-36, their biggest margin of the game to that point.\nThe first half featured many empty possessions for both teams.\nHalfway through the period the Bearcats had made only 2 of their 11 field-goal attempts but trailed only 14-5 because the Knights had hit only 5 of their 18 attempts.\nClark then scored five quick points on a layup and 3-pointer and guard Jarron Cumberland hit a triple to get the Bearcats to within 14-13, but Taylor closed out the half with a couple of baskets and Griffin added a free throw to make it a 19-15 game at the intermission.\nThe point totals were also season-lows for the first half for both teams.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
