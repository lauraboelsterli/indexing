    "text": "Supercrypto Mining\nFREMONT, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today it has entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of Flexisphere, http://www.flexisphere.com/ , an IT managed services provider that will work with Super Crypto Mining, DPW’s wholly owned subsidiary, to leverage its curated blockchain and cloud mining technology and expertise. Flexisphere’s client base ranges from small to medium businesses (“SMB”) and large firms that seek expertise for desktop, network, and other distributed services as well as programming, web/online asset development and cloud computing. Flexisphere is expected to be a majority-controlled subsidiary of DPW and will be available to provide a host of services including supporting Super Crypto Mining’s development of an online cloud mining platform for consumers interested in purchasing hash-rate for as low as $250.00. The cloud mining platform will feature a comprehensive dashboard readily providing historical and real-time operational data to its subscribers. In conjunction with these developments, the Company has prompted Super Crypto Mining to appoint Darren Magot as its CEO.\nFlexisphere is led by its President, CEO and Founder, Thomas Saleh, a leading entrepreneur in the computer industry for more than three decades. Mr. Saleh has founded seven successful high-technology companies, and influenced the success of several more. His first company, Applied Logic, an early provider of Managed Hosting Services, was acquired by Raytheon in 1980. He next founded XNET, which built the first fully automated financial futures and commodities exchange (INTEX) in Bermuda. XNET was acquired by the International Futures and Commodities Exchange in 1984. From there Mr. Saleh’s accomplishments have varied, but include his tenure from 2007 to 2009 at the FASB where, at the request of the president of the Financial Accounting Foundation and the Chairman of the SEC, Mr. Saleh served as the CTO and led the development of the USGAP XBRL “Intelligent Data” project. Mr. Saleh’s research on Policy Driven Security and Cloud Computing technologies led to the formation of FlexiSphere, a company specifically focused on delivering highly managed and ultra-secure turnkey computing to selected verticals including financial services, legal and transportation. Mr. Saleh has served as a strategic consultant and senior adviser to the NASDAQ, the NYSE, the FASB and Safeway Supermarkets among others. He has served as a director of 6 venture-backed companies and advises several private equity funds.\n“We are excited about the appointment of Darren Magot as the CEO of Super Crypto Mining. Mr. Magot brings decades of experience with identifying consumer tastes and trends to drive many successful marketing plans and programs that maximized client revenues against stern competition. We believe Mr. Magot has the critical expertise to navigate Super Crypto Mining’s future through the rapidly evolving crypto space. We expect him to lead Super Crypto Mining in accomplishing multiple goals including the deployment of over 10,000 crypto miners, the establishment of multiple data centers and mining co-locations that operate efficiently and effectively to launching our latest initiative, cloud based mining so consumers can readily participate by purchasing hash-rate at an affordable level,” said Milton “Todd” Ault III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault continued, “We are committed to supporting Super Crypto and all its projects as we execute on our highly profitable long-term strategies. We see the anticipated acquisition of Flexisphere as in integral part of our long-term strategy. We look forward to having Flexisphere and its very talented team of experts lead by Mr. Saleh join the DPW family. Mr. Saleh brings a wealth of experience, proficiency and knowledge that can benefit all DPW. We also look forward to Super Crypto Mining working with Flexisphere and Mr. Saleh in the short-term to develop an innovative cloud mining platform.”\nMr. Magot has over 30 years of experience in business development, financial management and sales management with both private and public companies leading teams and projects of various sizes. For the last 5 years, Mr. Magot has been focused on the innovation of new technology and products with some of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the world. The Company selected Mr. Magot since he possessed the best skill set to create a team that can support the aggressive growth opportunities within the Super Crypto family brands. Mr. Magot has a Finance Degree from California State University in Chico.
