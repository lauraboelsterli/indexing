    "text": "President Donald Trump will undergo a formal health check on Friday as he attempts to dispel any doubts about his fitness for office, according to The Telegraph .\nTrump will be examined by the same doctor as predecessor Barack Obama , the report said, and a summary of the results is expected to be made public. The routine physical was first announced by the White House late last year .\nThe customary examination will reportedly last around two hours and is set to include blood and urine tests, heart checks and questions about Trump's sleeping habits and sex life. Nonetheless, Trump has the power to hold back any details he wishes.\nThe formal medical check will be Trump's first since entering the White House and comes at a time of intense speculation about his mental and physical suitability for the presidency. Last week, an explosive book by journalist Michael Wolff alleged Trump would frequently fail to recognize old friends and often repeated stories \"word for word.\" The president described the book as \"fiction\" and claimed he was a \" very stable genius .\"\nRead The Telegraph's full article here .\nWATCH: Here's what Trump is going to talk about in his first major speech since tax reform passed show chapters Here's what Trump is going to talk about in his first major speech since tax reform passed 9 Hours Ago | 01:33",
