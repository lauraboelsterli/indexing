    "text": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd is still pursuing a “primarily permiting” strategy on its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the company said, and also reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday.\nKinder Morgan Canada reported a net income of C$46.4 million ($37.3 million) for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from C$17.8 million for the same period last year.\nLast month, Canada’s energy regulator ruled in favor of the company’s appeal to sidestep some municipal permits for the pipeline, marking a major victory for the C$7.4 billion project.\nKinder Morgan Canada was spun off from parent Kinder Morgan in May last year.
