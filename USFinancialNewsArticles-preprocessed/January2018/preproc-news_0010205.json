    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products that solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world, today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights and Summary\nTotal net sales for the first quarter were $97.6 million, an increase of 9 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Translation of the Company's foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on sales for the current quarter. On a constant currency basis total net sales for the first quarter would have been $96.2 million, an increase of 8 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net income for the first quarter was $12.6 million, an increase of 7 percent from the prior year fiscal quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90 compared to $0.82 in the prior year fiscal quarter. Gross margin percentage was 55.5 percent compared to 57.2 percent in the prior year fiscal quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 8 percent in the first quarter to $31.2 million when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Advertising and sales promotion expenses were up 6 percent to $5.1 million compared to the prior year fiscal quarter.\n\"The tribe has delivered solid first quarter results, reflecting excellent execution of our first and second strategic initiatives and the fact that for the first time in a long-time, foreign currency exchange rates are not diluting our reported net sales results,\" said Garry Ridge, WD-40 Company's president and chief executive officer.\n\"Our flagship product, WD-40 Multi-Use Product grew 10 percent in the first quarter, and our WD-40 Specialist product line grew 29 percent compared to the prior year quarter.\n\"Overall we are off to a good start in 2018 and we believe our focus on executing against our strategic initiatives will continue to drive revenue growth, further strengthen our financial foundation, and enhance shareholder value,\" Ridge concluded.\nNet Sales by Segment (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended November 30,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nAmericas\n$\n46,163\n$\n42,840\n8%\nEMEA\n35,028\n30,257\n16%\nAsia-Pacific\n16,406\n16,151\n2%\nTotal\n$\n97,597\n$\n89,248\n9%\nNet sales by segment as a percent of total net sales for the first quarter were as follows: for the Americas, 47 percent; for EMEA, 36 percent; and for Asia-Pacific, 17 percent. Net sales in the Americans were up 8 percent in the first quarter primarily due to strong maintenance product sales in the United States, Latin America and Canada which increased overall by 11 percent from period to period. This higher level of sales was primarily attributable to an 11 percent increase of WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales as well as a 16 percent increase of WD-40 Specialist sales throughout the Americas segment compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net sales in EMEA increased 16 percent in the first quarter primarily due to strong maintenance product sales in both the European direct and distributor markets which increased in total by 17 percent. This higher level of sales was primarily attributable to a 14 percent increase of WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales as well as a 77 percent increase of WD-40 Specialist sales throughout the EMEA segment compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales for the EMEA segment from period to period. On a constant currency basis EMEA sales for the first quarter would have increased by $3.7 million or 12 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 2 percent in the first quarter due to a 6 percent increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific distributor markets which were primarily attributable to a higher level of promotional activities. The sales growth in the Asia distributor markets was partially offset by a 9 percent sales decline in China due to the timing of customer orders in the region. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales for the Asia-Pacific segment from period to period. On a constant currency basis Asia-Pacific sales for the first quarter would have been constant compared to the prior year fiscal quarter.\nNet Sales by Product Group (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended November 30,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nMaintenance products\n$\n88,030\n$\n79,159\n11%\nHomecare and cleaning products\n9,567\n10,089\n(5)%\nTotal\n$\n97,597\n$\n89,248\n9%\nNet sales of maintenance products, which are considered the primary growth focus for the Company, increased 11 percent in the first quarter when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong sales of both WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist. Net sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 5 percent in the first quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., are considered harvest brands providing healthy profit returns to the Company but are becoming a smaller part of the business as net sales of maintenance products grow per the execution of the Company's strategic initiatives.\nDividend and Share Repurchase\nAs previously announced, WD-40 Company's board of directors declared on Tuesday, December 12, 2017 a quarterly dividend of $0.54 per share reflecting an increase of 10 percent over the previous quarter's dividend. The quarterly dividend is payable on January 31, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 19, 2018.\nOn June 21, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective on September 1, 2016, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2018. The timing and amount of repurchases are based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. During the period from September 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 328,823 shares at a total cost of $35.0 million under this $75.0 million plan.\nFiscal Year 2018 Updated Guidance\nThe Company has updated its net income and diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect its recent adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation:\nNet sales growth is projected to be between 4 and 6 percent with net sales expected to be between $396 million and $403 million. Gross margin percentage for the full year is expected to be near 56 percent. Advertising and promotion investments are projected to be near 6.0 percent of net sales. Net income is projected to be between $54.4 million and $55.3 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.91 and $3.98 based on an estimated 13.9 million weighted average shares o",
