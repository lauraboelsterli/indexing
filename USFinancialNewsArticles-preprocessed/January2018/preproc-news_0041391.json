    "text": "When thinking of six-figure salaries, flipping burgers may not come to mind. But In-N-Out, the cult favorite fast food chain, sees its store managers earning over $160,000 on average.\n\"In-N-Out is just eons above everybody else,\" Saru Jayaraman, director of UC Berkley's Food Research Center, told the California Sun . \"On wages and benefits, they really are the best large chain.\"\nThe Sun first reported In-N-Out's eye-popping figure, which the Irvine, Calif.-based chain confirmed to USA TODAY.\nRead more from USA Today:\nDid your company pay you a bonus with tax savings?
