    "text": "Jan 30 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp on Tuesday reported a 4.5 percent increase in quarterly sales at established U.S. restaurants, luring diners with $1 sodas, $2 coffees and $5 combo offers.\nThe figure was in line with analysts' expectations, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.\nNet income fell to $698.7 million or 87 cents per share, from $1.19 billion or $1.44 per share, a year earlier, mainly due to a $700 million charge related to the recent changes in U.S. tax law.
