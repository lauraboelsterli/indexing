    "text": "The year 2017 was a good year to be an investor. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just passed through the 24,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 , a broader measure of the market, finished higher in November, making it 13 months in a row of gains, also a record. Both indices are more than 20 percent higher than where they started the year.\nIt seems that every day, the headline on CNBC reads \"Markets Hit New Record High.\" In fact, we are in a bull market that is now eight-and-a-half years old, the second longest in history.\nAdvisors turn to life coaches and counselors",
