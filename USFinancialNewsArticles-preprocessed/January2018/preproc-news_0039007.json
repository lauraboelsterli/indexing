    "text": "* Juno Therapeutics jumps after Celgene’s $9 bln deal\n* AIG to buy reinsurer Validus for $5.6 bln\n* Senate to vote on extending U.S. funding at noon\n* Indexes: Dow flat, S&P up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq up 0.26 pct (Updates to open)\nBy Sruthi Shankar\nJan 22 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Nasdaq were marginally higher on Monday, while losses in industrial stocks such as General Electric and Boeing as well as Apple weighed on the Dow.\nA U.S. government shutdown entered its third day, and a bipartisan group of senators attempted to negotiate a deal just hours before the full Senate planned to vote to restore funding.\n“It’s ‘Been there, done that’. We know they are actually going to get their act together and reach a deal. But the economic impact depends on how long it lasts,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nAt 10:09 a.m. ET (1509 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.37 points, or -0 percent, at 26,071.35 and the S&P 500 was up 5.51 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,815.81.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 19.37 points, or 0.26 percent, at 7,355.75.\nShares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ soared 63 percent after French healthcare group Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion.\nIt was the top boost to the Nasdaq.\nJuno Therapeutics rose about 27 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash. Celgene was down 1.5 percent.\nInsurer AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings for $5.56 billion. Validus was up 45 percent.\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq managed to notch record highs shortly after open on Monday, as investors focused on upbeat quarterly earnings and a raft of deals.\nOf the 53 S&P 500 companies that reported through Friday, 79.2 percent have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHalliburton Co rose 2.7 percent on Monday after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production. Rival Schlumberger also rose 2.7 percent.\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.82 percent gain in the energy index and 0.6 percent rise in utilities index.\nGeneral Electric fell below $16 for the first time in six years, extending its losing streak from last week.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was close to its highest level in more than three years on Monday.\n“More concern is coming from the bond market where yields are testing a long-term resistance,” said Brown. “If the yields are going up, and if earnings stay the same, share prices would come down.”\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,258 to 1,256. On the Nasdaq, 1,247 issues rose and 1,181 fell.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
