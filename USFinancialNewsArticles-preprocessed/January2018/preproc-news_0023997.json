    "text": "Published: Jan 15, 2018 11:21 a.m. ET Share \nThe construction giant had scrapped dividend payments and issued profit warnings \nBy Jason Douglas Reuters A worker on Monday walks into Carillion's Midland Metropolitan Hospital construction site in Smethwick, Britain, after the company went into liquidation. \nOne of the U.K. government’s biggest contractors entered liquidation proceedings Monday after weekend rescue talks collapsed, a high-profile failure that comes amid a renewed political debate in Britain over the role of private-sector companies in the delivery of public services. \nCarillion PLC CLLN, -28.95% CIOIY, -18.87% said its board agreed to wind down the company after failing to reach an agreement with its lenders on the restructuring of its debts, a move that caps months of speculation about its future following poorer than expected results. \nThe company, which employs 43,000 people world-wide, provides a range of services in the U.K. on behalf of the government, ranging from building and managing hospitals to cleaning and providing food at schools. It also plays a key role in the construction of major infrastructure projects, including a new high-speed rail line linking London to Birmingham. \nSigns of trouble at the company had been brewing for some time. Carillion warned in July that it expected to miss profit targets for the first half of the year after losing money on several big construction contracts. Chief Executive Richard Howson stood down and the board scrapped dividend payments as part of a plan to rein in the company‘s borrowing, which ballooned as its cashflow dwindled. ",
