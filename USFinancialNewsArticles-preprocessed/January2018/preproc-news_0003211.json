Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United vs Southampton - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - December 30, 2017 Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku after sustaining an injury Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff \nThe 24-year-old missed United’s 2-0 league win at Everton on Monday after sustaining a head injury during last weekend’s goalless draw with Southampton, but the Portuguese boss said his top scorer had not suffered a concussion and would make a quick return. \n”Romelu is not a problem,“ Mourinho told reporters after the win at Goodison Park. ”Maybe Romelu can play (against Derby). It was a precaution by the doctor, it was following the rules to protect the situation. \n“He didn’t come today to follow the protocol but he wanted to play. We had to stop him to play because he was saying, ‘I feel amazing, I should go and play,’ but... we decided not to play (him). Probably Romelu is back against Derby.” \nLukaku has scored 10 goals and provided four assists in 21 league appearances for United this season as the Old Trafford outfit sit 12 points behind leaders Manchester City in second position, having played one more game. \nUnited have won the FA Cup on 12 occasions but were knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals by eventual runners-up Chelsea last season.
