    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SAIL), the leader in enterprise identity management, today announced the appointment of Michael J. Sullivan to the board of directors and as chairperson of the audit committee effective November 2017. In this role, Mr. Sullivan will oversee SailPoint’s financial reporting processes and provide oversight of SailPoint’s independent registered accounting firm. The board has determined that Mr. Sullivan is “independent” as that term is defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\n“Mike joins the SailPoint board during an exciting time in the company’s history. As we concentrate on the performance of the business, the guidance and leadership he provides will be instrumental to our continued success,” said Mark McClain, CEO and Co-founder of SailPoint. “With his significant experience in the identity industry combined with his financial and public company expertise, Mike is a key addition to our board of directors.”\nMr. Sullivan previously served as Chief Financial Officer at Ping Identity, an identity security company, and his tenure there culminated in the successful sale of Ping to Vista Equity Partners. Prior to that, he served on the boards and chaired the audit committees of two private equity-backed portfolio companies, Vertafore and SNL Financial. Previously, Mr. Sullivan spent 12 years as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of IHS Inc., which he helped take public, and also worked closely with the audit committee of its board of directors. Other leadership experience includes three years at Coors Brewing Company directing the corporate accounting function and leading corporate planning and analysis efforts. Mr. Sullivan began his career with Price Waterhouse, LLP in New York and Denver.\n“SailPoint’s track record of leadership in identity governance is unparalleled in the industry, and I look forward to providing strategic financial insight as a board member and chairperson of the audit committee,” said Mr. Sullivan. “It’s a pivotal time to be joining SailPoint as they build upon the momentum from their recent IPO, and I’m excited to make a positive impact along with the other board members and executive leadership.”\nSailPoint: The Power of Identity™\nSailPoint, the leader in enterprise identity management, brings the Power of Identity to customers around the world.
