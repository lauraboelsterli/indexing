    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- QuickLiquidity , an opportunistic real estate private equity firm investing in commercial real estate nationwide, has announced that for $460,000 it has purchased a 2.53% partial interest in a real estate partnership that owns a 199-unit apartment community in Fairfax, VA. The seller inherited the partial interest over 30 years ago and was seeking an immediate exit strategy from their illiquid and non-controlling interest.\n\"What we love about this property is its historical occupancy, steady income and the continued growth in the Fairfax area real estate market,\" said A. Yoni Miller, Principal of QuickLiquidity. \"We have a tremendous amount of experience with purchasing and lending against partial interest positions in commercial real estate partnerships which allows us to understand and close complicated transactions quickly.\"\nThe seller received a written offer from QuickLiquidity within only days of submitting information about the property and the partnership. Once the offer was signed by the seller it took around three weeks for the sale to be finalized. QuickLiquidity worked with the seller and the managing members of the partnership to ensure the transfer was in full compliance with the partnerships operating agreement.\nBy QuickLiquidity coming in as a new passive investor the seller was able to receive immediate liquidity without having to wait until the partnership decides to sell the property, which might not occur for many years.\nQuickLiquidity explains that some of the reasons an investor might want to sell their partial interest is either a personal cash-flow pinch, a diversion of interests between the investors, or to simplify the investors tax return and estate planning.\nWhen life presents unpredictable situations and liquidity is needed, partial interest owners can turn to QuickLiquidity for an immediate exit strategy. QuickLiquidity is a direct buyer and lender against partial interest positions in commercial real estate LLCs, LPs, TICS, and DSTs.\nAbout QuickLiquidity:\nQuickLiquidity is a direct lender and preferred equity investor providing equity recapitalizations, subordinated debt and partner buyouts on commercial real estate nationwide. QuickLiquidity allows real estate owners to monetize their existing equity while maintaining majority ownership and control of their property without disturbing their existing first mortgage or triggering any prepayment penalties.
