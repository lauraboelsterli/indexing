It will help participants successfully understand, devise and implement enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategies.\n\"CEOs and boards know cybersecurity is among the most important issues now facing every business, a legal, bottom-line and reputational risk that cannot just be relegated to the IT department,\" said Marshall Cooper, CEO, The Chief Executive Group. \"With GEN Hayden and the rest of our speakers, we've assembled a lineup of proven leaders who understand this world like few others, and can help CEOs and directors ask the right questions and navigate the threats around the corner.\"\nOther speakers include Dawn Cappelli, VP, Global Security & Chief Information Security Officer, Rockwell Automation; Anthony Dagostino, Head of Global Cyber Risk, Willis Towers Watson, James Routh, Chief Security Officer, Aetna and John Scimone, SVP & Chief Security Officer, Dell.\nAttendees will also participate in an interactive, industry-focused cyber security simulation to provide participants with a better understanding of the potential impacts of a cyber event across various elements of their business.\nAbout GEN Michael Hayden, Principal at the Chertoff Group\nGeneral Michael Hayden is a retired four-star general who served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency when the course of world events was changing at a rapid rate. As head of the country's premier intelligence agencies, he was on the frontline of global change, the war on terrorism and the growing cyber challenge. In addition to leading the CIA and NSA, General Hayden was the country's first principal deputy director of national intelligence and the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the country.\nHayden is a frequent expert and commentator on major news outlets and in top publications, valued for his expertise on intelligence matters like cyber security, government surveillance, geopolitics, and more.
