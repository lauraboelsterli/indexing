(Nasdaq:VNET) (\"21Vianet\" or the \"Company\"), a leading carrier-neutral Internet data center services provider in China, today announced that Mr. Terry Wang, its Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has decided to resign due to personal reasons, effective immediately. Mr. Wang will serve as an advisor to the Company and facilitate a smooth CFO transition. Mr. Wang has served as the Company’s CFO since June 2015. The Company also announced that Ms. Sharon Xiao Liu will succeed Mr. Wang as CFO of 21Vianet.\nMs. Liu will be undertaking the Company’s finance, legal, internal controls, merger and acquisitions, capital markets, and investor relations responsibilities. Ms. Liu currently serves as the Company’s vice president of finance, primarily responsible for finance-related matters in the Company’s hosting and related services business. Ms. Liu joined 21Vianet in October 2010, and was previously responsible for pre- and post-IPO finance matters, investor relations, financial reporting, FP&A, and financial BP.

Her broad financial experience as well as her rich experience as part of the senior management team make her an ideal candidate for the CFO position, and will also ensure a seamless transition. Having worked with her extensively since joining the Company, I am confident that Sharon is capable of handling her new role and responsibilities.” Mr. Zhang further stated, “This change did not arise from any issues involving the Company’s financial results, business practices, internal controls, or financial reporting.”\n“Furthermore, I would like to thank Terry for his contributions over the past few years. I appreciate his dedication to 21Vianet, as his leadership played a pivotal part in the Company’s reorganization and turnaround. We wish him nothing but the best in the future,” added Mr. Zhang.\nAbout 21Vianet\n21Vianet Group, Inc. is a leading carrier-neutral Internet data center services provider in China. 21Vianet provides hosting and related services, cloud services, and business VPN services, improving the reliability, security and speed of its customers' Internet infrastructure.
