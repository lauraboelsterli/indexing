They were last trading at 0.002 percent.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest in more than two-years at 0.625 percent, while two-year bond yields hit their highest since mid-2016 at minus 0.51 percent.\nAcross the euro area, 10-year bond yields were up 2-5 basis points on the day, with French and Dutch yields climbing to multi-month highs.\n“The Knot comments are a factor behind the sell-off in bonds today,” said DZ Bank rates strategist Andy Cossor. “There’s also the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries.”\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.724 percent , its highest level since early 2014, while two-year Treasury yields rose to 2.161 percent -- their highest since 2008.\nComments from the Bank of Japan governor on Friday that inflation is finally close to reaching its target added to a sense of a turnaround in policy among major central banks.\nThe ECB meanwhile surprised markets by striking a modestly dovish tone last week in the face of a robust euro, leaving German bond yields with a sixth straight week of weekly rises on Friday.\n“We are hitting psychological levels at the moment - 5-year German bond yields are above zero percent and 2-year bonds yields are at -50 bps,” said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at Credit Agricole. “It’s difficult to get in the way of the momentum at the moment.”\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
