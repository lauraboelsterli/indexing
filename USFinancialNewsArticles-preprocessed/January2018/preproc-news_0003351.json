He currently serves on the Liability and Energy committees of the American Institute of Marine Underwriters.\nSteve Vivian commented: “John’s depth of experience and expertise makes him uniquely qualified to build out our hull and liability portfolio in the US. He has an extensive network across the marine broking, insurance and client communities in the US and is highly regarded for his knowledge of the market. I am delighted that he is joining us at this important stage of our growth.”\nMr Moy’s appointment follows Beazley’s announcement on November 30 th 2017 that it was establishing a US Marine platform with the strategic aim of capturing opportunities that do not typically get placed outside of the US domestic market.\nBeazley has been a prominent insurer of marine risks in the Lloyd’s market in London since 1999.
