    "text": "AMMAN (Reuters) - The head of the Syrian opposition delegation to a Russia-sponsored conference on Tuesday said his group was boycotting the meeting because of broken promises to end the bombardment of civilians and remove Syrian state emblems from the premises.\nAhmed Tomah said in a video statement received by Reuters that his group had decided to go back to Turkey in protest. The Turkish delegation would represent the Syrian opposition delegationâ€™s demands, he said in the statement, which was recorded at Sochi airport.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
