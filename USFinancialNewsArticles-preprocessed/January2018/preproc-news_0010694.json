    "text": " 46 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago German would-be coalition partners agree skilled immigration law Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s would-be coalition partners reached agreement on a law to attract qualified labour to Germany, German media reported on Tuesday, citing a paper from a working group in the exploratory talks between the parties. \nImmigration is one of the most sensitive topics in the talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats. \nThe agreement on that topic, following compromises on tax and carbon emissions policy achieved on Monday, suggested the parties are inching closer to a decision to open formal coalition talks.
