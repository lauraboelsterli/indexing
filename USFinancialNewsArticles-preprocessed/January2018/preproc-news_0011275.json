    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: MRT) announced that it agreed to provide an acquisition and construction mortgage loan of $19.0 million to Haven Behavioral Healthcare to fund the purchase and conversion of an existing long-term acute care hospital to a 72-bed inpatient psychiatric hospital in Boise (Meridian), Idaho. The loan has a three-year term and an annual interest rate of 10.0%.\nThe financing includes $7.7 million that was drawn immediately for Haven to acquire the existing property and $11.3 million that will be drawn to fund the conversion of the facility to a psychiatric hospital. Upon completion of the planned renovation, MedEquities has the exclusive right to purchase the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding loan balance in a sale-leaseback transaction with a 15-year triple-net master lease at an initial lease rate of 9.3%.\nFounded in 2006, Haven Behavioral Healthcare operates six inpatient psychiatric hospitals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas and provides inpatient psychiatric stabilization and treatment to adults experiencing acute symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis or other severe behavioral problems.\nJohn McRoberts, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of MedEquities, noted, \"We have continued to extend our presence and diversify our investments in the behavioral health sector with proven operators.
