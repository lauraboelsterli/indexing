Profumo added that a string of orders was likely to come amid negotiations with Qatar and Saudi Arabia and “potential talks” with Germany and Poland.\n(*) TELECOM ITALIA The phone group presented to the communications regulator AGCOM a proposal to put all its last-mile phone network assets in a separate vehicle fully-controlled by TIM, Il Messaggero said.
