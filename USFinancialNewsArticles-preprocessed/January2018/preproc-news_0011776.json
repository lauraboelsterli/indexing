    "text": "By Jonathan Vanian 8:03 PM EST \nYouTube responded to a controversial video uploaded by video blogger Logan Paul of an apparent suicide victim last week, saying that it’s taking steps “to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.” \nThe response comes after the popular YouTube star apologized for and removed a video of himself and his friends taken in Japan’s notorious Aokigahara forest, which is known as a magnet for suicides. \nAlthough Paul initially said the video was intended to raise awareness about suicide, critics slammed him for seemingly making light of a serious situation. At the time, YouTube issued a short statement saying that it “prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner,” but it did not say whether it would take any action against Paul or if it would delete his account. \nIn Tuesday’s statement, YouTube elaborated by saying it is “looking at further consequences” against Paul, although it didn’t specify what those would be or why it has waited a week to react beyond the original short statement. It acknowledged that it failed to communicate quickly enough with users about the incident, saying: “Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently. You’re right to be.” An open letter to our community: \nMany of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently. You’re right to be. You deserve to know what's going on. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nYouTube also expressed shock at the video and added that “suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views.” Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week. \n— YouTube (@YouTube) January 9, 2018 \nSuicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views. As Anna Akana put it perfectly: \"That body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness.\" ",
