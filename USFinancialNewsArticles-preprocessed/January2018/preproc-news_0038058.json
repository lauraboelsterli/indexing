    "text": "8 Hours Ago | 00:53 \nNasdaq 100 futures rose on Tuesday after video-streaming giant Netflix reported better-than-expected subscriber growth for the fourth quarter. \nThe Nasdaq index was tipped to open 0.2 percent higher, while shares of Netflix spiked 10 percent higher in the premarket. Netflix also reported quarterly earnings and sales that beat expectations. \nDow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 futures traded marginally lower as earnings season continued, while the government resumed operations after a three-day shutdown . \nDow components Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Travelers Cos. all reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Tuesday. Verizon, another Dow component, posted a profit that missed expectations, while sales surpassed analyst estimates. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2018. \nTexas Instruments and United Continental are among the companies scheduled to report Tuesday after the bell. \nWall Street also looked to Washington as a three-day government shutdown concluded. During Monday's session, members of the Senate managed to secure a temporary arrangement to keep the U.S. government open until February 8 . The vote propelled the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to all-time highs . \nThe chamber passed a stopgap bill by a margin of 81-18. Members of the House later passed the bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump. ",
