The 36-year-old defending champion has now reached the fourth round at Melbourne for the 16th time. \nThe Swiss was joined in the next round by Novak Djokovic, who overcame a muscle strain in his lower back but still had enough in the tank to ease past Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-2 6-3 6-3. \nUp next for six-times Australian Open champion Djokovic is South Korean Chung Hyeon, who outlasted fourth seed and fellow young gun Alexander Zverev 5-7 7-6(3) 2-6 6-3 6-0. \nTomas Berdych overpowered Juan Martin del Potro 6-3 6-3 6-2 to reach the fourth round for the 10th time and set up a clash with Italy’s Fabio Fognini, who downed French journeyman Julien Benneteau 3-6 6-2 6-1 4-6 6-3.

Both ladies should be so proud-kept digging deeper when it looked like there was nothing left in the tank!” 0400 HALEP COMES THROUGH ROLLER-COASTER \nWorld number one Simon Halep completed her comeback from a set down with a 4-6 6-4 15-13 victory over American Lauren Davis in a pulsating third round encounter. \nThe Romanian saved three match points in the final set, which lasted over two hours, before serving out the match on her fourth attempt. \n“I‘m almost dead, but it was nice that we could show good tennis,” Halep said. 0350 GARCIA SURVIVES SASNOVICH SCARE \nWorld number eight Caroline Garcia rediscovered her touch in the decider to oust Brisbane finalist Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-3 5-7 6-2 in the third round and advances to a last 16 encounter against American Madison Keys. 0320 PLISKOVA POWERS PAST SAFAROVA \nSixth seed Karolina Pliskova recorded 31 winners, including 11 aces, to beat fellow Czech Lucie Safarova 7-6(6) 7-5 in the third round. 0124 KEYS OPENS DOOR TO ROUND FOUR \nAmerican 17th seed Madison Keys swots aside unseeded Romanian Ana Bogdan 6-",
