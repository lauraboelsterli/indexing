Core earnings rose an estimated 5 percent in 2017.\nUK midcap JD Sports Fashion jumped 6.7 percent after Britain’s largest sportswear retailer by market value forecast annual pretax profit ahead of market expectations.\nProvident financial however fell 12.6 percent after it said it expected to report a loss of about 120 million pounds ($166 million) at its consumer credit division - the upper end of its guidance.\nElsewhere among financials, Deutsche Bank lost 0.8 percent after it was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to rig a Canadian benchmark rate. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Monday.\nGermany’s Continental added 1.1 percent after sources told Reuters the auto parts maker had hired JP Morgan to advise on a possible break-up.\nGKN rose about 1 percent as it faces continued pressure from activist fund Elliott to engage with its would-be suitor Melrose.\nAmong sectors, miners and oil stocks both fell 1.4 and 1 percent respectively, leading sectoral losers in Europe as metal prices eased on profit-taking and crude prices pulled back from 3-year highs.\nAmong regional indexes, Milan’s FTMIB fell 0.2 percent following a nine-day winning streak.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles was at the bottom of the index, down 4.2 percent after the company’s chief executive said he had no intention of breaking up the company.
