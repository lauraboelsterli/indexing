    "text": " 07 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago German industrial strikes damage firms - employers' association Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Twenty-four hour strikes by Germany’s powerful IG Metall union will be highly damaging for companies, employers’ association Gesamtmetall said on Monday, adding that it was seeking a compromise sustainable for both parties. \n“There is major damage given that all companies in the delivery chain are affected,” said Oliver Zander of Gesamtmetall. “Twenty-four hour strikes are irresponsible and threaten jobs.” \nHe said employers had at the weekend offered a 6.8 percent wage increase over 27 months. \n“We want a compromise that is sustainable for both sides,” added Zander.
