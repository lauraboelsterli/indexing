    "text": "The White House declined Wednesday to echo Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 's comment that a weaker dollar helps the United States. \nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the dollar is \"stable\" and reflects a \"strong\" American economy. When pressed if President Donald Trump supports a stronger or weaker dollar, she did not specify. \n\"We believe in free-floating currency. The president has always believed in that,\" Sanders said. \nBrendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump Earlier, Mnuchin said \"a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.\" U.S. Treasury secretaries typically talk up a strong dollar. \nThe greenback fell against a trade-weighted basket of global currencies after Mnuchin's comment. The dollar index was down about 1 percent Wednesday afternoon.",
