    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sharethrough, the industry's largest native ad exchange for the open web, announced today the addition of Dina Roman as its new Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), a veteran media executive with two decades of experience growing businesses at the nexus of content, advertising and technology with companies like IDG, Adap.tv and Brightcove.\nRoman has held executive level positions at several global media companies, with a track record that speaks for itself; having laid the foundation for Brightcove's successful IPO, and helping to guide Adap.tv and IDG through two acquisitions. This, coupled with leadership roles at Scripps, The New York Times, Discovery and Disney and a strong focus on digital video throughout her career, lends to a unique, 360-degree view of the current media ecosystem. At Sharethrough she will be leading the company's global advertiser sales team, which spreads across three continents.\nRoman's hiring comes amid strong growth for Sharethrough, with $250 million in native ad spend through its platform in 2017, up 80 percent on 2016 and spurred by DSP integrations with over two dozen of the largest DSPs in the industry, surging adoption of its header bidder and 4x growth in advertising impressions sold directly by its 1200-plus publisher clients.\n\"Dina is a pro, in every sense of the word, and we're thrilled to have someone of her caliber join Sharethrough to help shape the next chapter of growth for programmatic native advertising,\" said Dan Greenberg, founder and CEO, Sharethrough. \"Dina was everything we were looking for in our new CRO: a proven business builder, a programmatic ad tech pioneer, with diverse executive experience and firsthand empathy for both advertiser and publisher.\"\n\"I've always been drawn to companies that are the leaders in their lane and have helped the industry shape the future. Sharethrough represents an exciting new opportunity for me,\" said Roman for two reasons: \"its distinguished track record to date, and the even greater opportunity that lies ahead in an always on, mobile world. In this world, the dynamic assembly and respectful delivery of advertising that native represents will undoubtedly play a larger role in the media mix; benefiting consumers, advertisers and publishers alike.\"\nAbout Sharethrough\nFounded in 2008, Sharethrough is the leading global native advertising platform, helping publishers maximize revenue and brands earn meaningful attention by powering ads that fit into - rather than interrupt - the audience experience.
