    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Finn Partners, one of the world's fastest growing marketing and communications firms, today announced that Scott Widmeyer, a Finn Partners founding managing partner, is stepping into a new role as Chief Strategy Officer/Washington, DC, focused on the growth of the firm in this market.\nAccording to Peter Finn, managing partner, \"Washington, DC continues to be a dynamic growth area for PR and marketing and it's been a high priority for Finn to continue expanding our DC operations, the second largest after our New York headquarters. We believe in the vibrancy and future of the Washington, DC area and our vision is to build upon our existing practice areas as well as add capabilities in new sectors.\"\nWidmeyer had been the CEO of DC-based Widmeyer Communications before he sold his firm to Finn Partners in 2013, and became a member of the Founding Managing Partners group at Finn.\n\"Scott's insights around strategic communications and public policy and the direct impact on citizens, consumers and the constituent community are of great value to our client base,\" said Finn.\nFinn Partners has approximately 65 staff in its Washington D.C. office, and is starting 2018 with approximately $15 million in annual fees generated by the DC operation. The firm's DC office includes groups specializing in public affairs, education/higher education, professional services, government agencies, digital marketing/creative services, and qualitative/quantitative research.\n\"I cut my teeth in Washington so I'm thrilled at the opportunity to work with many great colleagues and build out our footprint in the nation's capital. The role that Washington and government plays in our lives is constantly under evaluation and whether it's a for-profit entity or a non-profit organization, Finn experts who provide sound communications guidance will be in big demand,\" said Widmeyer.\nWidmeyer's ties to Washington are many including The George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs where he chairs its National Council. He is also on the executive committee of the DC-based Education Writers Association, and formerly chaired the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.
