    "text": "SHARES David A. Grogan | CNBC Ginni Rometty, Chairwoman, President and CEO of IBM, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nIBM saw its stock go down more than 1 percent after it reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.The company will hold a conference call with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time. EPS : Excluding certain items, $5.18 in earnings per share vs. $5.17 in earnings per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $22.5 billion vs. $22.06 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. \nIBM went 22 consecutive quarters with revenue declining on a year over year basis. Now that streak has finally ended. -- a positive sign as the company faces competition from faster-growing companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. \nFor the full year of 2017, IBM came up with $13.80 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, according to Thursday's statement . That's a penny short of what analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters. \nIn terms of guidance, for the first quarter of 2018, analysts are expecting revenue growth once more, with a total of $18.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts expect $2.28 in earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. \nAnalysts believe some revenue growth in Q4 will come from sales of IBM's z14 mainframe computer, which happened throughout the entirety of the fourth quarter. \nAnd IBM watchers continue to focus on the company's strategic initiatives -- analytics, cloud, mobile and security -- to deliver revenue growth. On Wednesday IBM stock rose 2 percent in premarket trading after Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz raised his price target, pointing to growth opportunities in public cloud and other areas. \nMultiple analysts are curious about whether IBM could provide information about changes to its services business. \"From our perspective, any signal of a more aggressive restructuring effort (at IBM's legacy software and services practices) could make us incrementally more constructive on the stock,\" Wedbush analysts Moshe Katri and Ariel Hughes wrote in a Thursday note. \nIn a Tuesday note, Bernstein analysts Toni Sacconaghi and Daniel Chen mentioned that IBM's normalized tax rate could rise in the wake of U.S. tax reform and that the company might even have to make a one-time tax-related accounting charge. \nIn the fourth quarter IBM acquired consulting agency Vivant Digital, settled a patent lawsuit with Priceline.com and said Daimler AG, JPMorgan Chase and Samsung are collaborating with the company on quantum computing technology. \nIBM stock is up 1 percent since this time last year. \nThis is breaking news.
