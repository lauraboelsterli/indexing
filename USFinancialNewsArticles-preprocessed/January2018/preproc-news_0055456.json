    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine tested a locally made cruise missile capable of hitting land and sea targets from land on Tuesday, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov said.\nTurchynov did not reveal the range of the missile, the first wholly made in Ukraine to be tested, but said it was in line with its international agreements.\nUkraine is battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in a conflict that erupted after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Kiev has committed to spending 5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product on security and defense.\n“Successful flight tests of new missile weaponry, namely of a land-launched cruise missile, were held. Flight performance and performance of all systems of this new Ukrainian weaponry were checked during the tests,” Turchynov said.\nReporting by Pavel Polityuk and Margaryta Chornokondratenko; Eriting by Matthias Williams; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
