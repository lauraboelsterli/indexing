Soccer Football - FA Cup Third Round - AFC Bournemouth vs Wigan Athletic - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - January 6, 2018 Bournemouth's Steve Cook scores their second goal REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nCup winners in 2013, the year they were relegated from the top flight, Wigan led 2-0 at halftime. \nNorthern Ireland striker Will Grigg put them ahead in only the fourth minute and just before the half-hour mark a free kick by former Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell was deflected in by Bournemouth’s American Emerson Hyndman. \nThe home side, who have only just moved out of the Premier League relegation places, had risked making eight changes. \nThey made two more with substitutions for the second half and got a goal back through Frenchman Lys Mousset. \nRyan Fraser’s free kick then came back off a post, but defender Steve Cook earned a replay in the 92nd minute.
