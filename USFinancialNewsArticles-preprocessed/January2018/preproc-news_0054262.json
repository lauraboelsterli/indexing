    "text": "CARSON CITY, NV, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turbo Global Partners (TRBO) (OTC PINK: TRBO), has announced the name change of the previously reported acquisition of Alpha Life Foundation, Inc. (ALPHA) a California 501 (c) (3) domestic nonprofit, to Org America, Inc.\n“This is yet again an exciting milestone for TRBO,” states Robert W. Singerman, TRBO’s Chairman & CEO. He continues, “The name change of our previously reported acquisition of ALPHA to Org America fits our strategy of tactical acquisitions that can maximize the synergies of TRBO. We are confident the new name of Org America will resonate to the growing non-profit sector. Our core objectives of Org America are to help non-profits better communicate their stories, better engage their target audiences and generate new found revenues with our mobile pledge campaigns and digital marketing strategies. We believe every non-profit, large or small can benefit from our full-spectrum Web-television Telethon expertise.”\nHenry Marx, Org America’s CEO, agrees, “We are excited to change the name to Org America effective February 1, 2018. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRBO, we will be able to access the synergies within the TRBO offerings to catapult our reach to the next level and better showcase our work, which since 2000, has spanned charitable giving initiatives for pets to cancer awareness, autism to community advocacy.”\nSingerman explains, “We previously stated we already are innovators in the non-profit arena with our portal www.OrgAmerica.org where currently we present two (2) Web-television Telethons spotlighting global non-profits produced by Turbo Communications, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary. Changing the name of ALPHA to Org America is an evolution of our revolution. And the non-profit sector is huge and growing. According to the GuideStar USA ( www.GuideStar.org ), their database has information on more than 2.2 million nonprofits in the United States; more than 1.8 million are active organizations, a tremendous market for TRBO and Org America to pursue that will generate long-term predictable renewable cash-flow for our client non-profits and TRBO.”\nStatements made in this press release that express the Company or management's intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations or predictions of future events, are .
