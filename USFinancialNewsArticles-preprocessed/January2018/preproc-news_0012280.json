The deal closed in the fourth quarter.\n“We were pleased to provide the target corporation and its legal team with research on the acquisition to assist them in preparing for review by various government agencies of this cross-border transaction,” said Peter Barakett, president of Due Diligence Consulting LLC. “Our goal is to provide deep-dive, detailed research to assist our clients and help them navigate legal and business risks.
