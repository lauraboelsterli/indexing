( bit.ly/2BCKWix ) \nA deal could be finalized as early as March and may involve primary and secondary sales by longstanding Flipkart investors, the paper added. \n“We don’t comment on rumors and speculation,” Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told Reuters via email. \nBengaluru-based Flipkart was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. \nThe news comes nearly two years after Reuters reported that Walmart was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart.
