    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 8:41 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago One person killed in attack Turkish convoy in Idlib - Turkish army Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nANKARA (Reuters) - One person was killed and two more were wounded in a roadside bomb attack on a Turkish military convoy in Syria’s Idlib on Tuesday, the Turkish army said. \nThe attack, carried out by Kurdish militants as the convoy was in transit in northern Idlib, left one civilian worker dead and wounded a soldier and another civilian, the army said in a statement. \nThe convoy was dispatched to Idlib as part of Turkey’s effort to help create a “de-escalation” zone there, under a deal brokered by Russia in August. \nForeign powers agreed to establish four such zones, including Idlib, in opposition territory in Syria after years of civil war. But the former al Qaeda branch that controls the province has pledged to keep fighting Syrian government forces and their allies. \nTurkey last week launched an air and ground offensive elsewhere in northwest Syria, targeting the Kurdish YPG militia in the Afrin region. That has opened a new front in the seven-year-old, multi-sided civil war and strained ties with NATO ally Washington. \nTurkey considers the YPG a terrorist organisation and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly, three-decade insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast. \nThe United States has armed a YPG-spearheaded militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.
