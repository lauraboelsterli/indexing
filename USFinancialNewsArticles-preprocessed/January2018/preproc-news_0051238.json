    "text": "(Reuters) - Aetna Inc ( AET.N ), which has agreed to be bought by CVS Health Inc ( CVS.N ), reported a 75.5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, due to lower restructuring and transaction and integration-related costs.\nU.S. drugstore operator CVS agreed in December to acquire Aetna for $69 billion seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies.\nNet income attributable to Aetna rose to $244 million, or 74 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $139 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.\nReporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto\n ",
