    "text": "MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Berengaria Development , a portfolio company of Marcus Investments, today announced it has acquired Grafton Commons, a key Power Center in Northern Milwaukee, WI. for an undisclosed price. The 239,177 square-foot regional center is just 19 miles North of Downtown Milwaukee and strategically located adjacent to the I-43/Hwy 60 interchange.\nThe property is made up of four tax parcels, which includes two main buildings and two out-lot buildings. Current tenants include Kohl’s, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Best Buy, PetSmart, Michaels, Aldi, AAA Insurance, Steinhafel’s Mattress, Qdoba and Verizon.\nJay Peirick, President of Berengaria Development, said, “We were attracted to Grafton Commons because of its superior location on the north side of Milwaukee. The I-43/Hwy 60 interchange serves as a premier shopping destination in Milwaukee. We value the thoughtfulness of the Grafton residents and officials that put this development together nearly 10 years ago. It is wonderful to invest in their vision.\"\n“At Berengaria we are continuing to move forward with our strategy to acquire regional retail shopping centers and senior living facilities throughout the Midwest.
