    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroMetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq:NURO), today reported financial and business highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company develops and markets novel therapies, based on neurostimulation and digital medicine, for chronic health conditions. The Company’s primary product is Quell ® , which is an over-the-counter wearable neurostimulation device for treating chronic pain. The Company also has a diagnostic business based on its DPNCheck ® product, which is a point-of-care test that provides accurate and cost-effective screening, diagnosis and monitoring of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).\nHighlights:\nQ4 2017 revenue of $4.9 million grew 33% from $3.7 million in Q4 2016. Quell contributed $3.7 million and DPNCheck added $0.8 million revenue. Full year 2017 revenue of $17.1 million grew 42% from $12.0 million in 2016. Quell contributed $12.4 million and DPNCheck contributed $3.1 million revenue. Fourth quarter Quell shipments totaled 26,496 devices and 36,556 electrode reorder packages. This compared with 14,301 devices and 19,993 electrode reorder packages in Q4 2016. Quell intellectual property assets were expanded in the fourth quarter with the issuance of a U.S. utility patent for novel technology that enhances Quell usability for those with an active lifestyle. In early Q1 2018 the Company reported a strategic collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) under which GSK Consumer Healthcare acquired Quell market rights outside the US while NeuroMetrix retained ownership for the US market. The companies will co-fund Quell technology development. GSK Consumer Healthcare paid $5 million for the Quell assets related to markets outside the US and will pay up to $21.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones.\n\"Our revenue growth in Q4 and full year 2017 reflects strong Quell unit volume growth throughout the periods. It continues the upward trend of the past two and a half years since Quell launch in Q2 2015,\" said Shai N. Gozani, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of NeuroMetrix. \"We are pleased to begin our partnership with GSK Consumer Healthcare. This will expand access to Quell technology among chronic pain sufferers around the world while we continue to focus on building Quell into a leading U.S. consumer healthcare brand. It will also strengthen our capital structure.”\nFinancial Highlights:\nThe Company reported its financial highlights results for Q4 2017. Total revenues were $4.9 million versus $3.7 million for Q4 2016, an increase of 33%. Gross margin was 42.0% of total revenues versus 45.5% in Q4 2016, reflecting an increased weighting of Quell in revenues. Operating expenses were $5.0 million compared to $4.6 million in Q4 2016.
