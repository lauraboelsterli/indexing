    "text": "Trump administration to appeal DACA immigrant ruling to Supreme Court Published 22 Mins Ago SHARES Getty Images People protest in front of the U.S. Capitol to urge Congress to save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, on Dec. 6, 2017, in Washington, D.C. \nThe Department of Justice on Tuesday said it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling last week that blocked President Donald Trump's move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \nThe Trump administration will file an appeal directly with the Supreme Court as well as seeking to appeal to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the statement said.
