    "text": "(Reuters) - German business software group SAP SE on Monday said its unit SAP America Inc will buy cloud-based human resources software company Callidus Software Inc for a total enterprise value of $2.4 billion.\nThe deal represents a per share purchase price of $36, which is a premium of about 10 percent to Callidus’s Monday close of $32.70.\nThe deal is expected to be essentially neutral to SAP’s non-IFRS earnings per share for fiscal 2018, SAP said.\nThe transaction will add to SAP’s non-IFRS earnings per share for fiscal 2019, the German company added.\nSAP said it planned to fund the deal with existing cash balances and an acquisition term loan.\nCallidus Software, which does business as CallidusCloud, said its board has unanimously approved the transaction.\nReporting by Shubham Kalia and Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
