    "text": "  API says US crude inventories fall; EIA supply report due (Updates prices, previous SINGAPORE, adds analyst quotes)\n  raising concern about risks to supplies, cold weather in the United States boosting demand and OPEC-led output cuts.\nSix days of anti-government protests in Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices. The unrest has not, however, affected production or exports in Iran.\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, was up 6 cents at $67.90 a barrel at 1005 GMT and traded as high as $68.27. U.S. crude rose 23 cents to $61.86 and also touched the highest since May 2015.\n\"There is enough support for prices with the cold in the U.S. and the geopolitical factor,\" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix.\nFreezing weather in the United States has spurred short-term demand, especially for heating oil.\nApart from the spike in May 2015, oil is trading at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a historic decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to prop up prices deepened a price collapse.\nAnalysts at JBC Energy in Vienna said the price reaction to the Iranian unrest was overdone, although there were other potential threats to Iranian supply looming.\n\"Beyond the recent focus on street protests, the potential reinstatement of U.S. sanctions targeting the Iranian oil industry remains an issue,\" JBC said.\n  get rid of a supply glut that had built up in the previous two years and boost prices.\nThe supply cut pact started   decided to extend the deal for the whole of 2018.\nOPEC's cuts are helping to reduce inventories around the world and in   ahead of the government's supply report due later on Thursday.\n \nThe U.S. government forecasts that 2018 average oil production will hit a record high.
