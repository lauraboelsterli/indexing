    "text": "BUDAPEST, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) plans to make its new interest rate swap (IRS) facility for commercial banks fixed- rate instead of variable-rate, three banking sources told Reuters on Wednesday.\nAccess to the IRS will be proportional to the size of the assets of bidders according to a new rule, two of the sources said. The NBH informed commercial banks about the changes at a meeting earlier on Wednesday, the sources said.\nThe first of the NBHâ€™s bi-weekly 5-year and 10-year IRS auctions, held last Thursday, led to a sharp rebound in IRS and government bond yields in the market because the offered amounts and yield spreads disappointed some investors.\nThe central bank was not immediately reachable for comment.
