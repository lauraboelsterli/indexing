    "text": "Russell Westbrook barely missed a triple-double with 37 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds, and the Oklahoma City Thunder held on for a 122-112 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday evening at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\nPaul George finished with 31 points as the Thunder won their eighth consecutive game, which is the longest active streak in the NBA. Steven Adams notched a double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds.\nJoel Embiid led Philadelphia with 27 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort. Ben Simmons tallied 22 points on 10-for-14 shooting. Dario Saric added 16 points in 21 minutes.\nThe Thunder beat the 76ers for the 18th time in a row, including the 10th straight time on its home court. Philadelphia’s last win against Oklahoma City took place Nov. 15, 2008, during Westbrook’s rookie season.\nOklahoma City outscored Philadelphia 35-25 in the third quarter to grab a nine-point lead entering the final frame. The 76ers evened the score at 101 on a slam dunk by Simmons with 6:18 remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Thunder closed the game on a 21-11 run to seal the victory.\nPhiladelphia led 58-57 at halftime. Robert Covington made a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left in the first half to give the 76ers a four-point lead. George responded with a 3-pointer at the buzzer to slice the deficit to one.\nGeorge finished the first half with 17 points, including 13 points in the first quarter. He has scored in double figures in the first quarter four times in his past five games to help the Thunder jump to early leads.\nOklahoma City played its first game without fifth-year guard Andre Roberson, who ruptured his left patellar tendon one day earlier against the Detroit Pistons. The Thunder announced that Roberson underwent successful surgery Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. He averaged 5.0 points and 4.7 rebounds per game in 39 starts.\nPhiladelphia guard Jerryd Bayless missed his fifth game in a row because of a sore left wrist. He is hopeful to return to action Monday night against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
