(NYSE American:XTNT), a leader in the development of regenerative medicine products and medical devices, announced that it has entered into a Restructuring and Exchange Agreement (the \"Restructuring Agreement\") with ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (\"ROS\"), OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP (\"OrbiMed\"), and all of the other holders of all of Xtant's outstanding 6.00% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\") on January 11, 2017. The primary purposes of Xtant's entry into the Restructuring Agreement are to reform its capital structure, meet its liquidity needs, reposition itself for long-term growth, and regain compliance with NYSE American LLC (formerly the NYSE MKT) listing standards. Xtant plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders to vote on matters required to be approved by stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement (the “Transactions”).\n\"We are pleased to have signed an agreement to restructure and recapitalize our debt with the noteholders. This will reposition the company for long-term growth and allow the company to regain compliance with the NYSE American.\" said Carl O’Connell, Chief Executive Officer of Xtant Medical, \"Furthermore, the private placement will provide the liquidity to meet our operating needs going forward.\"\nBelow is a summary of the Transactions:\nTier 1 Transaction\nOn January 17, 2018, and as contemplated by the Restructuring Agreement, ROS and OrbiMed converted the Notes issued to them in January 2017 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.627 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at the $0.7589 per share conversion rate originally provided thereunder, into approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock of the Company.\nReverse Stock Split and Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation\nUpon approval of the stockholders of Xtant, the Company will amend its certificate of incorporation to, among other things, effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of 1:12. As a result of the reverse split, each 12 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders.\nTier 2 Transaction\nUpon approval of the stockholders of Xtant, following the completion of the Tier 1 Transaction and after giving effect to the reverse split described above, the remaining $70.238 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, will be exchanged for newly-issued shares of Common Stock at an exchange price of $7.20 per share (or $0.60 per share on a pre-reverse stock split basis), for approximately 10.4 million shares of common stock (or approximately 124.6 million shares on a pre-reverse stock split basis).\nPrivate Placement\nUpon the approval of the stockholders of Xtant, following the consummation of the reverse stock split described above and simultaneously with the Tier 2 Transaction, ROS and OrbiMed have agreed to purchase approximately $6.809M of common stock at $7.20 per share (or $0.60 on a pre-reverse stock split basis).\nAssuming that the Tier 2 Transaction and the private placement are consummated on February 15, 2018, following the consummation of the Transactions, ROS and OrbiMed will collectively own approximately 70.4% of the outstanding common stock, and current non-ROS/OrbiMed holders of common stock, who currently own approximately 95.7% of the outstanding common stock, would own approximately 11.3% of the outstanding common stock.\nFor further details regarding the Restructuring Agreement and the Transactions, please reference the preliminary proxy statement and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Xtant with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, 2018.\nAbout Xtant™ Medical Holdings, Inc.\nXtant Medical Holdings, Inc.
