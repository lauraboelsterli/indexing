    "text": "RICHMOND, Calif., Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EKSO), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today announced preliminary top line financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was an estimated $2.5 million, including approximately $2.0 million in medical revenue. The company shipped 21 Ekso GT systems in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, 15 of which were new sales and six of which were new rentals. In addition, four previously rented units were converted to a sale. Ekso also recognized revenue of approximately $330,000 on shipments of 56 units of its industrial products in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $150,000 license payment from Ottobock.\nA total of 61 Ekso GT units were shipped in 2017, a nearly 50% increase over the 41 units shipped in 2016. This brings the total number of Ekso GT systems in the field at year end to 277, including 17 rental units. At the end of the third quarter 2017, Ekso had 256 GT systems, including 15 rental units, in the field.\nTotal revenue for fiscal year 2017 was approximately $7.4 million, compared to $7.7 million in 2016, excluding a one-time recognition of $6.5 million in 2016 of deferred revenue on previously shipped units.\n“Preliminary results for the fourth quarter reflect the growing visibility of and interest in our medical products pipeline in both the United States and EMEA. The growing awareness of our industrial products is also a positive sign,” said Thomas Looby, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ekso Bionics. “As we move into 2018, we remain focused on building a solid foundation for commercial success. This includes expanding our customer base with leading rehabilitation centers in China and Asia-Pacific. Our rental program continues to be an effective source of sales, and we are working to expand the program and convert current rentals to sales in the months ahead.”\nThe Company finished the year with $27.9 million of cash on its balance sheet.
