Sophomore guard Jordan Bohannon led Iowa with 11 assists, the fifth game of his career with at least 10 assists, and he scored 13 points.\nIowa took charge early with an 11-2 run. The Hawkeyes would later use a 10-1 run early in the second half to pull away for good.\nWisconsin, which is the 21st-youngest of 351 NCAA teams, went scoreless for the game’s first 4:03 and trailed 21-9 with 10:55 left in the first half.\nHapp kept the Badgers competitive, However, as his layup at the end of a 12-4 run got Wisconsin back within 31-27 with two minutes left in the first half.\nTyler Cook scored 17 points in the victory for the Hawkeyes.\nWisconsin’s Khalil Iverson scored 17 points. The Badgers had been undefeated in conference play this season with Iverson scoring in double figures.
