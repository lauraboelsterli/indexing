    "text": "Thinking of doing an MBA in Asia but worried you don't have the money to pay for it? You're not alone, but if you're a woman you may be in luck.\nIn a bid to address gender imbalances, a number of Asian business schools have created women-only scholarships to promote change from the ground up. CNBC Make It has compiled a list of the region's top MBA scholarships specifically for women.\n* Based on full-time study. Findings correct as of Jan. 2018\nMBA courses have long-struggled to reach gender parity in their applications. In 2016, women accounted for only 37 percent of all applicants globally, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council.\nWithin Asia, the imbalance is particularly striking, with women making up just 34 percent of MBA students at the region's top 10 business schools. This compares to 42 percent in the U.S. and 36 percent in Europe .\nFinancial restraints are thought to be a key factor in deterring women applicants. Though MBAs are famously expensive for both men and women, some argue that the gender pay gap makes it especially difficult for women to accrue the necessary savings in the years between college and an MBA.",
