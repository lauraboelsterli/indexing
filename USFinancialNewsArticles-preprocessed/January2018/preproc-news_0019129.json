    "text": "January 12, 2018 / 5:29 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago New report on Air France Rio-Paris crash report blames pilots Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Pilots of an Air France jet which plunged into the Atlantic in 2009, killing all 228 people onboard, lost control of the plane after failing to apply appropriate procedures, a new crash investigation report showed on Friday. \nThe inquiry into the flight AF447 crash confirmed previous findings that the captain was away from the cabin when the incident occurred and had left without giving clear operational instructions, the report, seen by Reuters, showed. \nRepresentatives of an association of families of victims said the report minimised Air France and Airbusâ€™ responsibilities in the crash. \nParties have two months to comment on the report, which is part of a judicial investigation into the crash.
