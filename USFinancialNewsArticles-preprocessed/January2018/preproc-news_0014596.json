    "text": "PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Athene Holding Ltd. (“Athene”) (NYSE: ATH) today announced the pricing of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). Athene’s inaugural bond offering is expected to close on January 12, 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nAthene intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. As was noted at the time Athene announced its reinsurance transaction with Voya Financial (NYSE: VOYA), Athene proactively accessed the capital markets to replenish excess capital given the current low rate environment. Barclays and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as active joint book-running managers for the offering.\nThe Notes are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that has previously been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Any offer, or solicitation to buy, if at all, will be made solely by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement filed with the SEC. You may obtain these documents without charge from the SEC at www.sec.gov .
