    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American River Bankshares (NASDAQ-GS:AMRB) today announced that the Board of Directors has approved and authorized a new Stock Repurchase Program for 2018 (the “2018 Program”). The 2018 Program authorizes the repurchase during 2018 of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, or approximately 306,618 shares based on the 6,132,362 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company previously authorized two stock repurchase programs in 2017 and repurchased approximately 9% of the outstanding shares of common stock, which followed stock repurchase programs in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n“After a thorough review of our capital position, the American River Bankshares Board of Directors again authorized the Repurchase Program,” said David E. Ritchie, Jr., President and CEO of American River Bankshares. “We believe this is a sound use of our capital on the path of continued growth for the Company.”\nRepurchases under the 2018 Program will commence sometime after the release of the Company’s results of operations for the period ended December 31, 2017. The fourth quarter financial results conference call will be held Thursday, January 25, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. David E. Ritchie, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mitchell A. Derenzo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, both of American River Bankshares, will lead a live presentation and answer analysts’ questions. Shareholders, analysts and other interested parties are invited to join the call by dialing (888) 517-2513 and entering the Conference ID 5899 805#.\nThe repurchases will be made from time to time by the Company in the open market as conditions allow. All such transactions will be structured to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18 and all shares repurchased under the 2018 Program will be retired. The number, price and timing of the repurchases will be at the Company’s sole discretion and the 2018 Program may be re-evaluated depending on market conditions, capital and liquidity needs or other factors. Based on such re-evaluation, the Board of Directors may suspend, terminate, modify or cancel the 2018 Program at any time and for any reason.\nAbout American River Bankshares\nAmerican River Bankshares (NASDAQ-GS:AMRB) is the parent company of American River Bank, a regional bank serving Northern California since 1983.
