    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it plans to triple its oil and natural production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico by 2025 and spend $2 billion there to expand a crude storage terminal.\nThe worldâ€™s largest publicly-traded oil producer said it expects to pump more than 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from the Permian within seven years by boosting output from both traditional and shale wells. Exxon said its shale acreage alone should see a five-fold output increase over that time frame.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder\n ",
