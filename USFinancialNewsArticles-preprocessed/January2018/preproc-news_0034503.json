    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 2:02 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Golf-Spain's Rahm wins CareerBuilder after playoff Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 21 (Reuters) - Spain’s Jon Rahm survived four playoff holes to capture the CareerBuilder Challenge in southern California on Sunday. \nRahm shot a five-under-par 67 to post a combined 22-under and force extra holes with American Andrew Landry, who fired a final round 68. \nRahm birdied the par-4 18th hole, the fourth of the playoff, to seal the win. The 23-year-old won the DP World Tour Championship in November and Sunday’s victory was his second on the PGA Tour. \nThe world number three started the final day two behind 54-hole leader Austin Cook and Landry was one behind. \nCook’s chances faded when he went three over after six holes. \nMartin Piller, John Huh and Adam Hadwin each finished at 20-under.
