Bruce Steinberg was a senior investor at the $160 billion hedge fund. SHARES Ezequiel Becerra | AFP | Getty Images The tail of the burned fuselage of a small plane that crashed, rests near trees in Guanacaste, Corozalito, Costa Rica on December 31, 2017. \nCondolences for the sudden death of an executive at the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates poured into the social media accounts of the fund's founder, Ray Dalio, on Monday and Tuesday. \nThe executive, Bruce Steinberg, was killed along with this wife, three children, and seven others when the small charter plane they were aboard crashed in a mountainous area of Costa Rica over the weekend. The Steinbergs lived in suburban New York. Another American family that died in the crash was from Florida. The crash also killed the American guide and the Costa Rican pilot and co-pilot, according to multiple news reports. \nOn Monday, Dalio posted to his Facebook account and Twitter about the accident, calling Steinberg a \"wonderful\" man and adding, \"Right now, we are each processing this devastating tragedy in our own ways. \nAt this time I will be devoting my attentions to doing this and helping others.\"",
