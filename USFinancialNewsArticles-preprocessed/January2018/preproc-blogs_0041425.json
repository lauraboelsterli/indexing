They wanted high returns. They didn't mind volatility,\" Chiavarone said.\n\"The Great Recession put the fear in a lot of folks and they wanted to go on the merry-go-round Folks really want to get on that risk trade,\" he added.\nChiavarone, who is a bull on the actual blockchain technology, believes there's a good chance bitcoin will suffer the same fate as Pets.com — one of the biggest dotcom bubble busts of the high-flying 90s, before tech stocks crashed.\nBitcoin bear, stock market bull However, that doesn't mean a monster crypto drop would send the stock market into a tailspin.\nAccording to Chiavarone, stocks are on solid ground. He cites the impact from President Donald Trump's tax reform package and strong economic fundamentals.\n\"When you look at pick-up in economic growth, the full impact of the tax reform boost, [and] the earnings number, you've got to pull your target up to match it,\" Chiavarone said. \"A lot of strategists falling over themselves to try to figure out what that right earnings number is.\"\nChiavarone predicts the S&P 500 Index will end the year around 3100 — a 10 percent jump from current levels.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
