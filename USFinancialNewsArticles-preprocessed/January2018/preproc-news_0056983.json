Net earnings were ahead of Company expectations but declined 8% to $468 million primarily due to the prior year second quarter $205 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses. Earnings before income tax declined to $566 million, or 28%. Adjusted earnings before income tax increased to $602 million, or 2%. Adjusted EBIT margin declined about 120 basis points in the quarter to 18.6% due to pressure from higher pass-through revenues and acquisitions. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped reduce the effective tax rate for the quarter to 17.4%, and 25.6% on an adjusted basis. This adjusted effective tax rate excludes a one-time net benefit of approximately $46 million related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax balances partially offset by a one-time transition tax and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits. Diluted earnings per share declined 7% to $1.05. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.99.\n“The world of work is going through transformative changes and we are continuing to evolve our solutions to meet our clients’ dynamic needs,” said Carlos Rodriguez, President and Chief Executive Officer, ADP. “With the recent acquisitions of Global Cash Card and WorkMarket we have further solidified our strategy of being the leading provider of HCM solutions across the entire workforce as we now comprehensively address the growing importance of freelance workers for our clients.”\n“ADP delivered strong results in the quarter, posting solid revenue, bookings and adjusted EPS growth. Based on the performance in the first half of the year, and the ongoing benefit we expect from corporate tax reform, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to 12% to 13% growth,” said Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer, ADP.\nAdjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, and organic revenue are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables at the end of this release for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Segment Results\nEmployer Services – Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HCM and human resources outsourcing solutions.\nEmployer Services revenues increased 6% on a reported basis, 4% organic compared to last year’s second quarter. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States increased 2.6% for the second quarter when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses. Employer Services client revenue retention declined 20 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter. Employer Services segment margin decreased approximately 50 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter. This decrease resulted primarily from approximately 70 basis points of pressure from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nPEO Services – PEO Services provides comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship.\nPEO Services revenues increased 15% compared to last year’s second quarter driven primarily by a 10% increase in average worksite employees for the quarter and higher than expected growth in pass-through revenues. PEO Services segment margin declined approximately 30 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter, primarily driven by pressure from higher pass-through revenues. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services were about 498,000 and we ended the quarter with about 504,000 worksite employees.\nInterest on Funds Held for Clients – The safety, liquidity and diversification of ADP clients’ funds are the foremost objectives of the company’s investment strategy. Client funds are invested in accordance with ADP’s prudent and conservative investment guidelines and the credit quality of the investment portfolio is predominantly AAA/AA.\nFor the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 16% to $107 million from $92 million a year ago. Average client funds balances increased 7% in the second quarter to $22.5 billion compared to $20.9 billion a year ago. For the second quarter, the average interest yield on client funds was 1.9% which was up 10 basis points compared to a year ago.\nNotable Subsequent Events\nThe composition of work is increasingly moving toward the freelance, or “gig,” worker and it is with this evolution in mind that ADP acquired WorkMarket, a leading provider of cloud-based freelance management solutions. With this acquisition, ADP has expanded its market opportunities while building on its current portfolio of industry-leading payroll and HCM solutions that help clients and workers modernize the way work gets done, while unlocking productivity, engagement, and growth. The purchase price of this acquisition was approximately $125 million.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nCertain components of ADP’s fiscal 2018 outlook and related growth comparisons exclude the impact of the following items and are discussed on an adjusted basis where applicable. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these adjusted amounts to their closest comparable GAAP measure.\nFiscal 2017 pre-tax restructuring charges of $90 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Fiscal 2017 second quarter pre-tax gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205 million. Anticipated fiscal 2018 pre-tax restructuring charges of about $25 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Fiscal 2018 pre-tax proxy contest charges of about $33 million. Fiscal 2018 second quarter one-time net tax benefit of about $46 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nADP now anticipates full-year fiscal 2018 revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared to the prior forecast of 6% to 8%. This revenue forecast continues to include approximately one percentage point of growth from acquisitions and the impact from foreign currency. This revenue forecast continues to assume growth in worldwide new business bookings of 5% to 7% compared to the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal 2017. Adjusting for additional anticipated PEO pass-through pressure, ADP now assumes adjusted EBIT margin will decline approximately 50 basis points for the full year compared to the prior forecast of down 25 to 50 basis points.\nADP expects full year diluted earnings per share to be up 8% to 9%, compared to our prior forecast of down 1% to up 1% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to be 12% to 13% compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7% growth. This adjusted earnings per share forecast reflects the ongoing estimated benefits from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and ADP now forecasts an adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 of 26.9% compared to the prior forecast of 31.7%. This benefit is primarily attributable to the lower blended federal corporate statutory rate of 28.1% for fiscal 2018.\nReportable Segments Fiscal 2018 Forecast\nFor the Employer Services segment, ADP still anticipates revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, and continues to anticipate a margin decline of 50 to 75 basis points for the year. ADP maintains expectations for an increase in pays per control of 2.5% for the year. For the PEO Services segment, taking into account higher pass-through revenues, ADP now anticipates revenue growth of approximately 12% to 13%, compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13% and margin to be flat to down 25 basis points for the year, compared to the prior forecast of up 25 to 50 basis points.\nClient Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2018 Forecast\nThe interest assumptions in our forecasts are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of January 29, 2018. The Fed Funds futures contracts used in the client short and corporate cash interest income forecasts assume an increase in the Fed Funds rate in March 2018. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of January 29, 2018 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client and corporate extended, and client long portfolios, respectively.\nInterest on funds held for clients is expected to increase $55 to $65 million, or about 16%, compared to the prior forecast of up $45 to $55 million. This is based on anticipated growth in average client funds balances of approximately 4% to 5% from $23.0 billion in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior forecast of approximately 3% growth and an average yield which is still anticipated to increase about 20 basis points to 1.9% compared to the fiscal 2017 average yield of 1.7%. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $45 to $55 million compared to the prior forecast of up $35 to $45 million.\nInvestor Webcast Today\nADP will host a conference call for financial analysts today, Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The conference call will be webcast live on ADP’s website at investors.adp.com and will be available for replay following the call.

helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as \"All other interest expense\" and \"All other interest income.\" (b) The majority of charges relating to our Service Alignment Initiative represent severance charges. Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to our broad-based, company-wide Service Alignment Initiative. (c) The taxes on the gain on sale of the business were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the period ended December 31, 2016 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business. (d) The tax provision on the Service Alignment Initiative was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. (e) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes. (f) Represents non-operational costs associated with proxy contest matters. The tax benefit on the non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. (g) The one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) is comprised of the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances partially offset by the one-time transition tax and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized. (h) \"Constant dollar basis\" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. \"Constant dollar basis\" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. (i) The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic revenue which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

These adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income”. No material impact is expected from change in all other interest expense or income in fiscal 2018. b) Second quarter fiscal 2017 impact from gain on the sale of CHSA and COBRA businesses c) Fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Workforce Optimization Effort adjustment is a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate and is not expected to recur in fiscal 2018. The majority of charges relating to the Workforce Optimization Effort represent severance charges. Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges related to a broad-based, company-wide Workforce Optimization Effort. d) Impact of Fiscal 2017 charges in connection with the Service Alignment Initiative e) Expected impact of Fiscal 2018 charges in connection with the Service Alignment Initiative f) Expected impact of Fiscal 2018 charges in connection with proxy contest matters. g) Expected Fiscal 2018 one-time benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Safe Harbor Statement\nThis document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
