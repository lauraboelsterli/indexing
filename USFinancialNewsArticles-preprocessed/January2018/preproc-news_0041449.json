    "text": "ATLANTA, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Rollins, Inc. (NYSE: ROL), a premier global consumer and commercial services company, reported strong unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was signed into law. The fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million decrease in net income, ($8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation). This resulted in a $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income for the quarter and $0.05 per diluted share decrease for the year. Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these on reported results.\nThe Company recorded fourth quarter revenues of $414.7 million, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Rollins reported net income of $33.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Excluding significant items Rollins' net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $38.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the same period in 2016.\nFor the full-year ended December 31, 2017, Rollins' revenues rose 6.4% to $1.674 billion compared to $1.573 billion for the prior year. The Company reported net income of $179.1 million. Excluding significant items Rollins' net income for the year rose 13.9% to $190.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to net income of $167.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share last year.\nGary W. Rollins, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rollins, Inc. stated, \"We are pleased to have delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year. These results reflect the underlying strength of our business and our initiatives that have benefitted our customers, employees, and shareholders.\"\nMr. Rollins concluded, \"Our strong balance sheet has allowed us to continue to make strategic acquisitions. Northwest Exterminating has been a great addition to our Company and we are extremely pleased with the contributions that they have made to our revenues and profits. We look forward to all of our acquisitions having a significant role in the company going forward.\"\nEddie Northen, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Rollins, Inc. stated, \"For Fiscal 2018, we believe the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will result in an all-in book tax rate for the Company in the mid 20 percent range. Our first quarter 2018 will have the additional tax benefit from share-based compensation, further reducing that quarter's tax rate.\nRollins, Inc. is a premier global consumer and commercial services company.

These forward-looking statements include statements about the Company's expectation that acquisitions will continue to have a significant role in the Company going forward; the expectation that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will result in an all-in book tax rate for the Company in the mid 20 percent range; and the expectation that the first quarter 2018 will have an additional tax benefit from share-based compensation, further reducing that quarter's tax rate. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, economic and competitive conditions which may adversely affect the Company's business; the degree of success of the Company's pest and termite process, and pest control selling and treatment methods; the Company's ability to identify and integrate potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; the Company's ability to attract and retain skilled workers, and potential increases in labor costs; uncertainties of litigation; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. A more detailed discussion of potential risks facing the Company can be found in the Company's Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nROL-Fin\nROLLINS, INC.
