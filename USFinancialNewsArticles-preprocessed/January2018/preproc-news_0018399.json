The Bayer Pension Trust holds a further 8.9 percent stake, which was unchanged. \nOne of the banks involved in the placement had said on Wednesday that Bayer would sell about 18 million shares in Covestro at 86.25 to 88.46 euros apiece for proceeds of 1.55 to 1.59 billion euros. $1 = 0.8373 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Madeline Chambers",
