    "text": "BERLIN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats agreed to cap at 1,000 a month the number of people who will be allowed to join their family now living as refugees in Germany, a blueprint seen by Reuters showed.\nThe draft, which is still subject to change, said that in return Germany would reduce by the same amount the number of refugees it takes from Greece and Italy under a European Union voluntary pact.\nFamily reunification would only apply to marriages sealed before migrants fled and only if the individuals concerned had committed no crimes, were not dangerous and in cases where refugees were not expected soon to return home.\nAgreement on one of the most emotive topics to divide the Social Democrats and the most conservative wing of Merkel’s camp suggests the parties are close to announcing a decision to open formal coalition talks.
