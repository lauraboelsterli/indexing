SHARES \nWhether you're in the market for a new pair of flip flops or Fingerlings toys, you'll likely find it in the endless aisles at Walmart. \nNow the retail behemoth has revealed its top-selling products in every state. \nWalmart looked at data from 2017 sales to determine the top 25 most popular items purchased on its website in each state, and identified \"interesting\" top-sellers. \nThe retail giant found that popular product categories included everything from school supplies to beverages to toys, with specific products ranging from utilitarian to unique. The top-selling products in every state \nCoast to coast, Walmart shoppers are turning to the retailer to quench their thirst. \nBeverages were one of the most popular products in Florida (sparkling cider), Indiana (instant coffee), Louisiana (root beer extract), South Dakota (orange juice), Ohio (grape-flavored drink mix) and California (protein powder â€” typically mixed with water or milk). \nMeanwhile, in a slew of states, food items were best sellers in 2017. And many appear to have a sweet tooth, like Arkansas (chocolate), Colorado (M&M's peanut chocolate candy), Delaware (spiced jelly candy), Maine (brownie mix), Missouri (Life Savers candy) and Washington (vanilla frosting). \nSome top products made sense geographically: In Wisconsin, shoppers were purchasing Green Bay Packers bath mats. Kansas residents were snapping up Ozark trail insulated tumblers to keep drinks hot or cold. Virginians bought lots of coolers. \nShoppers in a few states went for more obscure items. Cinnamon-flavored toothpaste was a top-selling product in New Hampshire, while coin banks made the list in South Carolina. The \"Ghost in a Shell\" DVD was a top-selling item in Connecticut, as were L.O.L Surprise! dolls in Arizona. \nBelow is a full list of Walmart's top-sellers in each state: \nAlabama: Crayons ",
