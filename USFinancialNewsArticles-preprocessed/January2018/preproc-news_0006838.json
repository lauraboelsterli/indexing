    "text": "With the 2017 holiday season behind it, two of America's biggest department store chains, Macy's and Sears Holdings , unveiled which locations they will be closing next â€” adding up to more than 100.\nThese companies have had an especially rough ride in recent months, as they work to right-size their overwhelming real estate footprints against a backdrop of Amazon stealing market share and more brands marketing themselves directly to consumers, bypassing department stores altogether.\nTo start the year and building on previous announcements, Sears will be closing 64 Kmart stores and 39 Sears stores , all of which are expected to shut between early March and April.\nshow chapters Sears to close an additional 103 Kmart and Sears stores 22 Hours Ago | 01:21 Macy's has revealed 11 locations (as part of a previously announced plan to close 100 stores, beginning in 2017) that will also shut in early 2018, with liquidation sales beginning as soon as next week.\nMeanwhile, the industry is closely watching which Sears and Macy's stores are going dark, as it could be a death sentence for a mall to lose both anchor tenants. The scenario isn't uncommon, either.\nshow chapters Here are the stores Macy's is closing next 22 Hours Ago | 00:39\nReporting by Lauren Thomas; data visualization by John Schoen",
