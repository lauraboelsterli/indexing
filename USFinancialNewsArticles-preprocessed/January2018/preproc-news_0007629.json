    "text": " 48 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago U.S. Supreme Court sides with death row inmate over racist juror claim Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday paved the way for a black Georgia inmate to challenge his 1991 death sentence for killing his sister-in-law after he argued the case was tainted by a racist white juror who questioned whether black people have souls. FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, U.S. on November 15, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo \nThe justices, in a 6-3 decision, threw out a lower court’s decision that had rejected his biased jury assertion. Keith Tharpe was found guilty and sentenced to death by a jury of 10 white people and two black people in Georgia’s Jones County. Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Alistair Bell",
