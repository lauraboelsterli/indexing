    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acceleron Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:XLRN), a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases, today announced the planned retirement of Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Matthew L. Sherman, M.D. The retirement will be effective after the topline data release from the ongoing MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept, expected to occur in the middle of this year. Luspatercept is the Company’s lead program that is being developed across multiple Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials in collaboration with Celgene Corporation for the treatment of chronic anemia in hematologic disorders.\nDr. Sherman joined Acceleron in 2006 as its first Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Sherman has successfully led the clinical development of multiple internally discovered programs, most notably the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of luspatercept.\n“I am sincerely grateful to Matt for his dedicated service to Acceleron throughout the past twelve years and for his support through my first year as CEO,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “Matt has provided valuable leadership and clinical development experience to Acceleron, especially in the areas of hematology and oncology. I am delighted that we will continue to benefit from Matt’s expertise in support of the anticipated process for regulatory approval of luspatercept.\"\n\"I am truly proud of our achievements at Acceleron over the last twelve years, including building an outstanding clinical development team, advancing multiple protein therapeutics into Phase 2 development and working strategically alongside our collaboration partner for the ongoing Phase 3 trials of luspatercept. I am looking forward to continuing to work on the luspatercept program. Acceleron is well-positioned for continued success and I am excited about the future of the company in all areas,\" said Dr. Sherman.\nDr. Sherman will remain on staff until the release of topline data from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials, and then serve in an advisory capacity for one year thereafter. The Company is now initiating a search for the position of Chief Medical Officer.\nAbout Acceleron\nAcceleron is a Cambridge-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. The Company's leadership in the understanding of TGF-beta biology and protein engineering generates innovative compounds that engage the body's ability to regulate cellular growth and repair.\nAcceleron focuses its research and development efforts in hematologic, neuromuscular, and pulmonary diseases.
