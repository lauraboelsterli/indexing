When you file your taxes, there are a few easy-to-make mistakes you'll need to dodge. Failing to do so could put your finances in jeopardy for the rest of the year.\nClick through to learn how you might be committing tax fraud without even knowing it , and let financial experts teach you how to avoid filing mistakes.\nForgetting to review payroll withholding deductions Getting a tax refund feels good. But if you are a salaried employee or hourly wage earner, it pays to understand why that money is coming back to you.\nOver the course of the year, your employer deducts taxes from each of your paychecks and sends that money to the IRS on your behalf.

You also might owe penalties in some cases. Your withholding should be enough to cover the tax bill at the end of the year.\nHow to correct the problem Review your W-4s regularly. Life changes can occur over the course of the year, and you can adjust your W-4 information at any time.\n\"Most individuals fail to review this form yearly and really should review it halfway through the year to adjust their withholding deductions, so they can adjust their federal and state tax withdrawals,\" Maselli said.\nMaking errors that can happen to anyone Some mistakes cost taxpayers money, but others cost time and create unnecessary stress and headaches.
