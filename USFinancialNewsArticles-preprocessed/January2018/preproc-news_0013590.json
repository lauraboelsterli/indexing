    "text": "(Reuters) - Portuguese soccer manager Andre Villas-Boas has withdrawn from the Dakar Rally after he injured his back in the Peruvian desert.\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager, who left Chinese side Shanghai SIPG in November, had entered the 40th edition of the endurance event to mark his 40th birthday.\n“We jumped off a dune and crashed the car nose first. The Dakar unfortunately is finished for us,” he said on Instagram.\n“Better luck next time.”\nVillas-Boas had been driving a Toyota and was running two hours and 18 minutes behind the leader, Stephane Peterhansel of France.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
