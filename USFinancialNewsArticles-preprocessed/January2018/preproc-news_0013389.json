    "text": "January 7, 2018 / 7:15 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago China December forex reserves rise to $3.1 trillion, highest since September 2016 - central bank Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s foreign exchange reserves rose to their highest in more than a year in December and grew at a faster-than-expected pace, as tight regulations and a strong yuan continued to discourage capital outflows, data showed on Sunday. FILE PHOTO - Chinese banknotes are seen at a vendor's cash box at a market in Beijing February 14, 2014. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nNotching up their 11th straight month of gains, reserves rose $20.2 billion in December to $3.14 trillion, the highest since September 2016 and the biggest monthly increase since July, central bank data showed on Sunday. \nThat compares with an increase of $10 billion in November. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion. \nCapital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy. \nThe yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation. \nThe value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the PBOC website also showed.
