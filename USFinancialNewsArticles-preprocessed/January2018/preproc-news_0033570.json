REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler \nKristoffersen’s 16th World Cup win was on the cards after he was fastest on the first run and opened up a gap of 1.05 seconds over Hirscher. \nAustrian Michael Matt was only 0.1 seconds behind Kristoffersen but his chances of victory ended when he skied through a gate halfway down his second run.

REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler \nDespite a big advantage, Kristoffersen held nothing back on his second run and nearly crashed when he lost control and at one point had both his skies in the air. \nBut he survived the scare and charged down the rest of the course, beating his chest and waving his skies in the air as he crossed the finish line. \nHirscher also saw his lead cut in the overall standings as he chases a seventh successive World Cup. He now has 1054 points, 154 clear of second-placed Kristoffersen with Aksel Lund Svindal third on 666. Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern; Editing by Toby Davis",
