She, along with Gary, will nurture and strengthen the Horizon culture and improve processes to position Horizon as a strong competitor.\"\nIn his role at Alaska, Beck oversaw 1,600 pilots in Alaska, California and Washington and was responsible for ensuring a safe, reliable and compliant flight operation. In addition, he introduced the airline's Greener Skies initiative, and ushered in technology game-changers such as pilot iPads and a paperless flight deck. After retiring from Alaska, Beck continued to serve as the airline's delegate on the NextGen Advisory Committee Sub Committee (NACSC), where he testified before the U.S. Senate on the airline's behalf. Since May 2016, he has led a joint Alaska Airlines/Virgin America integration team working towards obtaining a Single Operating Certificate.\nHe holds a certificate in negotiations from Harvard Law School, an executive management certificate from UCLA's Anderson School of Management and studied aerospace engineering at Central Texas College and business administration at Northern Illinois University He is a qualified pilot on multiple aircraft with over 15,000 flight hours.\nVon Muehlen was most recently managing director of airframe, engine and component maintenance repair and overhaul. Before that, she served as director of engine maintenance. During the last year, she led the integration of Virgin America's and Alaska's maintenance operations. Prior to Alaska, von Muehlen spent 20 years in aviation maintenance leadership at Pratt and Whitney and at Air Canada. She received her initial leadership training as a captain in U.S. Army Aviation serving tours of duty in Germany, Iraq, Turkey and Korea between 1990 and 1996.\nShe holds a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University, a certificate in Executive Leadership Training from Darden School at the University of Virginia and is a Six Sigma-certified black belt and master black belt in process improvement. She is completing an executive MBA at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington this spring.\n\"There are a lot of positive things happening at Horizon Air, including the introduction of new E-175 jets, a new pilot training and career development program, and very good operational performance in the last few months, said Tilden. \"The addition of Gary and Constance will do nothing but strengthen Horizon in the years ahead.\"\nAlaska Airlines, together with Virgin America and its regional partners, flies 40 million guests a year to more than 115 destinations with an average of 1,200 daily flights across the United States and to Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica and Cuba.
