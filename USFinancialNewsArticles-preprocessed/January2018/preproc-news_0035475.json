    "text": "LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Peugeot’s Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said he does not want to close any of the firm’s Vauxhall car plants in Britain, the head of Britain’s biggest trade union said on Monday after meeting the boss of the French carmaker.\nPeugeot acquired Vauxhall and Opel last year when it bought General Motors’ loss-making European arm, and has been pursuing a restructuring plan to return it to profitability.\n“Carlos Tavares repeated his desire not to close UK plants, which is reassuring,” the Unite union’s General Secretary Len McCluskey said on Monday.\nPeugeot said it wanted Unite’s help to work on plans to rebuild the industrial footprint of the British brand, which trades as Opel on the continent.\n“Further meetings are planned to quickly move this recovery plan for Vauxhall’s manufacturing sites to the highest level of performance, after years of degradation,” Vauxhall said in a statement.
