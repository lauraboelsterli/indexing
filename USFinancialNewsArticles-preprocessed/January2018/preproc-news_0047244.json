    "text": "SCRANTON, Pa., Jan. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Peoples Financial Services Corp. (NASDAQ: PFIS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. The dividend is payable March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record February 28, 2018.\nPeoples Financial Services Corp. (the \"Company\") is the parent company of Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company (the \"Bank\"), an independent community bank serving Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties in Pennsylvania and Broome County in New York through 27 offices. Each office, interdependent with the community, offers a comprehensive array of financial products and services to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government entities. The Company's business philosophy includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers and providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures and consistently applied credit policies.\nSafe Harbor Forward-Looking Statements:\nWe make statements in this press release, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for future financial or operating results and/or other matters regarding or affecting Peoples Financial Services Corp., Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Peoples\") that are considered \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\"). Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"planned,\" \"estimated,\" \"intend\" and \"potential.\" For these statements, Peoples claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the PSLRA.\nPeoples cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to: prevailing economic and political conditions, particularly in our market area; credit risk associated with our lending activities; changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation or practice with respect to tax or legal issues; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting Peoples' operations, pricing, products and services and other factors that may be described in Peoples' Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") from time to time.\nIn addition to these risks, acquisitions and business combinations, such as Peoples recent merger with Penseco Financial Services Corporation, present risks other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired. Acquisitions and business combinations may be substantially more expensive to complete than originally anticipated, and the anticipated benefits may be significantly harder—or take longer—to achieve than expected. As regulated financial institutions, our pursuit of attractive acquisition and business combination opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and/or legal issues related to the pre-acquisition operations of an acquired or combined business may cause reputational harm to Peoples following the acquisition or combination, and integration of the acquired or combined business with ours may result in additional future costs arising as a result of those issues.\nThe forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, Peoples assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peoples-financial-services-corp-declares-first-quarter-2018-dividend-300588917.html\nSOURCE Peoples Financial Services Corp.",
