    "text": " 12 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago Airline Niki takes insolvency row to German federal court Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nKARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Niki, the Austrian arm of collapsed Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ), has filed an appeal with Germany’s supreme court against a lower court ruling that has put at risk a deal for Niki to be bought by British Airways owner IAG ( ICAG.L ). People stand in front of an empty Niki customer care desk at Palma de Mallorca airport, Spain, December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Clara Margais \nThe appeal was filed on Monday, a spokeswoman for the federal court said, after a regional court said Niki’s insolvency should have been filed in Austria, not Germany, and that it would reverse the decision to open proceedings in Berlin. \n“The case will be handled swiftly,” she said on Tuesday. \nNiki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany’s Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian airline, grounding its fleet and stranding thousands of passengers. \nAfter hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it lost its valuable runway slots, IAG agreed to buy the business and make it part of low-cost unit Vueling. \nBut Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said last week it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria. \nThe head of Niki’s works council, Stefan Tankovits, told Reuters on Tuesday he was optimistic that IAG would remain on board and the deal for it to buy Niki would still go through. \nNiki had no immediate comment. IAG declined to comment. Related Coverage",
