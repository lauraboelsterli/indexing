    "text": "(Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Sunday that it appeared Hawaii did not have adequate safeguards in place to prevent a false emergency alert and that government officials must work to prevent future incidents.\nChairman Ajit Pai speaks ahead of the vote on the repeal of so called net neutrality rules at the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/Files The FCC “will focus on what steps need to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again,“ Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement after Saturday’s errant ballistic missile warning to Hawaii residents. ”Federal, state, and local officials throughout the country need to work together to identify any vulnerabilities to false alerts and do what’s necessary to fix them.”\nReporting by David Shepardson in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
