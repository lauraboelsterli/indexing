    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 7:31 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Nine charged over fraternity pledge's death at Florida State University Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Nine men were charged on Tuesday over the hazing death of a 20-year-old fraternity pledge, who died of alcohol poisoning at Florida State University late last year, police said. \nThe nine men, who are between the ages of 20 and 22, were charged with college hazing causing injury or death in Leon County after a two-month investigation into the death of Andrew Coffey, the Tallahassee Police Department said in a statement. \n“This collaborative investigation was critical to finding answers for Andrew Coffey’s family and our community. Hopefully, this investigation and its outcome will prevent another tragedy from occurring,” said Police Chief Michael DeLeo in the statement. \nCoffey died Nov. 3 after attending “Big Brother Night” at the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, where he was a pledge. An autopsy found his blood alcohol level was .447, more than five times the legal limit to drive, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. \nFlorida State University, a school of more than 41,000 students, suspended all fraternities and sororities after the incident.
