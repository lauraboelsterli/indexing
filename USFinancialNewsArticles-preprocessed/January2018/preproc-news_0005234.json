Unemployment overall was 4.1 percent.

In the 45 years the data has been tracked , the unemployment rate for black or African-American workers aged 16 years and older has never fallen below 7 percent. \nUnemployment rate - Black or African-American - since 1972 \nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics \nThrough last year, the black unemployment rate rose to 8 percent in March and fell back to 7 percent in September before falling again in December.
