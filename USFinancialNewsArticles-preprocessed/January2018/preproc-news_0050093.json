    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 9:53 PM / in 4 minutes Husky to restart SeaRose operations after iceberg probe Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Canadian regulators on Friday lifted a suspension notice on Husky Energy’s SeaRose floating production vessel off the coast of eastern Canada, allowing the company to resume operations on the 27,000-barrel-per-day project. \nThe Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) earlier this month ordered the company to suspend operations after an investigation found that it had not followed its own procedure when iceberg came too close to the facility in March 2017. \nHusky did not disconnect the SeaRose floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and sail away from the iceberg as it should have done, and at one point people on board were ordered to “brace for impact.” \nWhile the iceberg did not make contact with the SeaRose or underwater infrastructure, the response was against the company’s own Ice Management Plan protocol, the regulator determined. \nHusky completed a series of actions with the regulator to ensure a similar incident would not happen again. \nThe resumption of operations on the SeaRose was expected to take three days, the company said. The vessel is located in the North Atlantic’s White Rose oilfield, around 350 kilometers (217 miles) east off the coast of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. \n(This version of the story corrects the location of SeaRose to off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, not New Brunswick in the last paragraph) Reporting by Julie GordonEditing by Marguerita Choy",
