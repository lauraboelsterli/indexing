    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 12:19 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Harley-Davidson closes Missouri plant as shipments slump, shares fall Rajesh Kumar Singh , Rachit Vats 4 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) said on Tuesday it will close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri as it consolidates manufacturing operations after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years, sending its shares down more than 8 percent. \nThe Milwaukee-based company forecast a drop in shipments to dealers this year as it expects retail sales in the United States - the company’s biggest market - to dip. \nDespite generally higher U.S. consumer spending, Harley is grappling with an ageing customer base and younger, more price-sensitive buyers hesitant to embrace the iconic brand as previous generations have done. \nIts shares fell 8.5 percent to $50.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock fell nearly 13 percent in 2017. \nHarley said it expects to ship 231,000 to 236,000 motorcycles this year after shipping 241,498 vehicles in 2017, the lowest number since 2011. That is at the low end of its previous forecast of 241,000 to 246,000 units. \nIn the December quarter, Harley’s U.S. sales declined 11.1 percent from the year before and overseas sales dipped 7.7 percent. Overall sales in the quarter were down 9.6 percent. \nAs it adjusts to lower demand, Harley said it will consolidate work at its motorcycle assembly plant in Kansas City, Missouri, into the one in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 800 jobs at the Kansas City plant but adding 450 at the York facility. \nHarley said the move would result in restructuring costs of $170 million to $200 million through 2019 but would save the company $65 million to $75 million a year after 2020.

Revenue from motorcycles and related products rose to $1.05 billion from $933 million. Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Bill Rigby",
