    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 7:25 AM / in an hour UK's CMC Markets posts strong Q3 as focus on high-value clients pays Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 25 (Reuters) - Spreadbetting firm CMC Markets Plc said on Thursday its revenue per client surged 33 percent in the third quarter, as its focus on high-value clients helped offset challenges from a sector-wide regulatory clamp-down and lower levels of volatility. \nActive clients, however, fell 6 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier to 38,859, CMC said in a statement. \n“The regulatory uncertainty continues and the Group remains cautious around the impact any potential changes could have on Group performance in the short-term,” it said.
