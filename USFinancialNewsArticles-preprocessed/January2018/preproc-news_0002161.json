    "text": "January 2, 2018 / 8:59 PM / in 2 minutes At least 25 dead after bus careens off cliff in Peru: police Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLIMA (Reuters) - At least 25 people died on Tuesday when the bus on which they were traveling collided with a truck and careened off a cliff along a sharply curving highway north of the capital, Lima, local police said. \nThe accident took place on the Panamericana Norte highway near the area of Pasamayo. \n“It’s a dangerous curve zone,” Colonel Dino Escudero, head of Lima’s highway control division, told local radio station RPP. He said the death toll could rise because the bus had been carrying 40 passengers. \nRoad accidents are common in Peru because of unsafe highways. Police are investigating Tuesday’s accident.
