    "text": "January 19, 2018 / 9:24 PM / Updated 2 minutes ago Archer Daniels has made takeover approach to Bunge: WSJ Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland Co ( ADM.N ) made a takeover approach to rival Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ), the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. on.wsj.com/2mSY8L0 \nArcher Daniels’ move comes after Bunge rebuffed a takeover approach from rival Glencore ( GLEN.L ) last year. \nGlencore and Bunge struck an agreement that temporarily prevents Glencore from making a hostile bid, according to news media reports. \nLarge grain traders have struggled in recent years as a global oversupply and thin trading margins have squeezed their core commodity trading operations, including those of Bunge, Archer Daniels, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL]. \nShares of Bunge, which has a market cap of $9.79 billion, closed up 11 percent at $77.56 on Friday. \nADM said it does not comment on “rumors or speculation”, while Bunge was not immediately available for comment.
