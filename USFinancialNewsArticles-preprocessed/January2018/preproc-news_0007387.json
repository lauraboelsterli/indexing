    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Live Ventures Incorporated (Nasdaq:LIVE), a diversified holding company, today announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding stock of ApplianceSmart , a 17-store chain specializing sales and service of new and out-of-the-box appliances with annualized revenues of approximately $65 million.\nApplianceSmart maintains stores in Minnesota, Ohio, Texas and Georgia. It is estimated that Live Ventures revenues will rise approximately 42 percent on an annualized basis as a result of this acquisition.\nNet assets acquired as part of this transaction are estimated to be valued at purchase price or greater, resulting in no recording of goodwill. In addition, no stock was issued by the company in connection with this transaction.\nThe Company believes the acquisition will be synergistic because it anticipates the transaction may provide opportunities for its other subsidiaries, including award-winning entertainment retailer Vintage Stock, to expand into new markets. Additionally, management anticipates improving ApplianceSmart’s financial position by expanding its current product offering and increasing operational efficiencies.\n“We welcome ApplianceSmart and its approximately 150 employees to the Live Ventures family,” said Jon Isaac, president and CEO of Live Ventures Incorporated .\n“We are excited for this transaction and believe ApplianceSmart will thrive under the Live Ventures umbrella,” said Akram Mohamad, president of ApplianceSmart. “We look forward to continuing to grow in our current markets with an eye toward additional expansion.”\nAbout Live Ventures Incorporated\nLive Ventures Incorporated is a diversified holding company with several wholly owned subsidiaries and a strategic focus on acquiring profitable companies that have demonstrated a strong history of positive revenues.
