    "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (NASDAQ:WHLR) (“Wheeler” or the “Company”) today announced that Wilkes Graham has notified the Company of his intention to resign as Chief Financial Officer to accept a position with a privately-held real estate development company located in Atlanta, GA. The resignation will take effect after a transition period, which is expected to end on or before March 4, 2018. Over the next sixty days of the transition, we expect Mr. Graham will be fully engaged with the Company’s fourth quarter close, earnings announcement and the signing and filing of our 10-K.\nThe Company is in the process of engaging a professional search firm to assist in the hiring of Mr. Graham’s replacement. In the event that the Company has not hired a permanent replacement prior to the effectiveness of Mr. Graham’s resignation, Matthew Reddy, the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer, will serve as the Company’s interim Chief Financial Officer while the Company completes the search process. Mr. Reddy is a certified public accountant and has been with the Company since June 2015 as Chief Accounting Officer. Prior to joining Wheeler, Mr. Reddy was the Assistant Vice President of Online Products at Liberty Tax Service (NASDAQ:TAX). While employed at Liberty, Mr. Reddy was also employed as Director of Finance from 2011 to 2014, and Manager of Financial Reporting from 2008 to 2011. Prior to joining Liberty, Mr. Reddy worked at KPMG LLP as a Senior Auditor. Rebecca Schiefer, the Company's Director of Accounting, will continue to lead the day-to-day operations of the Company's accounting department.\n\"We want to thank Wilkes for his contributions to our Company during his tenure and wish him the best in his new position,\" said Jon Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"Our primary goal remains to serve our shareholders through a dedicated business strategy that is executed by experienced real estate and financial executives. We will work to locate and hire a capable successor in a timely fashion. Due to the financial and accounting processes and procedures we have implemented, and the increased board interaction and oversight from our Operating Committee, we are confident that our experienced financial and accounting teams will continue to efficiently run the financial operations of the Company while we search for his successor.\"\nAbout Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Virginia Beach, VA, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company focused on acquiring and managing income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.
