    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 4:31 PM / in 16 minutes Banco Santander Brasil to accelerate loan growth in 2018 -CEO Carolina Mandl 2 Min Read \nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Banco Santander Brasil SA plans to accelerate loan book growth this year as Brazilian economy recovers from recession and credit demand begins to pick up, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Rial told journalists on Wednesday. \nRial expects loan book growth to exceed the 6.1 percent achieved in 2017, concentrating expansion in payroll-backed credit, vehicle financing and mortgages to individuals, without setting a target. \nAfter years lagging the largest Brazilian listed banks in recurring return on equity, Santander Brasil beat estimates last quarter with a 18.3-percent recurring ROE. Since taking the helm two years ago, Rial made clear his main goal was to raise bank’s profitability and market share. \nAnalysts said the CEO strategy is working. \n“Santander Brasil has successfully turned around its business and now boasts one of the highest levels of profitability in our coverage,” said Deutsche Bank’s analyst Tito Labarta. \nThe CEO added that although the bank remains committed to growing return on equity, there may be ups and downs as interest rates hit their all-time low in the country and banks increase competition in loans. This may affect margins in the near term, he said. \nShares of Santander Brasil were up 1.8 percent, at 36.37 reais and show a 19-percent gain so far this year. \nRial and Chief Financial Officer Angel Santodomingo said Santander Brasil is being cautious in risk management to avoid rising default rates as the credit expansion picks up pace. \nSantander Brasil had a 3.2 percent delinquency rate in the fourth quarter, 0.3 percentage point above the previous quarter. \n($1 = 3.1633 reais)",
