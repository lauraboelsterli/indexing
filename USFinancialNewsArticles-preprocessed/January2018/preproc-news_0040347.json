    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 6:35 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago U.S. auto regulator probes Tesla ‘Autopilot’ crash -source Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is sending investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla Inc vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. \nThe move follows a separate announcement on Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board that it was sending two investigators to the scene to conduct a “field investigation” to examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday’s accident in which the driver said the vehicle was operating in “Autopilot” mode. \nTesla declined to comment on Wednesday on the new probe.
