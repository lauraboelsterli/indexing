Such can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as “will,” “strategy,” “expects,” “seeks,” “believes,” “potential,” or other similar words. Because such statements include risks, uncertainties and contingencies, actual results may differ materially from the expectations, intentions, beliefs, plans or predictions of the future expressed or implied by such . These are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of IRT’s management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally not within IRT’s control. In addition, these are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. These risks, uncertainties and contingencies include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in IRT’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. IRT undertakes no obligation to update these to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180125006376/en/\nFor Independence Realty Trust, Inc.\nEdelman Financial Communications & Capital Markets\nTed McHugh and Lauren Tarola, 212-277-4322\nIRT@edelman.com\nSource: Independence Realty Trust, Inc.",
