    "text": "(Reuters) - Telecoms and cable group Altice NV ( ATCA.AS ) ( ATUS.N ) is separating its U.S. and European operations to try to reassure investors alarmed by its high debt and low revenue generation, especially in its core French telecoms business.\nBelow is a list of some of companies Altice has acquired in recent years and which had contributed to Altice gradually building up debts of around 50 billion euros ($59.6 billion).\nSFR (2014-2015): Acquired by Altice for around 14 billion euros. Funded by debt, equity and cash.\nPT PORTUGAL (2014): Agreed a 7.4 billion euro deal in December 2014 with Brazil’s Oi ( OIBR4.SA ) to acquire sole control of PT Portugal. Funded by debt and cash.\nSUDDENLINK (2015): Bought U.S. regional cable company Suddenlink for $9.1 billion. Deal financed by debt and cash.\nCABLEVISION (2015): Bought U.S.-based Cablevision for $17.7 billion. Total debt financing of the deal stood at $14.5 billion, combined with debt from Cablevision.\nMEDIA CAPITAL (2017): 440 million euro deal to buy Portugal’s Media Capital, the owner of the country’s largest television channel, from Spain’s Prisa ( PRS.MC ).\nThe transaction still needs to get approval by local competition authorities.\n($1 = 0.8384 euros)\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
