    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 4:58 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange hacked, losing $530 million: NHK Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Coincheck, a major cryptocurrency trading exchange in Tokyo, has been hacked into and has lost about 58 billion yen ($534 million) worth of virtual money, national broadcaster NHK reported on Friday. \nCoincheck posted on its website on Friday afternoon that it had suspended withdrawals of almost all cryptocurrencies. \nThe exchange has already reported the incident to the police and to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, NHK said. \nIn 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world’s bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts.
