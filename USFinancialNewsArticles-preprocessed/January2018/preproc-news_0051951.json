(\"Navios Containers\" or \"the Company\") (N-OTC:NMCI), a growth vehicle dedicated to the container sector of the maritime industry, today reported financial results for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from April 28, 2017 (date of inception) through December 31, 2017.\nAngeliki Frangou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance for which we reported EBITDA of $9.9 million and net income of $1.7 million.”\nAngeliki Frangou continued: “Within the eight months of fiscal 2017, we created a fleet of 21 containerships. Our run rate continues to rise, and we expect a 32% increase of available days in Q1 2018 over Q4 2017. We are also continuing to see attractive acquisition opportunities as the market consolidates.”\nHIGHLIGHTS -- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nVessel Acquisitions\nIn September and October 2017, the Company agreed to acquire two 2009-built 4,250 TEU containerships for an aggregate purchase price of $19.75 million. The vessels were delivered to Navios Containers' owned fleet in November 2017. The acquisition of the vessels was financed through a new $12.0 million loan from a commercial bank and the balance with available cash.\nIn November 2017, the Company agreed to acquire four 2008-built 4,730 TEU containerships for a total purchase price of $96.8 million. These vessels are employed on charters with a net daily charter rate of $27,156. The charters expire in 2020 and are expected to generate approximately $70.0 million of EBITDA, assuming expenses approximating current operating costs and 360 revenue days per year. The vessels were delivered to Navios Containers' owned fleet in November and December 2017. The acquisition of these four vessels was financed through a new $50.0 million loan from a commercial bank and the balance with available cash.\nIn December 2017, the Company agreed to acquire one 2010-built 4,360 TEU containership for a total purchase price of $11.45 million. The vessel was delivered to Navios Containers' owned fleet in December 2017. The acquisition of the vessel was financed through a $6.0 million loan from a commercial bank and the balance with available cash.\nFleet Development\nNavios Containers controls a fleet of 21 vessels totaling 88,880 TEU. The current average age of the fleet is 9.8 years. As of January 25, 2018, Navios Containers has chartered-out 58.4% and 19.6% of available days for 2018 and 2019, respectively, which are expected to generate $87.3 million and $40.7 million in revenue, respectively. The average expected daily charter-out rate for the fleet is $19,527 and $27,148 for 2018 and 2019, respectively and the total expected available days for 2018 and 2019, are 7,665 days for both periods.\nPrivate Placement\nOn November 9, 2017, Navios Containers closed a private placement of 9,090,909 shares at a subscription price of $5.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $50.0 million. Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (“Navios Partners”) invested $10.0 million at the subscription price and received 1,818,182 shares. Navios Partners and Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. (“Navios Holdings”) also received warrants, with a five-year term, for 6.8% and 1.7% of the newly issued equity, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Navios Partners holds 9,818,182 common shares representing 33.7% of the equity and Navios Holdings holds 1,000,000 common shares representing 3.4% of the equity of Navios Containers. Both Navios Partners and Navios Holdings hold warrants, with a five-year term, for 6.8% and 1.7% of the total equity of Navios Containers, respectively.\nCredit Facilities\nIn December 2017, Navios Containers agreed to an additional tranche to its existing July 2017 $21.0 million credit facility with a commercial bank for an incremental amount of $50.0 million in order to finance the acquisition of the four 2008-built 4,730 TEU containerships. This tranche bears interest at LIBOR plus 385 bps per annum. The entire $71.0 million facility now matures in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is repayable in eight quarterly payments of $6.5 million each, plus a balloon payment on the last repayment date. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this new tranche of the facility was $50.0 million and the total amount outstanding under this facility was $70.2 million.\nThe maturity of the other $40.0 million loan facility the Company entered into in June 2017 has also been extended to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOn December 20, 2017, Navios Containers entered into a loan facility for an amount of up to $24.0 million with a commercial bank in order to partially finance the acquisition of four containerships. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $18.0 million (which was used to partially finance the two 2009-built 4,250 TEU containerships and the 2010-built 4,360 TEU containership), with the remaining $6.0 million available to finance the acquisition of an additional vessel. The facility is repayable in twenty consecutive quarterly instalments of $0.6 million each, plus a balloon payment on the last repayment date. The facility matures in December 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 300 bps per annum.\nRefinancing Credit Facilities – Reducing Cash Breakeven\nThe Company is in advanced discussions for re-financing its credit facilities maturing in the fourth quarter of 2019, totalling $102.7 million outstanding on December 31, 2017. Under one of the alternatives for such refinancing, the daily debt service cost in 2018 for the containerships would be reduced by 58%. No assurances can be provided that the Company will successfully refinance these credit facilities.\nEarnings Highlights\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as substitutes for Navios Containers’ results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSee Exhibit I under the heading, “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” for a discussion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share of Navios Containers and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable measures calculated under U.S. GAAP.\nFourth Quarter 2017 and period from April 28, 2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017\nResults (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data and unless otherwise stated):\nThe fourth quarter 2017 and the period from April 28, 2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017 information presented below was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective period.\nThree Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Period from April 28, 2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017 (unaudited) ( un audited) Revenue $ 21,329 $ 39,188 Net Income $ 1,673 $ 2,638 Adjusted Net Income (1) $ 1,673 $ 3,085 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,859 $ 2,623 EBITDA $ 9,917 $ 18,709 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 9,917 $ 19,156 Basic Earnings per Share $ 0.07 $ 0.14 Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share (1) $ 0.07 $ 0.17 (1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from April 28, 2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017 exclude $0.4 million relating to the reactivation costs of four laid-up vessels.\nFleet Summary Data:\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators indicative of the performance of the Navios Containers' operations and its fleet performance for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from which the vessels were delivered, June 8, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nThree Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Period from June 8, 2017 to December 31, 2017 Available Days (1) 1,434 2,411 Operating Days (2) 1,352 2,268 Fleet Utilization (3) 94.3 % 94.1 % Vessels operating at period end 21 21 TCE (4) $ 14,232 $ 15,730\n(1 ) Available days for the fleet are total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Containers' possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (2 ) Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3 ) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Containers' vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels. (4 ) TCE is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a relevant period divided by the number of available days during the period.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share represent Net Income and Basic Earnings per Share, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measures and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets, (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities, (iii) net interest cost, (iv) deferred finance charges and (v) payments for drydock and special survey costs. Navios Containers believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are a basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and represents useful information to investors regarding Navios Containers’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Containers also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used (i) by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide additional information with respect to the ability of Navios Containers to satisfy its respective obligations, including debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and pay dividends. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements, the definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used here may not be comparable to those used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Containers’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and other financing arrangements; and (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, among others, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Containers’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nNavios Containers Reconciliation of EBITDA to Cash from Operations\nThree Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Period from April 28,2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities $ 3,859 $ 2,623 Net increase in operating assets 996 12,142 Net increase in operating liabilities 2,642 (1,701 ) Payments for drydock and special survey 1,471 3,807 Deferred finance charges (231 ) (430 ) Net interest cost 1,180 2,268 EBITDA (1) $ 9,917 $ 18,709 Re-activation cost - 447 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,917 $ 19,156\n(1) Three Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Period from April 28,2017 (date of inception) to December 31, 2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,859 $ 2,623 Net cash used in investing activities $ (129,157 ) $ (249,227 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 109,587 $ 260,825 EXHIBIT II\nOwned Vessels Vessel Name TEU Year Built Navios Summer 3,450 2006 Navios Verano 3,450 2006 Navios Spring 3,450 2007 Navios Amaranth 4,250 2007 Navios Indigo 4,250 2007 Navios Vermilion 4,250 2007 Navios Verde 4,250 2007 Navios Amarillo 4,250 2007 Navios Azure 4,250 2007 MOL Dominance 4,250 2008 MOL Delight 4,250 2008 MOL Dedication 4,250 2008 MOL Devotion 4,250 2009 MOL Destiny 4,250 2009 Navios Lapis 4,250 2009 Navios Tempo 4,250 2009 Navios Felicitas 4,360 2010 APL Oakland 4,730 2008 APL Los Angeles 4,730 2008 APL Denver 4,730 2008 APL Atlanta 4,730 2008\nSource:Navios Maritime Containers Inc.",
