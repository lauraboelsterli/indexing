    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 10:01 AM / Updated 22 minutes ago Turkish border town hit by rockets, one civilian killed - Anadolu Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Two rockets fired from the Syrian region of Afrin struck the Turkish border town of Reyhanli and killed one person, the state-run Anadolu agency said on Wednesday. \nRockets hit two houses and killed one 17-year-old and wounded another person, Anadolu said. The missile attacks were believed to be carried out by members of Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and Syrian Kurdish fighters, it said. \nSince the start of Turkey’s operation against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin, several rockets have hit the Turkish border towns of Kilis and Reyhanli. \nTurkey launched the air and ground offensive, dubbed “Operation Olive Branch”, a little more than a week ago, opening a new front in Syria’s seven-year, multi-sided civil war to target Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.
