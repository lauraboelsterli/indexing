File photo: Mayor of Chongqing municipality Zhang Guoqing (2nd R) attends a session of the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 6, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nThe port city of Tianjin, close to Beijing, has ambitions to become a financial hub for northern China and is one of four areas designated a municipality, along with Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, giving it the same high status as a province. \nZhang Guoqing, the former mayor of Chongqing, was appointed acting mayor and deputy mayor of Tianjin, the Peopleâ€™s Daily newspaper said. \nA Chinese court in September jailed the former Tianjin mayor, Huang Xingguo, for 12 years for accepting bribes. \nThe former deputy mayor of Tianjin, Yan Qingmin, has been appointed as vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
