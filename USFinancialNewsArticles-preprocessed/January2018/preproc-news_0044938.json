    "text": "PRAGUE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Czech car factory TPCA, run by Toyota and Peugeot-Citroen, will raise wages by an average 16.4 percent over the next two years, the plantâ€™s unions said on Wednesday.\nThe export-oriented economy is driven largely by the car sector and has been growing at a strong clip in recent years, helping push unemployment to a two-decade low and boosting wages.\nThe average wage grew by a nominal 6.8 percent in the third quarter last year.
