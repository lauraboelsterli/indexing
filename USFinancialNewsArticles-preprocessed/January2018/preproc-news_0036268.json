    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) (\"Zions\" or \"the Company\") today reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $114 million, or $0.54 per diluted common share, compared with net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $152 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2017 and net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $125 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHarris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, \"We are pleased with the results of both the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased to $0.80, a 33% increase over the prior-year period, when adjusted for both the deferred tax asset revaluation and the larger charitable contribution expense, which were directly related to the passage of tax reform legislation. When adjusted for these items, the efficiency ratio improved materially to 59.8%, and the return on tangible common equity rose to 10.9%, up from 8.4% in the year-ago period.\" Mr. Simmons continued, \"We were pleased with loan growth over the year-ago period, which increased at a rate roughly double that of large domestic commercial banks. We've also seen strong improvement in credit quality, with classified loans and other measures of quality at their best levels in a number of years.\"\nMr. Simmons concluded, \"We are pleased to have achieved each of the financial goals we established in mid-2015, and we remain focused on building a culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence that will allow us to continue to produce profitable growth in the years ahead.\"\nFor the full version of the Company's 2017 fourth quarter earnings release, including financial tables, please visit zionsbancorporation.com .\nSupplemental Presentation and Conference Call\nZions has posted a supplemental presentation to its website, which will be used to discuss these fourth quarter results at 5:30 p.m. ET this afternoon (January 22, 2018).
