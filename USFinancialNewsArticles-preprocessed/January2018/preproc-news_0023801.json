    "text": "Devon Hall scored a career-high 25 points as No. 3 Virginia remained unbeaten in the ACC with a 68-51 win over North Carolina State Sunday night at John Paul Jones Arena.\nVirginia (16-1, 5-0) extended its winning streak to eight games and knocked off the Wolfpack for the 11th straight time in the regular season.\nNorth Carolina State (12-6, 2-3) entered the game averaging 83 points per game but ran into the stingiest defense in the country as the Cavaliers continued their defensive excellence.\nVirginia shot 56 percent on the night and connected on eight of their 14 three-point attempts, four of which were knocked down by Hall. Sophomore Kyle Guy added 17 points while Isaiah Wilkins scored 10 points and pulled down six rebounds.\nNorth Carolina State was held to 41 percent shooting and had made just one of their 15 three-point attempts before a last-second deep ball went in to push the Wolfpack over the 50-point plateau.\nTorin Dorn led North Carolina State with 16 points while Lavar Batts added 12. The Wolfpack turned the ball over 15 times which led to 22 Virginia points.\nThe Cavaliers turned it over 15 times -- a season-high.\nVirginia led by as many as 16 in the first half but allowed North Carolina State to get back into the game late in the half.\nThe Wolfpack shot just 33 percent over the first 20 minutes but pulled down eight offensive rebounds that led to 10 second-chance points.\nVirginia led 30-20 at halftime after shooting 53 percent for the half. The Cavaliers turned the ball over eight times while shooting 7-7 from the free throw line.\nHall led Virginia with 10 first-half points while sophomore guard Ty Jerome added eight.\nFreeman led North Carolina State with six points.\nVirginia will travel to Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech on Thursday. North Carolina State will host Wake Forest, also on Thursday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
