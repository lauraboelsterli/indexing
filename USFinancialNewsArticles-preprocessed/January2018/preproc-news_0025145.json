    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Academy Securities, a registered broker-dealer, certified Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE), and Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), today announced the addition of Lieutenant General David A. Deptula to its Advisory Board.\nLieutenant General Deptula served in the United States Air Force for more than 34 years where he took part in operations, planning, and command leadership at the most senior levels. He was the principal attack planner for the 1991 Operation Desert Storm air campaign, commander of no-fly-zone operations over Iraq in the late 1990s, and director of the air campaign over Afghanistan in 2001. Additionally, Lieutenant General Deptula was twice a joint task force commander and was the air commander for the 2005 South Asia tsunami relief operations. His last assignment was as the Air Force’s first deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), where he transformed America’s military ISR and drone enterprises.\n“We are thrilled to add such a highly-esteemed individual to our firm’s Advisory Board,” stated Academy’s Chairman and CEO Chance Mims. “Lieutenant General Deptula will add tremendous value advising on military issues around the world, especially where the projection of air power is involved.”\nLieutenant General Deptula commented on joining Academy Securities: “I'm honored to join the Advisory Board of Academy Securities.

He is a fighter pilot with more than 3,000 flying hours (400 in combat) including multiple command assignments in the F-15. Defense News Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in U.S. defense in 2014.\n“Academy Securities is privileged to continue to expand our advisory board with such a dynamic individual. He will bring a unique perspective that will be additive to our client offering and social mission,” said Phil McConkey, President of Academy Securities.\nAbout Academy Securities\nAcademy Securities is a preeminent disabled veteran owned investment bank with strength in capital markets, public finance, fixed income and equity trading.
