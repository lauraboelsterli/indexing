(“Newtek” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NEWT), an internally managed business development company (\"BDC\"), today announced that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 cash dividend of $0.40 1 per share, which represents an approximate 11% increase over the first quarter 2017 dividend of $0.36 per share.
