    "text": "SKOKIE, Ill., Jan. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The AZEK Company, formerly known as CPG International LLC, today announced the company's new name, which reflects its growing share of the expanding residential and commercial building products market. The rebranding is part of the organization's strategy to disrupt the nearly $2 billion wood deck and railing industry by concentrating on its leading, premium offerings and diversifying its portfolio through strategic acquisitions of other offerings in adjacent categories.\n\"As The AZEK Company, we are committed to engineering and manufacturing beautiful, high-quality and low-maintenance building products to improve the spaces where our customers live, work and play,\" said Jesse Singh, CEO of The AZEK Company. \"We will continue to expand our pipeline this year and grow our market share by engineering more premium building products and acquiring new offerings that envelop the house.\"\nWith expertise in materials science and more than 1,000 employees, The AZEK Company is growing across Illinois and within its manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio. It is also expanding its footprint with regional sales associates across the United States and Canada.\nA central part of The AZEK Company's strategy for growth is a strong focus on reusing recycled plastics and turning them into superior residential and commercial building products that outlast wood and other raw materials.

Over the past five years, AZEK Building Products alone has saved more than 900,000 trees, setting The AZEK Company apart and giving it a distinct competitive advantage in the building materials space.\nAbout The AZEK Company\nThe AZEK Company LLC is an industry-leading manufacturer of beautiful, low-maintenance residential and commercial building products, committed to innovation, sustainability and research and design.
