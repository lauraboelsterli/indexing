    "text": " 45 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Brazil offers $1 bln in reopening of 2047 dollar bond -source Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds details, context) \nBRASILIA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Brazil on Thursday offered an initial $1 billion worth of 2047 dollar bonds in the first sovereign debt transaction of the year, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \nIn a statement, the National Treasury said it had hired Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley to underwrite the reopening of its 5.625 percent Global 2047 bond. There were $1.5 billion worth of outstanding Global 2047 bonds at the end of November. \nThe government initially suggested a price for the reopening that would yield around 5.80 percent, according to Thomson Reuters debt service IFR. \nThe transaction comes a week after Standard & Poor’s widely expected downgrade of Brazil’s sovereign credit rating. \nThe cost of insuring against a Brazilian sovereign default held near four-year lows after the downgrade, though it remains close to that of lower-rated peers. \nBrazilian foreign debt totaled 121.4 billion reais ($37.9 billion) in November, dwarfed by its 3.37 trillion reais worth of local currency debt. $1 = 3.21 reais Reporting by Patricia Duarte; Writing by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Phil Berlowitz",
