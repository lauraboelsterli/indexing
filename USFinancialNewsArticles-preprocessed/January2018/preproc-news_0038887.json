Any offering of the securities covered by the shelf registration statement will be made solely by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement relating to that offering. A copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement may be obtained on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nAbout Helios and Matheson\nHelios and Matheson Analytics Inc.

(“MoviePass”) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, “forward-looking statements”), that may not be based on historical fact, but instead relate to future events. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “potential” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding MoviePass’ business and prospects. Statements regarding future events are based on HMNY’s and MoviePass’ current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated risks.\nSuch forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions. Although management of HMNY and MoviePass believe that the assumptions made and expectations represented by such statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that a forward-looking statement contained herein will prove to be accurate. Actual results and developments (including, without limitation, the declaration of effectiveness by the SEC of the shelf registration statement, the consummation of any financing under the shelf registration statement, the continued expansion of MoviePass’ business, the acquisition of films by MoviePass Ventures and the existence of future growth opportunities for HMNY) may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein and even if such actual results and developments are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences or effects.\nRisk factors and other material information concerning HMNY and MoviePass are described in HMNY’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 filed with the SEC on November 14, 2017, in HMNY’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 14, 2017, in HMNY’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 30, 2017 and other HMNY filings, including subsequent current and periodic reports, information statements and registration statements filed with the SEC. You are cautioned to review such reports and other filings at www.sec.gov .\nGiven these risks, uncertainties and factors, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and information, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. All forward-looking statements and information made herein are based on HMNY’s and MoviePass’ current expectations and HMNY does not undertake an obligation to revise or update such forward-looking statements and information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nIn particular, MoviePass’ subscription pricing models are new. There can be no assurance that MoviePass’ recent rate of increase in its subscribers resulting from these pricing models will be sustained. Moreover, an increase in the number of MoviePass subscribers provides no assurance that the MoviePass business model will lead to profitability.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180125005658/en/\nHMNY Contact:\nThe Pollack PR Marketing Group\nStephanie Goldman / Mark Havenner, 310-556-4443\nsgoldman@ppmgcorp.com / mhavenner@ppmgcorp.com\nor\nMoviePass Contact:\nLaunchSquad for MoviePass\nGavin Skillman, 212-564-3665\ngavin@launchsquad.com\nSource: Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc.",
