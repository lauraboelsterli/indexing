Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer. “In 2017, we exceeded the top end of our original earnings per share guidance range, grew market share in key businesses and delivered strong free cash flow of 118 percent of adjusted net income. We executed well on our dynamic capital allocation plans, raised dividends by 12.5 percent, committed $460 million to strategic acquisitions and deployed $1 billion to share repurchases. My thanks to our global team members for serving our customers and generating solid results.\n“In 2018 our strategy remains consistent,” he said. “We have healthy markets and leading brands that are well positioned for growth. We expect our business operating system to deliver strong operating leverage and powerful free cash flow.

Enterprise revenue up 8 percent, organic revenue up 6 percent; North America up 7 percent and international up 4 percent organically. Operating margin up 20 basis points, adjusted operating margin up 20 basis points. Positive price, higher volume and productivity improvements were partially offset by material and other inflation.

Organic revenue is defined as GAAP net revenues adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions.\nCurrency impacts on net revenues and bookings are measured by applying the prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates to the current period’s net revenues and bookings reported in local currency. This measure allows for a direct comparison of operating results excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation.\nAdjusted operating income is defined as GAAP operating income plus restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.\nAdjusted operating margin is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.\nIn 2017 Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses, net of tax impacts, plus the discrete non-cash tax adjustment in Latin America less U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items. In 2016 Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses and a legal settlement, less the gain from the sale of the company’s remaining interest in Hussmann, net of tax impacts. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.\nCash flow return on invested capital (“Cash flow ROIC”) is defined as annual free cash flow divided by the sum of gross fixed assets, receivables and inventory less accounts payables.\nFree cash flow in 2017 and 2016 is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring. Please refer to the free cash flow reconciliation on table 9 of the news release.\nWorking capital measures a firm’s operating liquidity position and its overall effectiveness in managing the enterprises’ current accounts.\nWorking capital is calculated by adding net accounts and notes receivables and inventories and subtracting total current liabilities that exclude short term debt, dividend payables and income tax payables. Working capital as a percent of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital balance (e.g. as of December 31) by the annualized revenue for the period (e.g. reported revenues for the three months ended December 31) multiplied by 4 to annualize for a full year.\nAdjusted effective tax rate for 2017 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs and the discrete non-cash tax adjustment in Latin America, U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring expenses. Adjusted effective tax rate for 2016 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs, a legal settlement and the gain on sale of Hussmann interest, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes less the gain on sale of Hussmann interest plus restructuring expenses and a legal settlement. This measure allows for a direct comparison of the effective tax rate between periods.\n*** Accounting for the Tax Effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act); however, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), the Company has made reasonable estimates of the effects the Act has on existing deferred tax balances, the tax owed on the one-time transition tax and the change in permanent reinvestment assertion related to unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the aggregate, the Company recognized a provisional tax benefit for the above items of $21.0 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. Any changes to these provisional amounts will be reported in the period in which the proper accounting under ASC 740 is complete but in no case will that period be longer than the one year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act as required by SAB 118.\nINGERSOLL-RAND PLC Condensed Consolidated Income Statement (In millions, except per share amounts) UNAUDITED\nFor the quarter For the year ended December 31, ended December 31, 2017 2016* 2017 2016* Net revenues $ 3,618.1 $ 3,358.8 $ 14,197.6 $ 13,508.9 Cost of goods sold (2,542.4 ) (2,347.3 ) (9,811.6 ) (9,307.9 ) Selling & administrative expenses (689.0 ) (658.7 ) (2,720.7 ) (2,597.8 ) Operating income 386.7 352.8 1,665.3 1,603.2 Interest expense (53.9 ) (53.8 ) (215.8 ) (221.5 ) Other income/(expense), net (7.8 ) (30.9 ) (31.6 ) 359.6 Earnings before income taxes 325.0 268.1 1,417.9 1,741.3 Benefit (provision) for income taxes 163.0 (63.9 ) (80.2 ) (281.5 ) Earnings from continuing operations 488.0 204.2 1,337.7 1,459.8 Discontinued operations, net of tax (30.8 ) (1.4 ) (25.4 ) 32.9 Net earnings 457.2 202.8 1,312.3 1,492.7 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.7 (4.0 ) (9.7 ) (16.5 ) Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 459.9 $ 198.8 $ 1,302.6 $ 1,476.2 Amounts attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc\nordinary shareholders:\nContinuing operations $ 490.7 $ 200.2 $ 1,328.0 $ 1,443.3 Discontinued operations (30.8 ) (1.4 ) (25.4 ) 32.9 Net earnings $ 459.9 $ 198.8 $ 1,302.6 $ 1,476.2 Diluted earnings per share attributable to\nIngersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders:\nContinuing operations $ 1.93 $ 0.76 $ 5.14 $ 5.52 Discontinued operations (0.12 ) (0.01 ) (0.09 ) 0.13 $ 1.81 $ 0.75 $ 5.05 $ 5.65 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding: Diluted 253.9 262.6 258.1 261.7 * Retrospectively restated for adoption of ASU 2017-07, see Table 10 for additional information.\nINGERSOLL-RAND PLC Business Review (In millions, except percentages) UNAUDITED\nFor the quarter For the year ended December 31, ended December 31, 2017 2016** 2017 2016** Climate\nNet revenues $ 2,760.2 $ 2,558.6 $ 11,167.5 $ 10,545.0 Segment operating income * 348.2 348.8 1,572.7 1,537.5 and as a % of Net revenues 12.6 % 13.6 % 14.1 % 14.6 % Industrial\nNet revenues 857.9 800.2 3,030.1 2,963.9 Segment operating income * 110.6 85.4 357.6 300.3 and as a % of Net revenues 12.9 % 10.7 % 11.8 % 10.1 % Unallocated corporate expense (72.1 ) (81.4 ) (265.0 ) (234.6 ) Total\nNet revenues $ 3,618.1 $ 3,358.8 $ 14,197.6 $ 13,508.9 Consolidated operating income $ 386.7 $ 352.8 $ 1,665.3 $ 1,603.2 and as a % of Net revenues 10.7 % 10.5 % 11.7 % 11.9 % * Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation.
