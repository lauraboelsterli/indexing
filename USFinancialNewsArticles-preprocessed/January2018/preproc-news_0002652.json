( bit.ly/2qpn7uh ) \nThe company said Chief Executive Thomas Wilson will take on the additional role of president following Matthew Winter’s plan to retire on Feb. 23. \nAllstate had been preparing for Winter’s departure for about a year by shifting around its executive ranks, Wilson told Reuters. \nIn addition, the Northbrook, Illinois-based company also named Glenn Shapiro as president of Allstate personal lines.
