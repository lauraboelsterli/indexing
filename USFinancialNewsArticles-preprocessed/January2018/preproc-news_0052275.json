    "text": "MADRID, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Telefonica and Netflix are close to reaching an accord which will permit the Spanish telecommunications company to include the U.S. groupâ€™s content as part of its television service, a source close to the talks said on Monday.\nThe two companies were close to an agreement which would most likely take a few weeks to finalise, the source said.\nTelefonica, which has some 3.7 million subscribers for its television service Movistar+, declined to comment.\nNetflix, which was not immediately available for comment, has around 1.16 million subscribers in Spain.
