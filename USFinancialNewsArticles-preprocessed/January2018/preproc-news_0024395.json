    "text": "January 16, 2018 / 12:53 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Permira partner takes charge of Germany's TeamViewer after execs quit Reuters Staff \n(Adds Permira partner leaving private equity firm to become CEO) \nBy Eric Auchard \nFRANKFURT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Permira has installed one of its partners as the new chief executive of German portfolio company TeamViewer, which it acquired in 2014, after the software company failed to find a buyer and its senior executives left last year. \nSeveral buyout funds had weighed rival bids for a potential $2 billion deal after Permira initiated a sales process last year, sources close to the matter said at the time. But the process was postponed after the parties failed to agree a price. \nTeamViewer said Oliver Steil, 46, a Permira partner and a long-serving operating executive for technology companies owned by the private equity firm, will join the software firm as its new chief executive this month, replacing Andreas Koenig as CEO. \nSteil is leaving Permira to focus on his new role as CEO, a TeamViewer spokesman said. \n“We will now rigorously implement the successful existing strategy and write the next chapter of the company’s success story in 2018,” Steil said in a statement issued by TeamViewer. \nKoenig resigned in December for personal reasons, TeamViewer said in a statement. He was not immediately available to comment. \nThomas Novak, left TeamViewer in November after 14 months as the company’s chief financial officer, according to his LinkedIn profile. \nTeamViewer are the makers of a remote administration software tool widely used by corporate network administrators to perform technical support on company employee computers, among other uses. \nSteil, a member of TeamViewer’s advisory board, is chairman of Permira’s portfolio review committee and is responsible for working with deal teams on wringing value out of its investments. He joined Permira as a partner in 2015. \nPreviously, he was chief executive of German mobile service provider Debitel before it was sold by Permira to Freenet in 2009. \nIn 2010, Steil was named chief executive of Sunrise Communications AG, a Permira investment holding, and left ahead of the company’s stock market flotation in 2015.
