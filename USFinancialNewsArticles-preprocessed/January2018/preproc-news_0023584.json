    "text": "(Reuters) - NXP Semiconductors NV ( NXPI.O ) shareholder Ramius Advisors LLC said on Tuesday it would reject chipmaker Qualcomm Inc’s ( QCOM.O ) $38 billion bid for the company, joining activist investor Elliott Management Corp.\nRamius, which is an affiliate of Cowen Inc ( COWN.O ), said it had informed NXP that Qualcomm’s offer “dramatically” undervalued the company.\nThe New York-based institutional asset manager owned about 2.5 million shares, or less than a one percent stake, in NXP Semiconductors, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nReporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
