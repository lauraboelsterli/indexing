    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. Republican congressional leaders, speaking after talks with Democrats, said on Wednesday lawmakers should not hold funding for defense “hostage” to immigration policy.\nSpeaking after negotiations with Democratic congressional leaders on funding the government, the Republicans said reaching a spending deal was important. “It also remains important that members of Congress do not hold funding for our troops hostage for immigration policy,” it said, suggesting that Democrats had sought to link the two.\nThe statement was issued jointly by the White House and the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans.\nReporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ",
