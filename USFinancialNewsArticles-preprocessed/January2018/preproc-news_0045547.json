    "text": "* Indexes up: Dow 0.25 pct, S&P flat, Nasdaq off 0.46 pct (Updates to early afternoon)\nBy Sruthi Shankar\nJan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared gains on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called China’s 2025 technology strategy a “direct threat” and hinted at action against Beijing, stirring fears of a tit-for-tat trade war.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ross said U.S. trade authorities were investigating whether there is a case for taking action over China’s infringements of intellectual property.\nThat was enough to turn back a relatively upbeat morning on New York markets, which had been buoyed by the prospect of a weaker dollar boosting the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.\n“There is commentary coming from Davos ... about China,” Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.\n“But I would lean towards the fact that the market has come so far so fast. If we continue to hit lower today, I think then we have come to a buying exhaustion point.”\nBy 11:56 a.m. ET (1656 GMt), the Dow Jones industrial average was up just 65 points, or 0.25 percent, at 26,275.91, having earlier risen around 0.7 percent on the day.\nThe S&P 500 was down 0.27 points, or 0.00951 percent, at 2,838.86 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 34.16 points, or 0.46 percent, at 7,426.13.
