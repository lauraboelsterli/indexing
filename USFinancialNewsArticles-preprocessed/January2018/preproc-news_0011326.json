(OTC PINK: GRCU), an innovative hemp-infused nutrition, botanical, sports, and body care products company, as previously announced, Green Cures has appointed Mr. William Pitsicalis as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Effective today, Mr. Joseph Tragesser has resigned as CEO, allowing Mr. Pitsicalis to begin leading the company moving forward.\n“Joe did great work, and we are very thankful for his tireless efforts in advancing the company towards cannabis and CBD-based objectives,” said the new CEO, Mr. William Pitsicalis, “We all wish you well in your future endeavors.”\nThe company’s management has been working on transitioning leadership and responsibilities for several weeks now, and in this time, Mr. Pitsicalis has developed a new strategy for 2018 with his team. In less than 90 days, the company will develop and launch a new blockchain technology platform to process payments in the cannabis space. In addition to this, the company will be releasing a new CBD-based product, which will be hitting shelves within 30 days.\nAs 2018 progresses, the company will continue its research and development initiatives to develop more exclusive product lines, which will be sold both online and in retail locations.\nMr. Pitsicalis added, “In any leadership transition, stakeholders wonder what it will mean for them. We are placing a strong emphasis on creating lasting shareholder value. Specifically, we are striving towards uplisting to the QB tier of the OTC Markets. This means we will become a more transparent company, with more up-to-date filings. At this time, we have no intention to reverse split our company’s stock. As we make progress towards our goal of uplisting, we will provide more updates.”\nAbout Green Cures & Botanical Distribution, Inc.
