    "text": "(Reuters) - Drug retailer Rite Aid ( RAD.N ) on Wednesday posted smaller-than-expected quarterly revenue due to a fall in reimbursement rates and comparable-store sales.\nThe company’s shares plunged 12 percent to $1.86 after the bell.\nThe stock has fallen over 45 percent since June, when larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc ( WBA.O ) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid outright after failing to win antitrust approval.\nRite Aid, however, received regulatory approval in September to sell 1,932 of its stores to Walgreens for $4.38 billion.\n“We have transferred 357 stores (to Walgreens) and have received about $715 million in proceeds, which we have used to pay down debt.” Rite Aid Chief Executive John Standley said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe company said same-store sales fell 2.5 percent in the third quarter, dropping for the sixth straight quarter.\nRite Aid’s retail pharmacy sales dropped 3 percent, while pharmacy services revenue fell 12.2 percent as it participated in fewer regions offering Medicare Part D prescription drugs.\nThe company has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business, which sells prescription drugs, as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressure for generics has intensified.\nThe number of prescriptions filled in same stores, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 2.4 percent, partly due to its exclusion from certain pharmacy networks, Rite Aid said.\nThe Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company’s total revenue fell 5.6 percent to $5.35 billion, much below analysts’ average estimate of $7.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nExcluding one-time items, Rite Aid broke even on a per-share basis, while analysts had expected a loss of 2 cents.\nReporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
