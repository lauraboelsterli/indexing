    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Shanghai aluminium prices rose on Friday, buoyed by the first acceleration in China's GDP growth in seven years, even as the country's output of the metal posted a surprise jump for December. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) was up 1 percent at 14,770 yuan ($2,307.56) a tonne at 0202 GMT, but still on course for a weekly drop of 2.3 percent. * LME ALUMINIUM: In London, three month aluminium edged down 0.2 percent to $2,236 a tonne, after ending up 2.2 percent in the previous session. * CHINA: China's economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017, as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years, defying concerns that intensifying curbs on industry and credit would hurt expansion. * ALUMINIUM: China's aluminium production rebounded in December to its highest since June, reversing five months of declines and lifting 2017 output to a record. * COPPER: The most-traded March copper contract in Shanghai was up 0.2 percent at 53,770 a yuan a tonne. Three-month London copper rose 0.4 percent to $7,108.50 a tonne, building on Thursday's gain of 0.6 percent, after a force majeure in Mongolia. * MONGOLIA: The Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in Mongolia's southern Gobi Desert declared force majeure after protests by Chinese coal haulers disrupted deliveries near the border, said majority owner Turquoise Hill. * LEAD: Lead was the biggest gainer among base metals on the ShFE, rising 1.3 percent to 19,485 yuan a tonne on concerns about air quality and more output restrictions in the key production hub of Jiyuan in Henan province. * ZINC: Rising supplies of zinc over the next couple of years are unlikely to replenish dwindling inventories to the extent that the market stops fretting about shortages and driving up prices towards the peaks seen in 2007. * NICKEL: The global nickel market deficit narrowed to 8,400 tonnes in November from 11,500 tonnes in the previous month, the International Nickel Study Group said on Thursday.
