    "text": "BERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) want to raise the bar for a top income tax rate for high earners to an annual income of 60,000 euros, a source with knowledge of their coalition talks said on Monday.\nThe measure, an election promise by the conservatives, is designed to provide tax relief for high earners. It signals a compromise by the SPD who had wanted to raise taxes for high earners and expand welfare payments.\nA top tax rate of 42 percent at the moment applies for those who earn some 53,700 euros and above ($64,375.56) annually.\n$1 = 0.8342 euros Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Paul Carrel\n ",
