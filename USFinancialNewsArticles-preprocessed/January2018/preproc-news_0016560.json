    "text": "By David Z. Morris 2:25 PM EST \nU.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning has filed paperwork to run for a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland, where she may challenge Democratic incumbent Ben Cardin in a primary. \nThe documents showing Manning‚Äôs campaign filing were shared on Twitter today, and confirmed by the Washington Post . üö® Per FEC filings, @xychelsea is running against Ben Cardin for Maryland Senate this year. https://t.co/MrQIs0Znzr pic.twitter.com/8Gw7vtVtc2 \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune‚Äôs technology newsletter. \nManning, a former Army intelligence analyst, was convicted in 2013 of leaking a vast trove of Army documents, videos, and other materials to WikiLeaks. They included evidence of what Manning later described as ‚Äúmissteps‚Äù and ‚Äúmisguided policies‚Äù in the prosecution of the war in Iraq. \nManning was pardoned by President Barack Obama in 2017, days before he left office. Manning was born male, and was known as Bradley Manning before changing her name to Chelsea and suing for sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatments while in prison.
