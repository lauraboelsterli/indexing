    "text": "January 19, 2018 / 5:26 PM   Actor Michael Douglas accused of sexual misconduct in 1980s Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman on Friday publicly accused Oscar-winning actor and producer Michael Douglas of sexual misconduct, saying he had repeatedly harassed her verbally and fondled himself in front of her when she worked for him in the 1980s. \n“He thought he was the king of the world, and that he could humiliate me without any repercussions,” journalist and author Susan Braudy said on NBC News’“Today” show. \nDouglas, 73, issued pre-emptive denials of the story in articles published over the last two weeks, including one in which he called it a fabrication. His publicist, Allen Burry, said on Friday there would be no further comment. \nThe allegations against Douglas were the latest in a lengthy series of accusations by women and men who say they were victimized by high-powered men in the entertainment industry. Movie producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Louis C.K. are among the most prominent men to have been accused. \nBraudy, a former executive at Warner Bros. studios, worked for Douglas’ production company for three years. \nShe said Douglas repeatedly used sexual language in conversations and that his behavior escalated during a work meeting at his New York apartment in 1989 where he groped his crotch in front of her.

He said he learned in December that multiple publications were investigating the claim. \nDouglas, who won an Academy Award for best actor in 1988 and for best picture in 1976, said he supported the #MeToo movement by those breaking their silence over past sexual harassment or misconduct, and that he had the support of his wife, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, and his children.
