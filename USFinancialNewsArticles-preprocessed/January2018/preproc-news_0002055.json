    "text": "HOUSTON, Jan. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today announced expected earnings on a guidance basis for 2017 will incorporate a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expense. As a result, earnings are expected to exceed the previously provided $1.25 to $1.33 guidance range. Absent these adjustments, earnings are anticipated to be at or near the high end of the $1.25 to $1.33 range.\nCenterPoint Energy's management will host an earnings call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2018, and will provide dial-in instructions at a later date. Company executives plan to discuss 2017 earnings results, 2018 earnings guidance, long-term growth drivers, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nEarnings Guidance Variables and Assumptions\nGuidance for 2017 considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, anticipated effective tax rates, and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.\nIn providing guidance, the company assumes for midstream investments a limited partner ownership interest in Enable Midstream averaging 54.1 percent for 2017 and includes the amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis difference in Enable Midstream. CenterPoint Energy's guidance takes into account such factors as Enable Midstream's most recent public outlook for 2017 provided on Nov. 1, 2017, and anticipated effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.\nAbout CenterPoint Energy\nCenterPoint Energy, Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas, is a domestic energy delivery company that includes electric transmission & distribution, natural gas distribution and energy services operations. The company serves more than five million metered customers primarily in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. The company also owns a 54.1 percent limited partner interest in Enable Midstream Partners, a publicly traded master limited partnership it jointly controls with OGE Energy Corp., which owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.
