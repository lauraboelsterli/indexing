    "text": "Reuters TV United States January 11, 2018 / 6:09 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Ford urges 2,900 pickup owners to stop driving after new Takata death Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said Thursday it had confirmed a second death in a older pickup truck caused by a defective Takata airbag inflator and urged 2,900 owners in North America to stop driving immediately until they can get replacement parts. FILE PHOTO: A recalled Takata airbag inflator is shown in Miami, Florida in this June 25, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo \nThe second largest U.S. automaker said it was able to confirm in late December that a July 2017 crash death in West Virginia in a 2006 Ford Ranger was caused by a defective Takata inflator. It previously reported a similar death in January 2016. \nFord said both Takata deaths occurred with inflators built on the same day. At least 21 deaths worldwide are believed linked to the Takata ( TKTDQ.PK ) inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments that has led to the largest automotive recall in history. All of the other deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) vehicles. Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
