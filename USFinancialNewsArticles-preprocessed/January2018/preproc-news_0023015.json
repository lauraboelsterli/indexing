    "text": " 52 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago France abandons plan for new airport in western France - PM Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The French government on Wednesday abandoned a decades-old plan to build a 580 million euro ($708.53 million) airport in western France, saying it did not have broad popular support. \n“The Notre-Dame-Des-Landes project will be dropped,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a televised statement. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who took office in May, promised a quick decision after years of indecision and political squabbles over the development. The issue has poisoned French politics for decades and spawned a hardcore eco-protest movement that threatened widespread disruption over the issue. \nFrench construction giant Vinci had won the contract to build the new airport, near the city of Nantes. It also operates the existing airport in the city, which Philippe said will be modernised. ($1 = 0.8186 euros) (Reporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Richard Lough)",
