    "text": "Caterpillar's $2 billion tax fight with the IRS could change how US companies do business Federal officials have been investigating Caterpillar Inc.'s taxes and profits processed through its Swiss subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL. The outcome of that investigation could influence other American companies' tax strategies. Michael Newberg | CNBC Caterpillar on display at the CONEXPO in Las Vegas. \nCaterpillar Inc. has long used a subsidiary in Geneva, Switzerland, called Caterpillar SARL, to process sales and profits for international orders, and the IRS wants the heavy-machinery maker to pay a $2 billion tax bill on that business, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nAlthough the company maintains that its Swiss strategy, which results in an effective tax rate there of as low as 4 percent, is legal, some Caterpillar employees have questioned the practice, which began in 1999, the Journal reports. \nNo civil or criminal charges have been filed, and a Caterpillar spokeswoman told the Journal that the company is \"in the process of responding to the government's concerns.\" \nFederal officials raided Caterpillar's offices in March, and the outcome of the investigation could influence other U.S. companies' tax strategies. Sweeping new tax law took effect Monday, partially aimed at persuading American companies to bring back their overseas cash holdings. ",
