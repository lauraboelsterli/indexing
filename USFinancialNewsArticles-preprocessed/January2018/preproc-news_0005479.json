REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic \nThe 22-year-old produced an astonishing first run as she charged down the course in 51.44 seconds, with Frida Hansdotter of Sweden the second-best on 52.91. \nEven though Shiffrin eased off slightly on the second run, when her time was bettered by two other skiers, nobody else could get near her total time of one minute 43.50. Slideshow (5 Images) \nHansdotter was second and Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener third. \nShiffrin, who won her maiden overall World Cup title last season, tops the overall standings with 1,281 points, an overwhelming lead of 721 points over second-placed Holdener. \nThis season she has won four slalom races, two giant slaloms, one parallel slalom, the Oslo city event and a downhill.
