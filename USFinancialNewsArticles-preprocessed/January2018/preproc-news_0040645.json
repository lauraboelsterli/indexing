    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 3:53 PM / in 7 minutes Brazil judge upholds Lula corruption conviction; 2 more jurists must vote Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRASILIA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The first of three Brazilian judges weighing an appeal by former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva voted on Wednesday to uphold a corruption conviction that will likely sideline him from running in this year’s presidential election. \nAppeals court judge Pedro Gebran dismissed defense lawyers’ arguments that the conviction for receiving a bribe and laundering money lacked proof and was politically motivated. Gebran said the so-called Car Wash investigation suggested Lula was an organizer of the kickback scheme operating within state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, funding his Workers Party and its allies.
