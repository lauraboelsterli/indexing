    "text": "Jan 8 (IFR) - Cantor Fitzgerald has appointed Andrew Apthorpe as global head of equity-linked origination, another high-profile hire as it builds out a relatively new business.\nApthorpe joins Cantor from RBC Capital Markets, where he had served as global co-head of convertible bonds and equity-linked origination since 2009.\nBefore that, he spent 12 years in convertible origination at Deutsche Bank.\n“There were a number of things that really attracted me to Cantor Fitzgerald,” Apthorpe told IFR.\n“The entrepreneurial aspect of building a new platform - and the momentum of a rapidly growing investment bank focused on life sciences and healthcare.”\nCantor Fitzgerald has plenty of momentum in straight equity.\nBetween 2016 and 2017, it climbed 16 spots in the combined US equity league tables to reach 22nd place with US$1.1bn of business from 26 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThat excludes at-the-market stock sales, where the bank has a long-established practice.\nBut the last time it was a bookrunner on an equity-linked deal was in 2011, and then just as one of three banks on a US$160m convertible bond for broker affiliate BGC Partners.\nBy 2014, five years after Apthorpe joined RBC, the bank ranked fifth in the US equity-linked league tables with 17 transactions and US$3.3bn of business.\nThat compared to just one deal for US$50m in 2009.\nApthorpe joins a growing team in Cantor Fitzgerald’s equity-linked business.\nJames Kenney, the longtime head of convertible bond sales at Goldman Sachs, joined Cantor in December in a similar role.\nKevin Cadden, another Goldman Sachs alumnus, also signed on last month as a senior director in convertible sales.\nFormer Credit Suisse banker Julie Reid was hired in 2016 as a managing director in sales and trading.\nNikola Dimitrov, an RBC and Goldman alumnus, was also hired last year to head convertible trading.
