FILE PHOTO: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo \nThe agency said that its review would entail evaluating Sinclair’s offer of divestitures, and that because the agency would need an opportunity “to fully review them,” it paused its informal 180-day transaction clock. \nRupert Murdoch-controlled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ) is in talks to buy about 10 television stations from Sinclair as part of the divestiture, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters this week.
