While bulk of India’s $150 billion sour debts are with the 21 state-backed lenders, some private sector banks like Axis and ICICI Bank also account for sizeable chunks.\nAxis’ net interest income for the quarter grew 9 percent from a year ago, while fee income grew 24 percent on year driven by the retail segment. Net interest margin was 3.38 percent.\nThe bank kept its credit cost guidance of 220-260 basis points for the full year to March, versus 282 basis points in the previous year. Its provision coverage ratio improved to 66 percent at end-December, from 60 percent three months earlier.\nThe bank has 60.74 billion rupees tied up in loans to companies that have been ordered by India’s central bank to be taken to bankruptcy court, Axis said, adding it had set aside funds to cover 68 percent of those loans.\nAxis shares rose to 621.75 rupees, their highest since September 2016, before trading at 614.80 rupees at 0936 GMT, versus the wider market which was up 0.71 percent.
