    "text": "PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced that on January 22, 2018 it closed the previously announced underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock, which included shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,500,000 additional shares. The offering was priced at $5.25 per share, and the company received gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the company. Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. acted as bookrunning managers for the offering, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as passive joint bookrunner for the offering and Chardan and B. Riley FBR, Inc. acted as co-managers for the offering.\nAbout Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowheadâ€™s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act:\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
