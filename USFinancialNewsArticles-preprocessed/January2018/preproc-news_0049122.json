It was last trading at minus 0.01 percent.\nU.S. Treasury yields also rose, continuing a move to multi-year highs after strong growth figures posted on Friday.\n“The Knot comments are a factor behind the sell-off in bonds today,” said DZ Bank rates strategist Andy Cossor. “There’s also the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries.”\nHelped by rising bond yields, the dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies, rising a quarter of a percent to 89.30 after scoring six consecutive weeks of losses.\nConflicting signals from top U.S. officials last week did little to discourage bearish positions, with net short dollar bets increasing to their highest level since October, according to latest positioning data.\nDespite Monday’s rise the dollar is set to post its biggest monthly decline since March 2016.\nThe currency’s decline has been a boon for many commodities, with gold making a 17-month top last week and last trading at $1,346 an ounce.\nOil prices dipped on Monday but remained just off their highest level in three years.\nBrent crude futures were holding atop $70 at $70.28 a barrel. U.S. crude futures were up 23 cents at $66.23.
