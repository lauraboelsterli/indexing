    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 5:53 PM / in 3 hours Teens get probation for livestreaming of Chicago sex assault Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Two teenage boys who pleaded guilty in the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl that was streamed live on Facebook have been sentenced to five years of probation, Chicago prosecutors said on Thursday. \nCook County juvenile court judge Patricia Mendoza sentenced the two 15-year-olds on Wednesday and ordered them to register as sex offenders, said Tandra Simonton, a spokeswoman for the district attorney. \nThe pair pleaded guilty to child pornography in November. They were originally charged with aggravated sexual assault and manufacturing and dissemination of child pornography. \nPolice said at the time of the attack in March that five or six males had assaulted the girl, whose family contacted authorities when she went missing. People who were watching the attack live did not call police, they said. \nReuters does not name the victims of sexual assault. Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay",
