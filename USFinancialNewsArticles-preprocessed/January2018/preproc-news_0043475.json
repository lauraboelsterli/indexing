    "text": "HONOLULU, Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:TBNK) (the “Company”), headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, the holding company parent of Territorial Savings Bank, announces that its Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend is expected to be paid on February 22, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 8, 2018.\nAllan Kitagawa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The Company continues to perform well despite the increase in income tax expense that occurred in the fourth quarter due to changes in federal tax law. Hawaii’s economy, especially the visitor industry, continues to improve. The growth in Hawaii’s economy has allowed us to increase the size of our loan portfolio and total deposits, which in turn, has increased our net interest income. Along with this growth, the Company’s strong performance has resulted in our total assets exceeding $2 billion.”\nForward-looking statements - This press release contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect,” “will,” “may” and words of similar meaning.
