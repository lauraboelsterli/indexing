He is most proud of this research and the studies he has done on Computational Fluid Dynamics and the treatment of Aortic Dissections. Dr. Calcaterra recently took part in a data study done with the use of Baxter’s FLOSEAL, a cost-effective tool for controlling bleeding during cardiac and spinal surgeries. His research concluded that the use of this tool may contribute to significant cost savings for hospitals. He has spent time developing a simulation model for teaching and practicing the Systematic Team-Approach to Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and captured video-atlas of a Cardiothoracic Surgical Technique in collaboration with the Miami Scientific Italian Community. He also worked on developing a new Classification Grading System correlating the severity of the Traumatic Aortic Injury with the characteristics of clinical presentation. He conducted an evaluation of the distribution of aortic blood flow in the true and false lumen of type B dissections using Computational Fluid Dynamics at the Minneapolis Heart Institute in collaboration with the University of Iowa’s School of Biomedical Engineering. Dr. Calcaterra has been accredited with many other advancements in medicine regarding Cardiothoracic Research and other related fields in Medicine. He has also completed several research grants and fellowships for a number of clinical practices and universities.\nDr. Calcaterra has also authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed articles on different procedures that pertain to various conditions of the heart.
