This filing relates to a proposed business combination between AHPAC and Envigo.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis filing includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “will,” “intend,” “seek,” “target,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “plan,” “outlook,” and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward looking statements include estimated financial information. Such forward looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the businesses of AHPAC, Envigo or the combined company after completion of the business combination are based on current expectations that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement and the proposed business combination contemplated therein; (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of AHPAC or other conditions to closing in the transaction agreement; (3) the ability to meet applicable listing standards following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement; (4) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Envigo as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement; (5) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its management and key employees; (6) costs related to the proposed business combination; (7) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (8) the possibility that Envigo may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (9) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the final prospectus of AHPAC, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and other documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by AHPAC. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only",
