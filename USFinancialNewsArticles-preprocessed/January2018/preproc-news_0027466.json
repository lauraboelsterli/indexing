Slideshow (2 Images) \nHe is also accused of making a bomb using the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide (TATP) - known as “the mother of Satan” - or another explosive substance. \nFlames engulfed the carriage but no-one was seriously hurt in what authorities said was Britain’s fifth major attack of 2017. \nThe two week trial is due to start on March 5.
