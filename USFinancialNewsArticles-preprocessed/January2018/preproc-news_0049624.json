Among the decliners, Barrick Gold shed 1.5 percent to C$17.93. \n* Cannabis company Aphria Inc fell 4.5 percent to C$19.25 after it said it would buy Nuuvera Inc for C$826 million ($670 million) to expand globally. Shares of Nuuvera jumped 12 percent to C$7.84. nL4N1PO42M] \n* The TSX posted five new 52-week highs and two new lows. Across all Canadian issues, there were 45 new 52-week highs and 27 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Torex Gold Resources, which rose 18.7 percent, while the largest decliner was Canopy Growth Co, down 4.5 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume, Bombardier was up 4.8 percent at $3.71 after a U.S. trade commission on Friday backed the Canadian plane maker in a trade dispute with Boeing. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 45.54 million shares.
