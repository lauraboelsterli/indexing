    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average edged up on Friday morning, with exporters supported by both the dollar regaining strength and a rise in U.S. stocks overnight, while Fujitsu soared after revealing talks to sell its mobile phone business.\nThe Nikkei gained 0.1 percent to 23,700.32 in midmorning trade. For the week, the Nikkei has fallen 0.4 percent.\nThe dollar rose 0.2 percent to 109.71 yen, having bounced from a four-month low of 108.50 yen struck on Thursday.\nFujitsu Ltd surged more than 2 percent after it said on Friday it was in talks about selling its mobile phone business to investment fund Polaris Capital Group, a deal that local media reported could fetch up to around 50 billion yen ($456 million).\nDrugmakers gained ground, with Takeda Pharmaceutical rising 1.5 percent and Eisai Co advancing 0.5 percent.\nHowever, exporters were mixed, with Nissan Motor rising 1.3 percent, Subaru Corp adding 0.7 percent, Olympus Corp advancing 1.5 percent, but Advantest Corp fell 3.4 percent.\nThe broader Topix added 0.1 percent to 1,886.85.
