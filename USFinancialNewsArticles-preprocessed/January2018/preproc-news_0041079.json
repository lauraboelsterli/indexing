    "text": "(Reuters) - Twitter Inc is working on a Snapchat-style tool that makes it simpler for users to post videos on its app, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe social media company already has a working demo of the camera-centered product, Bloomberg reported, citing people who have seen it. ( bloom.bg/2FdEktm )\nHowever, the design as well as the timing of the productâ€™s launch has not been settled upon and the tool could go through significant changes over the next few months, according to Bloomberg.\nTwitter declined to comment on the report.\nShares of the San Francisco-based company were up about 1 percent in early trading.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
