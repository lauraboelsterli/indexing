    "text": " 27 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Incumbent Anastasiades leads Cyprus vote, followed by left-wing candidate - exit poll Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nATHENS (Reuters) - Incumbent Nicos Anastasiades was leading Cyprus’s presidential election on Sunday, exit polls showed, but is likely to fall short of an outright majority and face a run-off on Feb. 4. \nAn exit poll for public broadcaster CyBC put Anastasiades in the lead with between 38 percent and 42 percent of the vote, followed by left-wing independent Stavros Malas on 27-31 percent. \nCentrist Nikolas Papadopoulos was seen taking between 21.5 percent and 24.5 percent of the vote. The poll was based on an 80 percent sample. \nOther stations gave a mixed picture, suggesting the vote was too close to call. \nThe two leading candidates to emerge from Sunday’s election will have to seek support from the seven other candidates ahead of the Feb. 4 run-off vote.
