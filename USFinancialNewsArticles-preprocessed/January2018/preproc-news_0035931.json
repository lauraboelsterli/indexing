    "text": "MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Spain’s Supreme Court on Monday rejected the state prosecutor’s demand to reactivate a European arrest warrant for former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont.\nPuigdemont, who is in Denmark on Monday to give a speech, potentially faces decades of jail in Spain for leading Catalonia’s independence drive.\nThe decision to reactivate the arrest warrant was postponed until the Catalan parliament is restored to normal activity, the court said in a statement.
