    "text": "LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) -\n* Nigerian state oil company NNPC cancelled a tender it issued last week to buy up to 1.55 million tonnes of gasoline from January to April, sources said on Monday\n* The company was seeking 42 cargoes of gasoline, each 37,000 tonnes, on top of the volumes NNPC is taking via ongoing crude-for-product swap contracts\n* Sources said it cancelled the tender after gasoline prices spiked on the news that it was looking to purchase the relatively substantial volume of fuel\n* But Nigeria, in the midst of fuel queues, is still likely to increase gasoline imports in coming weeks, sources said (Reporting By Libby George and Ron Bousso)\n ",
