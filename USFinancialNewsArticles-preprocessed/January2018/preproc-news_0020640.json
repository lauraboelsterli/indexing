If it's going to be bought out, it's probably going to be [for] less than a billion.\"\nHelmerich & Payne : \"Oh, I like Helmerich & Payne. Everyone laughed when they upped the dividend except for them. They are well-run.\"\nService Corp. Intl vs. Carriage Services : \"Service is the one that everyone knows and I think is a good company. The other one, Carriage, is not that well-known. I'd say stick with Service.\"\nSTMicroelectronics : \"I like that stock very much. Now, let's remember, that group has gotten hot again and we're starting to circle back. We want to be careful because ASML , [which] reports later this week, could impact that stock.\"\nEnergous Corp. : \"No, man. This thing is way too speculative for me. Sell, sell, sell. Maybe something works out, but I'll just hurt people if I say, 'Good,' and it goes up, great. But I could hurt people. I'm not going to hurt people.\"\nUniversal Display : \"We're having pullbacks in these high-multiple, high-growth stocks, so now you have to wait for the pullback in OLED. It's had a big move. We can wait for a pullback. We do not need to just plunge in. There's nothing today that is moving it.\"\nThe Carlyle Group : \"I think Carlyle's good. I actually like Blackstone more.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: GoPro won't be bought for more than $1B      20 Hours Ago | 03:46  ",
