    "text": "WINCHESTER, Va., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ: AMWD) (\"American Woodmark\") today announced that it intends to offer $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the \"Notes\") in a private offering, subject to market and other customary conditions. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of American Woodmark's existing domestic subsidiaries. The interest rate, offering price and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering.\nOn January 25, 2018, RSI Home Products, Inc. (\"RSI\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Woodmark, gave notice that it has elected to conditionally redeem 20% (the \"Conditional Redemption\"), or $115 million in principal amount, of the $575 million outstanding principal amount of its 6½% senior secured second lien notes due 2023 (the \"RSI Notes\"). American Woodmark intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, together with the proceeds from borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities and cash on hand, to pay the redemption price for the Conditional Redemption and to finance the purchase of the RSI Notes not subject to the Conditional Redemption pursuant to a cash tender offer and consent solicitation by RSI announced today (and for the redemption of any RSI Notes not so purchased), along with related fees and expenses.\nThe Notes are being offered solely to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. No assurance can be given that the offering of the Notes will be completed, or, if completed, as to the terms on which it is completed.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which, or to any person to whom, such an offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.\nThe tender offer is made only by, and pursuant to, the terms and conditions of an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated January 29, 2018, and a related Letter of Transmittal and Consent.\nIn addition, this press release does not constitute a notice of redemption or an obligation to issue a notice of redemption.\nAbout American Woodmark Corporation:\nAmerican Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes bath, kitchen and home organization products for the remodeling and new home construction markets. Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and through a network of independent distributors.
