    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 10:07 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago UPDATE 1-EU competition chief to hold news conference at 1030 GMT Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Adds Qualcomm background) \nBRUSSELS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will hold a news conference at 1130 CET (1030 GMT) on Wednesday on a case involving anti-competitive practices. \nThe Commission, which announced the news conference in a statement, did not give further details. \nEU antitrust regulators are expected to impose a multi-million euro fine on Qualcomm Inc for paying Apple Inc to use only its chips, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. \nThe European Commission accused the company of the anti-competitive behaviour in 2015. The fine could in theory go as high as 10 percent of Qualcommâ€™s annual revenue, which was $22.2 billion for its most recent fiscal year.
