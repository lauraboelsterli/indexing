Wonder no longer. \n‚ÄúIt was a lovely frame,‚Äù Obama told DeGeneres. Obama went into further detail about meeting, hinting it might have been more awkward than it looked. (Even after how now-President Donald Trump went up to greet the Obamas , leaving Melania behind to walk up by herself while carrying the gift box.) Obama described the meeting between the outgoing and incoming First Families as similar to a state visit, with a number of protocols to follow‚Äîbut it seems there wasn‚Äôt much prep for a gift exchange. \nObama‚Äôs interview on Ellen will air on Thursday.
