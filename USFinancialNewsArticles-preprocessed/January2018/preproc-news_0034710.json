It happened here. But I‘m still young, so I’ve got time.” \nThe level of tennis produced in the first three sets was so high it looked like a future grand slam final.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter \n“He’s 50-whatever in the world. But this was a top-10 level match from the start till the end of the fourth set, and for him until the end,” Zverev said. \n“When he plays like that, there are very, very few people who will beat him.” \nThere was nothing between the players in the first set until Zverev piled on the pressure in the 12th game with a couple of rasping baseline winners before prevailing in a 26-stroke rally that ended with a Chung error. Slideshow (7 Images) \nNo quarter was give in the second set but Chung, who beat Zverev’s brother Mischa in the first round after he retired ill, leveled with five successive winning points in the tiebreak. \nZverev found another gear to break twice in the third but the unflappable Chung was far from finished, and broke early in the third set, before consolidated it to lead 3-0. \nThe first sign that Zverev was beginning to unravel came when he berated the umpire for the fact that the lights were not switched on, despite it being only around 6 p.m. -- at least two hours before dusk in Melbourne. \n“I can’t see anything,” Zverev barked. “All you have to do is flick the switch.” \nThe lights did eventually come on but they were soon turned off for Zverev as he double-faulted to gift Chung a break in the first game of the deciding set. \nWhen Zverev looped a forehand into the net two games later to concede a second break, his racket paid the price, ending up in a crumpled heap next to his chair. \nChung barely changed his expression, quickly sealing his first victory over a top-five opponent to move ominously through to the last 16, where he will play six-times champion Novak Djokovic or Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
