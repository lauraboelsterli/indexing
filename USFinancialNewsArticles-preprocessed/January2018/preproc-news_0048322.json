    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD), the specialist in fiber management and connectivity platforms for communications providers, reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Q1 2018 Financial Summary (GAAP) (in millions except per share data and percentages) Q1 2018 vs. Q1 2017 Change Change (%) Revenue $ 16.9 $ 18.3 $ (1.4 ) -8 % Gross Profit ($) $ 7.1 $ 7.2 $ (0.1 ) -1 % Gross Profit (%) 42.1 % 39.5 % 2.6 % Income from Operations $ 0.6 $ 1.2 $ (0.6 ) -46 % Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (0.2 ) $ 0.4 $ (0.6 ) -155 % Net Income $ 0.94 $ 0.88 $ 0.06 8 % Net Income per Diluted Share $ 0.07 $ 0.06 $ 0.01 17 % “Our fiscal Q1 revenue results came in largely as we expected, but were negatively affected by spending disruptions in the marketplace,” said Clearfield CEO, Cheri Beranek.\n“Our core wireline business is performing well. We’re continuing to exert our dominance in this space and expand our market share. Yet, M&A activity, especially at our primary Tier 1 customer, has distracted service providers from currently expanding their network deployments. In addition, an increasing focus toward emerging technologies, such as 5G, has delayed construction among wireless providers as they plan for the convergence of their wireline and wireless networks. These trends impacted our revenue during the quarter, which was down 8% year-over-year.\n“Although it’s been difficult to predict when these distractions will clear, we are seeing signs that indicate we are potentially at the tail-end of this process. Specifically, we expect the M&A integration of our Tier 1 customer to wrap up in the second half of the fiscal year. We also expect wireless providers to begin rolling out their 5G deployments in the summer of 2018.\n“We continue to invest in growing our business with an increase in sales expense of 11% year-over-year. In the first quarter, expenses associated with the defense of the patent infringement lawsuit that began in second quarter of last year increased our SG&A expense and unfortunately masked otherwise positive gains in operating income and earnings per share for the quarter. Expenses associated with the litigation negatively impacted net income by approximately $400,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2018.\n“Clearfield continues to build upon our strong foundation. This quarter we increased our cash position by an additional $2 million. As we celebrate our 10th anniversary as an organization and the shipment of our 20 millionth fiber port, we are positioned with the product, channel and financial strength to reach our full potential.”\nFiscal Q1 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 8% to $16.9 million from $18.3 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales to the Company’s Tier 1 wireline and wireless customers, and was partially offset by an increase in sales to the Company’s cable TV and domestic core wireline customers.\nGross profit decreased 1% to $7.1 million, 42.1% of revenue, from $7.2 million, or 39.5% of revenue, in the fiscal first quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross profit was due to decreased volume while the increase in gross profit percent for the quarter was due to a change in product mix.\nOperating expenses were $6.5 million, an increase of 7% compared to $6.0 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased legal expenses over the same year-ago quarter.\nIncome from operations decreased 46% to $644,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $1.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. Income tax expense decreased 155% from an expense of $367,000 in the first quarter of 2017 to a benefit of $203,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, including a one-time benefit of $384,000 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Net income increased 8% to $943,000, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $877,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Earnings per share of $0.07 was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per diluted share due to increased SG&A expense associated with the defense of the patent infringement litigation and positively impacted by $0.03 per diluted share due to a one-time income tax benefit resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and investments increased 4% to $46.2 million from $44.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. The Company had no debt at quarter end. In addition, during the quarter, the Company repurchased 900 shares under the stock repurchase program.\nOrder backlog (defined as purchase orders received but not yet fulfilled) at December 31, 2017 decreased 40% to $2.4 million from $4.0 million at September 30, 2017, and decreased 34% from $3.6 million at December 31, 2016.\nFiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\nClearfield expects its fiscal Q2 revenue to be flat compared to the same year-ago quarter. The Company is also updating its revenue outlook for fiscal 2018. The Company now expects that revenue for the first half of fiscal 2018 will be down approximately 5% compared to the first half of fiscal 2017, but the company is not changing its previously issued guidance for full year fiscal 2018 of 5% total revenue growth.\nIn addition, the Company continues to expect gross profit percent to remain within its target range of 40% to 42%, with some variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nDue to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation which has lowered the corporate tax rate, for fiscal 2018, Clearfield now expects net income as a percentage of revenue of 5.5%, with quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to costs related to the CommScope litigation. Net income for the second quarter 2018 is expected to be approximately $500,000, or 3% as a percentage of revenue.\nLonger term, the Company expects to return to double-digit revenue growth, as the overall market regains stability.\nConference Call\nClearfield management will hold a conference call today, January 25, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\nClearfield’s President and CEO Cheri Beranek and CFO Dan Herzog will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Thursday, January 25, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (4:00 p.m. Central time)\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-0792\nInternational dial-in: 1-201-689-8263\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here .\nPlease call the conference telephone number 10 minutes prior to the start time.

These statements are based upon the Company's current expectations and judgments about future developments in the Company's business. Certain important factors could have a material impact on the Company's performance, including, without limitation: our success depends upon adequate protection of our patent and intellectual property rights and our ability to successfully defend against claims of infringement; our results of operations could be adversely affected now that the stimulus funds of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are fully allocated and projections are nearing completion; National Broadband Plan’s transitioning from the USF to the CAF program may cause our customers and prospective customers to delay or reduce purchases; a significant percentage of our sales in the last three fiscal years have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of these major customers would adversely affect us; intense competition in our industry may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share; our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses; our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which may make budgeting for expenses difficult and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock; to compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance; we may face circumstances in the future that will result in impairment charges, including, but not limited to, significant goodwill impairment charges; we rely on single-source suppliers, which could cause delays, increases in costs or prevent us from completing customer orders, all of which could materially harm our business; we face risks associated with expanding our sales outside of the United States; further consolidation among our customers may result in the loss of some customers and may reduce sales during the pendency of business combinations and related integration activities; we are dependent on key personnel; product defects or the failure of our products to meet specifications could cause us to lose customers and sales or to incur unexpected expenses; and other factors set forth in Part I, Item IA.
