    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s central bank lifted the interest rate on 63-day reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, used for open market operations by 5 basis points on Tuesday, bringing it in line with other interbank rates adjusted in mid-December.\nIt’s the first time the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has deployed the 63-day reverse repo to inject cash into the financial system since Nov. 30. The new rate was 2.95 percent, the PBOC said.\nOn Tuesday, the central bank injected 320 billion yuan ($49.69 billion) into money markets through 7-day, 14-day and 63-day reverse repos.\nThe PBOC nudged money market interest rates upward in December just hours after the Federal Reserve raised the U.S. benchmark.\nThe Chinese central bank has kept a tight leash on liquidity and rates via open market operations. Analysts say it has had a slight tightening bias as it has sought to discourage short-term borrowing as part of the government’s deleveraging campaign and keep China competitive during a U.S. rate tightening cycle.\n($1 = 6.4404 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
