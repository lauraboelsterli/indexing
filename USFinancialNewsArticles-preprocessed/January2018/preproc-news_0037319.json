Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, in conjunction with Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, was criticized by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders from the White House briefing room on Tuesday. \nThe bill doesn’t meet benchmarks set by Trump, Sanders said, which include border-security funding and an end to the visa lottery program and family-based immigration in exchange for permanently shielding from deportation young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \nHer remarks were in keeping with past statements from the White House on the issue, but took on increased significance Tuesday as lawmakers take up the immigration issue again in the wake of the brief government shutdown. Sanders had said Monday that Trump would follow through on a promise to work on immigration policy after Republicans and Democrats reached a deal to reopen federal agencies.",
