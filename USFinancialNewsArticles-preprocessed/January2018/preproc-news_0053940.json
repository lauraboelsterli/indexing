    "text": "BERLIN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Volkswagen has offered to raise wages for workers at western German facilities in two steps by 3.5 percent and another 2 percent, it said on Tuesday.\nThe German carmaker has proposed a 30-month wage contract for about 120,000 staff, with the two-step salary increase starting in May, it said in a written statement published after talks with the IG Metall labour union.\nThe offer also includes a significant improvement in the carmaker’s pension scheme.\n“Volkswagen needs a wage agreement with a sense of proportion,” chief wage negotiator Martin Rosik said.
