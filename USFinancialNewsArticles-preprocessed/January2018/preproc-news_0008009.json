(Sawai) successfully completed the sale of a 20 percent stake in Sawai America, LLC (SAL) to Sumitomo Corporation of Americas (SCOA), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading general trading houses. SAL is a subsidiary of Sawai and is owned by Sawai America Holdings Inc.\nAs previously announced, Sumitomo's investment in Sawai's US subsidiary and its management participation in Upsher-Smith will allow the company to benefit from its experience, knowledge and network in the global business arena in areas such as sourcing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and product introductions.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, SCOA acquired the stake for $211 million.\nAbout Upsher-Smith\nUpsher-Smith Laboratories, LLC is a trusted U.S. pharmaceutical company that has strived to deliver quality, affordable generic medications for nearly a century. In June 2017, Upsher-Smith was acquired by Sawai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a large publicly traded generics company in Japan that had been seeking entry into the U.S. market. Upsher-Smith and Sawai share a strikingly similar family history and hold many of the same cherished goals and valuesâ€” most importantly, the philosophy of always putting patients first. Upsher-Smith will continue to do those things it does best, which is provide a consistent supply of quality, affordable medications and invest in its historically strong industry relationships. Ultimately, Upsher-Smith believes the acquisition by Sawai represents a tremendous opportunity to leverage each company for growth worldwide and embark together on an exciting new chapter in generics.
