Scharf says an investigation into Martins’s conduct continues Getty Images New York City Ballet Master-in-chief Peter Martins, associated with the company for more than 40 years, is shown in 2010. \nBy Charles Passy Reporter \nJust weeks after taking a leave of absence from his post as ballet master-in-chief at the New York City Ballet, Peter Martins announced his retirement on Monday, according to the company. \nMartins, 71 years old, has been in the spotlight this past month as accusations of sexual harassment or physical mistreatment involving him have surfaced. He has been associated with the New York City Ballet for more than 40 years—first as a dancer, then as an artistic leader. \nMartins has also served as artistic director of the School of American Ballet. He is similarly retiring from his role at the school. \nIn his letter of resignation to the boards of both the company and the school, Martins said he denies that he “engaged in any such misconduct,” but that he wanted to “bring an end to this disruption which has enveloped the Ballet and the School.” ",
