For the past two years, Burns has been Validant's President of Client Services, personally leading the company's Medical Device Portfolio with oversight of the entire client portfolio. In his new role, Burns will further develop Validant's service offerings for clients and will expand the company's global reach. Burns' appointment was effective January 4, 2018.\nBurns succeeds Brian Healy, who founded Validant in 2005. Under Healy's leadership, Validant established a top-tier client base and a highly effective service model leveraging the best of professional services and consulting.

Both Rhoades and McShane bring deep industry knowledge, and unmatched leadership and problem-solving acumen to Validant's organization and clients.\nPrior to joining Validant in January 2016, Burns, 53, spent 30 years in the Medical Industry. He served as an Executive Vice President of Global Quality and Regulatory Affairs at Haemonetics Corporation and Fresenius Medical Care, and as Executive Vice President of Global Quality, Medical Safety & Regulatory Affairs at Boston Scientific Corporation.
