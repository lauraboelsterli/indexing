    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (“The ONE Group”) (NASDAQ: STKS) today announced preliminary unaudited sales for the fourth quarter of 2017, which ended December 31, 2017.\nPreliminary sales highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nTotal revenues are expected to be approximately $21.0 million, compared to $20.4 million, an approximate 3.0% increase, for the same quarter last year. Comparable sales * are expected to have increased approximately 9.5% compared to the same quarter last year, including an approximate 6.0% increase in US comparable store sales and an approximate 15.5% increase in international comparable store sales.\n*Comparable sales or same store sales (\"SSS\"), represents total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units opened for a full 18-month period. This metric includes total revenue from our US owned and managed STK locations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to comparable sales at our international managed locations (measured in constant currency), and excludes revenues where we do not directly control the event sales force (Royalton, NY and Westwood, CA).\nManny Hilario, President and CEO of The ONE Group stated, \"We are pleased with our preliminary sales results for 2017 as we continue to make progress on the four-point strategy we launched at the beginning of the year. This is evident by the notable improvement in profits for the first three quarters as well as our increased comparable store sales, the improvement in our event business, and stronger gift card sales. We will continue this focus into 2018 while we implement other important initiatives to further increase sales and continue the improvement in our performance.”\nMr. Hilario continued, “We continue to see strong interest in STK and in our hospitality program globally, and our worldwide development pipeline for 2018 remains strong as we continue to focus on our asset-light business strategy.”\nPreliminary results remain subject to the completion of normal quarter-end accounting procedures and adjustments and are subject to change. The Company currently expects to release financial and operating results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in March 2018.\nAbout The ONE Group\nThe ONE Group (NASDAQ:STKS) is a global hospitality company that develops and operates upscale, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides hospitality management services for hotels, casinos and other high-end venues both nationally and internationally.
