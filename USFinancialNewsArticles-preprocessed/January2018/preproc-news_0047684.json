As an avid student of politics, I enjoy advising executives across our divisions on the occasionally mysterious ways of Washington.\"\nScolese earned a bachelor of arts in history and German from the State University of New York and a master of arts degree in history from Brown University. He is a former president of the John Carroll Society of the Archdiocese of Washington.\nAbout Cox Enterprises:\nCox Enterprises is a leading communications, media and automotive services company.
