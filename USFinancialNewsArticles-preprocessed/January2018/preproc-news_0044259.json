    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 11:15 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Elton John says quitting touring after one last world tour in 2018 Alicia Powell 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - British pop musician Elton John said on Wednesday he is quitting touring after nearly 50 years, but will perform one last world tour starting in September 2018. \nThe 70-year-old singer, one of the best-selling recording artists in the world, told a news conference in New York that his priorities have changed after becoming a parent to two children with his husband David Furnish. \n“I love them so much. I don’t want to miss them and I don’t want them to miss me,” he said. “I’ve had a good run.” \nHe said the tour would last about three years and take him all around the world.
