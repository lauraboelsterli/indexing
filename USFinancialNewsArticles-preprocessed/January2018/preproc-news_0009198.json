(TSX: CJR.B) announced its first quarter financial results today.\n\"Our first quarter results were below expectations, as gains in local Radio advertising and our Nelvana content business combined with better than expected subscriber revenues were more than offset by weak television advertising market conditions\", said Doug Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We remain committed to advancing our strategic priorities as Canada's only pure play media and content company. Our ongoing financial discipline balanced with strategic growth investments in content and advanced advertising initiatives position us well over the longer term in a rapidly evolving media and content marketplace.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended\nNovember 30,\n(in thousands of Canadian dollars except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\nTelevision\n415,464\n425,564\nRadio\n41,924\n42,417\n457,388\n467,981\nSegment profit (1)\nTelevision\n168,602\n184,421\nRadio\n13,521\n13,286\nCorporate\n(4,236)\n(5,721)\n177,887\n191,986\nNet income attributable to shareholders\n77,673\n71,146\nAdjusted net income attributable to shareholders (1) (2)\n78,885\n80,826\nBasic earnings per share\n$0.38\n$0.36\nAdjusted basic earnings per share (1) (2)\n$0.38\n$0.41\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.38\n$0.36\nFree cash flow (1)\n83,215\n33,909\n(1)\nSegment profit, segment profit margin, adjusted net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted basic earnings per share, and free cash flow do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS.

More information can be found on the Corus Entertainment website at www.corusent.com in the Investor Relations section.\nUse of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the non-IFRS financial measures of adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share and free cash flow that are not in accordance with, nor an alternate to, generally accepted accounting principles (\"IFRS\") and may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-IFRS measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nNon-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company's reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. The non-IFRS financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, IFRS financial results. A reconciliation of the Company's non-IFRS measures is included in the Company's most recent Report to Shareholders which is available on Corus' website at www.corusent.com as well as on SEDAR.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking information and should be read subject to the following cautionary language:\nTo the extent any statements made in this report contain information that is not historical, these statements are forward-looking statements and may be forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws (collectively, \"forward-looking information\"). These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, our objectives, goals, strategies, intentions, plans, estimates and outlook, including advertising, distribution, merchandise and subscription revenues, operating costs and tariff",
