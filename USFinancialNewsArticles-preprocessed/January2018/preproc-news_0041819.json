The venture capital firm operates from offices in London, Berlin and Silicon Valley. \nThe two founders told Reuters in a phone interview that they will stick with their strategy of seed and early-stage rounds in areas such as online marketplaces, software as a service, fintech, digital health and mobile apps for consumers. \nThe latest fund, its fourth, will focus on Germany, Britain, the Nordics and France, as well as tech centres on both coasts of the United States. With $500 million in assets under management, it is one of Europe’s larger early-stage funds. \nIts third fund, which closed in 2014, was among the top 10 performers in Europe and North America among funds raised earlier this decade with a net internal rate of return of 62 percent according to Prequin Alternative Assets figures. \nDN invested $1 million in Shazam in 2004 for a 15 percent stake in the company, which provided it with a return 21 times its initial investment after Apple’s acquisition. \nA follow-on investment in 2014 made a positive, but far lower return, partners Partner Nenad Marovac and Steve Schlenker told Reuters. \nDN remains an investor in German-based, pan European used car marketplace Auto1, having sold just one-third of its investment stake to Softbank, which nonetheless yields its biggest ever payout to investors in its history, they said. $1 = 0.8059 euros Reporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Susan Fenton",
