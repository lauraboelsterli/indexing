    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 2:02 PM / Updated 7 hours ago Airbus in talks to sell at least 100 jets to China - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus ( AIR.PA ) is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Beijing next week, people familiar with the negotiations said. FILE PHOTO - The logo of Airbus Group is seen on the company's headquarters building in Toulouse, Southwestern France, April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \nMacron plans to visit on January 8-10, accompanied by 50 company executives including planemaking officials from Airbus. \nThe value of a deal for around 100 aircraft would be over $10 billion (£7.37 billion) at list prices, but could rise sharply depending on the breakdown between single-aisle and wide-body jets. \nThe total number of aircraft has yet to be agreed and has historically depended on last-minute commercial negotiations that coincide with such diplomatic visits. \nChina’s central purchasing agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, did not respond to a request for comment. \nA spokeswoman for Airbus in China said: “Discussions with customers are always going on, but we do not comment on speculation.” \nIn November, Boeing ( BA.N ) agreed to sell 300 planes worth $37 billion at list prices to China during a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump.
