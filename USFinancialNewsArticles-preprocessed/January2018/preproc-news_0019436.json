    "text": "Julius Randle recorded 23 points and 15 rebounds and Jordan Clarkson scored five of his 19 points in overtime as the Los Angeles Lakers stretched their season-best winning streak to four games with a 107-101 road victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday.\nKyle Kuzma scored 18 points and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope tallied 17 for the Lakers. Kuzma also collected 10 rebounds as Los Angeles held a 59-39 edge on the boards.\nDennis Smith Jr. scored 17 of his 23 points in the first half for Dallas. Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews added 17 points apiece and Dwight Powell scored 13 on 6-of-7 shooting for the Mavericks, who had a modest two-game winning streak snapped.\nClarkson drained a 3-pointer for the first points of overtime. He later added a jumper to make it 104-99 with two minutes left, and Dallas managed only two free throws the rest of the way.\nLos Angeles used a strong fourth-quarter push to force overtime. The Lakers posted a 7-0 run to hold a 92-87 edge with 1:25 remaining in regulation as Caldwell-Pope began the spurt with a go-ahead 3-pointer and Clarkson and Randle added baskets to make it 92-87.\nConsecutive baskets by Barnes and Smith pushed Dallas within 94-93 with 14 seconds left. After Caldwell-Pope split two free throws, Barnes’ hoop knotted the score at 95 with 5.9 seconds remaining, and Los Angeles’ Lonzo Ball missed a jumper just prior to the buzzer.\nLakers forward Brandon Ingram exited in the second quarter due to a sprained left ankle.\nDallas began a 10-0 run in the final minute of the third quarter and took an 80-70 lead on Dirk Nowitzki’s 3-pointer with 9:32 to play. The Lakers answered with a 15-3 burst and took the lead on a Kuzma shot with 4:40 remaining before a free throw by Randle made it 85-83 with 3:59 to play.\nRandle scored 10 first-quarter points as the Lakers jumped out to a 31-20 lead.\nLos Angeles led by six with just over five minutes left in the second quarter before the Mavericks erupted with 15 straight points. Smith scored seven points during the surge and Ferrell capped it with a 3-pointer to give Dallas a 52-43 lead with 2:13 to play.\nThe Mavericks took a 52-46 lead into the break.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
