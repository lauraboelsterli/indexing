    "text": "LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Five banks have lined up approximately €7bn-equivalent of debt financing that will be offered to buyers in a potential sale of Akzo Nobel’s chemicals business, banking sources said.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natwest and Societe Generale are offering a staple financing to potential buyers that equates to 6.25 times the division’s approximate €1bn Ebitda, the sources said.\nThe staple financing comprises just over €6bn-equivalent of funded debt and around €1bn of undrawn facilities, the sources said.\nThe funded debt includes a combination of senior leveraged loans and subordinated high-yield bonds, denominated in both euros and dollars, in a bid to maximise access to liquidity, the sources added.\nA divestment of the unit is part of an effort to placate investors after the Dutch paintmaker rejected a takeover offer from rival PPG Industries last year.\nThe sale has attracted a lot of interest from private equity and strategic buyers and final bids are due by March 23, the sources said.\nA spokesperson for Akzo said the process was ongoing and the company planned to either sell or seek a separate stock market listing for the division by mid-April. They also said there were three to four interested bidders.\nAt 6.25 times, the staple financing is competitive, several sources said.\nIt follows a 7.0 times staple being offered by JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley to back a potential sale of French drug maker Sanofi’s European generic drug business, known as Zentiva.\nStaple financings give potential buyers comfort they can finance a bid, they have however been traditionally seen as something to beat by other non-staple banks.\n“Staples are usually seen as a first stab and open to competition for more aggression from other banks,” a syndicate head said.\nHowever, at 6.25 times and 7.0 times, the staples being offered on Akzo’s and Sanofi’s divisions are highly viable financing options, the sources said.\nChemicals account for a third of Akzo’s sales and earnings and its value is estimated at roughly €9bn.
