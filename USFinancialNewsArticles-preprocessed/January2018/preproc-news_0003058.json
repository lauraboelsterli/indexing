    "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that the United States has \"foolishly\" handed Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years while getting nothing in return and pledged to put a stop to it.\n\"They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.\"\nTrump tweet \nIt was not immediately clear what prompted Trumps criticism of Pakistan but he has long complained that Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants.\nThe New York Times reported on Dec. 29 that the Trump administration was \"strongly considering\" whether to withhold $255 million in aid to Pakistan.\nIt said U.S. officials had sought but been denied access to a member of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network captured in Pakistan who potentially could provide information about at least one American hostage.\nThe Trump administration said in August that it was delaying sending the $255 million in aid to Pakistan. Last month, Trump said in a speech the U.S. government makes \"massive payments every year to Pakistan. They have to help.\" Pakistan counters that it has launched military operations to push out militants from its soil and that 17,000 Pakistanis have died fighting militants or in bombings and other attacks since 2001.\nThe top U.S. general in Afghanistan, John Nicholson, said in November that he had not seen a change in Pakistans behavior toward militants, despite the Trump administrations tougher line against Islamabad.",
