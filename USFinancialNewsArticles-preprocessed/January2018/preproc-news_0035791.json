The stock fell below $16 for the first time since 2011, extending a losing streak from last week.\nDefense stocks such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies dropped between 0.6 percent and 1.1 percent, sending the Dow Jones U.S. Defense sector index down 0.7 percent.\nBoosting the Nasdaq was a clutch of biotech deals, with the biotech index up about 2.3 percent.\nShares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ soared 63 percent after French healthcare group Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion.\nJuno Therapeutics rose about 27 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash.\nInsurer AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings for $5.56 billion. Validus surged 45 percent.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.1 percent gain in the energy index and 0.9 percent rise in utilities index.\nHalliburton Co rose 4.2 percent after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production.\nShares of Netflix Inc, a major contributor to the recent stock rally, were up about nearly 3 percent ahead of its quarterly results after market closes.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,498 to 1,258. On the Nasdaq, 1,401 issues fell and 1,380 advanced. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
