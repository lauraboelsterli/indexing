    "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCBS) (\"Nicolet\") announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $9.1 million and earnings per diluted common share of $0.88, compared to $9.5 million and $0.91 for third quarter 2017, and $6.1 million and $0.68 for fourth quarter 2016, respectively. Annualized quarterly return on average assets was 1.27%, 1.34% and 1.07%, for fourth quarter 2017, third quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, respectively.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $33.1 million, 80% higher than $18.5 million for 2016. Earnings per diluted common share were $3.33 for 2017, 40% higher than $2.37 for 2016. Return on average assets was 1.25% for 2017 and 0.95% for 2016.\n\"2017 was a great year no matter how you slice it. These results are directly attributable to our focus on customer service, employee attitude, and long-term values,\" said Bob Atwell, Chairman and CEO of Nicolet. \"Effective execution and integration of our recent acquisitions, combined with organic growth in support of our strategic values, led to this exceptional performance.\"\n\"We had several significant achievements during 2017, including phenomenal growth in both loans and core deposits, growing revenue streams, and effective cost management,\" Atwell said. \"We are generating consistent returns on average assets over 1%, while maintaining strong asset quality and capital.\"\nThe timing of the 2016 acquisitions (Baylake Corp. and a financial advisory business acquisition each completed in April 2016) and the April 2017 First Menasha Bancshares, Inc. acquisition impacts financial comparisons. Certain income statement results, average balances and related ratios for 2017 include full period contributions from the 2016 acquisitions plus eight months of First Menasha operations, versus eight months from the 2016 acquisitions and no contribution of First Menasha in the comparable 2016 period. Given the activity of multiple mergers, quarterly results included non-recurring other direct merger and integration pre-tax expenses of $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively, and $0.4 million, $2.1 million, $0.1 million, and $0.4 million in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016, respectively.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $9.1 million, down $0.4 million or 4% from $9.5 million for third quarter 2017, as third quarter 2017 benefited from a $1.2 million pre-tax gain ($0.7 million after tax) to record the fair value of Nicolet's pre-acquisition interest in First Menasha. On a comparable quarter basis, net income was up $3.0 million or 50% over the fourth quarter of 2016, aided largely by the inclusion of First Menasha and a lower effective tax rate.\nNet interest income increased by $0.1 million over third quarter 2017, comprised of a $0.4 million increase in interest income (partly attributable to higher earning asset volumes) and a $0.3 million increase in interest expense (driven mostly by rising rates). Between the linked quarters, noninterest income excluding net gains was down $0.2 million or 2%, with net mortgage income down $0.4 million on seasonally lower volumes, partially offset by $0.2 million higher trust and brokerage fees combined. Noninterest expense increased $1.0 million or 5%, with personnel costs up $0.6 million or 5% mainly from higher equity award and incentive costs between the quarters. Finally, the provision for loan losses decreased from $1.0 million to $0.5 million for the fourth quarter in light of the charge off of a large commercial loan during third quarter 2017.\nNet income for 2017 was $33.1 million, up $14.7 million or 80% over 2016. The increase is largely attributable to the timing of adding the acquisitions as previously noted, benefits from strong organic loan growth, higher aggregate discount accretion on purchased loans, effective cost management, and $2.5 million lower direct merger-related costs between the years. Diluted earnings per common share for 2017 was $3.33, up $0.96 or 40% over the comparable period last year, aided by strong earnings but impacted in part by an increase of approximately 30% in diluted average shares mostly due to stock consideration issued in the acquisitions.\nNonperforming assets declined to $14 million, representing 0.49% of total assets at December 31, 2017, down favorably from 0.97% at year-end 2016. For 2017, the provision for loan losses was $2.3 million compared to net charge offs of $1.5 million, with a $1.0 million commercial loan charge off in the third quarter. The allowance for loan losses was $12.7 million, representing 0.61% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.75% at year-end 2016, mainly a result of recording acquired loans at their fair value with no carryover of allowance.\nSince December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $0.6 billion or 27% to $2.9 billion, attributable largely to the acquisition of First Menasha which was approximately 20% of Nicolet's pre-merger size and the remainder to net organic growth. Excluding the impact of First Menasha, loans increased $168 million or 11% since year-end 2016, and deposits increased $126 million or 6% organically.\nTotal capital was $364 million at December 31, 2017, comprised entirely of common equity. Common equity increased $88 million since December 31, 2016, mostly due to stock issued in connection with the 2017 acquisition and net income. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Nicolet utilized $2.7 million to repurchase and cancel approximately 48,400 shares under its common stock repurchase program, bringing the 2017 full year totals to $10.0 million for approximately 188,600 shares repurchased and life-to-date cumulative totals to $24.1 million for just over 700,000 shares repurchased. There remains $5.9 million authorized under the repurchase program which Nicolet may from time to time repurchase shares in the open market or through block transactions as market conditions warrant or in private transactions as an alternative use of capital.\nThe Company adopted a new accounting standard as required effective January 1, 2017, which requires the tax impact of stock option exercises to be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense rather than to stockholders' equity directly. As a result of this accounting change and particularly large option exercises in fourth quarter 2017, income tax expense included a favorable tax benefit of $1.7 million and $1.9 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, for the tax impact of stock option exercises.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, necessitating that all companies evaluate deferred tax asset and liability positions for year-end 2017 under the lower corporate tax rate, as well as other impacts. Income tax expense included $0.9 million additional expense in fourth quarter 2017 related to the Company's current evaluation of this tax law change. If, in the future, the interpretations of the new tax law were to change, the Company's current estimates may require adjustments.\nAtwell commented, \"Policy makers have differing opinions about what to expect from tax reform. It is very clear that reform will provide an",
