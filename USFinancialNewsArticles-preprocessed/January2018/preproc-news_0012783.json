The average seven-year bond yield rose to 15.785 percent, from 15.554 percent. \nEgypt has raised its key interest rates by 700 basis points in total since November 2016 when it floated the pound currency to secure a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan aimed at reviving its economy. \nThe sharp hikes in interest rates have encouraged investors to buy Egypt’s debt.
