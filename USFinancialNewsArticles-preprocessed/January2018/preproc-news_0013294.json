With a background in finance and journalism and an advanced degree in economics and quantitative analysis, Ms. Barroso has led engagements that range from large-scale forensic accounting investigations to internal fraud investigations. She frequently consults with law firms and corporations on investigative issues related to financial fraud, such as revenue or expense falsification, corruption, and employee wrongdoing. Ms. Barroso has also coordinated projects relating to entry alternatives in Brazil, business internationalization, and regulatory assessment. She came to Kroll with more than a decade of experience working on a broad array of business transactions, such as domestic and international due diligence and business intelligence assignments. Her previous work history includes service with a Big Four accounting firm, commercial banks, private banks, private equity firms, and government departments. Ms. Barroso is a graduate of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and Saint Paul Escola de Negócios, and is a member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.

Her efforts support her clients' needs in crisis management, litigation support, and corporate contests. Prior to joining Kroll, Ms. Shanahan was an Investigator with the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).
