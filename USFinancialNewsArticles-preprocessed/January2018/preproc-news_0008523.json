He joined BlackRock in 2009 and had primary responsibility for investing, fundraising and managing its loan business. He previously worked in Lehman Brothersâ€™ leveraged capital markets group for eight years, and before that was at Bank of America. \nAlcentra said Leland will lead its 16-person investment and research team in New York and Boston. \nHe will work closely with Chris Barris, Kevin Cronk and Frank Longobardi, portfolio managers for loan, high-yield and multi-strategy funds, and report to Vijay Rajguru, co-chief investment officer. \nAlcentra said its US liquid credit platform has US$12.5bn in assets under management as of September 30.
