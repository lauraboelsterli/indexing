    "text": "Published: Jan 24, 2018 6:41 a.m. ET Share \nThe EU action is the latest in a string of bad news for Qualcomm Bloomberg News The fine follows a decision last week by the EU regulator to clear Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV with conditions. A separate EU antitrust investigation is ongoing over whether Qualcomm sold chips below cost to force a competitor, Icera Inc., out of the market. \nBy Natalia Drozdiak Ted Greenwald \nQualcomm Inc. was slapped with a €997 million ($1.23 billion) antitrust fine by the European Union on Wednesday for illegal payments it made to Apple Inc. for exclusively using its chips in smartphones and other products. \nThe EU said Qualcomm QCOM, -0.26% had abused its dominant position by paying billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 on the condition it wouldn’t buy from rivals, hindering other companies from competing in the market. \n“These payments were not just reductions in price—they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm’s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,” said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager. “This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were.” \nQualcomm can appeal the EU’s decision to the bloc’s highest courts, though the company would still have to pay the fine and change any conduct while the court case plays out, a process that can take years. \nThe EU’s move Wednesday, which follows a probe opened in 2015, fits into its broader strategy to boost and improve digital markets across the bloc’s 28 member states. As part of that project, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive, has pursued strict privacy rules, antitrust investigations and other rules in a bid to rein in the behavior of large U.S. tech companies.
