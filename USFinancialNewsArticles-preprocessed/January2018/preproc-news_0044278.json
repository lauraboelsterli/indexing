The consensus forecast from three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S was a loss of $26.3 million in 2018.\nThe airline is expected to release its 2017 earnings results next month. It reported a $222 million net loss for in the first nine months of 2017.\nGaruda estimates it will report an 11 percent rise in passenger numbers this year, up from 24 million passengers carried last year, Satriyono said.\nGaruda’s chief executive Pahala Mansury said last month the company’s international traffic declined late last year due to Bali’s Mount Agung eruption, but domestic flights had held up.\nSatriyono added that the company is planning to issue $750 million in global bonds to refinance old debt, as well as separate 2 trillion rupiah ($150.21 million) in bonds to finance operational expenses and business expansion.\n“At the latest we hope to issue them in June,” Satriyono said.\nGaruda unit PT Garuda Maintenance Facility AeroAsia said on Monday it would pick Air France-KLM’s maintenance, repair and overhaul unit as a strategic investor after narrowing down a list of potential partners.\nGaruda’s CEO had estimated in October that GMF AeroAsia could raise $200 million from selling a 20 percent stake to a strategic buyer.
