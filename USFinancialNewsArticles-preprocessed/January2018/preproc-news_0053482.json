    "text": "January 29, 2018 / 4:38 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Golf-Day beats Noren at sixth extra hole in playoff Andrew Both 1 Min Read \nLA JOLLA, California, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Australian Jason Day won for the first time in 20 months when he beat Alex Noren in a playoff at the Farmers Insurance Open on Monday. \nDay sealed victory with a birdie at the sixth extra hole after Swede Noren found a water hazard with his second shot at the par-five 18th at Torrey Pines. \nIt was the 11th PGA Tour triumph for Day, who had not won since the 2016 Players Championship when he was ranked number one in the world. \nDay and Noren could not be separated in five extra holes on Sunday before the playoff was suspended due to darkness. \nIt lasted just one more hole on the resumption on Monday morning after Noren narrowly failed to clear the pond guarding the green with his second shot. \nThe Swede was seeking his maiden PGA Tour victory. He has won nine times on the European Tour. Reporting by Andrew Both, editing by Ed Osmond",
