    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) intends to make further changes to its portfolio but will remain a company, its chief executive said on Wednesday.\n“There will be a GE in the future, but it will look different than it does today,” Chief Executive John Flannery said on a conference call as GE released fourth-quarter earnings.\nThe comments come after speculation increased last week that GE was seriously considering a break-up. Earlier Wednesday, the head of GE’s aircraft financing unit, said GE is looking at alternative structuring arrangements, not a break-up of the company.\nReporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
