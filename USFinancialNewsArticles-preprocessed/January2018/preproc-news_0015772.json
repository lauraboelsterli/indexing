    "text": "January 13, 2018 / 7:53 AM / in 6 hours Cricket-South Africa win toss, opt to bat in second test v India Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPRETORIA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - South Africa captain Faf du Plessis won the toss and elected to bat in the second test against India in Pretoria on Saturday. \nSouth Africa won the first match of the three-test series at Newlands by 72 runs, having also elected to bat first, and Du Plessis is expecting the wicket to deteriorate on days four and five. \n“With the history of this ground, it is a little slow on day one and then speeds. Later in the test match, there are cracks,” Du Plessis said at the toss. “The stats are very in favour of batting first.” \nSouth Africa have handed a first test cap to tall fast bowler Lungi Ngidi in the place of the injured Dale Steyn. \n“He is a promising youngster, so with some pace and bounce we are looking forward to seeing what he can do,” Du Plessis said. \nIndia captain Virat Kohli says batting first was a “no brainer” and was disappointed to have lost his second toss of the series. \n“We would have batted on this pitch too, it looks really dry and completely different from what we thought it would be two days back. We thought it would be similar to Cape Town, but a lot of the grass is off,” Kohli said. \nIndia have included opener Lokesh Rahul, wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel and seamer Ishant Sharma in the place of Shikhar Dhawan, Wriddhiman Saha and Bhuvneshwar Kumar respectively. \nSaha has a hamstring problem and has not been risked. \nTeams: \nSouth Africa: Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis (captain), Quinton de Kock (wicketkeeper), Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Morne Morkel, Lungi Ngidi. \nIndia: Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, Parthiv Patel(wicketkeeper), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami.
