(“Plymouth”). Plymouth is a corrugated packaging company that derives approximately 70% of its sales from its “Box on Demand” systems and corrugated fanfold, and 30% from traditional corrugated box packaging.\nThis acquisition represents WestRock’s entry into the growing on-demand corrugated packaging market that serves many e-commerce and other custom-packaging applications. The market-leading “Box on Demand” systems are located on the customers’ sites and use fanfold corrugated to produce custom, on-demand corrugated packaging that is accurately sized for any product type according to the customer’s specifications.\n“We are pleased to welcome the Plymouth team to WestRock,” stated Jeff Chalovich, president, Corrugated Packaging, WestRock. “The addition of Plymouth Packaging and the “Box on Demand” capabilities furthers our differentiated packaging and packaging machinery strategies, and we look forward to growing this business in our portfolio.”\nIn addition to the market expansion opportunity represented by this acquisition, WestRock intends to fully integrate the nearly 60,000 tons of containerboard used annually by Plymouth Packaging and expects additional containerboard integration opportunities as the Company serves the growing on-demand packaging market.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis release contains that are based on management’s current views and assumptions and are typically identified by words or phrases such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"target,\" \"prospects,\" \"potential\" and \"forecast,\" and other words, terms and phrases of similar meaning.
