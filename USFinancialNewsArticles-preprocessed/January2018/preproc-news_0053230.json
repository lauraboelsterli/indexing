(Nasdaq:CDK) today announced its second quarter fiscal 2018 financial results and raised fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nYear-over-year highlights are below:\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results GAAP Adjusted Revenues up 3% to $561.7 million up 3% to $561.7 million Earnings before income taxes up 1% to $120.3 million up 7% to $161.4 million Net earnings attributable to CDK up 26% to $104.0 million up 20% to $119.7 million Diluted net earnings attributable to\nCDK per share up 36% to $0.75 per share up 30% to $0.87 per share Margin Net earnings attributable to\nCDK margin up 340 bps to\n18.5% EBITDA margin up 350 bps to\n36.3% “Second quarter revenue results were in line with our expectations while earnings results were slightly better than anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 350 basis points to 36.3% in the quarter, enabled by our focus on our transformation plan and other cost saving actions,” said Brian MacDonald, chief executive officer. “In addition to our continued pursuit of efficiency, we are focused on revenue initiatives that we believe will improve our revenue growth trajectory while we continue to work towards our transformation goals and EBITDA margin targets.”\nPlease refer to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results, which we refer to as our adjusted results throughout the body of this press release. Results below reflect year-over-year comparisons.\nAs described below under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this press release, effective July 1, 2017, we began incorporating additional adjustments within our calculations of certain adjusted financial measures, including adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. Each adjusted growth rate is shown against a comparably calculated fiscal 2017 figure.\nImpacts to the Second Quarter:\nForeign exchange rates: Growth in revenues was positively impacted by 2 percentage points while earnings before income taxes were positively impacted by 1 percentage point by foreign exchange rates.\nTax rate: The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 11.7% compared to 29.7% in last year’s second quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 24.3% compared to 33.1% in last year’s second quarter.\nCDK Segment Information\nCDK North America: Retail Solutions North America\nRevenues increased 1% to $398.1 million. GAAP earnings before income taxes increased 14% to $162.3 million; adjusted earnings before income taxes increased 18% to $167.5 million. On a constant currency basis, earnings before income taxes increased 17%. GAAP pretax margin expanded 470 bps to 40.8%; adjusted pretax margin expanded 600 bps to 42.1%. Margin expansion was primarily driven by revenue and operating efficiencies associated with the business transformation plan.\nCDK North America: Advertising North America\nRevenues decreased 2% to $76.8 million. Earnings before income taxes decreased 4% to $9.4 million. Pretax margin declined 30 bps to 12.2% primarily due to a shift in revenue mix.\nCDK International\nRevenues increased 14% to $86.8 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Earnings before income taxes increased 23% to $22.6 million. On a constant currency basis, earnings before income taxes increased 18%. Pretax margin expanded 190 bps to 26.0% primarily due to scale from increased revenues and operating efficiencies associated with the business transformation plan.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nFiscal 2018 Guidance GAAP Adjusted Revenues up 3.0% - 4.0% up 3.0% - 4.0% Diluted net earnings attributable\nto CDK per share $2.65 - $2.75 $3.23 - $3.28 up 33.0% - 38.0% up 25.0% - 27.0% Margin Net earnings attributable to CDK\nmargin 16.0% - 17.0% EBITDA margin 35.0% - 36.0% We maintain our revenue guidance for the fiscal year. We have raised our earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year to $2.65-$2.75 from $2.37-$2.47 on a GAAP basis. We have raised our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year to $3.23-$3.28 from $2.95-$3.00, including approximately $0.23 associated with the ongoing benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). We currently expect EBITDA margin to be at the high end of the provided guidance range in fiscal 2018.\nTax Rate\nWe have revised our tax rate expectations to include the impact of the Tax Reform Act for fiscal 2018. We anticipate our GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be 25%-26% compared to 30.5% for fiscal 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 is expected to be 29.0%-30.0% compared to 34.2% for fiscal 2017. In light of the Tax Reform Act, and subject to finalization of our accounting for the Tax Reform Act, we anticipate our future annual adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately three to four points lower than fiscal 2018.\nWebsite Schedules\nOther financial information, including financial statements and supplementary schedules presented on a GAAP and adjusted basis, and the schedule of quarterly revenues and pretax earnings by reportable segment have been updated for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and will be posted to the CDK Investor Relations website, http://investors.cdkglobal.com , in the “Financial Information” section.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nAn analyst conference call will be held today, Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. CT.

These measures are intended to provide directional information regarding trends in our recurring subscription revenues. The following table summarizes these measures for recurring subscription revenues in our segments:\nSeptember 30,\n2016 (a) December 31,\n2016 (a) March 31,\n2017 (a) June 30,\n2017 (a) September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2017 RSNA Automotive DMS Customer Sites (b) 9,232 9,184 9,157 9,081 9,020 9,029 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 7,803 $ 7,875 $ 7,975 $ 8,070 $ 8,285 $ 8,410 Adjacencies DMS Customer Sites (b) 5,380 5,415 5,523 5,530 5,523 5,577 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 1,556 $ 1,569 $ 1,575 $ 1,578 $ 1,602 $ 1,600 Total RSNA DMS Customer Sites (b) 14,612 14,599 14,680 14,611 14,543 14,606 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 5,507 $ 5,538 $ 5,570 $ 5,616 $ 5,750 $ 5,814 Total Websites (d) 6,625 6,789 6,931 6,879 6,858 6,817 CDKI DMS Customer Sites (b) 13,373 13,424 13,419 13,477 13,496 13,559 Avg Revenue Per Site (c) $ 1,181 $ 1,199 $ 1,226 $ 1,249 $ 1,266 $ 1,290 (a) Average revenue per Dealer Management System (DMS) customer site has been updated for fiscal 2017 to reflect the change in reportable segments and budgeted foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2018.\n(b) DMS Customer Sites - We track the number of retail customer sites with an active DMS that sell vehicles in the automotive and adjacent markets as an indicator of our opportunity set for generating subscription revenue. We consider a DMS to be active if we have billed a subscription fee for that solution during the most recently ended calendar month. Adjacent markets include heavy truck dealerships that provide vehicles to the over-the-road trucking industry, recreation dealerships in the motorcycle, marine, and recreational vehicle industries, and heavy equipment dealerships in the agriculture and construction equipment industries.\n(c) Average Revenue Per DMS Customer Site - Average revenue per DMS customer site is an indicator of the adoption of our solutions by DMS customers, and we monitor changes in this metric to measure the effectiveness of our strategy to deepen our relationships with our current customer base through upgrading and expanding solutions. We calculate average revenue per DMS customer site by dividing revenue generated from our solutions, including revenue generated from websites, in an applicable period by the average number of DMS customer sites in the same period. The metric excludes subscription revenue generated by customers not included in our DMS customer site count as well as subscription revenue related to certain installation and training activities that is deferred then recognized as revenue over the life of the contract. Revenue underlying this metric is based on budgeted foreign exchange rates. When we discuss growth in average revenue per DMS customer site, revenue for the comparable prior period has been adjusted to reflect budgeted foreign exchange rates for the current period.\n(d) Websites - For the RSNA segment, we track the number of websites that we host and develop for our OEM and automotive retail customers as an indicator of business activity, regardless of whether or not the website is tied to a DMS customer site. The number of websites as of a specified date is the total number of full function dealer websites or portals that are currently accessible as of the end of the most recent calendar month.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose certain financial measures for our consolidated and operating segment results on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of each of the following non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures, or reconcile them to the comparable GAAP financial measures, in the same way.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure Comparable GAAP Financial Measure Adjusted earnings before income taxes Earnings before income taxes Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes Adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK Net earnings attributable to CDK Adjusted diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share Diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share Adjusted EBITDA Net earnings attributable to CDK Adjusted EBITDA margin Net earnings attributable to CDK margin Constant currency revenues Revenues Constant currency adjusted earnings before income taxes Earnings before income taxes We use adjusted earnings before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted diluted earnings attributable to CDK per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin internally to evaluate our performance on a consistent basis, because the measures adjust for the impact of certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our underlying operations. By adjusting for these items we believe we have more precise inputs for use as factors in (i) our budgeting process, (ii) making financial and operational decisions, (iii) evaluating ongoing segment and overall operating performance on a consistent period-to-period basis, (iv) target leverage calculations, (v) debt covenant calculations, and (vi) determining incentive-based compensation.\nWe believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful for users of the financial statements because they (i) provide investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our ongoing operating results on a consistent basis. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures disclosed below, provides investors with a fuller understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nEffective July 1, 2017, we began incorporating additional adjustments within our calculations of adjusted earnings before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK, adjusted diluted net earnings attributable to CDK per share, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin where management has deemed it appropriate to better reflect our underlying operations. For fiscal 2018, management modified fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 adjustments for (i) business transformation expenses and (ii) officer transition expense to remove stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively and excluded certain legal and regulatory expenses related to the competition matter from adjusted earnings before income taxes. There was no stock-based compensation expense included in business transformation expenses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Earnings before Income Taxes\nManagement has excluded the following items from adjusted earnings before income taxes for the periods presented:\nRestructuring expenses recognized in connection with our business transformation plan.\nOther business transformation expenses included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses that include legal, accounting, other professional fees, and other integration costs incurred in connection with our closed and pending acquisitions included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOfficer transition expense includes severance expense in connection with officer departures included within selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented.\nLegal and regulatory expenses related to competition matters included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss/(gain) recorded within other income, net associated with an indemnification receivable from ADP for pre spin-off tax periods in accordance with tax matters agreement.\nAdjusted Provision for Income taxes\nManagement has excluded the following items from adjusted provision for income taxes for the periods presented:\nIncome tax effect of pre-tax adjustments described above.\nExcess tax benefit derived from stock-option exercises and vesting of restricted stock in order to align the adjustments for this measure with our adjustments for total stock-based compensation in other measures.\nNet income tax benefit associated with a tax refund, offset by a pretax loss to establish a liability to ADP for the tax refund in accordance with the tax-matters agreement.\nAs a result of the Tax reform Act, an estimated one-time tax benefit of $22.6 million from the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability partially offset by a one-time expense of $8.5 million associated with undistributed foreign earnings.\nAdjusted Net Earnings Attributable to CDK and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Attributable to CDK per Share\nFor each respective presentation, management has excluded the items described above for adjusted earnings before income taxes and adjusted provision for income taxes from adjusted net earnings attributable to CDK and adjusted basic and diluted net earnings attributable to CDK per share.\nThe portion of expense related to noncontrolling interest of $0.1 million and $0.2 million has been removed from restructuring expenses for the three months ended and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, $0.1 million related to noncontrolling interest has been removed from other business transformation expenses three months ended and six months ended December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nManagement has excluded the following items from net earnings attributable to CDK in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest included within the financial statements.\nProvision for income taxes included within the financial statements.\nInterest expense included within the financial statements.\nDepreciation and amortization included within the financial statements.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRestructuring expenses recognized in connection with our business transformation plan.\nOther business transformation expenses included within cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Other business transformation expenses excludes depreciation expense of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and $0.1 million and $1.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses that include legal, accounting, other professional fees, and other integration costs incurred in connection with our closed and pending acquisitions included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOfficer transition expense includes severance expense in connection with officer departures included within selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented.\nLegal and regulatory expenses related to competition matters included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss/(gain) recorded within other income, net associated with an indemnification receivable from ADP for pre spin-off tax periods in accordance with tax matters agreement.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe also review free cash flow to measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less amounts paid for capital expenditures and capitalized software. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nConstant Currency\nWe review revenues and adjusted earnings before income taxes for our consolidated and operating segment results on a constant currency basis to understand underlying business trends. To present these results on a constant currency basis, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were translated into U.S. dollar using the average monthly exchange rates for the comparable prior period. As a result, constant currency results neutralize the effects of foreign currency.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
