    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said on Thursday they would rename their Telecommunication Services Sector and add Comcast Corp, Netflix, Facebook and Alphabet to the newly broadened category.\nIn an overhaul of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors, the Telecommunication Services Sector will be expanded and renamed Communication Services, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in a statement.\nThe new classification puts Facebook, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet - companies whose explosive growth has helped propel a stock-market rally - alongside traditional telecom players including AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications.\nIndexes including the S&P 500 are a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide, including index-tracking, exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many of those funds track sector-specific indexes and could be affected by the GICS changes.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in November 2017 they were planning changes to the categories and that they would be implemented after the close of business on Sept. 28, 2018.\nThe updates are meant to reflect changes to industries resulting from technology and acquisitions.\nAlso moving to the newly named Communications Sector are Twitter Inc and Snap Inc, both currently part of the Information Technology Sector.\nWalt Disney Co and DISH Network Corp, both currently in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, will also join the Communications Sector.\nComcast and Netflix currently fall under the Consumer Discretionary Sector, while Alphabet and Facebook are currently in the Information Technology Sector.\nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Chris Reese\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
