    "text": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - French Open champion Jelena Ostapenkoâ€™s Australian Open hopes ended on Friday as the seventh seed was beaten 6-3 1-6 6-3 by Anett Kontaveit in a battle of the Baltic.\nLatvian Ostapenko produced her usual brand of gung-ho tennis but Estonian Kontaveit weathered the storm to take her place in the fourth round in Melbourne for the first time.\nOstapenko, playing with a heavily bandaged thigh, dominated the second set but was unable to sustain her level.\nTennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 19, 2018. Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko in action during her match against Estonia's Anett Kontaveit. REUTERS/Toru Hanai The players traded breaks early in the deciding set but the 22-year-old Kontaveit outlasted her opponent in marathon seventh game, thumping a weak second serve for a backhand winner on her fifth break point to seize the advantage again.\nAfter holding serve, 32nd seed Kontaveit sealed victory when an Ostapenko forehand thumped into the net.\nHer reward is a fourth round tie against unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro who got the better of Kaia Kanepi in three sets.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
