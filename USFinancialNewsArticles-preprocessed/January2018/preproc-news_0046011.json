    "text": " 23 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Brexit minister says no difference with PM and finance minister over EU exit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTEESPORT, England, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Britain’s Brexit minister said there was no difference between himself, finance minister Philip Hammond and Prime Minister Theresa May over their aims on Brexit. \n“There is no difference between the chancellor and myself and indeed the Prime Minister in terms of that we both want a Brexit which serves the British economy and serves the British people,” David Davis said during a speech in Teesport, northern England. \nOn Thursday, a source in May’s office rebuked Hammond after he said at a business event in Davos that the changes Britain would undergo could be described as “very modest”.
