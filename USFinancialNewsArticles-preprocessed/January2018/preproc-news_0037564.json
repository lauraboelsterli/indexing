Shares of Validus jumped 16 percent.\nThe Senate is set to vote at midday following failed attempts by Democrats and Republicans to strike a deal on Sunday to fund government operations.\nAt 7:00 a.m. ET (1200 GMT), Dow e-minis were down 48 points, or 0.18 percent, with 17,075 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.07 percent, with 85,984 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were down 3.25 points, or 0.05 percent, on volume of 21,978 contracts.\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Friday, as investors shrugged off the threat of a shutdown and focused on upbeat quarterly earnings.\nOf the 53 S&P 500 companies that reported through Friday, 79.2 percent have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHalliburton Co posted a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production. Its shares were up about 1 percent.\nNetflix is due to report its quarterly results on Monday after the stock market closes. Shares were up 1 percent.\nThe week is heavy on economic data. Investors will get a peek into the economy’s health during the fourth quarter, with GDP growth numbers and the Fed’s favored inflation measure, personal consumption expenditure, due at the end of the week.
