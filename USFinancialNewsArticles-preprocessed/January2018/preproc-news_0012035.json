FILE PHOTO: Britain Football Soccer - Everton v Arsenal - Premier League - Goodison Park - 13/12/16 Everton's Seamus Coleman celebrates scoring their first goal Reuters / Phil Noble Livepic \nColeman last featured in Ireland’s World Cup qualifier against Wales last March when he suffered the injury. \n“Seamus Coleman is due back. He has started training,” Allardyce said at Everton’s general meeting on Tuesday. \nThe 29-year-old’s return will be a welcome boost for Everton, who have regained some decent form under Allardyce and climbed to ninth in the league.
