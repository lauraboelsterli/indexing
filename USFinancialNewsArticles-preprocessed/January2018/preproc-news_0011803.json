    "text": "By Sarah Gray January 8, 2018 \nPapa John‚Äôs is offering free pizza for most of January. As part of the pizza chain‚Äôs deal , customers can buy any full-price pizza and get one of the same or lesser value for free. \nThe pizza deal, announced on Christmas‚Äîjust three days after founder and former CEO John Schnatter stepped down ‚Äîruns until Jan. 28. (Sorry folks, you won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of this deal for the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.) \nThough Papa John‚Äôs became a sponsor and official pizza of the NFL in 2010, it‚Äôs has a tempestuous relationship with the league as of late. Last year, Papa John‚Äôs faced criticism after then-CEO Schnatter blamed lagging sales on the NFL‚Äîspecifically player protests over police brutality during the national anthem. \n‚ÄúThe NFL has hurt us,‚Äù Schnatter said during a third-quarter earnings call in November. ‚ÄúMore importantly, by not resolving the current debacle to the players‚Äô and owners‚Äô satisfaction. NFL leadership has hurt Papa John‚Äôs shareholders. This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago.‚Äù Buy any pizza at regular menu price, get one of equal or lesser value free. pic.twitter.com/FoCPDlWGH5 \n‚Äî Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) December 26, 2017 \nFollowing those comments, the white supremacist publication the Daily Stormer embraced the pizza chain. Papa John‚Äôs later apologized and denounce neo-Nazis in a series of tweets. The statements made on our earnings call were describing the factors that impact our business and we sincerely apologize to anyone that thought they were divisive. That definitely was not our intention. (1/3) \n‚Äî Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) November 15, 2017 We believe in the right to protest inequality and support the players‚Äô movement to create a new platform for change. We also believe together, as Americans, we should honor our anthem. There is a way to do both. (2/3) \n‚Äî Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) November 15, 2017 We will work with the players and league to find a positive way forward. Open to ideas from all. Except neo-nazis ‚Äî üñïthose guys. (3/3) \n‚Äî Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) November 15, 2017 \nSchnatter was succeeded by COO Steve Ritchie in December. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
