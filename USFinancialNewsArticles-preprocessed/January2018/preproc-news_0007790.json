A container ship is loaded at a terminal in the harbour of Hamburg, Germany September 23, 2012. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have for years urged Germany to lift domestic demand and imports in order to reduce global economic imbalances and fuel global growth, including within the euro zone. \nIfo said the German current account surplus -- which measures the flow of goods, services and investments -- was the world’s largest for the second year running in 2017 at $287 billion, followed by Japan with $203 billion. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticised Germany for doing too little to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, accusing Germany of “very bad” trade policies. \nChancellor Angela Merkel has pushed back, pointing to private consumption becoming the main driver of growth. \nMerkel also pointed out that the German surplus is mainly a result of the interplay of supply and demand on global markets and that Berlin has only limited influence on other important factors such as the euro exchange rate and energy prices. \nChina slipped to third place with a surplus of $135 billion, less than half Germany‘s. \nThe German current account surplus fell to 7.8 percent of total output in 2017 from 8.3 percent in the previous year. \n“Traded goods are the main reason for the German surplus,” said Ifo economist Christian Grimme. “The main driver was high demand from the European Union and the United States.” \nIn the first 11 months of last year, Germany’s trade surplus in goods was 249 billion euros (221.00 billion pounds) as exports continued to outstrip imports.
