    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nThe Board of Directors of Total (Paris:FP) (LSE:TTA) (NYSE:TOT) met on December 12, 2017, and declared a 2017 second interim dividend of €0.62 per share and offered, under the conditions set by the fourth resolution at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 26, 2017, the option for shareholders to receive the 2017 second interim dividend in cash or in new shares of the Company.\nThe period for exercising the option ran from December 19, 2017 to January 3, 2018. At the end of the option period, 21% of rights were exercised in favour of receiving the payment for the 2017 second interim dividend in shares.\n7,087,904 new shares will be issued, representing 0.28% of the Company’s share capital on the basis of the share capital of December 31, 2017. The share price for the new shares to be issued as payment of the 2017 second interim dividend was set at €46.55 on December 12, 2017. The price is equal to the average opening price on Euronext Paris for the twenty trading days preceding the Board of Directors on December 12, 2017, reduced by the amount of the 2017 second interim dividend, without any discount.\nThe settlement and delivery of the new shares as well as their admission to trading on Euronext Paris will occur on January 11, 2018. The shares will carry immediate dividend rights and will be fully assimilated with existing shares already listed.\nThe remaining cash dividend to be paid to shareholders who did not elect to receive the 2017 second interim dividend in shares amounts to 1,231 million euros and the date for the payment in cash is set for January 11, 2018.\nAbout Total\nTotal is a global integrated energy producer and provider, a leading international oil and gas company, and a major player in low-carbon energies.
