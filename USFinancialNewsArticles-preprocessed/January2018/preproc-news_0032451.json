By incorporating Mattermark’s unique data set into FullContact, we are able to provide customers with even richer information about companies and key employees.”\nMattermark’s data will complement FullContact’s existing offering, providing additional information about companies’ websites, number of employees, overviews, social profiles, industry data, and contact information.\n“Mattermark was started with the mission to organize the world’s business information,” said Danielle Morrill, former CEO of Mattermark, now vice president of product at FullContact. “The addition of Mattermark’s data into FullContact’s identity graph is a continuation of this mission and is excellent news for customers of both companies, as well as the marketplace.”\nAdded Morrill, “We are delighted to join a team with a strong overlap in both employee and customer value propositions.”\nIn addition to Morrill, FullContact, who currently serves 20,000 customers and over one billion API calls per month, will also be welcoming several other key employees from the Mattermark team into its Engineering and Product Division.
