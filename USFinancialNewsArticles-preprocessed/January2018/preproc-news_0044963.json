    "text": "Jan 25 (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp reported a 9.2 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, as it benefited from healthy NAND pricing and strong demand for its memory chips used in PCs and smartphones.\nThe company’s revenue rose to $5.34 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 29 from $4.89 billion a year earlier.\nThe data-storage device maker posted a net loss of $823 million, or $2.78 per share, compared with a profit of $235 million, or 80 cents per share, last year.\nThat was due to a $1.6 billion charge related to new U.S. tax laws.
