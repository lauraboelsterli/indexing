Dr. Moncada has more than 20 years' experience in the pathology field, the last ten of which he served as Chief Medical Officer of PCG Molecular. He has expertise in the fields of gynecologic, breast, and head and neck pathology and cytopathology as well as in molecular pathology and oropharyngeal and cervical cancer genomics.\n\"It is with great pleasure that we welcome Dr. Moncada to our leadership team\" said Sonny Roshan, Chairman and CEO of Aeon Global Health. \"He has built an impressive reputation for his work in actionable molecular and genetic information related to an individual's risk for developing cancer. We are confident that this will serve Aeon well as we continue to build a world-class medical information company.\"\n\"Dr. Moncada will provide important guidance and advice as we expand into the anatomic pathology field. By adding targeted assays based on his expertise, we believe that Aeon can emerge with a menu that will augment our outcomes-based assays that are the hallmark of today's healthcare environment.\"\nDr. Moncada is a Board Certified pathologist by the American Board of Pathology and served as the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of PCG Molecular, LLC. He trained in pathology while attending Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana followed by a fellowship in oncopathology at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, California. Upon completing his fellowship, Dr. Moncada served as medical director of large hospital systems in Texas and New Mexico. He was then given an appointment as Assistant Professor of Pathology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\nDr. Moncada is a Fellow and/or active member of the following professional organizations: American Medical Association, College of American Pathologists, American Society for Clinical Pathology, American College of Physician Executives, and Association for Molecular Pathology.\nIn addition, Dr. Moncada is an experienced College of American Pathologists (\"CAP\") inspector who served as the State Commissioner for the College of American Pathologists in New Mexico where he was responsible for the laboratory accreditation program for both clinical and pathology medical laboratories. He continues to serve as a CAP inspector for the College of American Pathologists and understands the changing needs of the medical community and laboratory industry. Dr. Moncada also has a special interest in the laboratory industry and healthcare administration.\nIn addition, Aeon Global Health announced that it intends to acquire certain intellectual property assets from PCG Molecular, LLC, a genetics and molecular informatics company that has developed proprietary testing for screening for oropharyngeal carcinoma and related infectious diseases.

Among the assays developed by PCG are MOP ® —a multiplex-based molecular assay for the identification of a number of extra-genital sexually transmitted diseases from samples taken in the oral cavity; Bella One Pap™, a comprehensive molecular cervical based test that identifies both cervical cancer risk as well as infectious agents from a single sample; and MAP™-Molecular Anal Pap, a genetic assay for the identification of anal cancer risk and related sexually transmitted diseases. Completion of this transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive assignment agreement and customary conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached by the parties.\nAbout Authentidate Holding Corp.:\nAeon Global Health (Aeon), the operating arm of Authentidate Holding Corp., is an emerging leader in the provision of clinically actionable medical informatics.
