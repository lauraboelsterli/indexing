The company was formed through the combination of Tucker Midstream Inc. / Tucker Construction Inc.

We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients to deliver solutions that help manage risk and properly maintain the integrity of pipeline and facility assets throughout their life cycle.\"\nPaul Neundorfer added, \"Through the dedication of our employees, we have developed a reputation for delivering safe, quality results to our customers. Since partnering with Blue Point in 2009, we have made significant investments in our operational infrastructure as well as organic and acquisition initiatives, and we thank them for their support and guidance. This combination of EMS and Tucker is a natural and important step in our evolution and will offer numerous benefits as we become part of a larger platform with a shared vision.\"\nHoulihan Lokey acted as financial advisor to EMS in this transaction.
