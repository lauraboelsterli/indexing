The Company has developed proprietary products and provides services that target the entire Process Life Cycle, which is a term used to mean the time from technology development and the design of an IC to volume manufacturing of that IC to product assembly and test.\nPDF Solutions’ products and services consist of proprietary test structures and electrical test systems, physical intellectual property, enterprise platform software and professional services. The Company’s Characterization Vehicle® (CV®) electrical test chip infrastructure provides core modeling capabilities, and is used by more leading manufacturers than any other test chips in the industry. The Design-for-Inspection™ (DFI™) solution extends the Company’s electrical characterization technologies into the e-beam measurement of extremely dense test structures, or DFI cells, across an entire fabrication process. Proprietary Template™ layout patterns for standard cell libraries optimize area, performance, and manufacturability for designing IC products. The Exensio platform for big data unlocks relevant, actionable information buried in wafer fabrication, process control and test data through the key components: Exensio® -Yield, Exensio® -Control, Exensio® -Test, Exensio® -ALPS, and Exensio® -Char. The Exensio® platform is available either on-premise or via software as a service (SaaS).\nHeadquartered in San Jose, Calif., PDF Solutions operates worldwide with additional offices in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
