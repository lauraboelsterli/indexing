    "text": "Sophomore guard Jonah Mathews scored 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting and Southern California connected on a season-high 14 3-pointers while rolling to an easy 84-67 victory over Utah on Sunday night in Pac-12 play at the Galen Center in Los Angeles.\nJunior forward Bennie Boatwright added 13 points and senior guard Jordan McLaughlin contributed 14 points and seven assists as the Trojans (13-6, 4-2 Pac-12) finished 14-of-29 from long range to win for the seventh time in the past nine contests. USC built a 24-point halftime lead en route to snapping an eight-game series losing streak against the Utes.\nSenior guard Justin Bibbins made five 3-pointers while scoring 19 points for Utah (10-7, 2-4), which committed 17 turnovers and dropped its fourth consecutive game. Sophomore 7-footer Jayce Johnson matched his career high of 14 points and also collected nine rebounds. Senior forward David Collette added 11 points and freshman forward Donnie Tillman scored 10.\nThe Trojans -- who also received 11 points from junior forward Chimezie Metu -- controlled the final 38 minutes while defeating the Utes for the first time since Jan. 12, 2013.\nUtah opened the game with 3-pointers from Tillman and senior forward Tyler Rawson before USC took over. Junior guard Shaqquan Aaron drained two 3-pointers as the Trojans ran off the next 10 points to start a 24-3 burst.\nSenior guard Elijah Stewart had two 3-pointers and freshman wing Jordan Usher capped the spree with one of his own to give USC a 24-9 edge with 11:11 left in the half. A 3-pointer by Mathews pushed the lead above 20 for the first time at 32-11 with 9:20 left.\nMcLaughlin drained a 3-pointer to make it 41-17 with 3:38 left in the half. He later converted a layup to push the margin to 26 before the Trojans settled for a 46-22 halftime advantage.\nUSC was 9-of-15 from 3-point range in the half, compared to 3-of-13 for the Utes. Utah ended up 10-of-24.\nBibbins nailed back-to-back 3-pointers to pull the Utes within 66-45 with 9:55 to play before McLaughlin made USCâ€™s 14th 3-pointer -- representing the new season high -- just 31 seconds later.\nUtah crept within 14 on a jumper by Johnson with 4:21 left before the Trojans bumped the lead back up to 19 while cruising to the finish.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
