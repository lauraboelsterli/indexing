We have included EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. EBITDA is reconciled from the respective measure under GAAP in the attached table “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThis press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
