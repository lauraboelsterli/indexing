I ... welcome back to the new tax on and Downing's has some college is worried about budgeting ... it isn't yet clear exactly how the new wind down the tax will be calculated ... but it turns out some smaller colleges may end up paying more in the short term ... joining me now to explain from Washington DC as Richard group in the law Street Journal's U S tax policy reporter ... Richard this is a new thing for colleges which have enjoyed tax free endowments what Republicans pushed through this change as part of a tax overhaul ... Republicans ... like everyone are seeing college costs rise and there seemed student loan balances go up in their ... concern about affordability and they see these big ... endowments these big pots of money ... but are on taxes and subsidized by federal taxpayers through both the tax deductions that the donors got into the tax exemption on the college's earnings ... and they say that you know that there should be some serve more oversight more scrutiny of of the endowment taxes away the to do that ... any college is on the other hand argue that this change will make it more difficult to offer things like financial aid to students ... right will colleges say is when it we use our endowment earning the money we make every year from ... mothers dividends or sales of assets or ... interest whatever else the endowment is throwing off ... or just taking out a piece of it as new gifts are coming in ... this did did they use that to help keep the cost to ration out even though the costs of tuitions piety but semesters and they would argue that the action would be even higher were it not for the down earnings in DC this new tax of one point four percent ... net investment income from endowments is just going to make that job even harder that protection would actually accomplish they say what Republicans want to ... and now there is some confusion about how exactly the endowment tax will be calculated what to know so far but how will work ... so the basics are devices schools with the least five hundred students ... and the tax only by schools that have ... fine in two thousand union down and proceed in ... this inquest about how the five hundred thousand would be to find how the ... income will be defined them shovel be some debate about how student is defined as well to do so would with anything in taxes the beauty of the law and an OBE ... so every tuition that will follow that will inherit the Treasury Department that will lead to self ... image that will cause me to do ... and we don't have any effect yet to were in the interim period where the tax exists and schools will have to pay at starting soon By they also don't know exactly how this worked ... so there is some confusion in the college community and as you report in The Wall Street Journal ... there's also the ... factor that some smaller liberal arts colleges could end up paying more than wealthier ones can you explain ... yet that five hundred thousand dollar endowment for student threshold ... that leaves out some some larger and wealthier schools so long the University to stick in your free sample of the University NYU which both a ... multi billion dollar endowment ... will pay the tax at least initially ... the two smaller schools Cooper Union and Juilliard both also in your city ... will pay the tax because they've ... in one of the things that they offer students is that ... small enrollment and so as they've attracted donations that they're in talent pursued a number that ... which accounts for the tax ... is in fact higher than some other larger and nominally wealthier counterparts ... what you're hearing from the smaller schools about their concerns for the short term and how they are trying to plan ahead ... so if you're on the cusp of this tax rate is no brackets and sex your their inner year LUV the one point four percent in Utah so there's ... some ways if your school that's just below on the enrollment citing the foreign trip nine nine students in years to decide whether to expand your student body if the five hundred ... bets given really expensive five hundred students oh ... eight will affect that certainty and in the other side maybe if you're close to five hundred thousand number ... you might do things like defer or receiving the gaps until after your taxable year or after the iPhone's big it would push you over that's a ... fact that your donation let's just take it next year ... you might also ... increase in Rome on a little bit to get that and down for student number Amal work to get a tax you might also you spend over the endowment to get below the tax ... so there's ... a bunch of different options that the schools have been a ultimately what what are those that makes the least of the land is one point four percent tax level ... makes ... college is more like other taxpayers thinking about how their income and their earnings are affected by taxes in ways that they just haven't really needed to think about for ... I've been speaking with a richer driven The Wall Street Journal The U S tax policy reporter about the new college endowment tax things Richard ... banks ... and that's what seems like what you hear or read and heard us on Apple podcasts ...
