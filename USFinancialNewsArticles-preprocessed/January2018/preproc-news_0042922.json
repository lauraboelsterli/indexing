The most recent, ILUVIEN ® , a micro-insert for diabetic macular edema, licensed to Alimera Sciences, is currently sold directly in the U.S. and three EU countries. Retisert ® , an implant for posterior uveitis, is licensed to and sold by Bausch & Lomb.

Two pivotal Phase 3 studies with Durasert achieved their primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of uveitis at six months of follow-up with statistical significance. pSivida's pre-clinical development program is focused on using its core platform technology Durasert to deliver drugs to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases.
