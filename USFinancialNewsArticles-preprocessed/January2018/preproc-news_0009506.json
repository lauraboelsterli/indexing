    "text": "January 8, 2018 / 4:38 PM / Updated 2 hours ago German coalition negotiators agree to cut electricity tax - document Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Germany’s would-be coalition partners have agreed to cut the tax on electricity in order to reduce energy costs, according to a document agreed by negotiators for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). \nThe political blocs, which are exploring a possible governing coalition, also agreed to tender an extra 4 gigawatts of solar energy, as well as onshore and offshore wind-generating capacity, the document seen by Reuters on Monday showed. \nThe agreement, worked out by energy experts from both sides, must still be approved by party leaders.
