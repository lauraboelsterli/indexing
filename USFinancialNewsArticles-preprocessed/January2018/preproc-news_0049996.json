    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei ended flat in choppy trade on Monday with gains in cyclicals such as memory chip makers offset by weakness in in shares sensitive to domestic demand, notably railroad and construction companies.\nThe Nikkei share average ended flat at 23,629.34 after flirting in positive territory in early trade.\nSilicon products maker Shin-Etsu Chemical jumped 4.6 percent after raising its net profit forecast and dividend payout outlook for the year ending March, while silicon wafer maker Sumco soared 2.0 percent.\nChip-making equipment manufacturers also outperformed the overall market, with Tokyo Electron rising 1.3 percent and Advantest Corp advancing 1.8 percent.\nInsurers rallied with T&D Holdings up 1.7 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings surging 0.8 percent.\nBut railroad operators slipped, with East Japan Railway falling 1.2 percent and West Japan Railway declining 0.9 percent.\nContractor Obayashi shed 1.1 percent and Taisei declined 1.0 percent.\nThe broader Topix eked out small gains, adding 0.1 percent to 1,880.45.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
