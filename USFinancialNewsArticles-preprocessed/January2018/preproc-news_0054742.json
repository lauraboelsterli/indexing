(NASDAQ:TRNS) (“Transcat” or the “Company”), a leading provider of accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services and value-added distributor of professional grade handheld test, measurement and control instrumentation, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended December 23, 2017 (the “third quarter”) of fiscal year 2018, which ends March 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”).\n“We are pleased to report strong third quarter results in both segments. This quarter represents record results for our Distribution segment as momentum in our core sales as well as rentals continues to be strong. Our Service segment generated solid organic growth of 7.5% and delivered improved productivity with a 30 basis point increase in gross margin,” commented Lee D. Rudow, President and CEO. “Transcat continues to demonstrate results consistent with the effective execution of our strategic plan.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Review (Results are compared with the third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 25, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”))\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q3 FY17 Q3 $'s % Service Revenue $ 18,769 $ 17,455 $ 1,314 7.5 % Distribution Sales $ 21,714 $ 20,358 $ 1,356 6.7 % Revenue $ 40,483 $ 37,813 $ 2,670 7.1 % Gross Profit $ 9,701 $ 8,915 $ 786 8.8 % Gross Margin 24.0 % 23.6 % Operating Income $ 2,654 $ 2,353 $ 301 12.8 % Operating Margin 6.6 % 6.2 % Net Income $ 1,831 $ 1,270 $ 561 44.2 % Net Margin 4.5 % 3.4 % Adjusted EBITDA* $ 4,400 $ 3,901 $ 499 12.8 % Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 10.9 % 10.3 % *See Note 1 on page 4 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 9 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nTranscat achieved record consolidated quarterly revenue of $40.5 million, up 7.1%. Consolidated gross profit grew by 8.8% and gross margin improved 40 basis points. General and Administrative expenses were up $0.5 million to $2.9 million, which reflected the Company’s continued investment in its infrastructure and operational excellence initiatives. Overall, operating income increased $0.3 million and operating margin increased 40 basis points to 6.6%.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the \"Act\") was signed into law. The Act includes numerous changes in existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Act contains other provisions that are not expected to materially impact the Company. As a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rates, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 21.9% from the prescribed blending of old and new federal income tax rates and the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities previously recorded. Third quarter diluted earnings per share increased $0.07 to $0.25, of which $0.04 of the increase was due to the Act.\nService segment delivers solid organic growth while focusing on productivity enhancements\nRepresents the accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services business (46% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018).\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q3 FY17 Q3 $'s % Service Segment Revenue $ 18,769 $ 17,455 $ 1,314 7.5 % Gross Profit $ 4,699 $ 4,306 $ 393 9.1 % Gross Margin 25.0 % 24.7 % Operating Income $ 1,063 $ 941 $ 122 13.0 % Operating Margin 5.7 % 5.4 % Adjusted EBITDA* $ 2,278 $ 2,067 $ 211 10.2 % Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 12.1 % 11.8 % *See Note 1 on page 4 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 9 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nService revenue increased 7.5% on all organic growth, and was comprised of new business from the life science market and growth in general industrial manufacturing, which includes both the defense and aerospace markets.\nGross profit increased $0.4 million and gross margin improved 30 basis points due to productivity improvements, including the ramp-up in productivity from technicians hired earlier in the fiscal year.\nDiversified sales channels lift Distribution segment\nRepresents the distribution and rental of new and used professional grade handheld test, measurement and control instrumentation (54% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018).\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q3 FY17 Q3 $'s % Distribution Segment Sales $ 21,714 $ 20,358 $ 1,356 6.7 % Gross Profit $ 5,002 $ 4,609 $ 393 8.5 % Gross Margin 23.0 % 22.6 % Operating Income $ 1,591 $ 1,412 $ 179 12.7 % Operating Margin 7.3 % 6.9 % Adjusted EBITDA* $ 2,122 $ 1,834 $ 288 15.7 % Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 9.8 % 9.0 % *See Note 1 on page 4 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 9 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nThe Distribution sales increase reflected higher demand from industrial customers, including new equipment sold through the Company’s independent representative network and increased web-based sales. It also reflects higher rental revenue, which was up 44% to $1.0 million in the quarter. Despite a decrease in year over year volume-based vendor rebates, the segment recorded a 40 basis point improvement in gross margin.\nNine Month Review (Results are compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017)\nTotal revenue was $112.7 million, up 6.9%, or $7.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, all from organic growth. Consolidated gross margin was 23.6% of revenue, down 30 basis points primarily due to Service segment productivity challenges earlier in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, consolidated operating expenses were 18.7%, down 10 basis points. As a result, operating income increased $0.2 million to $5.5 million, or 4.9% of revenue. Net income was $3.5 million compared with $3.1 million, of which $0.3 million of this increase was from lower income tax expense resulting from the new tax Act. Adjusted EBITDA improved 7.3% to $11.1 million. See Note 1 on page 4 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 9 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Overview\nCapital expenditures were $5.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Investments were primarily for assets for customer-driven expansion of Service segment capabilities, including mobile calibration fleet investments and RF/electronics assets for the aerospace/defense and life science markets, and purchases of rental business assets.\nOn October 30, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement, which extended the term of the Company’s $30.0 million revolving credit facility to 2021 and increased the amount of the term loan to $15.0 million, replacing the previous term loan. The excess funds of the new term loan were used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nAt December 23, 2017, the Company had total debt of $26.2 million, with $18.4 million available under its credit facility. Total debt compared with fiscal 2017 year-end was down $1.1 million. The Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, was 1.72 at December 23, 2017, compared with 1.88 at fiscal 2017 year-end.\nAs previously announced, on December 20, 2017, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Under the shelf registration statement, the Company may from time to time in one or more future offerings, issue various types of securities up to an aggregate amount of $50 million. Mr. Rudow noted, “While we have no immediate plans to use this registration statement, we are being proactive in our efforts to support our growth strategy.” The SEC declared the shelf registration statement effective on January 5, 2018.\nOutlook\nMr. Rudow concluded, “We believe we are well positioned and on track for a record year in fiscal 2018. Our multi-year operational excellence initiatives are starting to gain traction and are positively impacting both segments. Our Service segment continues to strengthen its market position, particularly in the life science space where we believe our value proposition resonates the most, and where regulation and the high cost of failure drive recurring revenue streams. We will continue to focus on leveraging technology as a competitive advantage and a driver of increased margins.”\nGiven the changes to the federal corporate income tax rate, Transcat expects its blended income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to range between 28% and 29%. For fiscal year 2019, the Company expects its effective income tax rate to be approximately 26%.\nThe Company tightened its capital expenditures expectations for the full year fiscal 2018 to a range of $6.0 million to $6.3 million, which is being used primarily for IT infrastructure investments to drive operational excellence, specific customer-opportunity driven Service capabilities and additional assets for the Company’s growing rental business.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nTranscat will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET. Management will review the financial and operating results for the third quarter, as well as the Company’s strategy and outlook. A question and answer session will follow the formal discussion. The review will be accompanied by a slide presentation, which will be available at www.transcat.com/investor-relations . The conference call can be accessed by calling (201) 689-8471. Alternatively, the webcast can be monitored at www.transcat.com/investor-relations .\nA telephonic replay will be available from 2:00 p.m. ET on the day of the call through Tuesday, February 6, 2018. To listen to the archived call, dial (412) 317-6671 and enter conference ID number 13675052, or access the webcast replay at www.transcat.com/investor-relations , where a transcript will be posted once available.\nNOTE 1 – Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting net income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measure, we present Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense), which is a non-GAAP measure. The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, and stock-based compensation expense, which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is included. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating its business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. See the attached Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table on page 9.\nABOUT TRANSCAT\nTranscat, Inc. is a leading provider of accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services.
