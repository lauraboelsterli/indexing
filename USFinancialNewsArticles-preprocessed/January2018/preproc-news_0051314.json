Under his dynamic leadership, we expect to leverage our dominant position in the revenue cycle management market and expand to other markets with our innovative technologies and superior services.”\nWheeler has a strong track record of delivering business growth, and is an accomplished senior-level executive with more than 30 years of proven marketing strategy and go-to-market executive skills. In addition to co-founding two start-ups, he previously served as an EVP of global marketing for several large public companies including Compaq, Tandem and Citrix. He also served as the CMO for several VC-funded companies including DocuSign. Wheeler graduated from the Harvard Business School Executive Business Management program and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in computer information systems from Purdue University. He also serves on the corporate board of advisors for Purdue University's School of Technology and is an inductee into the Purdue University distinguished alumni.\n“XIFIN and its unique blend of technology and services have become the standard and relied upon partner for laboratories seeking greater profitability and better patient outcomes,” said Wheeler. “I’m eager to have a leadership role in a growth company that delivers incredibly valuable technology solutions, and I am excited to lead marketing initiatives that will further expand the company's market opportunity and growth.”\nThe addition of Wheeler comes at a time of increasing momentum at XIFIN. The company recently announced its next generation revenue cycle management solution, XIFIN RPM 9 , on which hundreds of laboratories rely to process more than 200 million medical claims annually. In addition, the company launched a next generation sequencing module XIFIN LIS Anywhere for NGS , to expand its laboratory information system.
