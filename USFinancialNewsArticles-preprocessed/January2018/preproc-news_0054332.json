I‘m going to knock you out,” Alvarez said in Spanish in an online promotion of the fight. \nGolovkin, who holds the WBA, WBC, IBF and IBO belts, is unbeaten with a 37-0-1 record while Alvarez is 49-1-2, with his only loss coming against Floyd Mayweather in 2013. \n“This time we won’t need the judges,” said Golovkin, who is also nicknamed ‘Triple G.’ Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
