    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde said it was reassuring that exploratory talks between Germany’s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) had been successful and urged a new government to show global leadership.\nMerkel’s conservatives and the SPD agreed to a coalition blueprint last week but it is not yet clear whether they will proceed to full-blown coalition negotiations - the SPD is due to vote on that on Sunday.\nAsked by broadcaster n-tv what she expected from a new government in Europe’s largest economy, Lagarde said: “Germany is a key player and it must demonstrate leadership in Europe and the world.”\nReporting by Michelle Martin and Paul Carrel\n ",
