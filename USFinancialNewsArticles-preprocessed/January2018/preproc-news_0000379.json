(OTCQB:EVIO), a life sciences company and leading provider of quality control testing and advisory services to the regulated cannabis industry, is pleased to announce the appointment of Al Lustig as President of EVIO, Inc., reporting to William Waldrop, EVIO Chief Executive Officer. Lustig’s primary responsibility will be to drive EVIO’s growth in both new and existing markets by developing and executing national and international sales and operational strategies.\nLustig joins EVIO after completing a successful 30-year career at Pfizer Inc.

While at Pfizer, he also led many cross functional teams and partnered with senior leadership to help integrate Sales, Marketing, Medical, Operations, Strategy & Analytics and Government Relations across business operations.\nWilliam Waldrop, EVIO CEO states, “As we embark upon our next stage of rapid growth, Al’s history of recognized success in corporate growth and sales leadership at Pfizer, one of the world’s largest bio-pharmaceutical companies, makes him the perfect fit to help lead EVIO into 2018 and beyond. We look forward to leveraging Al’s leadership and expertise from the pharmaceutical sector. Current EVIO President and Chief Operating Officer Lori Glauser has resigned from her position as President to make room for Al in the Senior Leadership team.
