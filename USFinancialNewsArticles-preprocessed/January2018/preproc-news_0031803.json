    "text": "MONTERREY, Mexico, Jan. 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Deutsche Bank Mexico, S.A., Banking institution, Trust Division F/1616 or Fibra Inn (BMV:FINN13) (ADR OTC:DFBRY) (“Fibra Inn” or “the Company”), a Mexican real estate investment trust internally managed specializing in the hotel industry serving the business traveler, announced today that it issue new Senior Notes to refinance its current liabilities in order to improve the Company’s debt profile and convert it to a fixed interest rate. This will be conducted through two simultaneous processes:\nA Debt Tender Offer through the partial and early repurchase of FINN 15 local debt, maturing in 2021, for a total of up to Ps. 1,875.4 million; and\nA new debt issuance, FINN 18, at a 10-year fixed interest rate for up to Ps. 2 billion.\nNearly all of the proceeds will be used to partially refinance the FINN 15 local debt issuance, thereby, Fibra Inn’s overall leverage levels will not be affected. The objective is to align the Company’s debt maturity profile with Fibra Inn’s strategy for the upcoming years.\nThe FINN15 Debt Tender Offer will have a repurchase price of Ps. 100 per certificate (nominal value) and will take place between January 4 and 31 of 2018. The settlement date is February 2, 2018.\nThe new issuance of Trust Certificates (“CBF”) FINN 18 is under the debt program for up to Ps. 5.0 billion that was approved by the Mexican Banking and Securities Commission. As with previous issuances, the local debt ratings remained the same, at AA- (mex) by Fitch Ratings and AA+ by HR. This new issuance of unsecured CBFs will pay semi-annual interest, using the reference rate of the 10-year Federal Government M Bond and the principal payment will be due at maturity. The Company is entitled to prepay the full amount of the issuance at any time by paying a premium. The payment premium will be waived in the last 18 months. The book building will take place on January 31, 2018 and the issuance will take place on February 1, 2018.\nMiguel Aliaga, Chief Financial Officer, stated: “Fibra Inn is committed to maintaining a financial strategy that is healthy and responsible and with this issuance the Company improves its debt profile. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the Company had available resources totaling Ps. 651 million derived from cash, VAT reimbursements and debt. It is important to mention that after this issuance Fibra Inn’s estimated leverage will remain below 30%.”\nAbout the Company\nFibra Inn is a Mexican trust formed primarily to acquire, develop and rent a broad range of hotel properties in Mexico aimed at the business traveler.
