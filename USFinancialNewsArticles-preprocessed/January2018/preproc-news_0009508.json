REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo \nUnder the agreement, Sanofi will obtain global development and commercialization rights to fitusiran, currently in development for the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B. \nGlobal commercialization of fitusiran will be done by Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, while Alnylam will receive royalties based on net sales of fitusiran products. \nFitusiran complements Sanofi Genzyme’s rare hematology portfolio and will bring an innovative new treatment for people living with hemophilia, one of the most common rare diseases. \nAlnylam will obtain global development and commercialization rights to a new treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, a rare disease caused by the build-up of an abnormal protein. \n“The restructured alliance reflects Sanofi Genzyme’s sustained interest in the strong potential of Alnylam’s portfolio of genetic medicines,” said Bill Sibold, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Genzyme. \nSanofi said it will continue to have the right to opt into other Alnylam rare genetic disease programs for development and commercialization in territories outside of the United States, Canada and Western Europe, as well as one right to a global license.
