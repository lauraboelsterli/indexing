    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus ( AIR.PA ) is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Beijing next week, people familiar with the negotiations said.\nMacron plans to visit on January 8-10, accompanied by 50 company executives including planemaking officials from Airbus.\nThe value of a deal for around 100 aircraft would be over $10 billion at list prices, but could rise sharply depending on the breakdown between single-aisle and wide-body jets.\nThe total number of aircraft has yet to be agreed and has historically depended on last-minute commercial negotiations that coincide with such diplomatic visits.\nChina’s central purchasing agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, did not respond to a request for comment.\nA spokeswoman for Airbus in China said: “Discussions with customers are always going on, but we do not comment on speculation.”\nIn November, Boeing ( BA.N ) agreed to sell 300 planes worth $37 billion at list prices to China during a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nReporting by Tim Hepher, Brenda Goh, Michel Rose; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain\n ",
