    "text": "Heidi Petty | CNBC Richard Kovacevich \nFormer Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich told CNBC on Tuesday that he believes bitcoin is a scam. \n\"I think it's a pyramid scheme. It makes no sense. I'm just surprised it isn't even lower,\" he said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \nBitcoin tumbled to a six-week low early Tuesday, falling below $12,000 for the first time since Dec. 5, according to CoinDesk, before paring some of those losses. \nComments from South Korea's finance minister renewed concerns about a crackdown in one of the largest markets for digital currency trading.
