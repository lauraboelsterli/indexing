    "text": "January 8, 2018 / 8:24 PM / Updated 31 minutes ago Rallying - Peterhansel leads the Dakar but al-Attiyah hits back Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Defending champion Stephane Peterhansel took over the lead of the Dakar Rally on Monday, the third driver in three days to hit the front, while Qatar’s Nasser al-Attiyah won the stage in southern Peru.

It was not a big push, because the road really isn’t easy and very dangerous in places,” he said.

REUTERS/Andres Stapff \n“It’s good, except for yesterday when we opened (the road)which was very difficult for us because there were no lines, but I think we are in a good way now.” \nNine-times world rally champion Sebastian Loeb, also in a Peugeot, dropped to fourth after finishing more than eight and a half minutes behind the Qatari. \nIt was a bad day for Spanish driver Nani Roma, a Dakar winner on motorcycle and car, who rolled his Mini near the finish and suffered head and neck injuries. \nRoma finished the stage, with co-driver Alex Haro largely unhurt, but was flown by helicopter to a nearby airport for medical checks in Lima. \nBritain’s Sam Sunderland, the Dubai-based defending champion, went back to the top of the motorcycle standings after Honda’s overnight leader Joan Barreda lost his way and dropped almost 28 minutes. \nSunderland won the stage, his second victory for KTM in three days, to lead Honda’s Argentine rider Kevin Benavides by four minutes and 38 seconds. \nTuesday’s fourth stage starts and ends in San Juan de Marcona after a 330km special stage that includes one of the longest sandy sections in the event’s history.
