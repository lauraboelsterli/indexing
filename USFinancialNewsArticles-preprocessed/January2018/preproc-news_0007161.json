    "text": "January 7, 2018 / 4:48 PM / Updated an hour ago Trump tweet on nuclear button keeps North Korea's Kim 'on his toes' - Haley Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet about having a bigger nuclear button than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s has kept Kim “on his toes” and makes clear the risks of a nuclear standoff, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday. FILE PHOTO: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves to people attending a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father, Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo \nAfter Kim asserted that he had a nuclear button at the ready, Trump last week dismissed the taunt by saying in a tweet that the U.S. button at his disposal was bigger and more powerful. \nThe comment drew criticism, including from former Vice President Joe Biden, who said it caused allies to lose confidence in Washington. \nAsked on the ABC programme “This Week” whether the president’s tweet was a good idea, Haley said: “I think that (Trump) always has to keep Kim on his toes. It’s very important that we don’t ever let him get so arrogant that he doesn’t realise the reality of what would happen if he started a nuclear war.” \nHaley said North Korea should be clear that the United States will not reduce pressure on Kim. \n“We’re not going to let them go and dramatize the fact that they have a button right on their desk and they can destroy America,” she said. “We want to always remind them we can destroy you too, so be very cautious and careful with your words and what you do.” Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe",
