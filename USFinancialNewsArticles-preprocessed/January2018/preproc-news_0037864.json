    "text": "No specific driver was immediately apparent behind Tuesday's decline, which has taken bitcoin more than 25% lower for the year so far. Tuesday's losses did come as more details emerged around South Korea's efforts to limit speculation in cryptocurrencies. The South Korean Financial Services Commission announced Tuesday that a proposed ban on anonymous trading accounts will take effect Jan. 30. \"Those who do not have their real-name accounts at the same bank with the exchanges will not be allowed to make new deposits into the exchanges' accounts. They will be only allowed to make withdrawals,\" a release said. The commission also announced guidelines for financial institutions to prevent cryptocurrency-related money laundering. CLOSE A bitcoin conference is no longer allowing customers to buy tickets with Bitcoin, because the transactions are too much of a burden, according to NYMag. Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60 The share of bitcoin trading in South Korean won remained steady around 4.6%, while U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading had the largest share at 37%, according to CryptoCompare. The Japanese yen had the second-greatest share, near 32% of bitcoin trading volume. The Cboe bitcoin futures traded slightly higher near $10,270, while the CME bitcoin futures were 1% lower around $10,225 Tuesday morning. Other major digital currencies traded lower Tuesday morning, but near the prior day's lows. Ethereum, the second largest digital currency by market capitalization, traded more than 6% lower near $939, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple, the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell more than 8.5% to $1.24, the website showed. Â© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
