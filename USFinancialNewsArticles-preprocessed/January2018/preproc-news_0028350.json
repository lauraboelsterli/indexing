The previous yearly record for purchases was the C$171.77 billion in 2016. \nNon-residents bought C$17.75 billion worth of Canadian bonds, around half of which were federal bonds, and C$2.32 billion in money market paper. They sold C$507 million in stocks. \nCanadians sold a net C$4.59 billion of international securities in November, the first divestment in four months.
