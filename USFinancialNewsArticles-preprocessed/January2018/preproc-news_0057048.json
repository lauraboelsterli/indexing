Today I am realising one of my dreams to pull on the shirt of such a great club,” Emerson told the club’s official website (www.chelseafc.com). \n“English football is something I have been watching since I was 15 years old. It is a really beautiful game over here but it is going to be even more beautiful to play it,” he added. \nBritish newspapers reported on Tuesday that Chelsea were close to signing France striker Olivier Giroud from Arsenal.
