    "text": "KIGALI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Germany’s Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it would start assembling three vehicle models at a new plant in Rwanda in May for local sale and use in its own new ride-sharing service.\nThe company said it planned to spend $20 million to start developing the assembly plant and ride-hailing service - part of a push into sub-Saharan Africa.\nThomas Schaefer, chief executive of Volkswagen Group South Africa, said they were trying to wean East African drivers off second-hand imports.\n“We are trying to break this thought-pattern that Africa is poor; they can’t afford (new) cars,” he told a news conference.\nVolkswagen will produce three models; the Hatchback Polo, the Passat and possibly the Teramont, a large sports utility vehicle, it said in a statement.\nThe carmaker said it had registered a local company to run its ride-sharing service and signed up a local software firm to develop a smartphone application to hail rides.\nGlobal ride-sharing companies such as Uber have not yet moved into Rwanda.\nVolkswagen said 500-1,000 jobs would be created in the first phase of the investment, including the drivers of the first batch of cars for the ride-hailing service.\nSchaefer said the service will feed demand for the assembly plant, since vehicles in the scheme will be driven all the time, forcing the need for constant replacement.\nThere were 300,000 cars in Rwanda last year, in a country of 12 million people, the CEO of the Rwanda Development Board, Clare Akamanzi, said as she welcomed the deal. Most of the cars on the roads are second-hand imports from countries such as Japan. (Writing by Duncan Miriri)\n ",
