The Dow hit the 26,000-mark for the first time but closed more than 200 points below that level.\nFord slipped 5.2 percent after the automaker reported full-year 2017 profit below estimates and provided a downbeat forecast.\nData showed U.S. industrial production increased more than expected in December as unseasonably cold weather boosted demand for heating.\nThe Federal Reserve said industrial output surged 0.9 percent last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.4 percent increase.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,742 to 799. On the Nasdaq, 1,564 issues rose and 749 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
