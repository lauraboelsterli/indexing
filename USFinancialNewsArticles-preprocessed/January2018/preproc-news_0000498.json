The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018.\nU.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels.\nStrong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude.\nOnly rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, is somewhat hampering the outlook into 2018.\n\"We think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC's market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,\" Barclays bank said on Tuesday.\nU.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, driven largely by onshore tight shale oil fields, has risen by almost 16 percent since mid-2016, to 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.\nConsultancy Rystad Energy said \"U.S. crude oil production capacity has reached 10 million barrels per day.\"\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin)",
