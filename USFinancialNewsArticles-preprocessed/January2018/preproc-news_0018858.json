Tuesday’s rulings forbid SPI from describing vodkas and other drinks it sells as “Russian” or “Imported from Russia.”\nDocuments in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce showed Spirits International had net profit of more than 100 million euros ($110 million) in the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012 before it moved offices to Curacao.
