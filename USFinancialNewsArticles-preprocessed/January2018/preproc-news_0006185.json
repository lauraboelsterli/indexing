    "text": "January 7, 2018 / 1:58 PM / Updated an hour ago Fresenius CFO backs acquisition course: Boersen-Zeitung Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius ( FREG.DE ) will continue to look for acquisitions even if that leads to a temporary rise in debt, Boersen-Zeitung quoted the company’s finance chief as saying. \nLast year Fresenius bought U.S. generic drugmaker Akorn Inc ( AKRX.O ) for $4.8 billion, the biosimilars arm of Germany’s Merck KGaA for as much as 670 million euros ($806 mln) and closed a 5.8 billion euro acquisition of Spanish hospital chain Quironsalud. \nRachel Empey, finance chief since last August, was asked in an interview with Boersen-Zeitung whether she unhesitatingly backed the proactive acquisition strategy. “By all means,” she said. \n“Fresenius generates a very high and above all stable free cash flow and is able to scale back the debt burden after acquisitions quickly,” Empey, a British national who joined Fresenius in August from Telefonica Deutschland 02Dn.DE, said in the interview published on Saturday.
