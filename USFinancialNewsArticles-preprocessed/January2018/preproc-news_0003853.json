The transaction took place on December 22, 2017. C&M is a leading designer and manufacturer of wire & cable and coil cords for performance-critical applications. The company serves blue-chip customers across a variety of growing markets including industrial automation, medical and military. Based in Norwalk, Connecticut, Winchester is a designer and manufacturer of connectivity solutions, including both connectors and cable assemblies, for diversified end markets including medical, military, aerospace and semiconductor.\nC&M has transformed its business over the past nine years, following its acquisition by the Watermill Group in 2008.

In addition, C&M upgraded its facility, equipment and capabilities, including completing a major facility move and retrofit process. A new management team has also taken the helm to ensure engineering leadership, along with the delivery of high-performance products and exceptional customer service.\n“The C&M of today is quite different from the firm we originally acquired, and we have been proud partners through their strategic journey,” stated Timothy Eburne, Partner, the Watermill Group. “As a result of Watermill’s strategy development and implementation process, C&M evolved from a family owned job shop in an aging facility serving increasingly commoditized end markets into a professional, tightly run operation in a modern facility with a unique position in custom wire and cable. Their transformation is evidence that the application of strategic vision combined with hands on operational support can create lasting impact for businesses and employees.”\nWatermill and C&M were represented by M&A Advisor Sperry, Mitchell & Co and legal advisor K&L Gates LLP.\nAbout the Watermill Group\nThe Watermill Group is a strategy-driven private investment firm that helps companies achieve their full potential through strategic transformation.
