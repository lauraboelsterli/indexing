Perpetual bondholders would be offered $15 million, or less than 4 percent of face value.\nCreditors would end up owning 70 percent of the restructured company, management would get up to 20 percent, and existing shareholders would own just 10 percent.\n“The creditors are all savvy operators who will now be in the driver’s seat, which will raise the prospect of a turnaround,” said Tang from United First Partners.\n“Everyone involved has lost - (although) the distressed investors are best positioned when Noble turns around,” Tang said. The company did not name the creditors with which it struck a deal.\nNoble shares fell as much as 23 percent on Tuesday and were last down 13 percent at 0.22 Singapore dollars, giving it a market value of just $263 million. That is in sharp contrast to a valuation of $6 billion that it commanded in February 2015.\nNoble was founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build the company into one of the world’s biggest traders, but it plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research started questioning its books. Noble has stood by its accounting.\nElman is Noble’s biggest shareholder with a stake of just over 18 percent. Other large investors include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and Orbis Investment Management.\nThe proposed debt-for-equity deal has to be approved by regulators and Noble’s shareholders.\n($1 = 1.3127 Singapore dollars)\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ",
