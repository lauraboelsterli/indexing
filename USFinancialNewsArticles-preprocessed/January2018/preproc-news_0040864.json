( PLD.N ) have sold 27 logistics properties from their joint U.S. portfolio to a unit of Blackstone ( BX.N ), the fund said in a statement on Thursday.\nNorges Bank Real Estate Management received $110.1 million for its 45 percent ownership in the Chicago, Florida and New Jersey buildings, which were acquired as part of a larger portfolio in May 2015.\nThe fund said it had also bought a stake in a logistics property in San Francisco, paying $29.1 million for a 45 percent stake, while Prologis would buy the rest and manage the site.\nReporting by Terje Solsvik; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
