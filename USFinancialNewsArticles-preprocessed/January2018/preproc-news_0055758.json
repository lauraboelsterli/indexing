    "text": "BORDEAUX, France, Jan 30 (Reuters) - France’s coastguard on Tuesday launched a search operation for Pierre Agnes, the chief executive of surfwear company Boardriders, after his sailing boat was found on a beach on France’s Atlantic coast, the local prefecture said.\nBoardriders owns the Quicksilver brand.\nAgnes, 54, set sail early on Tuesday morning, before sending a message to port authorities indicating that he was delaying his return because of thick fog. His boat was found near Hossegor.\nBoardriders, which is 85-percent controlled by U.S. private equity firm Oaktree Capital, owns the Quicksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes brands.
