    "text": "OBERSDORF, GERMANY (Reuters) - World ski jumping champions Norway won their second successive men’s team title after effervescent performances by individual gold medalist Daniel Andre Tande and compatriot Andreas Stjernen on Sunday.\nStjernen produced the day’s longest jump of 231 meters and Tande, who was victorious in the individual event on Saturday, steered the four-man team with a pair of solid flights as Norway blew away the field.\nSlovenia finished second for their first team medal and Poland came third in the eight-team competition.\nSlideshow (2 Images) With distance and style marks from the judges determining the tally, Norway finished with 1662.2 points, ahead of Slovenia (1,615.8)and Poland (1592.1) who snatched the bronze medal ahead of hosts Germany.\nMissing out on a podium finish in the team competition compounded Germany’s threadbare weekend as they only had Richard Freitag’s bronze medal in the individual event to cheer with Poland’s Kamil Stoch finishing second.\nThe double joy was a boost for Norway ahead of the upcoming Feb. 9-25 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with the Germans now facing a difficult task to defend their title from the high-flying Scandinavians.\nWriting by Zoran Milosavljevic in Belgrade; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
