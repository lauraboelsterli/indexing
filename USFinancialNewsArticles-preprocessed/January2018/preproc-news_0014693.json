Cowell takes over from Kathleen Powers Dunlap, who is retiring from the position.\n“I am excited to welcome Janet to her new position as Chief Executive of Girls Who Invest. Janet is a highly accomplished industry professional, and she will propel our organization and its mission to the next level of growth,” said Seema R.

It is an honor to pass the mantle to Janet as she takes Girls Who Invest—and the industry’s transformation—forward.”\nAbout Janet Cowell\nJanet Cowell is the Chief Executive Officer of Girls Who Invest. From 2009 to 2016, she served as the State Treasurer of North Carolina, the first woman to hold that position. As State Treasurer, Ms. Cowell successfully managed more than $100 billion in assets and health and retirement benefits for 900,000 members. Previously she was a two-term member of the Raleigh City Council and a two-term Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate, representing Wake County.\nMs. Cowell earned her BA in Non-Western History from the University of Pennsylvania and her MBA from The Wharton School.\nAbout Seema R.

With the help of our industry and academic partners, we are developing a pipeline of highly qualified young women to take on substantial roles in the asset management industry. Our goal is to see 30% of the world’s investable capital managed by women by 2030 (’30 by 30’). Our approach is simple and practical: Create a pipeline of talented, motivated young women through an intensive educational program, a meaningful paid internship experience and a robust ongoing community.
