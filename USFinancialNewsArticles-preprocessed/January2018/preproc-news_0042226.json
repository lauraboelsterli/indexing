    "text": "Fourth quarter 2017 net income per diluted share was $1.18; Operating EPS was $1.18\nOne-time negative impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) in the quarter of $2.08 per diluted share\nFourth quarter 2017 net income per diluted share excluding the impact from the Tax Act was $3.26; Operating EPS excluding the impact from the Tax Act was $3.26, up 19 percent\nFull year 2017 net income per diluted share excluding the impact from the Tax Act was $11.49; Operating EPS excluding the impact from the Tax Act was $12.27, up 45 percent\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $181 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, and operating earnings of $182 million, or $1.18 per diluted share. Results included a $320 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, impact from the enactment in the fourth quarter of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act will be an ongoing benefit to the company, with the estimated effective tax rate in the 17 to 19 percent range over the near term.\nExcluding the impact of the Tax Act, fourth quarter 2017 operating earnings increased 13 percent to $502 million, with operating earnings per share up 19 percent to $3.26.\nFourth quarter 2017 return on equity excluding AOCI was 24.8 percent and operating ROE excluding AOCI was 26.9 percent. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, operating ROE excluding AOCI was 32.3 percent compared to 22.2 percent in the prior year.\nFull year 2017 net income per diluted share was $9.44 and operating earnings per diluted share was $10.23. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, operating earnings per diluted share was $12.27, up 45 percent compared to 2016.\n“Ameriprise had an excellent fourth quarter and a strong 2017 as we served more clients and experienced good asset growth across the firm,” said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. “We’re well positioned to build on our momentum and further differentiate Ameriprise as a financial services leader.”\n“Our strong growth, driven by our wealth management business, reflects the value of the advice and solutions we provide, and we are increasingly being recognized for high client satisfaction, loyalty, trust and forgiveness.\n“The lower corporate tax rate will increase cash flow generation, providing additional flexibility to invest for business growth and to generate a differentiated capital return to shareholders. While our fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted, we expect the ongoing benefits from tax reform will more than offset the one-time accounting impacts in short order.”\nGAAP Results – Fourth quarter\nNet revenues were $3.2 billion driven by strong growth in Advice & Wealth Management that was partially offset by the impact of 12b-1 fee changes.\nExpenses of $2.6 billion decreased 1 percent, or $33 million, from a year ago.\nOperating Results – Fourth quarter\nOperating net revenue increased 10 percent to $3.2 billion after normalizing for the net impacts of 12b-1 fees and the one-time impact of the Tax Act. Advice & Wealth Management net revenues increased 17 percent driven by growth in client assets after normalizing for the net impacts of 12b-1 fees.\nOperating expenses of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent from a year ago. General and administrative expenses increased 6 percent reflecting the timing of accruals and payments for performance-related compensation, as well as foreign exchange translation. Adjusting for these items, underlying general and administrative expenses remained well managed and were essentially flat.\nTaxes\nThe fourth quarter 2017 operating effective tax rate included a $320 million impact primarily from the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, repatriation tax and lower future tax benefits from low income housing assets. This was a one-time, primarily non-cash, accounting adjustment. Excluding these impacts, the operating effective tax rate was 23.0 percent. Taxes in the current quarter also reflect the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2017, which had a favorable $13 million impact in the quarter and reduced the tax rate by 2 percentage points.\nThe company estimates that its ongoing effective tax rate will be in the 17 to 19 percent range over the near term. The lower corporate tax rate will have an ongoing benefit to earnings and the company expects to earn back the initial charge within two years.\nAmeriprise Financial, Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nAmeriprise is transforming its business mix\nTotal assets under management and administration increased 14 percent to a record $897 billion reflecting ongoing strength in Ameriprise advisor client net inflows and market appreciation. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management generated 73 percent of pretax operating earnings in the quarter, excluding the corporate and other segment. In the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $302 million and paid $123 million in quarterly dividends. For the full year, the company repurchased 9.9 million shares for $1.3 billion and paid $502 million in quarterly dividends, which represented 96 percent of 2017 operating earnings, excluding the tax impact. Additionally, the company completed its acquisitions of Investment Professionals Inc. (IPI) and Lionstone Investments (Lionstone). The company’s risk-based capital ratio declined to approximately 435 percent at year-end primarily due to the Tax Act and the ratio is expected to increase during 2018 from improved cash generation from the lower tax rate.\nWealth manager generating strong results\nAdvice & Wealth Management client assets increased to a record $560 billion reflecting continued strength in fee-based investment advisory (wrap) net inflows, with net inflows of $5.0 billion in the quarter. Total wrap assets were $248 billion, one of the largest in the industry. Operating net revenue per advisor increased 15 percent normalizing for net 12b-1 fee impacts. Growth reflects the full service financial planning advisors provide clients, industry-leading technology and tools, as well as dedicated field leadership and support. The company is an attractive destination for productive advisors, with 99 experienced advisors joining the firm during the quarter.\nGlobal asset manager with broad capabilities and competitive margins\nAsset Management AUM grew to $495 billion, reflecting market appreciation partially offset by net outflows. Investment performance in retail and institutional equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios and strategies remains strong. At quarter end, the company had 114 four- and five-star Morningstar-rated funds. The company completed its acquisition of Lionstone, a leading national real estate investment firm specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. The acquisition added $5.4 billion in assets. Columbia Threadneedle launched the Columbia Adaptive Retirement Series for the retirement marketplace and won the Multi-Asset Manager of the Year Award at the Professional Pensions Investment Awards 2017 in London.\nAnnuities and Protection businesses focused on serving our wealth management clients\nVariable annuity account balances increased 7 percent to $80 billion and VUL/UL account balances increased 9 percent to $12.5 billion. RiverSource Annuities launched the RiverSource Assured SM Fixed Index annuity, a long-term retirement savings vehicle that can add stability to clients’ retirement portfolios by helping to protect principal from market downturns and provide opportunities for growth.\nValues-based, client-focused firm\nAmeriprise ranked #1 in customer loyalty in the investment industry in Temkin Group’s Temkin Loyalty Index, which evaluates the loyalty of 10,000 U.S. consumers on how likely they are to perform five behaviors: recommending the company to others, forgiving the company if it makes a mistake, trusting the company, repurchasing from the company and trying the company’s new offerings. On November 10, 2017, more than 8,000 Ameriprise employees, financial advisors and clients participated in a day of service serving meals, sorting donations and stacking shelves at 450 company-sponsored events nationwide. The November event provided more than 1 million meals for people in need ahead of the holiday season. For the 12th consecutive year, Ameriprise received a 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality.
