Telephone calls to its spokesman remained unanswered. \nLeshi shares will resume trading on Wednesday after a nine-month suspension, it said in a filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange on Tuesday. \nThe company asked in April for trading to be suspended pending an acquisition of LeEco’s film unit for 9.8 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), a plan it eventually scrapped last week. \nLeshi, which makes internet-connected TVs and produces video entertainment, said Jia and various non-listed units of LeEco owed it 7.5 billion yuan at the end of November. \nLeEco on Monday disputed the debt amount, saying it only owed Leshi 6 billion yuan, half of which it has arranged to repay soon. \nLeshi, which said on Tuesday that China’s TV market is estimated to have declined by 5-10 percent in 2017, has loans and liabilities totalling 9.29 billion yuan ($1.45 billion). Part of that will be due in 2018, it said last week. \nLeshi said it expects to report a loss for 2017 and warned that it would run into “operational difficulty” if it does not receive new funds to repay its own debt. \nIt also scrapped a plan to inject LeEco’s film unit into the listed company, a transaction pending which Leshi’s stock had been suspended from trading since April. \nLeshi, once the main listed vehicle of LeEco, is now controlled by property developer Sunac China, its second-largest shareholder with an 8.56 percent stake.
