    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his primary concern with the Paris climate accord was that it treated the United States unfairly and that if a better deal could be reached, Washington might be persuaded to rejoin the agreement.\n“It treated the United States very unfairly,” Trump said during a news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.\nHe said he had no problem with agreeing to a climate deal but the Paris accord was “a bad deal. So we could conceivably go back in.”\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by David Alexander\n ",
