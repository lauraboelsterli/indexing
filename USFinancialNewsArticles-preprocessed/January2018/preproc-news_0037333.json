    "text": "UNIONDALE, N.Y., Jan. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flushing Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FFIC), the parent holding company for Flushing Bank (the “Bank”), announced that the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the dividend in 2018 by two cents per share per quarter and provide each full-time and part-time employee with a one-time bonus, of $1,000 and $500 respectively, as a result of the benefits derived from the recent tax reform.\nJohn R. Buran, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Beginning in 2018, the Company expects to retain a larger share of corporate earnings thanks to the recently enacted reductions in the federal corporate tax rate. Our key stakeholders are our investors who have placed their trust in our Company and our employees, our greatest asset, who are the backbone of our organization. The Board of Directors and our executive team feel strongly that our shareholders and employees should share in this benefit. Our plan is to increase our quarterly dividend in 2018 to $0.20 per share - an 11% increase from prior year. The bonus which we recently distributed to all non-executive employees was grossed up to provide $1,000 and $500 payouts. It was well received by our employees. We also plan to continue to invest in our business through technology, people, and the communities we serve.”\nAbout Flushing Financial Corporation\nFlushing Financial Corporation (Nasdaq:FFIC) is the holding company for Flushing Bank®, a New York State-chartered commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
