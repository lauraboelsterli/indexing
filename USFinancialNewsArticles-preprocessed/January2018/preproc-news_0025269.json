    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MoviePass ™, the nation's premier movie-theater subscription service and a majority-owned subsidiary of Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (NASDAQ:HMNY), today announced the hire of Natasha Mulla as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Mulla, a savvy media industry veteran, joins MoviePass from her previous position as Senior Vice President of Marketing at Mashable.\nMoviePass Hires Natasha Mulla as Company’s First Chief Marketing Officer\nMulla’s addition to MoviePass’ growing executive team comes as MoviePass continues to experience a significant and rapid rise of subscribers in the wake of the massively popular $9.95 per month subscription plan rolled out in August 2017.\nAs CMO, Mulla will oversee MoviePass’ brand identity across all platforms. She will develop long-term marketing strategies in order to grow MoviePass’ subscriber base in key markets, and will work closely with the product team to continue to improve and enhance the overall customer experience.\n“MoviePass has already proven to be one of the fastest growing subscription services, generating over 1.5 million new subscribers in under five months,” Mulla said. “The company has seen great success throughout media and entertainment. I look forward to helping the team strategize and execute on programs to expand our already incredible customer base and continue to build a trusted and sustainable brand.”\nIn her previous role at Mashable, Mulla oversaw the development of that company’s brand and image. She assisted with public relations and global events, including organizing initiatives for the Mashable House at SXSW and the Social Good Summit in New York. Prior to Mashable, Mulla was Director of Events for Haymarket Media, an international publishing company, producing both online and in-person award shows and conferences across multiple brands and industries. She now brings her valuable experience to MoviePass, where her knowledge of the current media landscape will serve to maintain and increase awareness for MoviePass as it continues to grow.\n“We’re thrilled to have Natasha join the team as we continue to grow,” said CEO Mitch Lowe. “The type of rapid subscriber increase we’ve experienced can make it challenging to remain focused on delivering a great customer experience, and we believe that Natasha will be invaluable in helping us stay on track, while strategically orienting around the MoviePass brand. Her experience, dedication, and passion for the service are going to be hugely important as we move forward in our mission to fundamentally improve the movie-going experience.”\nAbout MoviePass\nMoviePass, Inc. is a technology company dedicated to enhancing the exploration of cinema.
