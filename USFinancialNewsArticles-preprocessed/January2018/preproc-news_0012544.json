    "text": "Fourth Quarter Operating Income Continues to be Expected in the Range of $2M - $4M\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New York & Company, Inc. [NYSE:NWY], a specialty apparel chain with 459 retail stores, today commented on its holiday performance and fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook ahead of its presentation at the 20 th Annual ICR Conference. Comparable store sales for the nine-week period ended December 30, 2017 (“holiday period”) increased approximately 3% as compared to the prior year period. The Company continues to expect comparable store sales for the full quarter to be up in the low single-digit percentage range, as compared to the same period last year.\nThe Company detailed that with four weeks remaining in the quarter it continues to expect its fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 operating results to reflect operating income in the range of $2.0 million to $4.0 million. The Company plans to report actual results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 in March 2018.\nGregory Scott, New York & Company’s CEO, stated: “We had a strong holiday performance that included positive comparable sales and expansion in gross margin demonstrating the success of our strategy. Indeed, our ongoing ability to differentiate our stores with exclusive celebrity brands, reach existing and new consumers with effective digital marketing campaigns and capitalize on our increased omni-channel capabilities has served us well in the final quarter of the year. At the same time, we continue to benefit from increased royalties under the private label credit agreement and efficiencies from our supply chain, which contributed to improvement in gross margin. In addition, we also maintain stringent control of inventory and expense with continued real estate optimization, including reduced rents. Combined, this is expected to result in a significant increase in profitability for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year as compared to the prior year periods.”\nICR Conference\nAs previously announced, the Company will be meeting with analysts and investors and presenting at the 20 th Annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida. The Company’s presentation will be held on Tuesday, January 9, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and will be webcast live at www.nyandcompany.com .\nAbout New York & Company\nNew York & Company, Inc. is an omni-channel women’s fashion retailer designing on-trend and versatile collections at a great value.
