    "text": "LIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITRI) (the “Company”) today announced the pricing of the previously announced private offering of $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 5.000% senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued in the offering at an issue price equal to 100.000% of principal, plus accrued interest from Dec. 22, 2017. The Notes being offered are additional notes under the indenture pursuant to which the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% senior notes due 2026 on Dec. 22, 2017. The Notes will be treated as a single series with and will have the same terms as, the existing 2026 notes.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to refinance existing indebtedness, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Notes will be offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the related guarantees will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy or sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell the securities described herein. There shall not be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nNo Offer or Solicitation\nThis communication is neither an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis communication may contain “forward-looking” statements, as defined in federal securities laws including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections.
