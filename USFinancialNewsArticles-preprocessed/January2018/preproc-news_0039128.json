    "text": "CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) â€” The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline jumped 4 cents nationally over the past two weeks to $2.58.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the increase is due to higher crude oil costs.\nThe current gas price is 22 cents above where it was a year ago.\nGas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.26 a gallon. The lowest was in Tucson, Arizona, at $2.16 a gallon.\nThe U.S. average diesel price is $2.99, up 5 cents from two weeks ago.",
