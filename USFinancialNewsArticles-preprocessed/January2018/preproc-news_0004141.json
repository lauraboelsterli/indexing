    "text": "HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA (Reuters) - Dozens of flights were canceled and thousands of people were left without power in Eastern Canada on Thursday as the region felt the early impact of a massive storm arriving from the United States.\nIce begins to collect at the base of the Horseshoe Falls in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron Lynett More than 17,000 businesses and homes were without electricity in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, according to the Nova Scotia Power website. Most departing and arriving flights were canceled or delayed at Halifax Stanfield airport.\nIn Montreal, 85 flights were canceled on Thursday because of snowstorms affecting airports in Canada’s so-called “Maritime” provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island and through much of the Eastern United States, an airport spokeswoman said.\n“For the Maritimes, it is a cocktail of precipitation and strong winds,” Environment Canada meteorologist Jean-Philippe Begin said by phone.\nThe fast-developing storm bringing high winds and heavy snowfall has been dubbed by forecasters as a “weather bomb,” a “bombogenesis” or “bomb cyclone.” Wind speeds of up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) an hour are expected in some parts of the Maritimes, Begin said, and the storm will also dump up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) of snow in areas of Eastern Quebec.\nReporting by Darren Calabrese in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Writing by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Jim Finkle and Bernadette Baum\n ",
