    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, Jan. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pengrowth Energy Corporation (TSX:PGF) (NYSE:PGH) today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a 2018 capital expenditure budget of $65 million. 2018 capital spending will be focused on adding production volumes at the Company’s two 100 percent owned and operated assets at Lindbergh and Groundbirch.\nThe 2018 capital budget is expected to grow production volumes through the course of the year from a December 2017 exit production rate of approximately 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), excluding the Quirk Creek production volumes, to an estimated 2018 exit rate of approximately 24,000 boe/d, representing approximately 25 percent production growth in 2018. On an annual basis, the 2018 budget is expected to deliver average daily production of between 22,500 and 23,500 boe/d.\nDerek Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Our 2018 capital budget continues our strategy of putting capital to work growing our production at Lindbergh, one of the most economic, long life thermal projects in Canada. Our 2018 and 2019 WCS differential hedging and apportionment protection in combination with our low operating cost structures are expected to provide us with strong, predictable netbacks for this growing production stream.”\n2018 Capital Plan\nThe Company has allocated approximately $45 million towards continued development and maintenance activities at its Lindbergh thermal project. Lindbergh is Pengrowth’s primary oil asset and with continued development is expected to deliver long-term growth in production and cash flow to the Company.\n2018 development plans at Lindbergh will focus on continued optimization activities, including the drilling of eight additional infill wells. Approximately $33 million of the Lindbergh capital has been allocated to the optimization and infill well program. The remaining capital will be allocated to maintenance and enhancement activities to support the continued production growth from existing operations.\nThe wells that were drilled in 2017 as part of the optimization program are now on production and are contributing to growth in Lindbergh production volumes, with production from the project expected to reach 16,000 bbl/d by the end of the first quarter 2018. The eight infill wells in the 2018 capital program are scheduled to be drilled in the second quarter of 2018 and are expected to be brought on stream in the fourth quarter of 2018, increasing Lindbergh production to approximately 18,000 bbl/d by the end of the year.\nAt Groundbirch, Pengrowth’s Montney property in north east British Columbia, $17 million of capital is being directed to the completion and tie-in of the four wells which where drilled in the fourth quarter of 2017. The completion of these wells is expected to increase natural gas production from Groundbirch from the current 9.0 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) to approximately 30 MMcf/d, with the initial volumes coming on by the end of April 2018. In addition to the drilling program, Pengrowth is working on the completion of a compression project which is expected to allow the Company to shift transportation of natural gas production at Groundbirch away from Station Two and onto the Nova system. Once production is on the Nova system, it is anticipated that the majority of the natural gas produced (approximately 87 percent) will be transported to Lindbergh where it will be used to support the energy requirements of that project.\nThe pace of development at Groundbirch will be dependent on the energy requirements for Lindbergh operations. It is the Company’s intention to utilize the majority of Groundbirch’s produced natural gas in its thermal operations and avoid having to export natural gas outside of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.\nAn additional $3.0 million of capital has been allocated to Pengrowth’s remaining conventional assets as well as for general corporate purposes.\nProduction Guidance\nThe anticipated make-up of 2018 expected average production volumes of 22,500 to 23,500 boe/d, using the mid-point of guidance, is set out below:\n2018 Production Volume Summary Light oil and NGLs (bbl/d) 1,800 Thermal oil (bbl/d) 16,500 Total liquids (bbl/d) 18,300 Natural gas (MMcf/d) 28.2 Total production * (boe/d) 23,000 *assumes mid-point of production guidance Operating Expenses\nTotal 2018 corporate operating costs are expected to be materially lower compared to 2017 costs primarily as a result of the Company’s significant asset disposition activities in 2017. This process resulted in the sale of several high cost legacy assets, leaving the Company with a portfolio centering on two 100 percent owned and operated, low cost, growth assets. On a unit basis, operating expenses are expected to be between $10.50/boe to $11.50/boe, representing a decline of approximately 17 percent from 2017 operating cost guidance, based on the midpoint of guidance. Pengrowth will continue with its emphasis on cost minimization and will seek out opportunities to further reduce its operating costs where possible.\nCash General and Administrative Expenses\nWith the extensive asset sales completed in 2017, the Company has been reducing its staff count to align with its refocused asset base. This process is expected to be completed in the first half of the year and, as a result, the Company expects to see a bifurcated cash general and administrative (G&A) expense profile in 2018, with G&A expenses being higher in the first half of the year averaging $3.93/boe and ultimately falling lower in the second half of 2018 to $2.46/boe. This is expected to result in full year 2018 cash G&A costs in a range of $3.10/boe and $3.35/boe, representing a decrease of approximately 14 percent from 2017 G&A guidance, based on the mid-point of guidance.\nRisk Management\nThe ongoing production growth in Canadian heavy oil and lack of new export pipeline capability has resulted in a widening of the Western Canadian Select (WCS) price differential. Pengrowth has afforded itself protection from this volatility through its hedging activities. For 2018, the Company has locked in the WCS heavy oil price differential at US $16.82/bbl for 17,000 bbl/d of Lindbergh blended production through physical sales. These sales provide stability to WTI-WCS differential pricing and in addition, these sale agreements ensure the Company has committed purchases for approximately 75 percent of its forecast Lindbergh production. In the fourth quarter, the delivery of Lindbergh production to these purchasers resulted in an operating netback of $23.19/bbl.\nLindbergh Q4 2017 netback $/bbl Sales revenue $ 39.56 Royalties $ 2.86 Transportation $ 2.90 Operating expenses $ 10.61 Operating Netback $ 23.19 In addition to the WCS heavy oil price differential protection, Pengrowth has in place financial hedging contracts for 10,000 boe/d of 2018 oil production outlined in the following table:\n2018 Financial contracts US$/bbl Bbl/d Collars",
