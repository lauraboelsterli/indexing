    "text": "DALLAS, Jan. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cushing ® Energy Income Fund (formerly known as the Cushing ® Royalty & Income Fund) (NYSE: SRF) declared a distribution for January 2018 of $0.04 per common share. The Fund's distribution will be payable on January 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on January 19, 2018. The ex-date for the Fund's distribution is January 18, 2018.\nIt is anticipated but not certain that approximately 100% of the Fund's distribution will be treated as a return of capital. The final determination of such amounts will be made and reported to shareholders in early 2019, after the end of the calendar year when the Fund determines its earnings and profits for the year. The final tax status of the distributions may differ substantially from this preliminary information.\nThe Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with an investment objective of seeking a high total return with an emphasis on current income. The Fund seeks to provide shareholders with a tax-efficient vehicle to invest in a portfolio of public and private securities of energy companies involved in exploring, developing, producing, transporting, gathering and processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined products or coal. The Fund will invest no more than 25% of its total assets in securities of energy master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") that qualify as publicly traded partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code. The Fund is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SRF.\"\nThe Fund is managed by Cushing ® Asset Management, LP (\"Cushing\"). No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.\nABOUT CUSHING ® ASSET MANAGEMENT, LP\nCushing, a subsidiary of Swank Capital, is an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Cushing serves as investment adviser to affiliated funds and managed accounts which invest primarily in securities of MLPs and other natural resource companies. As of December 31, 2017, Cushing had approximately $3.8 billion of assets under management in closed-end funds, mutual funds, privately offered funds and separately managed accounts.\nContact:\nJudson Redmond\nCushing ® Asset Management, LP\n214-692-6334\nwww.cushingasset.com\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.\nThis press release contains certain statements that may include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
