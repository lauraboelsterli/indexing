This was subsequently increased to 60 and then 80 percent.\nThe performance comes as Britons face pressure from slow wage growth compounded by higher inflation and appear to have cut back on almost everything other than food purchases in the run-up to Christmas.\nIt contrasts with the struggles of Marks & Spencer, one of the biggest names on the British high street, which on Thursday reported another fall in quarterly clothing sales.\nHowever, retailers with strong online sales channels have seemed insulated from the broader downturn in consumer demand. Fashion company Ted Baker on Wednesday reported higher sales over Christmas as online purchases surged.\nBoohoo, whose brands include PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, has been winning market share from traditional retailers, benefiting from the increasing popularity of smartphone e-commerce and the extensive use of social media for promotion.\nBoohoo group revenue doubled to 228.2 million pounds ($307.8 million) for the four months to the end of December thanks to stellar sales during Black Friday period.\nBoohoo has been a star UK stock market performer, with its shares rising 460 percent over the last 24 months.\nShares in the company were flat at 207p at 1020 GMT, after having risen over 10 percent year-to-date.
