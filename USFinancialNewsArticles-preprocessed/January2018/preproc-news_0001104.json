    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - HeidelbergCement ( HEIG.DE ) expects the U.S. tax reform to have a negative effect of around 200 million euros ($241 million) on its balance sheet for 2017, the German cement maker said on Tuesday but affirmed its guidance for underlying profits.\nThe revaluation of deferred tax assets is a one-time effect that is not cash-effective and has no impact on earnings before tax or cash flow in 2017, it said, sticking with its guidance for a significant increase in full-year underlying profit.\nIt also said that it expected the lower corporate tax rate in the United States to have a positive effect on annual group net profit and cash flow from 2019.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Georgina Prodhan\n ",
