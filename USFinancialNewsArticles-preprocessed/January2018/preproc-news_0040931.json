Eichel scored a power-play goal with 8:21 to go, and O‘Reilly added another power-play goal with 2:35 left to complete the offensive onslaught for the Sabres in the middle period.\nSam Reinhart scored a power-play goal with 5:04 left in the first period to give the Sabres a 1-0 lead. Reinhart, Kyle Okposo and Rasmus Ristolainen each had two assists for the Buffalo.\nThe Sabres ended up 3-for-4 on the power play and saw goalie Robin Lehner make 33 saves for his second shutout of the season.\nOilers goalie Cam Talbot allowed four goals on 22 shots before he was removed. Al Montoya entered and stopped 11 of the 12 shots he faced.\nBuffalo can win three consecutive games for the first time this season with a victory on Thursday in Vancouver in what will be the last of a three-game road trip to Western Canada and the Sabres’ last game before the All-Star break.\nEdmonton failed in its attempt to win four games in a row for the second time this season. The Oilers also have one more game before the All-Star break, a home contest against the Calgary Flames on Thursday.\nBuffalo swept the season series with Edmonton after winning at home 3-1 on Nov. 24.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
