Insurers and pension funds bought 12 percent of the bond. \nInvestors from Germany and Austria together bought 35 percent of the issue, followed by those from the United Kingdom and Ireland with 17 percent, the ministry said. \nLast month the ministry said Slovenia will this year borrow between 2.2 billion and 6.3 billion euros in order to finance its budget needs and prefinance debt that will mature in 2019 and 2020.
