    "text": "NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) today announced full year and fourth quarter 2017 financial results.\nFull Year Revenues Totaled $12.7 Billion, Up 12% Versus Prior Year, As 7% Organic Growth And 7% Growth From Acquisitions Were Partially Offset By The Sale Of The Mechanical Security Business Full Year Operating Margin Rate Was 14.1%; Excluding M&A Related Charges, Full Year Operating Margin Rate Expanded 40 Basis Points To A Record 14.8% Full Year Diluted GAAP EPS Was $8.04; Excluding M&A Related Charges, Full Year Diluted EPS Was $7.45, Up 14% Versus Prior Year, Reflecting Strong Operational Performance And Accretive Acquisitions 2017 Free Cash Flow Conversion Was Approximately 100% 4Q'17 Revenues Totaled $3.4 Billion, Up 17% Versus Prior Year, Including Robust Organic Growth Of 8% 4Q'17 Diluted GAAP EPS Was $1.84; Excluding M&A Related Charges, 4Q'17 Diluted EPS Was $2.18, Up 27% Versus Prior Year Signed Agreement To Acquire Nelson Fastener Systems ($200 Million Revenues) For $440 Million Expect 2018 Full Year Diluted GAAP EPS Of $7.80 To $8.00; Adjusted EPS Of $8.30 - $8.50, Up 11% - 14% Versus Prior Year; 2018 Free Cash Flow Conversion Expected To Approximate 100%\n4Q'17 Key Points:\nNet sales for the quarter were $3.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year, as acquisitions (+9%), volume (+9%) and currency (+3%) more than offset divestitures (-3%) and price (-1%). Gross margin rate for the quarter was 36.6%. Excluding charges, the gross margin rate was 36.7% compared to 36.9% in 4Q'16, as volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by the impact from the Mechanical Security business divestiture and continued commodity inflation. SG&A expenses were 23.2% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A expenses were 22.9% of sales, down 50 basis points versus 4Q'16, as tight cost management offset the impact from investments in growth initiatives. Operating margin rate was 13.3%. Excluding charges, operating margin rate was 13.8%, a 30 basis point expansion versus 4Q'16. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $8.6 million. Excluding M&A related charges, restructuring charges for the quarter were $4.9 million compared to $21.7 million in 4Q'16. Tax rate was 17.8%, which reflects a one-time net charge of $23.6 million related to the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Excluding M&A related charges and one-time tax charge, tax rate was 9.4%, no change from 4Q'16. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 153.4 million versus 149.4 million a year ago, due primarily to share issuances in 4Q'16 associated with the Company's 2013 Equity Units. Working capital turns for the quarter were 8.9, down 1.7 turns from prior year as a result of recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, turns were flat versus prior year.\nJames M. Loree, President & CEO, commented, \"Stanley Black & Decker delivered an impressive 2017, with strong execution aligned with our SFS 2.0 operating system. Our team delivered total growth of 12% with well above-market organic growth of 7%, 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, 14% earnings per share growth and solid free cash flow conversion. We achieved these excellent results while successfully integrating multiple acquisitions on or ahead of plan. We are particularly excited about the growth pipeline for 2018 and beyond which includes core innovation, the Craftsman brand rollout, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, FlexVolt, emerging markets and additional acquisitions such as Nelson Fastener Systems.\n\"We are expecting 2018 to be another strong year as our continued focus on SFS 2.0 and our solid growth pipeline position us to deliver sustained above-market organic growth with margin expansion. The team is energized by our company's purpose – 'For Those Who Make The World™' – to achieve our 22/22 vision and to strive to become known as one of the world's leading innovators, to deliver top-quartile financial performance and to demonstrate our commitment to social responsibility.\"\n4Q'17 Segment Results\n($ in M)\nSales\nProfit\nCharges 1\nProfit\nEx -\nCharges 1\nProfit\nRate\nProfi t Rate\nEx-\nCharges 1\nTools & Storage\n$2,430\n$391.9\n$13.6\n$405.5\n16.1%\n16.7%\nIndustrial\n$473\n$75.8\nN/A\n$75.8\n16.0%\n16.0%\nSecurity\n$510\n$55.5\n$1.1\n$56.6\n10.9%\n11.1%\n1 See Merger And Acquisition (M&A) Related Charges On Page 5\nTools & Storage net sales increased 26% versus 4Q'16 as acquisitions (+13%), volume (+12%) and currency (+2%) more than offset the impact from price to support holiday promotions (-1%). Organic growth was strong across all regions with emerging markets +17%, Europe +17% and North America +8%. The strong emerging market organic growth was supported by mid-price-point product releases, higher e-commerce volumes and benefits from changes to our distribution models in Russia & Turkey. All markets across Europe contributed to another quarter of above-market organic growth in that region, enabled by successful commercial actions and new product launches. North America growth was supported by share gains from strong commercial execution and market-leading innovation, including sales from the DEWALT FlexVolt system, as well as a healthy U.S. tool market. Overall Tools & Storage segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 16.7%, up 50 basis points versus 4Q'16 as volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments, price, and increased commodity inflation. Industrial net sales increased 4% versus 4Q'16 as volume (+2%) and currency (+3%) were moderated by divestitures (-1%). Engineered Fastening organic revenues increased 1% as automotive fastener penetration gains, which enabled growth in excess of light vehicle production, and strong volume growth in general industrial markets more than offset the impact from lower self-piercing rivet system shipments in automotive and lower volumes within electronics. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 8% on increased Hydraulic Tools volumes from successful commercial actions and supportive market conditions, as well as low-single digit growth within Oil & Gas from higher inspection and onshore project activity in North America. Overall Industrial segment profit rate was 16.0%, as volume leverage, productivity gains and cost control resulted in an 80 basis point expansion versus the 4Q'16 rate. Security net sales decreased 4% versus 4Q'16 as bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions (+4%), currency (+3%) and volume (+2%) were more than offset by the sale of the Mechanical Security business (-13%). North America expanded organically (+2%) on higher installation volumes within commercial electronic security and growth within healthcare. Europe organic growth (+1%) was due to strength within the UK and the Nordics partially offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. Overall Security segment profit rate of 11.1% was consistent with the prior two quarters. Versus the prior year, the rate reflects a decline of approximately 90 basis points related to the sale of the Mechanical Security business, as well as impacts from mix and funding growth investments.\nEngineered Fastening Acquisition\nOn December 22, 2017, the company reached an agreement to purchase the industrial business of Nelson Fastener Systems, which excludes Nelson's automotive stud welding business, for approximately $440 million in cash (LTM Revenue ~$200 million). Nelson enhances Engineered Fastening's presence in the general industrial end markets, expands its portfolio of highly engineered fastening solutions and will deliver cost synergies. The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to 2018 earnings per share, excluding one-time charges. This transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nDonald Allan Jr., Executive Vice President and CFO, commented, \"2017 was a year of excellent operational execution as we delivered very strong financial results, while remaining focused on acquisition integrations, overcoming commodity and currency headwinds, successfully navigating dynamic end markets and investing for future growth. In 2018 we expect to generate another year of above-market organic growth of approximately 5% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% - 14% versus prior year.\"\nManagement expects its 2018 EPS to be $7.80 - $8.00 on a GAAP basis and $8.30 - $8.50 on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow conversion is expected to approximate 100%.\nThe following represents key 2018 adjusted EPS assumptions:\nOrganic growth of approximately 5% (+$0.50 to +$0.60 EPS) Commodity inflation of ~$150 million partially offset by price actions (approximately -$0.25 to -$0.30 EPS) Net impact from closed acquisitions, cost actions and improved productivity partially offset by higher share count (approximately +$0.45 to +$0.50 EPS) Tax rate to approximate 18% reflecting the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation (approximately +$0.20 EPS) Embedded core restructuring charges (~$50 million)\nAllan continued, \"While we expect 2018 to have its share of externally driven challenges, our strong day-to-day execution, ability to deliver robust innovation, and commitment to SFS 2.0 give us confidence in our ability to deliver solid organic growth, operating leverage and strong free cash flow conversion this year, consistent with our long-term financial objectives.\"\nMerger And Acquisition (\"M&A\") Related Charges\nTotal M&A related charges in 4Q'17 were $27.1 million, primarily related to restructuring, deal and integration costs, as well as non-cash inventory step-up charges. Gross margin included $4.3 million of these charges while SG&A included $10.9 million. Other, net and Restructuring included $7.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of these charges. In addition, a net $1.0 million loss was recorded in the quarter related to divestitures.\nThe Company will host a conference call with investors today, January 24, 2018, at 8:00 am ET.

Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income, excluding the gain or loss on the sales of businesses. The normalized statement of operations and business segment information, as reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 and 13 for 2017, is considered relevant to aid analysis of the Company's margin and earnings results aside from the material impact of the acquisition-related charges, gain or loss on the sales of businesses and a one-time net tax charge related to the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nUnder the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nStatements in this press release that are not historical, including but not limited to those regarding the Company's ability to: (i) achieve full year 2018 GAAP EPS of $7.80 – $8.00 and Adjusted EPS of $8.30 - $8.50; (ii) generate 2018 free cash flow conversion approximating 100%; (iii) achieve its 22/22 vision of doubling the size of the Company by 2022 while expanding its margin rate; and (iv) deliver solid organic growth with operating leverage, earnings per share expansion and free cash flow conversion in 2018 consistent with its long-term financial objectives, (collectively, the \"Results\"); are \"forward-looking statements\" and subject to risk and uncertainty.\nThe Company's ability to deliver the Results as described above is based on current expectations and involves inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and other factors that could delay, divert, or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations.
