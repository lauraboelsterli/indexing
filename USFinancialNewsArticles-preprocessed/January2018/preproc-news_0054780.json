    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 4:32 AM / in an hour METALS-Base metals lose ground as dollar firms ahead of Trump address Reuters Staff 5 Min Read (adds analyst comment, updates prices) BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Most base metals gave up early gains on Tuesday due to a strengthening dollar, as investors awaited positive signals about infrastructure building in U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address later in the day. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies. \"It is believed that (Trump's) infrastructure programme will be a highlight of his State of the Union speech, raising hopes that U.S. demand growth will pick up,\" ANZ wrote in a note.
