    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday failed to pass an amendment to legislation renewing the governmentâ€™s sweeping internet surveillance program that would have required warrants for searching data.\nThe amendment failed by a vote of 233-183, with 58 Republicans breaking party ranks to support it. The Republican-dominated chamber then moved to consider the entire legislative package renewing the surveillance program.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
