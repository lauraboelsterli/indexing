(TSXV: KASH) (\" HashChain\" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it proposes to split its common shares on a two-for-one basis (the \" Forward Split \"). The record date of the Forward Split will be February 5, 2018, subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.\nManagement of the Company believes that the Forward Split will provide increased liquidity to shareholders and promote broader share ownership, which is expected to be beneficial to the Company's shareholders.\nThe Forward Split will result in the Company's current issued and outstanding share capital of 55,327,508 shares, as of the date of this news release, being increased to 110,655,016 issued and outstanding shares. The Forward Split is being conducted on a push-out basis. The Company's CUSIP number and trading symbol will remain the same.\nAny outstanding share purchase warrants and stock options will be adjusted by the same two-for-one ratio and the respective exercise prices of outstanding warrants and stock options will be adjusted accordingly.\nShareholders of the Company do not need to take any action with respect to the Forward Split. The Company's transfer agent will send registered shareholders a DRS advice or share certificate representing the additional number of shares to be received as a result of the Forward Split.\nAbout HashChain Technology Inc.\nHashChain is a Blockchain mining company, and the first publicly traded (TSXV:KASH) Canadian cryptocurrency mining company to file a final prospectus supporting highly scalable and flexible mining operations across all major cryptocurrencies.
