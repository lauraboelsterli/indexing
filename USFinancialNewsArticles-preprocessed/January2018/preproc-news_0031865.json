    "text": "PORTERVILLE, Calif., Jan. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sierra Bancorp (Nasdaq:BSRR), parent of Bank of the Sierra, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share, which represents an increase of $0.02 per share, or 14%, relative to quarterly dividends paid in 2017. The dividend, which will be paid on February 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2018, was approved subsequent to the Board's review of the Company's financial performance and capital strength for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. In addition to an anticipated lift in net income from a lower corporate income tax rate in 2018, the fact that fourth quarter 2017 results include substantial non-recurring items was taken into consideration when determining the appropriate dividend level. Counting dividends paid by Bank of the Sierra prior to the formation of Sierra Bancorp, the Company has paid regular cash dividends to shareholders every year since 1987, comprised of annual dividends through 1998 and quarterly dividends since then. The dividend noted in today's announcement marks the Company's 76 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.\nSierra Bancorp is the holding company for Bank of the Sierra ( www.bankofthesierra.com ), which is in its 41 st year of operations and is the largest independent bank headquartered in California's South San Joaquin Valley.
