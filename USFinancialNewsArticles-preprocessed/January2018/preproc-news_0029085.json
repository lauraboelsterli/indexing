    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 2:09 PM / Updated 43 minutes ago Displaced by war, some Yemenis sift through garbage for food Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nHODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - After persistent Saudi-led air strikes on their home area in northwest Yemen, the Ruzaiq family packed their belongings and fled to the relative safety of Hodeidah port on the Red Sea. \nBut with no money or relatives to shelter them, the 18-member family joined a growing number of displaced Yemenis living on or next to the garbage dump of the Houthi-controlled city. \nDespite the health risks, the dump has become a source of food for hundreds of impoverished Yemenis and given some young men a chance to try to earn some income. \n“We eat and drink the food that is thrown away,” said 11-year-old Ayoub Mohammed Ruzaiq. “We collect fish, meat, potatoes, onions and flour to make our own food.” \nFor a photo essay, please click: reut.rs/2DfEW12 \nThe United Nations estimates that more than two million people have been displaced by the war, which intensified in 2015 when an Arab coalition intervened to try to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power after the Houthis forced him into exile. Ayoub Mohammed Ruzaiq, 11, lies in his family's hut next to a garbage dump where he collects recyclables and food near the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen, January 09, 2018. \"We eat and drink the food that is thrown away,\" said Ayoub. \"We collect fish, meat, potatoes, onions and flour to make our own food.\" REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad \nThe war has killed more than 10,000 people, crippled the economy, caused a cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 2,000 people and pushed the country to the verge of famine. \nThe Saudi-led coalition denies Houthi accusations that it targets civilians or civilian property in its operations. Riyadh sees the Houthis as a proxy militia linked to regional rival Iran. Both Iran and the Houthis deny any military cooperation. \nFatema Hassan Marouai, 53, who was driven from her home in Hodeidah by economic hardships, said that apart from picking up food thrown away by better off Yemenis, some displaced people collect metal cans and plastic bottles to sell to merchants for some cash to cover daily needs.
