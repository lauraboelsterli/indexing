Splinter is chairman of the board at Nasdaq, Inc. and general partner at WISC Partners.\nSplinter, an electrical engineer and innovator, has played a major role in driving advances in the high tech industry, with more than four decades of executive leadership experience at organizations including Applied Materials, Inc. and Intel. During his 12-year tenure with Applied Materials, Inc., Splinter served as chairman and CEO. Over his 20 years with Intel, he was executive vice president of sales and marketing, and executive vice president of the Technology and Manufacturing Group.\nThroughout his career, Splinter has demonstrated an abiding commitment to shaping a better world.

It is clear Wellbe's products will be clear enablers to those solutions. I look forward to working closely with James and the outstanding team at Wellbe.\"\nAbout Wellbe\nWellbe enables high-performing health systems across the U.S. to advance the coordination and quality of care.
