    "text": "LEESBURG, Va., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- K2M Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:KTWO) (the \"Company\" or \"K2M\"), a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance™, today announced preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Summary:\n• Full year 2017 revenue of $257.5 million to $258.1 million, up approximately 9% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis\n• The Company continues to expect full year 2017 net loss and Adjusted EBITDA will be within the range of its previously provided guidance\nFourth Quarter Revenue Summary:\n• Total Q4 revenue of $67.3 million to $67.9 million, up approximately 9% to 10% year-over-year, or 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis\nDomestic Q4 revenue of $51.7 million to $52.0 million, up approximately 9% year-over-year, comprised of:\n- U.S. Complex Spine growth of approximately 8% year-over-year\n- U.S. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) growth of approximately 15% year-over-year\n- U.S. Degenerative growth of approximately 8% year-over-year International Q4 revenue of $15.6 million to $15.9 million, up approximately 11% to 13% year-over-year, or 8% to 10% on a constant currency basis\n“Our preliminary financial results for calendar year 2017 reflect total revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, above the high-end of our guidance range,” said Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Major. “We delivered approximately 9% growth in the U.S. in 2017—well above-market growth rates—driven by solid execution against our strategic goal of increasing market share by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions and expanding our distribution footprint. We have supplemented this organic growth activity with exciting product introductions in both the complex spine and degenerative categories. Looking out to 2018, we are excited about the opportunity of our first-of-its-kind MOJAVE™ PL 3D Expandable Interbody System featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology™ and our YUKON™ OCT Spinal System that can be used with the PALO ALTO ® Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System, the first and only static corpectomy cage in the world to receive a cervical 510(k) clearance. We also announced an important strategic collaboration with Brainlab, one of the world's leading imaging and navigation companies, that we believe will represent additional implant sales opportunities in the second half of 2018. Our Brainlab collaboration will complement our recent launches of the BACS® platform and the EVEREST® Minimally Invasive XT Spinal System.”\nMr. Major continued, “We remain confident in our ability to drive above-market growth in the U.S., fueled by our continued focus on leading the spine market by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions to help surgeons care for patients around the world who suffer from debilitating spinal pathologies. We expect our revenue to increase 9%–10% in 2018 with improved profitability.”\nThe financial estimates presented above are preliminary and remain subject to management's final review as well as audit by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company intends to report complete fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results in late February. Details regarding the timing of the release of those results, as well as details of a conference call and publicly available webcast, will be announced in a subsequent press release.\nAbout K2M\nK2M Group Holdings, Inc. is a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance.
