Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net CLOSING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE HOLDS UP AS BIG FALLS HIT UK STOCKS (1653 GMT) The session has ended, and while it's been positive for continental European stocks, the UK has fared less well with some large losses for Micro Focus and Mothercare, among others. Is this the beginning of a theme for UK shares? We've got quite a UK-heavy calendar to navigate this week, with Morrison's and Persimmon due to give updates tomorrow, Taylor Wimpey and Sainsbury's on Wednesday and Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Barratt Developments on Thursday, so hold on to your hats! Here's your closing snapshot: (Kit Rees) MOODY'S CUTS DEBENHAMS DEBT TO \"JUNK\", SHARES RESIST (1620) Moody's has just downgraded Debenhams long-term corporate family rating from Ba3 to B1, which means it now qualifies as \"junk\", after a profit warning last week. It seems no one is shocked: shares in the iconic British department store chain have barely reacted, closing up 3 percent. Debenhams stock is down 15 percent since the start of last week after tumbling 39 percent last year and 22 percent in 2016. (Julien Ponthus) WHAT RUNS QUITE FAST AND IS EUROPE'S 2ND BIGGEST M&A DEAL OF 2018? (1545 GMT) It is, according to Thomson Reuters' Deals team, Philippe Coutinho! \"His move from Liverpool to Barcelona for a reported Â£142 million would make the deal the second largest acquisition by a European company so far in 2018 across all industries when compared to traditional M&A activity,\" our colleagues, who have not taken into account Novo's 2.6 billion euro bid for Belgium's Ablynx, say. \"Globally, it would be the 29th biggest acquisition of 2018\", they add. (Julien Ponthus) ANOTHER BANK SEES VOLATILITY RISING IN 2018 - CITI (1505 GMT) It's not all rainbows and butterflies for markets this year - with risks around politics, tightening financial conditions, and high asset prices likely to cause disruption. \"Most markets should begin to see increased volatility,\" write Citi analysts, in a note which echoes a similar call by UBS last week. \"This is less of a view on volatility and more a reflection of the extremely low current levels and the strong rally in risk assets in the latter part of 2017.\" Although the backdrop is still pretty benign and Citi forecasts gains of around 8 percent for global markets this year, led by Europe and emerging markets, risks are rising. In increasingly mature cycles financial vulnerabilities are rising and pent-up demand is moderating, making markets less resilient to shocks, the U.S. bank says. And interestingly the very fact markets have shrugged off political developments so far could make them vulnerable. \"The current disconnect between the political outlook and economic and financial markets performance is itself a major risk,\" notes Citi. Here's the VIX from its highs just under ten years ago, to today: (Helen Reid) ABLYNX SHARES SURGE TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NOVO'S OFFER (1442 GMT) Shares in the Belgian group have resumed trading and surged 45 percent to just slightly above the 30.50 euros per share offer it rejected from Novo Nordisk. Investors are willing to pay above the offer price of the Danish insulin maker to get a piece of the action, which means a serious M&A battle is expected here. Remember that Ablynx had already rejected an offer by the Danish group on Dec. 14. (Julien Ponthus) TELL-TALE SIGNS OF GREED AND EXCESS IN LATE BULL MARKET (1350 GMT) While stock markets continue their dizzying ascent, we are still in the last leg of a bull market which is developing \"in slow motion\", Hawksmoor's head of research Jim Wood-Smith writes, and there are more and more signs of hubris. \"This is maybe not so openly apparent in mainstream equities, but it is certainly so with bitcoin - and other crypto-currencies to boot.\" Ethereum, for example, extended gains to a new high today, while bitcoin is still faltering slightly. And the crypto obsession is spilling over into some stocks too. \"The price changes in blockchain stocks make the dotcom days look like kindergarten,\" Wood-Smith adds. However these and other \"beacons of nauseous wealth and excess\" are reassuring in a way as \"they are precisely what should be happening after years of quantitative easing,\" he said. Opportunistic takeovers of stocks trading at depressed levels are also signs of a late bull market. He cites Hammerson's proposed acquisition of Intu Properties, and the bid for IWG, for example. (Helen Reid) ABLYNX: IT'S HOSTILE! PITCH OPENS AT 1400 GMT (1311 GMT) The Belgian group just rejected Denmark's Novo Nordisk 2.6 billion euro takeover offer, saying it undervalues the company. It seems we have a real M&A battle on our hands with potential white knights and no shortage of drama. The battleground (Euronext Brussels) is set to open at 1400 GMT, the Belgian regulator says. (Julien Ponthus) UNFORGIVING MARKETS (1301 GMT) The bull market has lifted the global benchmarks to record highs but it can be unforgiving, especially with those companies that fail the street. We've seen Debenhams plunge over 20 percent last week after the department store group slashed its annual profit forecast, and baby goods retailer Mothercare wiping out one third of its market value today on a profit warning. Disappointing numbers are also sinking tech company Micro Focus and retail firm McBride. What does all this mean? We're asking around and here's a quick take from Stephane Ekolo, Global Equity Strategist at Avalon Capital Markets: \"Given the risk-on sentiment prevailing in the market, market participants are eager to punish companies when they warn or issue disappointing statements. This is no surprise to me as the same phenomenon occurred in January 2017, when approaching earnings season. That being said, we are all too aware that valuations are somewhat stretched (for some metrics). Therefore (and depending on the reasons for the disappointing statements), I don't think we can make firm conclusions about the state of those industries.\" (Danilo Masoni) A \"BUY THE DIP\" FEELING (1247 GMT) For those of us lucky enough to still be receiving steady flows of research despite now living in a post-MiFID II world, there's a strong sense of optimism pouring into our inboxes as the STOXX cruises just 17 points below its all-time high. \"Keep buying any dips\", JP Morgan writes in an equity strategy note, which gives you an idea of the mood, with most brokers sticking to strong \"overweights\" for Europe. Optimism is also palpable for M&A with notes pointing to sectoral consolidation (see Kit's post on security firms below) and BNP Paribas arguing the U.S. tax cuts will spice things up but that ou",
