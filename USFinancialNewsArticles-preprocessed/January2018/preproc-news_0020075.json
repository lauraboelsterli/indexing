    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday that relations with the United States were harmed by Washingtonâ€™s refusal to extradite cleric Fetullah Gulen and its provision of arms to the Kurdish militant YPG.\nSpeaking to the state-run Anadolu Agency, Cavusoglu said that ties between the NATO allies could be harmed further if Washington does not correct its mistakes.\nAnkara has been infuriated with Washington over its refusal to extradite Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a 2016 coup attempt, and U.S. support for the YPG, which it sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging an insurgency against the Turkish state.\n(This story has been refiled to fix headline)\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun\n ",
