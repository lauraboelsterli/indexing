Japan Dec final manufacturing PMI highest since Feb 2014 Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years in December as new orders accelerated, a revised survey showed, in a sign that steady economic growth will continue into the new year. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 10,499.00, trading up 0.14 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee will likely trade lower against the dollar in early session, as hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting amid upbeat U.S. manufacturing and construction data boosted demand for the greenback. Indian government bonds are expected to edge lower as overnight gains in crude oil prices worsen the outlook for domestic inflation, even as traders await a fresh supply of notes tomorrow. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 percent bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.32 percent-7.38 percent band today, a trader with a primary dealership said. The bond closed at 96.43 rupees, yielding 7.32 percent, yesterday. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after signs of robust economic growth. • Asian shares scaled a 10-year high as solid economic data from the United States and Germany reinforced investors' optimism while oil prices hovered at 2-1/2-year high with unrest in Iran stoking supply disruption concerns. • The dollar extended gains after upbeat U.S. data and supportive minutes from the Federal's Reserve's latest policy meeting helped it shake off recent weakness. • U.S. Treasury yields were little changed on Wednesday as traders stuck to their view that the Federal Reserve would gradually increase interest rates in 2018 based on the minutes of the central bank's December policy meeting. • Oil prices remained near levels last seen in late 2014/2015, with markets tightening amid tensions in Iran and due to ongoing OPEC-led production cuts. • Gold prices eased early, extending losses from the previous session as the precious metal retreated from more than 3-1/2-month highs due to a firmer dollar on expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes.
