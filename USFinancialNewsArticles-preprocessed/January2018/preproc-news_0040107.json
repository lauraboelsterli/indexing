And we do it to give the whole of Europe a new boost, to make it even stronger,” Merkel said in a joint video podcast as the countries prepare to seal a new bilateral compact. \nAfter meeting in Paris on Friday, Merkel and Macron talked up the prospect of agreeing reforms to the euro zone, saying they were committed to strengthening the bloc.
