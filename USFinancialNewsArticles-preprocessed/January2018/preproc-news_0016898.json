Brown’s breakaway dunk gave the Ducks a 72-65 lead with 1:54 remaining.\nGuard Kodi Justice scored 21 points and Shannon Evans II added 19 for the Sun Devils (13-3, 1-3). Arizona State has lost three out of four after opening the season 12-0 to stand as the last undefeated team in Division I for a few hours.\nEvans’ 3-pointer with 17.5 seconds remaining closed the Oregon lead to 74-72 with 17.5 seconds left.\nPritchard converted both ends of a one-and-one for a 76-72 advantage with 13.8 seconds remaining, and Arizona State could not get off a good shot in the time remaining.\nArizona State began the game sixth in NCAA Division I with a 89.3 scoring average.\nTra Holder had 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting for Arizona State, which shot 43.5 percent and made 10 of 24 3-point attempts. Justice was 4-for-8 from long distance, and Evans was 4-for-9.\nSorkin, a 6-foot-10 senior, had 23 points in the season opener against Coppin State but had scored only 16 points in nine games since. He managed five points in 15 minutes in the first three Pac-12 games.\nOregon had a 38-31 rebounding advantage and grabbed 15 offensive rebounds to Arizona State’s eight. The Ducks outscored the Sun Devils 38-16 in the paint.\nPritchard made four of Oregon’s eight 3-pointers, and Brown made three.\nEvans had five points including his first 3-pointer and Holder had four when the Sun Devils used a 13-2 spurt to take its biggest lead, 33-20, with five minutes left in the first half.\nArizona State, which opened about 4,000 more seats by removing a wall in the second tier of the arena, drew its biggest crowd since 2010, 13,693.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
