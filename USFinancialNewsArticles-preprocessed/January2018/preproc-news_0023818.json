Another key reason behind Asia's economic growth is its integration into the global supply chain. Nakao said that, while Asian economies used to follow a \"flying geese\" model, which essentially meant countries followed one another in terms of investment, the region today follows more of a production sharing model.\n\"One of the reasons India's economy grew slower compared to China was because they were more domestic oriented. India was not part of the global supply chain as much as China was,\" he explained.\nToday, however, \"the Chinese develop in some sectors â€¦ the Koreans develop in some sectors, so they are sharing comparative advantages through supply chains,\" the ADB president said.",
