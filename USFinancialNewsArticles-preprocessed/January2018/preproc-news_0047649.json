GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump security team sees building U.S. 5G network as option President Donald Trump's national security team is looking at options to counter the threat of China spying on U.S. phone calls that include the government building a super-fast 5G wireless network, a senior administration official said on Sunday. • Australia's CBA promotes retail banking boss Matt Comyn to CEO Commonwealth Bank of Australia named retail banking boss Matt Comyn as its new chief executive officer, to lead the company as it faces challenging trading conditions as well as allegations of massive money laundering system breaches. • China declares intention to improve ties with Japan China hopes to work with Japan to establish more cordial relations, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart on Sunday, aiming to move on from a series of disputes, some dating back to before World War Two. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 11,131.00, trading up 0.50 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, in line with most Asian peers, tracking U.S. Treasury yields that rose following slower quarterly growth in the world’s largest economy, even as traders await cues from the Fed’s policy meet. • Indian government bonds are likely fall in early session tracking higher U.S. Treasury yields and crude oil prices. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.30 percent - 7.34 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The latest round of strong earnings reports, including from Intel and AbbVie, along with continued weakness in the dollar lifted each of the major Wall Street indexes to closing records on Friday. • Asian shares extended their bull run amid upbeat corporate earnings and strong global economic growth, while the dollar tried to bounce even as the White House continued to complain of \"unfair\" trade practices by competitors. • The dollar wobbled near three-year lows against a basket of major currencies, struggling to pull ahead from six straight weeks of losses amid its evaporating yield advantage and doubts about Washington's commitment to a strong currency. • U.S. Treasury yields rose Friday following data showing the nation's economy grew 2.6 percent in the final quarter of 2017 and the governor of the Bank of Japan said inflation is finally close to reaching its target. • Oil prices held firm, supported by strong demand, a weak dollar and ongoing supply cuts lead by OPEC and Russia, although soaring U.S. output means many analysts expect crude prices to fall later in the year. • Gold prices inched higher as the U.S. dollar hovered around three-year lows, trading not far off more than 17-month highs hit last week.
