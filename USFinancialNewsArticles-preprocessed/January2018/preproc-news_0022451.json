    "text": "January 15, 2018 / 5:40 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago North Korea requests talks on Olympics with South on January 17 - South Korea Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has requested that working talks on sending its athletes to next month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics be held on Wednesday at the truce village of Panmunjom, the South’s unification ministry said in a mobile text message. FILE PHOTO - Head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son Gwon talks with South Korean counterpart Cho Myoung-gyon during their meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, South Korea. Yonhap via REUTERS \nA ministry official said on Monday it had yet to decide whether it would accept the request from the North, which asked for the meeting to be held at Peace House on the South Korean side of the demilitarised zone that separates the two Koreas. \nThe message from the South’s unification ministry came after the two Koreas met earlier on Monday to discuss North Korea sending a performance art group to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, which will begin in February. \nNorth and South Korea had agreed to hold follow-up discussions regarding North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics after the two Koreas last week held their first formal dialogue in more than two years amid high tensions over the North’s missile and nuclear programmes. \nNorth Korea is also planning to send a large delegation to the Winter Olympics in addition to the athletes and performance group. South Korea is also seeking to form a united women’s ice hockey team with the North to participate in the Games, according to media reports. \nNorth and South Korea will also hold talks hosted by the International Olympics Committee, separate from the inter-Korean talks, on Jan. 20.
