    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 7:29 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago IOC issues conduct guide for Russian athletes at Games Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Russian athletes who compete as independents at next month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics cannot grab a Russian flag or stage alternate medal ceremonies as part of conduct guidelines issued on Friday. \nThe International Olympic Committee, which in December banned Russia from the Feb. 9-25 Games in South Korea because of the country’s doping violations, has invited 169 carefully screened Russian athletes who will compete under the Olympic flag as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR). \nRussia was banned over “systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Games. \nAccording to the IOC’s “Conduct Guidelines for Olympic Athlete from Russia”, athletes must wear only the authorised OAR uniforms and refrain from any public form of publicity associated with the Russian “flag, anthem, emblem and symbols”. \nThey must also “not solicit or accept the national flag, anthem, emblem and symbols at any Olympic site,” the IOC said. \nAthletes and officials are also not allowed to stage or take part in ‘alternate’ victory ceremonies organised by the Russian Olympic Committee or a third party. \nThe IOC said it would be monitoring the application of these guidelines through a taskforce, led by IOC deputy Director General Pere Miro and sports Director Kit McConnell. \nThe suspended Russian Olympic Committee will also be responsible for their fans’ behaviour inside the venues and any display of national flags or emblems even at non-official venues must have IOC approval. \nThe IOC has said if Russia respected the decisions it could potentially be admitted back under its own flag at the Games’ closing ceremony.
