    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:CORE) (the “Company”), one of the largest marketers of fresh and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America, today announced preliminary financial results for the year-ended December 31, 2017.\n“We continued to execute on our core strategies during the fourth quarter resulting in growth of approximately 7% in our non-cigarette same store sales. Unfortunately, many of our customers did not see an overall retail sales lift, particularly in California, driven primarily by cigarette carton volume declines,” said Thomas B. Perkins, Chief Executive Officer. “We do not expect to meet our previous expectations for Adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to the performance of our two recovering divisions and not realizing our operational cost reduction initiatives at the pace we expected. We are, however, making progress in reducing expense levels across the organization, and are confident that our two troubled divisions are on a path to profitability in 2018. With this momentum, we are well positioned to improve our profitability as we enter 2018.”\nThe Company expects to report 2017 full-year net sales of $15.7 billion for 2017, consistent with the Company’s previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for 2017 is now expected to be between $136 million and $141 million, compared to previous guidance of $152 million to $156 million. The Company expects to report diluted earnings per share (“Diluted EPS”) for the year in the range of $0.66 to $0.73, lowered from $0.93 to $0.97 in the Company’s prior guidance. The Company expects diluted EPS, excluding LIFO expense (non-GAAP), to be reported between $0.94 and $1.01 per diluted share, compared with previous guidance from $1.20 and $1.24 per diluted share.\nThe key assumptions for the Company’s updated projections are an expected tax rate of 36.0%, $20 million in LIFO expense and $11 million in interest expense, with approximately 46.4 million diluted shares outstanding for the year. The Company expects to realize a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the termination of its legacy pension plan, which is not included in the estimates above. In addition, these preliminary results do not include the impact of the recently enacted tax legislation. The Company estimates a tax benefit between $8 million and $10 million, or $0.17 to $0.21 per diluted share for 2017, due primarily to the revaluation of its net deferred tax liabilities under the new legislation.\nThe above information is unaudited and subject to completion of the year-end financial reporting processes. The Company expects to release fourth quarter and year-end results on or about February 27, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company expects 2018 annual net sales to be between $16.6 billion and $16.8 billion. This growth in sales is expected to be driven by increases in same store sales and incremental market share gains; it assumes no new acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2018 is expected to be between $157.0 million and $167.0 million. Diluted earnings per-share for the full year are expected to be between $0.84 and $1.00, which assumes $18.0 million of estimated LIFO expense. Our diluted per-share estimates, excluding LIFO expense, are between $1.13 and $1.29. EPS estimates assume a tax rate of 25% based on preliminary assessment of the new tax legislation and 46.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately $30 million.\nICR Conference\nThe Company is planning on presenting at the upcoming ICR Conference 2018 on Tuesday, January 9 th of 2018. Its presentation, which will be webcast, is scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time and will be available at the Company’s website in the Investors- Events & Presentations section.\nCore-Mark\nCore-Mark is one of the largest marketers of fresh and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America.
