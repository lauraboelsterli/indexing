    "text": "DUBLIN, Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company, is providing its 2018 preliminary financial outlook and other financial updates at the 36th annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco today.\nCommenting on the Company's 2018 outlook, Allergan Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders said, \"While we face loss of exclusivity revenue headwinds in 2018, Allergan is in a solid position to unlock value in the near- and long-term. Our confidence is driven by the durable growth prospects for our businesses, the efforts we are taking to right-size the organization, our therapeutic area leadership, deep and high-potential pipeline and strong cash flows and balance sheet. Together, these elements provide a formidable foundation for Allergan to deliver value for shareholders in 2018 and beyond.\"\n2018 Outlook\nToday, the Company is providing the following preliminary financial outlook for 2018. The outlook includes the following assumptions:\nNo generic entry for RESTASIS ® prior to the second quarter of 2018. Additional impact of generic entries: ESTRACE ® (generic already in market); NAMENDA XR ® (early first quarter of 2018); DELZICOL ® (early second quarter of 2018); ACZONE ® (highly genericized market). Ongoing cost reductions of $300 million – $400 million from Fiscal Year 2017 non-GAAP operating expenses. Expected 2018 non-GAAP tax rate of no more than ~15%.\nThe following represents 2018 financial outlook for select income statement categories:\nFull Year 2018 Select Outlook\nGAAP\nNON-GAAP\nTotal Net Revenues\n~$15.0 - $15.3 billion\n~$15.0 - $15.3 billion\nTax Rate\nNo more than ~65%\nNo more than ~15%\nPerformance Net Income Per Share*\n$(0.84)**\n≥$15.25\n* Refer to Table in the Appendix of this press release for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.\n** 2018 GAAP loss per share from continuing operations attributable to shareholders under a scenario of non-GAAP performance net income per share of $15.25 .\nAllergan will provide additional 2018 financial outlook measures as part of its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings report and call on Tuesday, February 6, 2018.\nOther Financial Updates\nIn addition to the above 2018 preliminary financial outlook, the Company is providing the following financial updates:\n2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act Impact\nOn December 22, 2017 the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was enacted into law by President Donald Trump. Allergan is providing the following guidance on the expected impact of the TCJA on the Company.\nOverall, Allergan anticipates the future impact of the TCJA will be broadly neutral to the Company's non-GAAP effective tax rate over time, with a moderate increase for 2018 as compared to full year 2017. The Company will provide further information on its expected effective tax rate as determined under GAAP and our non-GAAP effective tax rate as part of our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings report.\nAllergan Share Repurchase Program\nOn September 25, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Allergan repurchased approximately 20 percent of the authorized repurchase amount in the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nTeva Securities Divestiture\nAllergan continues to prudently divest its remaining holding in securities of Teva Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. (\"Teva\"), including, as previously disclosed, through its Forward Sale Agreement with J.P. Morgan for 25 million of the 100 million Teva securities with a February 2018 maturity date.\nAllergan plans to sell its remaining position in 2018 through Forward Sale Agreements and/or open market sales. Such sales will be disclosed in amendments to the Company's Schedule 13D as required by law.\nAbout Allergan plc\nAllergan plc (NYSE: AGN), headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is a bold, global pharmaceutical company and a leader in a new industry model – Growth Pharma.
