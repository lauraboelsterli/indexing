Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net EUROPEAN MORNING CALL: LOWER (0617 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. Following a steady close in the previous session, financial spreadbetters expect European to open lower today as gains on Wall Street evaporated, dragged by a weaker energy sector and losses in General Electric shares. Over in Asia, stocks stepped back from a record high as the region's resource shares were hit by falling oil and commodity prices. Here are your morning calls, courtesy of CMC Markets: FTSE100 is expected to open 21 points lower at 7,734 DAX is expected to open 64 points lower at 13,182 CAC40 is expected to open 20 points lower at 5,494 (Danilo Masoni)",
