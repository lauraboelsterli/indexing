The round was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from Salesforce Ventures and the Slack Fund . Repeat investors include High Alpha Capital, GGV, SV Angel, and Hyde Park Venture Partners.\nByron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners will join Zylo’s Board of Directors. Byron directly led investments in seven cloud IPOs (SendGrid, Twilio, Instructure, Box, Criteo, Eloqua, Cornerstone OnDemand) in the past six years, more than any other venture capitalist, and invested in numerous high-growth private cloud companies.\nThe Zylo platform provides one system of record for all SaaS and cloud-based software used across a company, giving an organization visibility into what software is used, how much is spent and how to optimize their SaaS and cloud-based software investments.

I look forward to being an active partner to this veteran team and their big vision.”\nZylo launched in June of 2016 out of High Alpha Studio and announced a $3.3 million seed round in October 2016. The company boasts integrations with Concur, Expensify, G Suite by Google Cloud, Intacct , Microsoft Office 365, Netsuite, Okta , Onelogin, Salesforce , Slack and Veeva Systems.
