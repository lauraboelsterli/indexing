Reed’s is well capitalized and has a strong leadership team, an excellent network of operating and retail partners and great tasting and refreshing natural beverages that have been embraced by our loyal customers for more than 25 years.

Mr. Cargile commented, “I am confident that Reed’s is well positioned for success and has made great progress in the last year. I am also confident that Dan Doherty will provide a great contribution. After joining the Reed’s board of directors, I became the Chief Executive Officer of Sunworks (NASDAQ:SUNW), I now need to devote more of my time to Sunworks.

Reed’s is America’s #1 selling Ginger Beer brand and has been the leader and innovator in the ginger beer category for decades. Virgil’s is America’s #1 selling independent, natural craft soda brand. The Reed’s Inc. portfolio is sold in over 20,000 retail doors across the natural, specialty, grocery, drug, club and mass channels nationwide.
