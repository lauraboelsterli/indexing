    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE American: CDOR), a hotel-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered and incorporated in the state of Maryland, today announced that it has closed on its previously-announced agreement to purchase the 122-room TownePlace Suites located in the North Tech Ridge submarket of Austin, Texas. The hotel was purchased for $19.75 million and will continue to be managed by Aimbridge Hospitality.\n“With the closing of the TownePlace Suites Austin North Tech Ridge, we have added another young, high-quality select-service asset into our growing portfolio of new investment platform hotels. The TownePlace Suites represents the youngest select-service product in the North Tech Ridge submarket, which has numerous and diverse local demand drivers, including Dell’s corporate campus, Samsung’s semiconductor Facility, and General Motors’ IT innovation facility. As the 31 st largest MSA by population, Austin grew faster than all other large metro areas in the United States over the last five years. This new asset fits perfectly within our acquisition strategy of acquiring newer select-service hotels in fast-growing, top-100 MSAs,” stated Bill Blackham, Condor’s Chief Executive Officer.\n“Assuming the closing of the Home2 Suites Summerville, which is currently under contract, we will have closed approximately $276 million of acquisitions since the fourth quarter of 2015, representing fourteen high-quality premium-branded select-service hotels flagged under the leading Marriott, Hilton, and IHG hotel brands,” added Mr. Blackham.\nRefer to the Company’s Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further description of the terms of the transaction.\nAbout Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.\nCondor Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE American: CDOR), is a self-administered real estate investment trust incorporated in the state of Maryland that specializes in the investment and ownership of upper midscale and upscale, premium-branded select-service, extended stay and limited-service hotels. The Company currently owns 19 hotels in 9 states.
