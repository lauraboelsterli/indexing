Benj Pasek and Justin Paul hold the awards they won for Best Original Song - Motion Picture for \"This Is Me\" from the filmâ \"The Greatest Showman,\" at the 75th Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \n“The Greatest Showman” soundtrack, which features songs by the cast including Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and Zendaya, sold another 106,000 total album units in the week ending Jan. 4, according to figures from Nielsen SoundScan. \nThe soundtrack’s lead song, “This is Me,” won the Golden Globe award for best original song in a motion picture on Sunday. The 20th Century Fox film, about circus entertainer P. T. Barnum, has grossed $150 million worldwide since its Dec. 20 release. \nSheeran’s “Divide” album remained at No. 2 for a second week with sales of 67,000 units, while his single “Perfect” featuring Beyonce held steady at No. 1 on the Digital Songs chart with another 109,000 copies sold. \nSwift’s “Reputation” album, which opened 2018 at the top of the Billboard 200 chart last week, dropped to No. 3 with 48,000 units sold. \nNo new entries made the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart this week.
