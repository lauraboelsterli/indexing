    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly said he will vote to keep the government open, suggesting that he would vote for a Republican-backed temporary government funding bill, thereby breaking with the majority of his party.\n“Keeping the government running is our job and I will vote to keep the government open. I hope that Republicans and Democrats will join together to reach an agreement and avoid a shutdown,” the senator from Indiana, a state that voted for Trump in the 2016 election, said in a speech on the Senate floor.
