    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s central bank said it will skip open market operations for the 12th straight trading day on Tuesday as liquidity levels in the banking system were “appropriate”.\nOn a net basis, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will drain 130 billion yuan ($20.01 billion) from the money market for the day, equal to the amount of reverse repos due to mature on Tuesday.\nThe PBOC drained a net 510 billion yuan from the money market last week.\nIn 2017, the central bank drained 65 billion yuan on a net basis from money markets.\nReporting by the Shanghai Newsroom\n ",
