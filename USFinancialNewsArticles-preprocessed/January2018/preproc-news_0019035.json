    "text": " 09 PM / Updated 39 minutes ago Dortmund suspend Aubameyang, draw against Wolves Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Borussia Dortmund misfired in their goalless draw against VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday after suspending top striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for a disciplinary offence. Soccer Football - Bundesliga - Borussia Dortmund vs VfL Wolfsburg - Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund, Germany - January 14, 2018 Borussia Dortmundâ€™s Alexander Isak looks dejected after the match REUTERS/Leon Kuegeler \nThe Gabon international, who has scored 13 league goals, was dropped just before the game after he missed a team meeting on Saturday in his latest disciplinary offence. \nHis finish was badly needed as Dortmund lacked precision up front. \nUkrainian Andriy Yarmolenko squandered a golden opportunity from a Mario Goetze assist and fired over the bar from four metres out while teenager Alexander Isak and Sancho, who both also hit the woodwork, had their share of wasted chances. \nWolfsburg keeper Koen Casteels rescued his team with some desperate goalkeeping late in the game as Dortmund dropped their first points under new coach Peter Stoeger after two wins in their previous two games. \nThe result left the Ruhr valley club in fourth on 29 points as the league resumed after the winter break. Champions Bayern Munich increased their lead at the top to 13 points after they beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 on Friday. \nRB Leipzig, on 31, reclaimed second place with a confidence-boosting 3-1 win over Schalke 04 that snapped their 11-game unbeaten run.
