(NYSE: SPB) (“Spectrum Brands”), a global consumer products company offering a portfolio of leading brands providing superior value to consumers and customers every day, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Global Battery and Lighting Business (“Battery Business”) to Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR) (“Energizer”) for $2.0 billion in cash. The Company expects to use the net cash proceeds after tax and transaction costs to reduce debt, reinvest in its core businesses both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, and repurchase shares.\n“Today’s announcement is a culmination of our efforts to sell the Battery Business in order to refocus Spectrum Brands and enhance shareholder value. While we have a long and proud heritage in the Battery Business, this is a key part of our re-allocation of capital strategy towards a faster-growing and higher-margin Spectrum Brands,” said David Maura, Executive Chairman of Spectrum Brands Holdings.\nAndreas Rouvé, Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings, said, “Through this transaction, we are making progress towards repositioning ourselves with an increased focus on our remaining businesses of Hardware & Home Improvement, Global Auto Care and Pet, Home & Garden. We are focusing our portfolio to strengthen our business and drive long-term growth and shareholder value.\n\"Our Global Battery Business is a true reflection of Spectrum Brands’ strengths – a portfolio of well-known and widely trusted brands driven by a culture of innovation and by passionate people to generate consistent results,” Mr. Rouvé added. “We are pleased to be selling to owners who can deliver the necessary resources and market expertise, and provide strong support for our people and the business’ future growth plans.”\nThe transaction is expected to close prior to the end of calendar 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.\nSpectrum Brands had previously announced on January 3, 2018 that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Global Batteries & Appliances (GBA) businesses. Spectrum Brands is actively marketing its Appliances business. No assurance can be given that any transaction will result from these efforts. The Company does not intend to comment on or provide updates regarding the exploration of strategic options unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required based on the then-current facts and circumstances.\nRBC Capital Markets acted as exclusive financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to Spectrum Brands in connection with the transaction.\nAbout Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\nSpectrum Brands Holdings, a member of the Russell 1000 Index, is a global and diversified consumer products company and a leading supplier of consumer batteries, residential locksets, residential builders’ hardware, plumbing, shaving and grooming products, personal care products, small household appliances, specialty pet supplies, lawn and garden and home pest control products, personal insect repellents, and auto care products.
