    "text": "A disappointing fourth quarter at Colgate-Palmolive shows the company isn’t immune to the weak pricing and intense competition that has dogged rivals like Procter & Gamble.\nUntil now, Colgate-Palmolive’s shares had held up rather well amid a broader washout in the consumer-staples sector. Before reporting fourth-quarter results on Friday, its shares were up 13% over the past year. That compares with a rise of just 2% at P&G, the consumer conglomerate that counts Crest and Oral-B among its brands.\n ",
