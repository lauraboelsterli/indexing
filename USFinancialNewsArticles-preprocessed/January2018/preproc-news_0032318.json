Unlike 2017’ summer, when positioning wasn’t as stretched and valuations still reasonably attractive, current levels are not as supportive for the single currency.\nLatest positioning data showed that net long euro positions are at a record high while both ECB and IMF valuation metrics show the euro is only about 6-7 percent currently compared to more than 12 percent before the French elections last year.\nMorgan Stanley strategists said in a daily note that as long as inflation expectations are met and growth remains strong, the euro’s strength will be tolerated by the ECB.\nElsewhere, Canada’s central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points and take the benchmark borrowing cost to 1.25 percent. Analyst expect the BoC to raise rates as many as three times in 2018.\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $0.7970 and the New Zealand dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7260 .\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
