    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday he would set up a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government and state institutions.\nFILE PHOTO: President of South Africa Jacob Zuma gestures during the 54th National Conference of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo The presidentâ€™s move follows a court ruling on Dec. 13 that required a commission to be set up within 30 days to carry out such an inquiry. That order upheld a recommendation in a 2016 report by the then Public Protector, whose role is to protect standards in public life.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
