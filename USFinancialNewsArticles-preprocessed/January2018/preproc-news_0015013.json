    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The District of Minnesota, case no. 0:18-cv-00047, on behalf of shareholders of Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. (\"Buffalo Wild Wings\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BWLD) who held Buffalo Wild Wings securities and have been harmed by Buffalo Wild Wings and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the merger of the Company to Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Buffalo Wild Wings shareholders will have the right to receive $157.00 in cash per share for each share of Company common stock they own (the \"Merger Consideration\"). The Proposed Transaction is valued at approximately $2.9 billion. December 28, 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings filed a Definitive Proxy Statement (the \"Proxy\") on Schedule 14A with the SEC. The complaint alleges that the Proxy, which recommends that Buffalo Wild Wings shareholders vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (i) the financial analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\"Goldman Sachs\"); and (ii) past dealings or a historical relationship between Goldman Sachs and either Buffalo Wild Wings or Arby's.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today.
