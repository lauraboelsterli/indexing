On Monday it hit $70.37, the highest since December 2014. U.S. crude was up 2 cents at $63.99 and reached its highest since December 2014 on Tuesday.\nA supply report from the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday presented a mixed picture, with inventories of gasoline and diesel rising and crude stocks falling. The U.S. government's weekly supply data is due on Thursday.\nBrent has risen from $61 a barrel in early December and some analysts say the rally may be about to run out of steam.\n\"The upside is now limited for oil prices,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at brokerage Forex.com . \"U.S. oil producers will ramp up production in the coming months.\"\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday it expects U.S. oil output to continue to rise in February with production from shale increasing by 111,000 barrels per day (bpd).\nThe agency previously said U.S. output could reach 10 million bpd in February and 11 million bpd in 2019.\nEven so, traders said prices were unlikely to fall far due to the OPEC-led curbs and the risk of further disruptions.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Dale Hudson)",
