    "text": "Daryl Macon scored all 25 of his points after halftime, and Arkansas outlasted Georgia 80-77 in double-overtime Tuesday at Stegeman Coliseum in Athens, Ga.\nMacon hit a 3-pointer with 1:05 left in the second overtime to give the Razorbacks a 78-76 lead, and Trey Thompson blocked a layup from Georgia’s Yante Maten in the final seconds to help Arkansas (14-6, 4-4 SEC) pick up its first true road win of the season.\nMaten finished with 26 points and 15 rebounds for his ninth double-double of the season, and William Jackson II added 15 points on a career-high five 3-pointers for the Bulldogs (12-7, 3-5 SEC), who have lost two in a row.\nJaylen Barford scored 24 points and sparked the Razorbacks after a sluggish start.\nBoth teams made runs in the first half. Georgia started hot, connecting on four early 3-pointers and racing out to a 24-9 lead. Arkansas, which entered the game averaging 85.1 points per game, had only nine points after 12 1/2 minutes of play. The Razorbacks found their rhythm late, though, and closed the first half with a 15-4 run to cut the Georgia lead to 33-28 at intermission. Barford had eight points during the Razorbacks’ closing spurt.\nHe stayed hot in the second half, knocking down two early 3-pointers and giving the Razorbacks their first lead at 38-37 with 16 minutes left in the second half.\nAnton Beard knocked down a contested jumper with 28 seconds to play in regulation to give the Razorbacks a 63-61 lead. Georgia’s Jordan Harris answered with a pair of free throws with five seconds left to tie the score and force overtime.\nMacon came off the bench for a third straight game and didn’t score in the first half. He hit five 3-pointers on eight attempts after halftime.\nArkansas returns home to take on Oklahoma State on Saturday, as part of the Big 12/SEC Challenge.\nGeorgia will be at Kansas State on Saturday as part of the event.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
