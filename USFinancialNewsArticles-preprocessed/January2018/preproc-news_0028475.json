    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 11:09 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Dakar 12th stage cancelled for bikes and quads Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Dakar Rally organisers cancelled the 12th stage for motorcycles and quadbikes in Argentina on Thursday for safety reasons due to the weather. \nThe cars and trucks, which were due to take a different route, will continue as planned. \n“Having consulted the competitors groupped at Fiambala’s marathon bivouac, the race direction has taken the decision to cancel the 12th special stage for bikes and quads,” a statement said. \nAustrian Matthias Walkner is leading the motorcycle standings on a KTM, 32 minutes clear of Argentina’s Honda rider Kevin Benavides. \nThe 12th stage from Fiambala to San Juan was scheduled as a 375km timed leg and 348km of liaison. The rally ends in Cordoba on Saturday. Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar",
