    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catersource, the world’s premier educational resource and expansive network for the catering and events industry, today announces its third annual State of the Industry feature in anticipation of the upcoming Catersource 2018 event. The feature is based on extensive research by Catersource magazine’s Director of Community & Content Strategy, Kathleen Stoehr. In the last year, the catering and events industry has experienced disruptions that have rippled through every aspect of business, from natural disasters and disaster relief, to planning for the next generation, staffing, and sustainability and food waste concerns, among others.\nCatersource 2018\nFor more information on the feature, visit: https://www.catersource.com/business-operations/state-industry-part-1\n“Individuals, employees and business owners are faced with disruption every day, and with each change and challenge also comes new opportunity. At Catersource 2018, we are very excited to discuss larger industry disruptions and provide attendees with the tools to tackle them from a business perspective,” said Stoehr, who also curates all live education for both Catersource and the Art of Catering Food.\nAs disruption occurs, Catersource is leading the charge as the primary resource for the latest industry information. Its 26 th annual event will take place from February 18–20, 2018 at Caesars Palace. The Art of Catering Food (AOCF) will be co-located with Catersource during the same time frame, and then the educational experience will continue with a vibrant tradeshow at the Las Vegas Convention Center from February 20–21, 2018. For additional information please visit: https://conference.catersource.com/ .\nNatural Disasters and Disaster Relief\nCatering, quick service and full-service restaurants, venues and all aspects of the food and event service industry were disrupted by storms, wildfires, and hurricanes in 2017. According to Technomic’s Vice President of Innovation, Sara Monnette, the top 50 quick-service restaurants in the Houston area lost an estimated 30% of their weekly customer spend on a year-over year basis the week after Hurricane Harvey. However, some caterers found that recovery efforts were a lucrative endeavor to enter into. Waffle House, for example, implemented a shortened menu with nonperishable items in some units and according to Technomic, customer spend increased year-over-year in the Miami area 130% the week of September 10.\nPlanning for the Next Generation\nThe challenges and disruptions faced when transitioning a company from one generation to the next include alignment of family interests, balancing of financial returns, lack of interest on the part of the next generation and company control, among others. Carl Sacks, executive director of the Leading Caterers of America, believes that generational succession is a challenge for nearly any family business, and only one third of all family businesses successfully make the transition to the second generation according to Forbes . In order to tackle this challenge, one must implement succession planning and evaluate it regularly.\nStaffing\nStaffing is the single largest expense and challenge for virtually every caterer or restaurateur, due to lack of available staff and unease sweeping the industry related to minimum wage increases. To tackle this challenge, Robert Sullivan, owner of Utah Food Services, Salt Lake City Utah, has looked to the retired community and high schools for temporary support for the last 20 years. By identifying group leaders within retirement organizations and high school clubs to support large events, relationships are cultivated over several years, and 40% of these temporary workers become leaders that significantly reduce staffing stress.\nSustainability & Food Waste Concerns\nOver 30% to 40% of food produced goes uneaten , leading to the growing concern about sustainability and food waste. To solve these problems, chefs and giant multinational companies are implementing sustainability practices and embracing a no waste movement, which includes developing more ways to use food scraps, save water and reduce plastic waste.\nFor more information on Catersource 2018 packages and pricing, visit conference.catersource.com .
