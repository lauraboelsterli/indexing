    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INC Research/inVentiv Health (Nasdaq:INCR), the only fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization, today announced that Greg Rush is stepping down as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to pursue an opportunity at a private company. In order to ensure a smooth transition, Rush will remain as the company’s CFO until April 30, 2018.\nAlistair Macdonald, Chief Executive Officer of INC Research/inVentiv Health, said, “Greg is a valued member of the Executive Leadership Team. He played an important role in INC Research’s initial public offering, successfully merging INC Research and inVentiv Health and building great momentum in our integration. On behalf of everyone here, I thank Greg for his contributions to the company and look forward to his continued guidance as we work to identify his successor.”\nRush said, “As I prepare to start the next chapter of my career, I am grateful for my four years at INC Research/inVentiv Health. Serving alongside Alistair and our talented and dedicated team has been a privilege and an honor. I am committed to ensuring a seamless transition, and I am confident that INC Research/inVentiv Health will continue to positively address the needs of biopharmaceutical companies, patients, physicians and payers around the world for many years to come.”\nThe company has initiated a search for a permanent CFO and will retain an executive search firm to assist with that process. The company expects to consider both internal and external candidates for the role. Jason Meggs, Executive Vice President and CFO, Commercial Solutions, will act as interim CFO, beginning April 30, 2018, should the search continue to be active at that time.\nAbout INC Research/inVentiv Health\nINC Research/inVentiv Health (Nasdaq:INCR) is the only fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization.
