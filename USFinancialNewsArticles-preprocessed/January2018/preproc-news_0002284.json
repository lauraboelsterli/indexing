    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - There is no evidence that the fatal stabbing of a Japanese man in a series of random and unprovoked attacks in the northeastern Irish town of Dundalk this week was related to terrorism, police said on Thursday.\nAn 18-year-old Egyptian man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of 24-year-old Yosuke Sasaki, whom police said had been living in Ireland for the past year. Two other men were injured in the attacks early on Wednesday.\nPolice said at the time of the arrest that terrorism was one line of enquiry they were pursuing.\n“At this time, we can find no established link to indicate that this tragedy is terrorist-related,” they said in a statement on Thursday. “However, enquires are continuing internationally as the investigation develops.”\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
