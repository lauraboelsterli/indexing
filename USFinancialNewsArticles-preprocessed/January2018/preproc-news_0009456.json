Proof of this team’s success is demonstrated by the Trust Company’s compounded annual revenue growth of nearly 10 percent over the course of Ray’s tenure as CEO - a truly remarkable track record - and their achievement of one of the highest client retention records in the industry.”\nPrior to joining Commerce Bank, Handy was chief operating officer and director of TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB, the Missouri-based trust subsidiary of the national teachers’ retirement fund manager. Handy received his bachelor of arts degree in economics and business administration from Wittenberg University in 1985. He is a graduate with honors from the ABA Graduate Trust School of Northwestern University, where he earned his CFSC designation. Handy also holds a Series 65 license.\nCommerce Trust Company, founded in 1906, is a specialized division of Commerce Bank, solely focused on wealth management, investments and planning services for families and institutional clients.
