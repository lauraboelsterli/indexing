(NASDAQ:HTGM) (HTG), a provider of instruments, reagents and services for molecular profiling applications, today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 12,100,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $2.90 per share.

The offering is expected to close on January 23, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, HTG has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,815,000 additional shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nHTG anticipates using the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\nLeerink Partners LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC and LifeSci Capital LLC are acting as co-managers for the offering.\nThe shares of common stock described above are being offered by HTG pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed by HTG with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that was declared effective on April 6, 2017. A preliminary prospectus supplement related to the offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov .
