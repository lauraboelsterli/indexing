    "text": "YARDLEY, Pa., Jan. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alliqua BioMedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALQA) (“Alliqua or the “Company”), a regenerative technologies company committed to restoring tissue and rebuilding lives, today announced a definitive agreement with Celularity, Inc. (“Celularity”), under which Celularity will acquire all of the property, assets and rights relating to the Company’s advanced biologic wound care business - including Biovance® amniotic membrane allograft and Interfyl® Human Connective Tissue Matrix - and the Company’s UltraMist® Therapy System and other therapeutic ultrasound platform products for an aggregate cash consideration of $29.0 million. No debt or significant liabilities are being assumed by Celularity in the transaction. Alliqua BioMedical’s Board of Directors unanimously approved entering into the agreement.\n“This is a transformative transaction for Alliqua,” said David Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Alliqua. “First, we will be able to strengthen our balance sheet by paying our debt in full. Second, we believe we will have an appropriate amount of working capital to drive our operating business forward in a positive way. Finally, we will evaluate the appropriate options to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value.”\n“The acquisition of Alliqua’s commercial infrastructure and product portfolio in the field of regeneration advances Celularity’s goal of bringing back under one entity the proprietary end-to-end regenerative pipeline that was pioneered by Celularity’s predecessor company, Anthrogenesis Corporation,” mentioned Dr. Robert Hariri, Founder and CEO of Celularity. “This acquisition further positions Celularity to become the world leader in cell therapy and regenerative medicine, which have the potential to treat or cure many of today’s most debilitating illnesses.”\nThe asset purchase agreement includes all intellectual property and all license, marketing, development and supply agreements related to these businesses. The Company’s contract manufacturing assets and operations are not included in the asset purchase agreement. The transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among other things, Alliqua BioMedical stockholder approval. There are no financing conditions associated with the transaction.\nCowen served as Alliqua’s exclusive financial advisor in connection with this transaction.\nThe above description of the definitive agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreements, which Alliqua included as an exhibit to its Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nThis communication is being made in respect of the proposed asset purchase transaction involving Alliqua and Celularity.
