(“AMD” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AMD) violated federal securities laws.\nClick here to learn about the case: http://docs.wongesq.com/AMD-Info-Request-Form-1785 . There is no cost or obligation to you.\nOn January 3, 2018, following reports that processor chips manufactured by AMD's competitor, Intel Corporation, contained a major security flaw—known as the \"Spectre\" vulnerability—AMD advised investors that while its own chips were vulnerable to one variant of Spectre, there was \"near zero risk\" that AMD chips were vulnerable to the second Spectre variant. Then on January 11, 2018, AMD acknowledged that its chips were in fact susceptible to both variants of the Spectre security flaw.\nTo learn more about the investigation of Advanced Micro contact Vincent Wong, Esq. either via email vw@wongesq.com , by telephone at 212.425.1140, or visit http://docs.wongesq.com/AMD-Info-Request-Form-1785 .\nVincent Wong, Esq. is an experienced attorney that has represented investors in securities litigations involving financial fraud and violations of shareholder rights.
