    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 9:26 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Trump administration drops Cha as pick for Seoul envoy - U.S. official Reuters Staff 1   Victor Cha, a former White House official who had been the Trump’s administration’s choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to South Korea, is no longer being considered for the post, a U.S. official said on Tuesday. \nThe Washington Post earlier quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that Cha had raised concerns with National Security Council officials over their consideration of a limited strike on North Korea and about the administration’s threats to tear up a bilateral trade deal with Seoul. \nCha, a Washington-based academic who for months had been widely expected to be nominated for the sensitive diplomatic post, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
