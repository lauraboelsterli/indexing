(the “Company” or “IBP”) (NYSE:IBP), an industry-leading installer of insulation and complementary building products, announced today the acquisition of Rocket Insulation & Coatings Inc. Founded in 2009, Rocket Insulation serves the Long Island, New York market through one branch location. The company provides spray foam and fiberglass insulation installation services primarily for single-family residential customers.\n“With trailing-twelve month revenue of $5.4 million, Rocket Insulation expands our footprint to the Long Island market,” stated Jeff Edwards, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Prior to this acquisition, IBP did not have a presence in Long Island, and we are excited to begin serving primarily single-family residential customers in this large market.”\nAbout Installed Building Products\nInstalled Building Products, Inc. is one of the nation's largest insulation installers for the residential new construction market and is also a diversified installer of complementary building products, including waterproofing, fire-stopping and fireproofing, garage doors, rain gutters, shower doors, closet shelving and mirrors, throughout the United States. The Company manages all aspects of the installation process for its customers, including direct purchases of materials from national manufacturers, supply of materials to job sites and quality installation. The Company offers its portfolio of services for new and existing single-family and multi-family residential and commercial building projects from its national network of branch locations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including with respect to the demand for our services and product offerings, expansion of our national footprint, our ability to capitalize on the new home construction recovery, our ability to strengthen our market position, our ability to pursue value-enhancing acquisitions and our ability to improve profitability.
