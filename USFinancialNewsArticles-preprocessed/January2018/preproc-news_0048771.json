    "text": "AMMAN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Jordan’s largest lender, Arab Bank Group, said on Saturday its 2017 net profit came to $533 million, barely changed from $532.7 million with revenues coming mainly from core banking activities.\nThe bank, one of the Middle East’s major financial institutions, said operational profits rose 12 percent without factoring exchange-rate fluctuations.\nTotal loans rose 6 percent to $25.1 billion while deposits rose slighty to $33.8 billion at the end of last year compared with $33.6 billion in the same period the previous year.
