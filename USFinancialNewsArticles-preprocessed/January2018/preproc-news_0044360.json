    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 12:37 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Asia stocks rise for 11th straight session, Trump helps dollar bounce Shinichi Saoshiro 5 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended their winning run to the 11th day on Friday, while the battered dollar won back some ground after President Donald Trump said he wanted a strong U.S. currency. \nEuropean shares are expected to open higher, with spread-betters foreseeing a 0.3 percent gain in Germany's DAX .GDAXI and France's Cac .FCHI and a 0.4 percent rise in Britain's FTSE .FTSE . \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.25 percent for the day, led by gains in Chinese financial and property shares. \nIt headed for its 11th straight day of gains, the longest sequence since 2015, and also for seventh straight week of gains for the first time since 2010. \nJapan's Nikkei .N225 ended down 0.2 percent. \nWorld equity markets have rallied over the past year, buoyed by a synchronised uptick in global economic growth in a boon to corporate profits and stock valuations. \nAustralian markets were closed for a public holiday. \nThe Dow .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX ended at their highest closing levels ever on Thursday although Wall Street relinquished bigger intraday gains after President Trump's strong dollar comments.[.N] \nTrump said on Thursday he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong, contradicting comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin one day earlier. \nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was at 89.034 .DXY. It had sunk to a three-year low of 88.438 on Thursday after Mnuchin said he welcomed a weaker greenback, which the markets initially took as Washington’s departure from its strong dollar policy. \n“Trump did say he wanted a stronger dollar, but at the same time made no intention of changing his stance towards pursuing U.S. interest through trade policies,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. \n“Comments from U.S. top officials regarding the dollar are likely to continue lacking consistency going forward,” he said. \nThe euro was 0.2 percent higher at $1.2426 EUR= but still some distance from $1.2538, its highest since December 2014 scaled on Thursday. \nThe common currency had soared to the fresh three-year high on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said economic data pointed to “solid and broad” growth with inflation likely to rise in the medium term from subdued levels. \nDraghi also said the recent surge in the euro was a source of uncertainty, although this had little impact on the currency as some market participants had expected the ECB chief to use stronger language. \nThe dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 109.42 yen JPY= , though it rebounded from a four-month low of 108.500 set the previous day. \nThe pound was 0.5 percent higher at $1.4205 GBP=D3 following its ascent to a 1-1/2-year high of $1.4346 the previous day. \nThe Australian dollar climbed 0.5 percent to $0.8059 AUD=D4 , edging back towards a four-month peak of set $0.8119 overnight. \nEven if the Trump administration does push for a weaker dollar, the current U.S. monetary policy trend was expected to complicate the agenda. \n“Help from the Federal Reserve would be needed to weaken the dollar. But right now, the Fed is in midst of raising interest rates and this is not conducive to a weaker currency,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. \nThe Fed conducted three rate hikes in 2017 and is expected to tighten as many as three more times in 2018. \nOil prices fell ahead of the end of the peak-demand winter season in the northern hemisphere, although ongoing supply cuts and the weakening dollar offered broad support to the market. \nU.S. crude futures CLc1 were 0.1 percent lower at $65.43 per barrel after reaching $66.66 on Thursday, highest since December 2014. \nSpot gold XAU= was a shade higher at $1,354 per ounce after sliding 0.8 percent overnight. It set $1,366.06 earlier on Thursday, its highest since August 2016. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Sam Holmes",
