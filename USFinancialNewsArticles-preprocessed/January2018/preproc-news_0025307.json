    "text": "Trump claims Democrats don't want to make a deal on DACA President Donald Trump tweeted statements concerning the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He continued to blame congressional Democrats for stalling a process to come to an agreement on the future of the program. SHARES Mark Wilson | Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump waves as he departs from the White House on July 12, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday to blame Democrats for stalling a deal to protect about 800,000 young immigrants from deportation. \nThe president referred to statements made Sunday prior to a dinner with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in West Palm Beach, Florida . \n\"Statement by me last night in Florida: 'Honestly, I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA, but they don't want to help..We are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to,\" he wrote on the social media platform. @realDonaldTrump tweet \nHe then referenced increased border security a cornerstone of his campaign, claiming congressional Democrats \"don't want...to stop drugs.\" \nThey don't want security at the border, they don't want... to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.\" My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump wrote.",
