It ended above 25,000 on Jan. 4.\nJPMorgan and Wells Fargo kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday. More than three quarters of the 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, have beaten profit estimates, above the average of the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAt 6:52 a.m. ET (1152 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 231 points, or 0.9 percent, with 71,925 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 12.75 points, or 0.46 percent, with 276,816 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 43.25 points, or 0.64 percent, on volume of 64,602 contracts.\nThe markets were shut on Monday to observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nGeneral Electric shares fell more than 4 percent after the company said it would record a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, related to its finance arm’s run-off insurance portfolio.\nOil prices pulled back from 2014 highs on Tuesday, with Brent crude dipping 1.38 percent to $69.3 per barrel and U.S. crude trading slightly below $64 per barrel.\nBitcoin tumbled 18 percent to a four-week trough close to $11,000, after reports that a ban on trading of cryptocurrencies in South Korea was still an option.\nShares of cryptocurrency-related companies were all down. Marathon Patent, Riot BlockChain, Xunlei and Overstock.com fell between 4 percent and 13 percent. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
