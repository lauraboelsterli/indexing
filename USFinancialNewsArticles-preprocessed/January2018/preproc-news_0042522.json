    "text": "SAN DIEGO,\nMitek (NASDAQ:MITK) ( www.miteksystems.com ), a global leader in mobile capture and digital identity verification software solutions, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal First Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue increased 31% year over year to $12.1 million. GAAP net loss of $(5.7) million, or $(0.17) per share, includes an estimated one-time non-cash charge of $4.4 million, or $0.13 per share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding the impact of tax reform, net loss was $(1.3) million, or $(0.04) per share. Non-GAAP net income was $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, up 4%. Total cash and investments was $45.8 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.\nCommenting on the results, James DeBello, Chairman and CEO of Mitek, said:\n“Our results for the fiscal first quarter reflect continued solid growth from both our digital identity software solutions and our industry leading Mobile Deposit. Our growing and profitable recurring business in mobile deposit continues to be a solid springboard from which to capture the growth in the global digital identity verification market. During the quarter SaaS ID transactions increased 117% year over year, and we ended the quarter with 29% more ID customers than a year ago. With our continued momentum in both markets, we are well positioned for growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond.”\nFiscal 2018 Financial Guidance\nFor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, the Company is reiterating its previously provided guidance for full year total revenue of $57 million to $59 million, which would represent growth between 26% and 30% year over year. The Company continues to expect to generate a non-GAAP profit margin of approximately 19% to 20% for fiscal 2018.\nConference Call Information\nMitek management will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company's financial results.\nTo listen to the live conference call, parties in the United States and Canada should dial 800-239-9838, access code 2115565.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to the Company's ability to withstand negative conditions in the global economy, a lack of demand for or market acceptance of the Company's products, the Company's ability to continue to develop, produce and introduce innovative new products in a timely manner or the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation and the timing of the implementation and launch of the Company’s products by the Company's signed customers.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are contained from time to time in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, but not limited to, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you may obtain for free on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Collectively, these risks and uncertainties could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in its forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release contains non-GAAP financial measures for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude stock compensation expenses, intellectual property litigation costs, acquisition-related costs and expenses, and deferred taxes. These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company's performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company's operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company's comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company's underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company's underlying business.\nMITEK SYSTEMS, INC.

The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances, the utilization of research and development tax credits, and the utilization of loss carryforwards which currently have an overall effect of reducing taxes payable. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 30%.",
