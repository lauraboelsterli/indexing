    "text": "BOSTON, MA, Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ValueSetters Inc. (OTC Pink: VSTR) announced the acquisition of DreamFunded Marketplace, LLC, Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area’s first regulated funding portal under Title III of the JOBS Act, which allowed non-accredited investors to invest in early-stage startup companies.\nThe DreamFunded.com’s membership base will be exclusive for accredited investors. Going forward, however, all of the Title III offerings will be available for ValueSetters to direct to Netcapital.com , a registered funding portal that assists startups that are seeking to raise up to $1,070,000 from non-accredited investors.\nAs part of this agreement, Manny Fernandez, the founder of the DreamFunded brand, will join the ValueSetters Board of Advisors. Manny Fernandez is a Stanford University educated angel investor, serial entrepreneur, and bestselling author featured on CNBC's Make Me A Millionaire Inventor. He has been successful investing in his own ideas as well as taking companies from startup to exit. Featured in The Wall Street Journal and on CNBC Squawk Box , he was also named one of the 33 Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2016 by Inc. Magazine . In addition, he was chosen as the 2014 San Francisco Angel Investor of the Year.\n“We are pleased that someone of Manny Fernandez’s caliber has chosen to form a relationship with ValueSetters. With his expertise as a pioneer in the equity crowdfunding space, Manny will bring his vast experience and provide value to the hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs who are looking to raise money,” said Cecilia Lenk, CEO. “With Manny’s extensive network and strong reputation in the startup ecosystem and the investor community, we expect the acquisition to have a positive impact on revenues going forward.”\nTerms of the acquisition have not been disclosed.\nAbout ValueSetters: Led by a team of professional investors and technology specialists, ValueSetters is a publicly traded boutique advisory firm with unique expertise in helping early stage companies raise capital over the Internet.
