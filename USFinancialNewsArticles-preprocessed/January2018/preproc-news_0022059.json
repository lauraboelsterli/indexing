    "text": " 45 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Post Holdings to explore options for private brands business Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds background on company) \nJan 11 (Reuters) - Post Holdings Inc said on Thursday it would explore options, including a sale, for its private brands business, which makes nut butter, dried fruits, pasta and granola products for retailers and distributors. \nThe company said the options also include an initial public offering, a private equity placement and a strategic combination. \nPostâ€™s shares were up 2.5 percent at $81 in light premarket trading on Thursday. \nThe company operates its business under five units: Post Consumer Brands, Michael Foods Group, Active Nutrition, Private Brands and Weetabix. \nPost said it would now create two more units - refrigerated retail and food service - after it closes the acquisition of frozen foods maker Bob Evans Farms by January 12. \nIn its most recent quarter, sales at the private brands business rose 7 percent to $114 million, or about 8 percent of total sales. The unit counts grocers Whole Foods Market and Aldi as its top customers. \nJim Dwyer, current chief executive of the Michael Foods Group unit, will lead the private brands business.
