    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Quantum Corp. (NYSE: QTM) today announced that its board of directors has appointed Patrick Dennis as president and CEO, effective today. Dennis was most recently president and CEO of Guidance Software and has also held senior executive roles in strategy, operations, sales, services and engineering at EMC. He succeeds Adalio Sanchez, a member of Quantum's board who had served as interim CEO since early November 2017. Sanchez will remain on the board and assist with the transition.\n\"Patrick has been a successful public company CEO and brings a broad range of experience in storage and software, including a proven track record leading business transformations,\" said Raghu Rau, Quantum's chairman. \"The other board members and I look forward to working closely with him to drive growth, cost reductions, and profitability and deliver long-term shareholder value. We also want to thank Adalio for stepping in and leading the company during a critical transition period.\"\n\"During my time as CEO, I've greatly appreciated the commitment to change I've seen from team members across Quantum and will be supporting Patrick in any way I can to build on the important work we started,\" said Sanchez.\nDennis served as president and CEO of Guidance Software, a provider of cyber security software solutions, from May 2015 until its acquisition by OpenText last September. During his tenure, he turned the company around, growing revenue and significantly improving profitability. Before joining Guidance Software, Dennis was senior vice president and chief operating officer, Products and Marketing, at EMC, where he led the business operations of its $10.5 billion enterprise and mid-range systems division, including management of its cloud storage business. Dennis spent 12 years at EMC, including as vice president and chief operating officer of EMC Global Services, overseeing a 3,500-person technical sales force. In addition to his time at EMC, he served as group vice president, North American Storage Sales, at Oracle, where he turned around a declining business.\n\"With its long-standing expertise in addressing the most demanding data management challenges, Quantum is well-positioned to help customers maximize the strategic value of their ever-growing digital assets in a rapidly changing environment,\" said Dennis. \"I'm excited to be joining the company as it looks to capitalize on this market opportunity by leveraging its strong solutions portfolio in a more focused way, improving its cost structure and execution, and continuing to innovate.\"\nAbout Quantum\nQuantum is a leading expert in scale-out tiered storage, archive and data protection, providing solutions for capturing, sharing, managing and preserving digital assets over the entire data lifecycle.
