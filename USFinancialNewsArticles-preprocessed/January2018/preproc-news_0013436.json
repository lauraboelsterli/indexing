Barclays' CEO Jes Staley arrives at 10 Downing Street in London, Britain january 11, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nMay met with financiers from companies including Barclays, Goldman Sachs and HSBC at Downing Street on Thursday to discuss the impact of Brexit on Europe’s financial capital. \nAs May plots Britain’s course for Brexit, London’s vast financial services industry is scrambling to prepare for losing access to the world’s biggest trading bloc, the City of London’s biggest challenge since at least the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
