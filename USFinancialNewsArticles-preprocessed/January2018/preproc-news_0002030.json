In Suffolk County, where blizzard conditions were forecast, snow started falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches an hour before 8 a.m. ET. \nIn New York City, where 5 to 10 inches of snow was predicted, the city closed public schools, suspended alternate side parking and urged residents to use mass transit whenever possible.
