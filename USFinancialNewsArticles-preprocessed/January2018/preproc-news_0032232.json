The weighted average interest rate of the Series 2018-1 Notes is 3.41%.\nThe Class B Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes. The Class C Notes are subordinated to the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes. In addition, HVF II will issue the Series 2018-1 Class D Notes, which will be retained by HVF II or conveyed to an affiliate of HVF II.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2018-1 Notes generally are expected to be used (i) to make loans to Hertz Vehicle Financing LLC, a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of the Company, and/or (ii) to repay a portion of the outstanding principal amount of HVF II's Series 2013-A Variable Funding Notes, as well as other series of notes issued by HVF II, from time to time. The offering is expected to close on January 24, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Series 2018-1 Notes or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Series 2018-1 Notes or any other securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The Series 2018-1 Notes will be sold in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\") and, solely in the case of the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Class C Notes, to investors outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. None of the Series 2018-1 Notes will be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and the Series 2018-1 Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable state or other jurisdiction.\nABOUT HERTZ\nThe Hertz Corporation, a subsidiary of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., operates the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty vehicle rental brands in approximately 9,700 corporate and franchisee locations throughout North America, Europe, The Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
