GAAP results in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include items which are excluded from non-GAAP results.

China grew revenues 30% in Q1, with the strategic acquisition of East China positioning us to accelerate our growth in the key China market,” said Kevin Johnson, president and ceo. “Today, Starbucks has two powerful, independent but complementary engines driving our global growth, the U.S. and China. Our work to streamline the company is sharpening our focus on our core operating priorities.”\n“Starbucks delivered solid revenue and profit growth and our first ever $6 billion revenue quarter in Q1,” said Scott Maw, cfo. “We are laser-focused on accelerating growth in China and driving improvement across the U.S. business as we move into and through the back half of the year, and remain committed to delivering on the long-term targets we announced last quarter.”\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary\nQuarter Ended Dec 31, 2017 Comparable Store Sales (1) Sales Growth Change in Transactions Change in Ticket Consolidated 2% 0% 2% Americas 2% 0% 2% CAP 1% 1% 0% EMEA (2) (1)% (4)% 3% (1) Includes only Starbucks company-operated stores open 13 months or longer.

Operating Results Quarter Ended Change ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Net New Stores (1) 700 649 51 Revenues $6,073.7 $5,732.9 6% Operating Income $1,116.1 $1,132.6 (1)% Operating Margin 18.4% 19.8% (140) bps EPS $1.57 $0.51 208% (1) Q1 2018 net new stores include the closure of 2 Teavana-branded stores. Consolidated net revenues grew 6% over Q1 FY17 to $6.1 billion in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 2% growth in global comparable store sales.\nConsolidated operating income declined 1% to $1,116.1 million in Q1 FY18, down from $1,132.6 million in Q1 FY17. Consolidated operating margin declined 140 basis points to 18.4%, primarily due to food-related mix shift in the Americas, as well as restructuring costs related to the company's ongoing efforts to streamline business operations.\nQ1 Americas Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Net New Stores 278 251 27 Revenues $4,265.8 $3,991.4 7% Operating Income $979.4 $958.5 2% Operating Margin 23.0% 24.0% (100) bps Net revenues for the Americas segment grew 7% over Q1 FY17 to $4.3 billion in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 979 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 2% growth in comparable store sales.\nOperating income of $979.4 million in Q1 FY18 grew 2% versus $958.5 million in Q1 FY17. Operating margin of 23.0% declined 100 basis points primarily due to food-related mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage.\nQ1 China/Asia Pacific Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Net New Stores 300 303 (3) Revenues $843.7 $770.8 9% Operating Income $196.8 $163.4 20% Operating Margin 23.3% 21.2% 210 bps Net revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment grew 9% over Q1 FY17 to $843.7 million in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,033 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 1% increase in comparable store sales. The increase was partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in Q4 FY17 as part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline business operations and retail geographies.\nQ1 FY18 operating income of $196.8 million grew 20% over Q1 FY17 operating income of $163.4 million. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.3%, primarily due to sales leverage and favorable foreign currency translation.\nQ1 EMEA Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Net New Stores 123 95 28 Revenues $283.9 $262.4 8% Operating Income $39.1 $44.1 (11)% Operating Margin 13.8% 16.8% (300) bps Net revenues for the EMEA segment grew 8% over Q1 FY17 to $283.9 million in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency translation and incremental revenues from the opening of 365 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.\nOperating income of $39.1 million in Q1 FY18 declined 11% versus operating income of $44.1 million in Q1 FY17. Operating margin declined 300 basis points to 13.8% primarily driven by sales deleverage in company-operated stores.\nQ1 Channel Development Segment Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Revenues $560.3 $553.7 1% Operating Income $243.3 $242.9 —% Operating Margin 43.4% 43.9% (50) bps Net revenues for the Channel Development segment of $560.3 million in Q1 FY18 increased 1% versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by our foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels. This increase was partially offset by competitive pricing on single-serve items and the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo tea brand late in Q1 FY18.\nOperating income of $243.3 million in Q1 FY18 was flat compared to Q1 FY17. Operating margin declined 50 basis points to 43.4% primarily driven by deleverage on cost of sales and lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, partially offset by lower marketing expense.\nQ1 All Other Segments Results\nQuarter Ended Change ($ in millions) Dec 31, 2017 Jan 1, 2017 Net New Stores (1) — (1) Revenues $120.0 $154.6 (22)% Operating Income/(Loss) $(30.0) $9.6 nm All Other Segments primarily includes Teavana-branded stores, Seattle’s Best Coffee®, and Starbucks Reserve™ and Roastery businesses. The operating loss in Q1 FY18 was primarily due to restructuring costs related to our strategy to close Teavana retail stores and focus on Teavana tea within Starbucks stores.\nFiscal 2018 Targets\nThe company reiterates the following full year FY18 targets, with the exception of earnings per share which has been modified for the expected net impact of changes in the U.S. tax law and related reinvestments. Year-over-year growth is based on prior year non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release.\nContinue to expect approximately 2,300 net new stores globally Continue to expect 3-5% comparable store sales growth globally, expect to be near the low end of the range for the year Continue to expect consolidated revenue growth in the high single digits consistent with long term guidance; when including approximately 2% of net favorability related to the acquisition of East China and other streamlining activities, we expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 9-11% in FY18 Now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.36 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.53, consistent with guidance issued last quarter but updated to include the expected net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments\nThe company will provide select quarterly and segment information regarding its business outlook during its regularly scheduled quarterly earnings conference calls; this information will also be available following the call on the company's website at http://investor.starbucks.com .\nCompany Updates\nOn December 31, Starbucks completed the previously announced acquisition of the remaining 50% share of its East China business from long-term joint venture partners, Uni-President (\"UPEC\") and President Chain Store Corporation (\"PCSC\"). As a result of this acquisition, Starbucks has assumed 100% ownership of over 1,400 Starbucks stores in Shanghai and in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, bringing the total number of company-owned stores in China to over 3,100 at the time of closing. Also on December 31, UPEC and PCSC acquired Starbucks 50% interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited and assumed 100% ownership of Starbucks operations in Taiwan. The company completed its previously announced sale of the Tazo Tea brand to Unilever on December 11. Starbucks will instead drive a single tea brand strategy and focus with its super premium tea brand, Teavana, by continuing to invest in the growth, innovation and development of the Teavana brand of teas in its Starbucks stores and in channels outside its stores. Last week, the company was named 5th in Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies survey, and placed in the top spot for the food services industry. The company opened its Starbucks Reserve™ Roastery in Shanghai, China, on December 5, now the largest Starbucks store in the world. The Roastery features onsite baking by Italian food purveyor Rocco Princi for the first time ever in China and features onsite roasting and brewing of Starbucks Reserve coffees. Starbucks also brought Princi Bakery to the U.S. inside its Seattle Roastery in November 2017. Together with its local business partner, Baristas del Caribe, LLC, Starbucks opened its first store in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria struck the island in September 2017. The two companies and their namesake nonprofit foundations have also collectively contributed more than $1.3 million toward emergency relief and long-term rebuilding efforts across the region. In November 2017, the company opened its first store in Jamaica and entered its 76th market globally, marking a historic milestone for the global coffee company’s Caribbean operations and its storied history of sourcing high-quality coffee from the region going back more than four decades. The company repurchased 28.5 million shares of common stock in Q1 FY18; approximately 52 million shares remain available for purchase under current authorizations. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on February 23, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2018.\nConference Calls\nStarbucks will hold a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, which will be hosted by Kevin Johnson, president and ceo, and Scott Maw, cfo. The call will be webcast and can be accessed at http://investor.starbucks.com . A replay of the webcast will be available until end of day Saturday, February 24, 2018.\nIn addition, Starbucks will hold a supplemental conference call to provide a market update on China as well as to address high-level modeling-related questions on Wednesday, January 31, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below listed items, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are operating income, operating margin and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Exclusion Rationale East China acquisition-related gain Management excludes the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture as this incremental gain is specific to the purchase activity and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Taiwan joint venture operations Management excludes the gain related to the sale of our Taiwan joint venture operations as this incremental gain is specific to the sale activity and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Tazo brand\nManagement excludes the net gain on the sale of our assets associated with our Tazo brand and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and for reasons discussed above. Restructuring expenses Management excludes restructuring charges related to strategic shifts in its Teavana and e-commerce business units as well as related to divesting certain lower margin businesses and assets, such as closure of certain company-operated stores for reasons discussed above. Additionally, these expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.\nCAP transaction and integration-related costs Management excludes transaction and integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.\nSale of Singapore retail operations Management excludes the net gain related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. Sale of Germany retail operations Management excludes the net gain, associated costs and changes in estimated indemnifications related to the sale of our Germany retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. The Starbucks Foundation donation Management excludes the company's largest donation to a non-profit organization for reasons discussed above. 2018 U.S. stock award\nManagement excludes the announced incremental 2018 stock-based compensation award for reasons discussed above.\nOther tax matters On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law. Management excludes the estimated transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the re–measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate for reasons discussed above.\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nSTARBUCKS CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(unaudited)\n($ in millions) Quarter Ended Consolidated\nDec 31,\n2017\nJan 1,\n2017\nChange Operating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 1,116.1 $ 1,132.6 (1.5)% Restructuring expenses (1) 32.0 —\nCAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 18.5 14.0 Sale of Tazo brand transaction costs\n0.9 —\nNon-GAAP operating income $ 1,167.5 $ 1,146.6 1.8% Operating margin, as reported (GAAP) 18.4 % 19.8 % (140) bps Restructuring expenses (1) 0.5 — CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 0.3 0.2 Sale of Tazo brand\n— — Non-GAAP operating margin 19.2 % 20.0 % (80) bps Diluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 1.57 $ 0.51 207.8% East China acquisition gain (0.92 ) — Sale of Taiwan joint venture operations (0.11 ) —\nSale of Tazo brand\n(0.24 ) — Restructuring expenses (1) 0.02 — CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 0.01 0.01 Other tax matters (3) 0.10 —\nIncome tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (4) 0.22 — Non-GAAP net earnings per share $ 0.65 $ 0.52 25.0% (1) Represents $27.6 million associated with our restructuring efforts, primarily lease termination costs.
