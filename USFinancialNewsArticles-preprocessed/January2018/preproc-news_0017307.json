    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he expects a medical examination he is to undergo on Friday will go well and that he would be surprised if it did not.\nAnswering questions from reporters after an event on prison reform at the White House, Trump said with a smile, “It better go well, otherwise the stock market will not be happy.”\n“I think it’s going to go very well. I’ll be very surprised if it doesn‘t,” he said.\nThe medical checkup at Walter Reed Medical Center in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, will be the first for Trump since he took office nearly a year ago.\nU.S. President Donald Trump answers a question during a joint news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria Trump’s medical exam was announced early last month after he slurred part of a speech in which he declared the United States recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nMichael Wolff, author of “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” has charged in promoting the book that Trump lacked the mental fitness to serve as president, drawing fire from Trump, his aides and supporters.\nTrump’s physical exam is not expected to include a mental acuity test.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the exam will be conducted by presidential physician Ronnie Jackson.\nA statement about the results will be released on Friday. At the White House on Tuesday, Jackson will give details on Trump’s health and take questions.\nReporting by Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
