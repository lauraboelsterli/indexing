She joins Sidley from Bracewell LLP. Ms. Palmer brings a wealth of environmental regulatory knowledge and experience in handling complicated energy-related environmental transactions.\nMs. Palmer is a well-versed environmental lawyer who advises clients in the energy, petrochemical, power and utility sectors. She handles a variety of regulatory counseling and enforcement matters, including onshore and offshore oil and gas regulation, solid and hazardous waste, oil and gas waste, wastewater and stormwater permitting, wetlands, water rights, Superfund litigation and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. Ms. Palmer also advises clients on environmental issues relating to shale play development, hydraulic fracturing and the permitting, construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import and export facilities in the U.S. On the transactional side, Ms. Palmer has extensive experience identifying and managing sources of environmental risks.
