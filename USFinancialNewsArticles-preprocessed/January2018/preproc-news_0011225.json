    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) announced today that Edmond L. Harris has been named executive vice president of operations, effective immediately. Mr. Harris has more than 40 years’ experience in the railroad industry in an operating capacity, including nearly two decades at the Illinois Central and Canadian National (CN), where he worked closely with Hunter Harrison to transform the traditional operating models of both railroads to Precision Scheduled Railroading models. Mr. Harris ultimately served as executive vice president of operations until his retirement from CN.\nJim Foote, president and chief executive officer of CSX, said, “I am thrilled to have Ed join the CSX team and believe his railroading experience, including nearly a decade working closely with me at CN, will be invaluable in achieving our ultimate goal of establishing CSX as the best railroad in North America. Ed joins an already strong and diversified leadership team at CSX that is focused on creating value for our customers and shareholders through operational excellence and the continued implementation of the new operating plan.”\nEd Harris, executive vice president of operations of CSX, said, “The pace of transformation that CSX has accomplished in such a short period of time has been remarkable and I am excited to get to work. Similar to Jim, I have spent many years implementing the scheduled railroading operating plan and I am confident that I can make an immediate contribution to CSX’s commitment to delivering value to all stakeholders.”\nAs executive vice president of operations, Mr. Harris will have responsibility for mechanical, engineering, transportation and network operations.\nPrior to joining CSX, Mr. Harris served as a senior advisor to Global Infrastructure Partners, an independent fund that invests in infrastructure assets worldwide; chairman of Omnitrax Rail Network; and board director for Universal Rail Services. Mr. Harris also consulted recently with Rio Tinto in Australia and Cosan Industries in Brazil. Mr. Harris began his career with Illinois Central Railroad serving as a key member of the operating team, which included Hunter Harrison, that first introduced the scheduled railroading model to the industry. Following CN’s acquisition of Illinois Central, Mr. Harris held leadership positions alongside Jim Foote. After retiring from CN, Mr. Harris joined Canadian Pacific (CP) where he served as chief operations officer and subsequently joined the CP Board.\nMr. Harris brings a demonstrated track record of improving productivity, service, and safety at North American railways. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business management from the University of Illinois and served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1969 to 1973.\nAbout CSX\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.
