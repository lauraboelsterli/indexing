    "text": "It's now 2018, and a raft of changes to the tax code are in effect – including updates to income tax brackets.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , signed into law by President Donald Trump in December, maintains the same seven-bracket structure that was in force previously. However, Congress has tweaked the rates and the income levels at which they apply.\nPrior to the new law, the seven tax brackets were 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.\nNow, the tax code pegs the new rates at 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 37 percent.\nSee below for a breakdown of the income tax brackets for singles. Rate Taxable Income Bracket 10% 0 to $9,525 12% $9,525 to $38,700 22% $38,700 to $82,500 24% $82,500 to $157,500 32% $157,500 to $200,000 35% $200,000 to $500,000 37% $500,000 and up Here are the rates for married couples who file jointly. Rate Taxable Income Bracket 10% 0 to $19,050 12% $19,050 to $77,400 22% $77,400 to $165,000 24% $165,000 to $315,000 32% $315,000 to $400,000 35% $400,000 to $600,000 37% $600,000 and up Finally, these are the rates for heads of household. Rate Taxable Income Bracket 10% 0 to $13,600 12% $13,600 to $51,800 22% $51,800 to $82,500 24% $82,500 to $157,500 32% $157,500 to $200,000 35% $200,000 to $500,000 37% $500,000 and up For comparison, here's how 2018 brackets would have looked under the old tax code. Rate Single Married Filing Jointly Head of Household 10% 0 to $9,525 0 to $19,050 0 to $13,600 15% $9,525 to $38,700 $19,050 to $77,400 $13,600 to $51,850 25% $38,700 to $93,700 $77,400 to $156,150 $51,850 to $133,850 28% $93,700 to $195,450 $156,150 to $237,950 $133,850 to $216,700 33% $195,450 to $424,950 $237,950 to $424,950 $216,700 to $424,950 35% $424,950 to $426,700 $424,950 to $480,050 $424,950 to $453,350 39.60% $426,700 and up $480,050 and up $453,350 and up Financial advisors have been concerned about the rates and brackets because they are instrumental in shaping financial planning strategies. That includes managing retirees' income in order to get the preferential rate of zero on long-term capital gains and dividends.\n\"The rates are one thing, but the brackets — we want to know at what income levels do these brackets apply,\" said Keith Fenstad, partner and director of financial planning at Tanglewood Total Wealth Management in Houston.\nMore from Personal Finance: \nTax changes are coming Monday: Here's what it means for you. \nProperty tax prepayment deadline looms as homeowners scramble \nThis year-end donation strategy could reap big savings for retirees \nA tax break for disasters largely disappears under the new law",
