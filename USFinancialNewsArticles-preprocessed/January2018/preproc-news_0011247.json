When the Company uses words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, it is making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. The Company’s expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Specifically, the Company’s statements regarding the completion of the proposed follow-on public offering of Series D Preferred Stock on the terms described, or at all, and the Company's proposed use of net proceeds are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, among others, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements in this press release. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the Company's filings with the SEC, which are available for review at www.sec.gov . The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward‐looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof.\nCONTACT:\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.\nWilkes Graham\nChief Financial Officer\n(757) 627-9088\nwilkes@whlr.us\nLaura Nguyen\nDirector of Investor Relations\n(757) 627-9088\nlaura@whlr.us\nSource:Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.",
