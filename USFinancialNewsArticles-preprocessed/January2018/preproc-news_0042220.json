    "text": "CLEVELAND, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- On January 15, 2018, Itocho announced the acquisition of Alta Forest Products, a large North American wood fencing manufacturer. The transaction will allow Itocho, a major player in the US fencing industry through its MASTER-HALCO unit, to further increase its presence in this market.\nFreedonia Group analyst Nick Cunningham discusses the implications: \"Prior to this acquisition, Itocho was already the leading supplier of fencing to the US through its substantial sales of a variety of metal fencing products. By adding Alta Forest Products' wood fencing operations to its portfolio, Itocho will further increase its market-leading position.\"\nThe acquisition will significantly expand Itocho's fencing operations, as the company will add Alta Forest Products' four manufacturing plants to its five existing production facilities. This should provide a considerable boost to Itocho's already substantial economies of scale.\nFencing, a study written by Cunningham, projects 5.0% annual growth in US fencing demand through 2020.\nMore information regarding the study can be found here:\nhttps://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/fencing-3453.htm\nAbout The Freedonia Group â€“ The Freedonia Group, a division of MarketResearch.com , is a leading international industrial research company publishing more than 100 studies annually.
