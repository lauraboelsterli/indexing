    "text": "LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia on Sunday relaxed rules imposed to curb the spread of cholera as the number of new cases being reported has halved, Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya said.\nSchools and some markets will be allowed to re-open, Chilufya told a news conference in Lusaka.\nPolice arrested 55 people in the capital on Friday after residents rioted over a curfew and ban on street vending.\nThe outbreak has killed 74 people since Oct. 4, including 68 in Lusaka, Chilufya said.\nThe number of new cases has fallen to around 80 from 164 a week ago. Of the more than 3,200 cases reported in total, more than 3,000 have been in Lusaka.\nAll government and private schools will re-open on Jan. 22, but Zambiaâ€™s two largest public universities will remain closed for now.\nPresident Edgar Lungu last month directed the military to clean markets and unblock drains to help to fight the spread of the waterborne disease.\nCholera causes acute watery diarrhea. It can be treated with oral hydration solutions and antibiotics but spreads rapidly and can kill within hours if not treated.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
