    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that messages exchanged between employees at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who were working on a special counsel investigation into whether Russia had meddled in the 2016 election amounted to treason.\nThe messages that Trump cited were critical of him. Both officials no longer work for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is also looking into whether Trumpâ€™s campaign colluded with Russia.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Eric Beech\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
