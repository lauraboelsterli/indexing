    "text": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas producer Cheniere Energy Inc said on Tuesday Singapore-based commodity trader Trafigura Pte Ltd would buy about 1 million tonnes of natural gas per year from its unit for 15 years, starting 2019.\nThe agreement with Cheniere Marketing, LLC would help the Houston-based company to fund its expansion plans, Chief Executive Jack Fusco said.\nThe company has been expanding its presence in Asia to benefit from the rising demand for liquefied natural gas from the region.\nAccording to the sale-purchase agreement, the purchase price for LNG is indexed to the monthly Henry Hub benchmark price, including a fee.
