    "text": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, West Bancorporation, Inc. (Nasdaq:WTBA), parent company of West Bank, today reported 2017 net income of $23.1 million, or $1.41 per diluted common share, compared to $23.0 million, or $1.42 per diluted common share for 2016. Net income for 2017 was a record for the Company, even after recording an additional provision for income taxes of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The additional tax provision related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets as a result of the tax reform bill signed into law on December 22, 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share. This compares to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $6.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share. On January 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share. The dividend is payable on February 21, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 7, 2018.\n“I am extremely pleased that West Bancorporation, Inc. has again delivered record results,” commented Dave Nelson, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “We believe our earnings performance is evidence of our community-focused, relationship-driven business model’s success. The primary driver of our increased earnings continues to be our overall loan growth. Management remains committed to achieving a high level of earnings and creating value for our stockholders in an evolving economic and regulatory environment. We are confident in the strength of our balance sheet and capital position.”\nBrad Winterbottom, West Bank President, said, “We continue to grow our community banking relationships in all of our markets. In 2017, deposit balances increased 17.1 percent and outstanding loan balances grew 7.9 percent. I am particularly pleased with the 30 percent growth in trust revenues. We believe our performance reflects the skill of our team and the quality of the loan portfolio, and that West Bank’s risk management practices and capital strength continue to position us well for long-term growth. We approach 2018 with continued confidence in our ability to cultivate quality relationships and deliver excellent service.”\nEastern Iowa Market President, Jim Conard, commented, “The Eastern Iowa market achieved record loan production in 2017. We attribute our success in recent years to our ability to bring real value to the people and businesses we serve, and 2017 was no exception. In 2018, we will focus on delivering new and innovative value propositions to the market. We feel this strategy is unique, and we invite any business owner or manager to reach out to us to learn more about how a business relationship with West Bank can impact their company.”\n“We are very pleased with our strong year in Rochester and plan on carrying that momentum into 2018,” said Mike Zinser, Rochester Market President. “Year-end loans outstanding in Rochester increased over 30 percent in 2017, and our deposits increased over 15 percent for the same period. While nearly all of our loan growth was from business banking, much of our deposit growth was from an inflow of personal deposits. New customers are enjoying our high service, concierge-type personal banking program which is similar to our business banking model.” Zinser concluded, “We are providing our customers with a comprehensive and unique banking experience that continues to drive our strong growth of loyal customers and market share in Rochester.”\nThe Company will file its annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about March 1, 2018.

The Form 10-K will also be available on the Investor Relations section of West Bank’s website at www.westbankstrong.com .\nThe Company will discuss its financial results on a conference call scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Central Time tomorrow, Friday, January 26, 2018.

Return on average equity - annualized net income divided by average stockholders’ equity. Net interest margin (1) - annualized tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Efficiency ratio (1) - noninterest expense (excluding other real estate owned expense) divided by noninterest income (excluding net securities gains and gains/losses on disposition of premises and equipment) plus tax-equivalent net interest income. Texas ratio - total nonperforming assets divided by tangible common equity plus the allowance for loan losses. Allowance for loan losses ratio - allowance for loan losses divided by total loans. Tangible common equity ratio - common equity less intangible assets (none held) divided by tangible assets.\n(1) Non-GAAP measures - see reconciliation below.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis report contains references to financial measures that are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratio on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis to GAAP.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of net interest income and annualized net interest margin on an FTE basis to GAAP: Net interest income (GAAP) $ 15,544 $ 14,425 $ 60,057 $ 57,118 Tax-equivalent adjustment (1) 785 629 2,677 2,623 Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) $ 16,329 $ 15,054 $ 62,734 $ 59,741 Average interest-earning assets $ 1,990,776 $ 1,747,080 $ 1,863,791 $ 1,711,612 Net interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) 3.25 % 3.43 % 3.37 % 3.49 % Reconciliation of efficiency ratio on an FTE basis to GAAP: Net interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) $ 16,329 $ 15,054 $ 62,734 $ 59,741 Noninterest income 1,908 1,930 8,648 7,982 Less: realized investment securities (gains) losses, net 97 (6 ) (326 ) (66 ) Plus: losses on disposal of premises and equipment, net — 4 25 4 Adjusted income $ 18,334 $ 16,982 $ 71,081 $ 67,661 Noninterest expense $ 8,032 $ 7,537 $ 32,267 $ 31,148 Efficiency ratio on an adjusted and FTE basis (non-GAAP) (2) 43.81 % 44.38 % 45.39 % 46.03 % (1) Computed on a tax-equivalent basis using an incremental federal income tax rate of 35 percent, adjusted to reflect the effect of the nondeductible interest expense associated with owning tax-exempt securities and loans.\n(2) Efficiency ratio expresses noninterest expense as a percent of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, excluding specific noninterest income and expenses. Management believes the presentation of this non-GAAP measure provides supplemental useful information for proper understanding of the financial results, as it enhances the comparability of income and expenses arising from taxable and nontaxable sources.\nFor more information contact:\nDoug Gulling, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (515) 222-2309\nSource:West Bancorporation",
