    "text": " 40 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Tennis - Chung pulls out of Sofia Open due to injury Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSOFIA (Reuters) - Chung Hyeon will miss next weekâ€™s Sofia Open after failing to recover from the foot injury that forced him to retire from his Australian Open semi-final against Roger Federer, organisers said on Tuesday. \nThe 21-year-old South Korean, who beat six-times champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round at Melbourne Park, has climbed from 58th to 29th in the world, the highest ranking achieved by a Korean player. \nBulgarian world number four Grigor Dimitrov faces a race against time to get fit to defend his title in Sofia after shoulder pain and exhaustion prevented him from practising.
