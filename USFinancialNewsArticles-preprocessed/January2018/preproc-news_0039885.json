    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it would not be right for Turkey and the United States to discuss a potential “safe zone” in Syria until trust issues between the NATO allies are resolved, the Hurriyet newspaper said on Thursday.\nOn Wednesday, local media had Quote: d Cavusoglu as saying that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had proposed a 30 km safe zone along Turkey’s border with Syria.\n“There was a loss of trust with the United States during this period. Until trust is instilled again, it is not right for these issues to be discussed,” Hurriyet Quote: d Cavusoglu as saying.\nCavusoglu’s comments appeared to be in line with those of a senior U.S. official this week, who had said that Turks had not been ready to engage in detail on such a proposal.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
