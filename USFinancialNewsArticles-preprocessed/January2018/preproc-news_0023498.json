Mr. Coffey is a two-time CEO with 15+ years of executive experience in technology enabled companies, and will lead DTT's day to day operations. Sam Naficy, DTT's previous CEO and founder remains dedicated to DTT and will assume the position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\"I'm thrilled to transition into a new role at such an exciting time for the company,\" said Mr. Naficy. \"Being Chairman of the Board will allow me to focus on strategy and M&A opportunities. While I will miss working in a direct capacity at DTT, I couldn't be more confident that Mike will successfully lead our growth and deliver significant benefits for our customers and our team.\"\nMr. Coffey comes to DTT after successfully having held executive leadership positions across Internet of Things, SaaS, and Managed Services businesses.

I'm looking forward to spending the first few months learning more about the company, getting to know the DTT team and our tremendous customers, and ensuring we work together to continue providing truly innovative loss prevention solutions to the hospitality and retail industries.\"\nDTT also recently announced the closing of an $80 Million Facility with Capital One as well as the acquisition of LP Innovations Inc. (LPI), a company headquartered in Milford, Massachusetts that provides loss prevention solutions to the retail industry. \"The acquisition of LPI will provide truly unparalleled solutions for both existing DTT and LPI customers as we look to expand our service offerings for both companies,\" said Mr. Naficy.\nAbout DTT\nFounded in 1999 by Sam Naficy, DTT provides video surveillance solutions to the hospitality and retail industries.
