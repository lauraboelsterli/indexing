    "text": "PARIS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - French fishermen on Thursday blocked entry to the northern port of Calais, France’s busiest passenger port and a major entry point to Europe for British goods, halting all ship movements, P&O Ferries’ freight division said.\n“The Port of Calais is closed due to French fisherman blockade. Currently no ship movements in the port,” P&O Ferries Freight said on Twitter.\nThe fishermen are protesting against losses they say are inflicted by some countries’ use of electrified fishing nets, said local fisherman Stephane Pinto.
