    "text": "(Corrects to Varta from Vatra in first paragraph)\nJan 16 (Reuters) - Battery maker Energizer Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it would buy the battery and portable lighting business of Spectrum Brands in a $2 billion cash deal, adding brands such as Rayovac and Varta to its lineup.\nThe deal comes two weeks after Spectrum said it was exploring strategic options, including a sale, for its global batteries and appliances businesses.\nShares of Energizer, known for the Energizer and Eveready batteries, were up 5.8 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday, while Spectrum’s shares were up 1.2 percent.\nSpectrum said it was still “actively marketing” its appliances business, which includes brands such as George Foreman cookware and Remington grooming products.\nThe company’s battery and portable lighting business generated revenue of $866 million in 2017, accounting for 17 percent of the total revenue. The unit posted earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $169 million.\nSpectrum said the sale will allow it to focus on its remaining businesses - hardware, auto care and pet and gardening products.\nFor Energizer, the deal adds heft to its batteries unit, while also expanding its international business.\nSpectrum said it expects to use proceeds to pay down debt, reinvest in its core businesses both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions, and repurchase shares.\nEnergizer said it intends to fund the deal through existing cash and committed debt facilities, expected to consist of a new term loan and senior notes.\nBarclays was the financial adviser to Energizer, while RBC Capital Markets advised Spectrum Brands. The deal is expected to close before the end of this year, the companies said. (Reporting by Munsif Vengattil and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n ",
