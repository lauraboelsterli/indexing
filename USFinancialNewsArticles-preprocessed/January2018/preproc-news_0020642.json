    "text": "PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - French carmaker and Peugeot-brand owner Groupe PSA reported a 15.4 percent rise in its worldwide sales for 2017, echoing a similarly robust performance from its domestic rival Renault earlier this week.\nGroupe PSA sold 3,632,300 vehicles worldwide in 2017, helped by solid sales for its Peugeot and Citroen light commercial vehicles (LCV) and by growth in overseas markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.\n“2017 was an exceptional year, with record high results for Peugeot,” said Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Jean-Philippe Imparato in a statement.\nPSA said it increased its market share in all of its main European countries, apart from the United Kingdom, where the company is grappling with difficulties at the Opel-Vauxhall business which PSA acquired last year.\nOn Jan 15, Renault also posted higher 2017 global sales figures and added it expected more growth in 2018.
