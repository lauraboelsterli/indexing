(Photo: dogecoin.com) CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A cryptocurrency that was created as a parody and named after an Internet meme now has a market value of more than $1 billion. Data from CoinMarketCap showed dogecoin's current market value is about $1.17 billion — as of Jan. 4, 11:56 p.m. EST — and traded at $0.010360 per token. Last month, the virtual coin rose more than 400% and briefly topped $0.0107 in late December. Dogecoin is an example of an altcoin, which are peer-to-peer digital tokens that descended from bitcoin . The more popular ones include ethereum, which topped $1,000 for the first time on Thursday, and ripple, which saw a staggering 35,000% jump in its value last year . Dogecoin, for its part, was created in 2013 and its mascot is a Japanese shiba inu dog popularized by an Internet meme that dates back to 2010 . The creators of dogecoin positioned the virtual token as \"the Internet currency\" that can allow users to easily send money online. There are several ways to get dogecoins: Users can buy them at online exchanges, get tipped in the cryptocurrency and even mine them.",
