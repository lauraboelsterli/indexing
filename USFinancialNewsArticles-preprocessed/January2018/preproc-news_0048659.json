    "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y., Vuzix® Corporation ( VUZI ), a supplier of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) products in the consumer and enterprise markets, today announced the entry into agreements with institutional investors relating to the sale of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at an offering price of $10.00 per share together with 1 year warrants to purchase an aggregate 1,200,000 shares of its common stock at $10.00 per share, and will be immediately exercisable for a period of one year. The offering price was based above the closing consolidated bid price as of January 23, 2018. The gross proceeds from the offering will be $30,000,000 before deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including expanding its product offering and the commercial launch of its Blade Smart Glasses, featuring its proprietary waveguide technology products and for general working capital purposes.\n\"This financing significantly improves Vuzix' balance sheet and helps ensure that the Company has sufficient operating capital to execute on its aggressive business plans while also putting Vuzix in a stronger position to effectively negotiate and conclude discussions with potential licensing and strategic partners,\" explained Paul Travers, President and CEO of Vuzix Corporation. He continued, \"With all the increased business activities from the recent launch of the Vuzix Blade and the growing deployments around our workhorse M300, the response from both consumer and enterprise segments has been overwhelming. As a result, we felt that it would be prudent to strengthen our balance sheet.\"\nChardan acted as the lead placement agent for this transaction and Maxim Group LLC acted as a co-placement agent and Craig-Hallum Capital Group as a financial advisor.\nThe shares of common stock and warrants sold in the Offering will be issued separately.
