    "text": "January 27, 2018 / 4:35 AM / Updated 8 hours ago President Moon backs Chung to bring more joy to South Koreans Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - South Korean president Moon Jae-in has backed Chung Hyeon to bring more joy to his country after the youngster’s inspired charge at the Australian Open came to a heart-breaking end in the semi-finals on Friday. \nThe bespectacled 21-year-old, conqueror of six-times Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic, suffered from blisters on his foot before retiring from the match while trailing 6-1 5-2 against 19-times grand slam champion Roger Federer. \n“Chung Hyeon wrote a new chapter in South Korean sports history and brought pride and happiness to all South Koreans. We are so proud of him,” Moon said in a statement on Saturday.
