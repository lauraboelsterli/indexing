    "text": "CARLINVILLE, Ill. and JACKSONVILLE, Ill., Jan. 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CNB Bank Shares, Inc. (“CNB Shares”) and Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. (“Jacksonville Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:JXSB) jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby Jacksonville Bancorp will merge with and into CNB Shares. Following the merger, Jacksonville Savings Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Jacksonville Bancorp, will merge with and into CNB Bank & Trust (“CNB B&T”), the wholly-owned subsidiary of CNB Shares.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of Jacksonville Bancorp will receive $33.70 in cash for each share of Jacksonville Bancorp common stock. The transaction has an aggregate deal value of approximately $61.6 million.\nThe transaction combines two strong local community banks that share a common culture and core values. CNB B&T is headquartered in Carlinville, Illinois, with approximately $924 million in total assets at September 30, 2017 and operates thirteen full-service branches located throughout Illinois and in the St. Louis, Missouri MSA. Jacksonville Savings Bank is headquartered in Jacksonville, Illinois, operating four full-service branches and two limited service branches located throughout central Illinois, with approximately $337 million in total assets at September 30, 2017. With approximately $1.25 billion in pro forma assets, the combined bank will continue to operate all branches after closing.\nJacksonville Bancorp board chairman, Andy Applebee, said, “Our two banks are very complementary. We are confident CNB will continue our community bank traditions while capitalizing on the benefits that come with being a larger bank.” Said Rich Foss, President and CEO of Jacksonville Savings Bank, \"We are pleased to be partnering with another local community bank that shares our deep commitment to customer service and community involvement.\"\nFollowing the merger, Mr. Foss will serve as a director on the board of CNB Bank & Trust and Mr. Applebee will remain in an advisory capacity.\nThe acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to Jacksonville Bancorp shareholder approval, regulatory approval, and other conditions as set forth in the merger agreement. Upon completion of the holding company merger, we anticipate the two banks will be merged in the fourth quarter of 2018 or first quarter of 2019. The directors of CNB Shares and Jacksonville Bancorp have unanimously approved the merger agreement.\nCNB Shares also announced today that, subject to customary closing conditions, Castle Creek Capital Partners VI, L.P. (“Castle Creek”) will be making an investment of $30.0 million into CNB Shares with the proceeds being used both to fund the merger and support future organic growth. Upon closing of the transaction, Castle Creek will have one representative appointed to CNB Shares’ board of directors.\nCNB B&T President Shawn Davis said, “This merger will not only be a good fit geographically for CNB, but also culturally as Jacksonville Savings Bank has diligently committed resources to staff training in the areas of quality service and product development.” CNB Shares President Jim Ashworth added, “CNB Shares will benefit with an expansion of a familiar customer demographic, an investor group that is optimistic about our future, and additional experienced directors.”\nJacksonville Bancorp was advised by the investment banking firm of D.A. Davidson & Co., and the law firm of Luse Gorman, PC. CNB Shares was advised by the investment banking firm of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. and the law firm of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum & Nagelberg LLP.
