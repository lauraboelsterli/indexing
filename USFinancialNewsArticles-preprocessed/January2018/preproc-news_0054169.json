    "text": "STOCKHOLM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Swedish auto safety gear maker Autoliv on Tuesday forecast higher than expected organic sales growth this year and reported fourth quarter core earnings above market expectations.\nStockholm-based Autoliv, the worldâ€™s largest maker of airbags and seatbelts, forecast 2018 like-for-like sales growth of more than 7 percent compared with a 5.6 percent mean forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nThe company said its quarterly adjusted operating profit rose to $263 million from $243 million in the year-ago quarter, beating a mean forecast for $247 million in a Reuters poll.\nAutoliv said last year it was planning to split into two listed companies, with one focused on high-tech safety gear to capture the rapid growth towards self-driving vehicles.
