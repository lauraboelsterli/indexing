    "text": "HONOLULU, Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Hawaiian, Inc. (NASDAQ:FHB) announced today that Michael Ching, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of First Hawaiian, Inc. and First Hawaiian Bank, will be leaving the company. His last day of employment will be January 31, 2018. He will continue to assist the company on a consulting basis, and, effective February 1, Eric Yeaman, President and Chief Operating Officer, will serve as acting CFO as the company conducts a search for a permanent replacement.\nMichael Ching joined the company in June 2015 and played an important role in First Hawaiian Bank’s transition from a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas to a publicly traded company with First Hawaiian, Inc.’s initial public offering “IPO” in August of 2016.\n“Mike has played an integral role at First Hawaiian — we will miss his expertise, great sense of humor and collaborative nature,” said Bob Harrison, chairman and CEO. “We would like to thank Mike for his contributions and wish him well.”\n“It’s been exciting to be a part of First Hawaiian’s journey over the last two and a half years, especially the work and development that went into the execution of the company’s successful IPO. I am looking forward to applying the experience I have gained in this process as I take on my next exciting venture,” said First Hawaiian CFO Michael Ching. “Leaving the Bank will be very difficult, and I wish the best for all of my FHB colleagues who have been like family.”\nFirst Hawaiian, Inc. (NASDAQ:FHB) is a bank holding company headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. Its principal subsidiary, First Hawaiian Bank was founded in 1858 as Bishop & Co., and today is Hawaii’s oldest and largest financial institution with branch locations throughout Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. The company offers a comprehensive suite of banking services to consumer and commercial customers including deposit products, loans, wealth management, insurance, trust, retirement planning, credit card and merchant processing services.
