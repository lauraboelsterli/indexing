    "text": "Doral, FL,, Jan. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTC PINK: ETST) (\"ETST\" or, the “Company\"), an innovative biotech company that operates in the fields of hemp cannabinoid (CBD), nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and medical device R&D, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Avi Levy, Esq. as the company’s legal consultant for Canadian activities.\nWith Mr. Levy’s expertise as a highly-regarded lawyer, the company plans to expand its business in Canada. Levy has been practicing law for over twenty-two years and has been involved in both criminal and civil law since the beginning of his practice. He started his career at one of the biggest law firms in Canada, where he worked in tax and estate law, dealing mostly with regulatory issues, and as a prosecutor. He went on to advise and act as general counsel to some of the biggest internet companies, in addition to top athletes and celebrities in the United States. Most recently, Mr. Levy established himself as an expert in the medical marijuana industry, representing some of Canada’s largest clinics and counseling them on regulatory and legal issues.\nMr. Levy will help the company apply for licenses to import its CBD-rich hemp oil into Canada, where it will be transformed and exported in bulk as raw hemp oil, or in individual ready-to-consume bottles. CBD-rich hemp oil is growing in popularity around the world, and ETST hopes to soon begin exporting from its Canadian facilities to various different countries. The company will also profit from the new Canadian market that is opening for cannabis edible products.\n“We will be well prepared for that new market. We will manufacture and start to distribute our 3 new CBD-based nutraceutical products in USA in 2018 and in 2019, following our application to get a license to work with schedule II controlled substances,” said Mr. Levy, “We will develop new products with a mix of CBD and THC-rich cannabis oil. In Canada there will be a huge amount of production of dried cannabis herb, and we will profit from purchasing and transforming the excess stock these companies create.”\n“We are very excited to welcome Mr. Avi Levy, Esq. to our board of directors,” said CEO & CSO, Michel Aubé, “He brings with him decades of experience in advising companies and individuals in rapid-growth environments, has personal connections to top brands and celebrities, and has worked directly with the cannabis industry.
