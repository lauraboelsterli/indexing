Last week, Kinder Morgan pushed back the startup of the expanded line to December 2020, adding another three months to a previous nine-month delay it has blamed on the permitting difficulty.\nThe project is backed by Canadian oil producers, who are desperate for access to new international markets for their product. It faces opposition from some municipalities, aboriginal groups and environmental activists.\nThe current round of route hearings will run until Jan. 31, with more to come in communities all along the pipeline’s path. The route must be finalized before full construction can begin. ($1 = 1.2466 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Burnaby, B.C.; Editing by Andrew Hay and Matthew Lewis)\n ",
