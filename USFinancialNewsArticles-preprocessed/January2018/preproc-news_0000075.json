McMaster. \n\"There was now a fair amount of back-of-the-classroom giggling about who had called Trump what. For Steve Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, he was an 'idiot.' For Gary Cohn, he was 'dumb as s--t.' For H.R. McMaster he was a 'dope.' The list went on,\" an excerpt reads, according to NBC. show chapters 46 Mins Ago | 02:51 \nThe book, set to be released Jan. 9, follows reports this summer that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the president a \"moron.\" Tillerson has not specifically denied making that comment. \nThe comments in the book extended beyond the president himself. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon, whose comments about Donald Trump Jr. drew the president's ire , also called Ivanka Trump \"dumb as a brick\" in the book, according to NBC and The Wall Street Journal. \nEarlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the book was \"filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.\" WATCH: Trump disavows Steve Bannon: 'He not only lost his job, he lost his mind' show chapters",
