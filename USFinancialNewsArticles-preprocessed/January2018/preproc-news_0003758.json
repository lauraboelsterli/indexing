Roger Mason as President of Newly Formed Space, Intelligence and Cyber Sector (Photo: Business Wire)\nAs sector president, Roger will have full executive responsibility for the sector’s strategy development and execution, program performance, and growth objectives. The Space, Intelligence and Cyber sector delivers advanced, mission-specific technology capabilities across a broad range of national security, civil space, and intelligence community customers.\n“Roger’s service to our nation, his deep understanding of the space, intelligence and cyber domains, and his exceptional business acumen will serve as invaluable assets as we further position and differentiate our company within the space, intelligence and cyber markets,” said Stu Shea, Peraton CEO.\nRoger joins Peraton from Noblis, a leading provider of science, technology, and strategy services, where he most recently served as senior vice president, National Security and Intelligence. While there he had executive responsibility for Noblis’ national security missions including intelligence, defense, homeland security, and law enforcement. He also oversaw Noblis’ two wholly owned subsidiaries, Noblis ESI, LLC and Noblis NSP, LLC, focused on supporting the Intelligence Community.\nPrior to his role at Noblis, Roger served with distinction as the first assistant director of National Intelligence for Systems and Resource Analyses (ADNI/SRA). As the DNI’s principal intelligence officer, he was the trusted advisor for all intelligence capabilities, resources, requirements, systems analysis, program evaluation, and cost analysis matters. He was awarded the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal – the highest award in the Intelligence Community – for his role in establishing a critical new capability, combining operations research, decision sciences, and business analytics. This effort supported the DNI and other senior intelligence agency leaders in their decision making process across myriad complex intelligence issues affecting national security.\nRoger earned his doctorate and master’s degrees in engineering physics (nuclear) from the University of Virginia, a master’s degree in business administration from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School, and a bachelor’s degree in physics from The George Washington University.\nAbout Peraton\nPeraton provides innovative, reliable solutions to the nation’s most sensitive and mission-critical programs and systems.
