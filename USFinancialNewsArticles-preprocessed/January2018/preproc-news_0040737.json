    "text": "SHANGHAI, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WuXi Biologics (2269.HK), a leading global open-access biologics technology platform company offering end-to-end solutions for biologics discovery, development and manufacturing, today announced the appointment of five internationally recognized scientists, entrepreneurs and visionary thinkers to its newly formed Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). The SAB includes: Peter G. Schultz, PhD (President of the Scripps Research Institute and the California Institute for Translational Research); James Larrick, MD and PhD (Founder, Managing Director, Scientific Director of Panorama Research Institute; Managing Director & Chief Medical Officer of Velocity Pharmaceutical Development); Ram Sasisekharan, PhD (Alfred H. Caspary Professor of Biological Engineering and Health Sciences & Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); David D. Ho, MD (Scientific Director and CEO, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center; and Irene Diamond Professor, the Rockefeller University) and Wei-Shou Hu, PhD (Distinguished McKnight University Professor at University of Minnesota).\nChaired by Dr. Schultz, the inaugural members represent a broad range of scientific disciplines in biologics research and development in the fields of synthetic biology, antibody therapeutics, protein engineering, analytical sciences, virology, vaccines, and cell culture bioprocessing and bioengineering. In addition, the SAB members are also thought leaders and entrepreneurs, collectively founding more than forty successful biotech companies.\nThe first SAB meeting was held on January 5, 2018 in San Diego. The SAB members thought highly of WuXi Biologics' achievements, business model, technology platforms, capabilities and capacities. \"I am excited about the capabilities WuXi Biologics is building and the impact this will have on biologics in the healthcare industry,\" said Dr. Peter G. Schultz. The members offered many insightful strategic, tactical, and technical suggestions at the meeting to help guide the future business strategies at WuXi Biologics.\n\"This SAB will help shape the technological and strategic direction of the company and build additional momentum for WuXi Biologics' quest to transform the way in which biologics are discovered, developed and manufactured,\" said Dr. Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics. \"The SAB will support WuXi Biologics' mission of becoming a technology leader and a trusted partner for biopharmaceutical companies worldwide to advance the science and technology of biologics development and ultimately benefiting patients worldwide.\"\nBrief biographies of the SAB members are listed below.\nPeter G.
