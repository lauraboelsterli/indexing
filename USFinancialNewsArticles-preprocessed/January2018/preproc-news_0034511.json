    "text": "January 22, 2018 / 6:23 PM / Updated an hour ago Three USA Gymnastics board members resign in wake of sex abuse scandal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Three USA Gymnastics board members resigned on Monday in the wake of a sex abuse scandal involving its former team physician, the organisation said in a statement. \nThe resignations include the board’s chairman, vice chairman and treasurer who comprise the organisation’s executive leadership team, the statement said. \nThe organisation has been criticized by several of the sport’s top gymnasts during the sentencing of former team doctor Larry Nassar who has pleaded guilty to molesting female gymnasts. \nProsecutors have asked for a sentence of 40 to 125 years for Nassar, 54, who was also a prominent physician at a Michigan State University sports clinic. That would add to a 60-year sentence he is serving in federal prison on child pornography convictions. \nAbout 120 victims were expected to make statements at the sentencing hearing.
