    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe , founder of The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC , announces that a federal class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California against The Crypto Company (“Crypto” or “Company”) (OTC PINK: CRCW) and several officers and directors for acts taken during the period of August 21, 2017 and December 18, 2017 (the “Class Period”).\nBased upon the allegations in the class action, the firm is investigating additional legal claims against the officers and Board of Directors of Crypto. If you are an affected Crypto shareholder and want to learn more about the lawsuit or join the action, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or call toll free at (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nIn the complaint, the defendants are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose during the Class Period that: (i) Crypto unlawfully engaged in a scheme to promote and manipulate its stock; and (ii) as a result, Crypto’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn December 19, 2017, the SEC temporarily suspended Crypto stock from trading due to concerns that the stock was being manipulated after the shares surged more than 17,000% in less than 3 months. The SEC said it was alarmed about “the accuracy and adequacy of information” relating to the compensation paid for promotion of its and statements in SEC filings about the plans of Crypto’s insiders to sell their stock.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180109006288/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC",
