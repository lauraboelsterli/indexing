    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Jan. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CNX Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:CNXM) (“CNXM” or the “Partnership”), today announced that the Board of Directors of its general partner, CNX Midstream GP LLC, has declared a cash distribution of $0.3133 per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution will be made on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 5, 2018. The distribution, which equates to an annual rate of $1.2532 per unit, represents an increase of 3.6% over the prior quarter, and an increase of 15% over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCNX Midstream Partners is a growth-oriented master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires gathering and other midstream energy assets to service natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. More information is available at our website www.cnxmidstream.com .\nThis press release is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of CNX Midstream’s distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributed to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, CNX Midstream's distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. Nominees, and not CNX Midstream, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding on the distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.\nContacts:\nInvestor Relations:\nSteve Milbourne\n724-485-4408\nstevemilbourne@cnx.com\nMedia:\nBrian Aiello\n724-485-3078\nbrianaiello@cnx.com\nSource:CNX Midstream Partners LP",
