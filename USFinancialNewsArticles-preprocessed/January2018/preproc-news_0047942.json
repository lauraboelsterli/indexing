    "text": " 58 PM / a few seconds ago Britain's May says world cannot pull in different directions on trade     in Davos on Thursday that countries must not start pulling in different directions on trade. \nShe added that the World Trade Organization must go further in its reforms. \n“Too often our rhetoric in support of free trade here in Davos is not matched by our actions,” she said. \n“The World Trade Organization still needs to go much further in its reforms, ensuring its rule book keeps pace with developments in the global economy.” Reporting by Noah Barkin; writing by Kate Holton, editing  ",
