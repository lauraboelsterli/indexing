Founded in 1999, the company has two approved antibodies, DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) for the treatment of certain multiple myeloma indications, and Arzerra ® (ofatumumab) for the treatment of certain chronic lymphocytic leukemia indications. Daratumumab is in clinical development for additional multiple myeloma indications, other blood cancers, and solid tumors. A subcutaneous formulation of ofatumumab is in development for relapsing multiple sclerosis. Genmab also has a broad clinical and pre-clinical product pipeline.
