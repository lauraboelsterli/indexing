    "text": "Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum combined for 57 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers past the Dallas Mavericks 117-108 Saturday night at Moda Center.\nLillard scored 31 points and doled out nine assists and McCollum added 26 points as the Trail Blazers (25-21) won their third straight game and sixth in a row at home.\nWesley Matthews led Dallas (15-31) with 23 points while Dirk Nowitzki and Dennis Smith Jr. each chipped in 21.\nLillard made his first nine shots from the field - seven of them 3-pointers. He finished 10-for-15 from the field and 7-for-9 from 3-point range.\nPortland shot .523 from the field, sinking 18 of 36 3-point tries.\nLillard had 18 points at halftime on 6-for-6 shooting, including 4-of-4 on 3-pointers, as Portland mounted a 62-45 halftime lead. McCollum had 13 points and Evan Turner 12 for the Blazers, who shot .571 in the half.\nDallas opened the second half with an 11-2 spurt that closed the gap to 64-56. Matthews buried back-to-back 3s to close the gap to 74-69. Portland responded with a 14-2 run to go ahead 88-71. The Blazers carried a 91-79 lead into the final period.\nSmith’s 3 cut Portland’s advantage to 95-87 with 9:29 remaining. Nowitzki’s layup cut it to 100-93, but Shabazz Napier knocked down a trey to make it 103-93 with 6:10 left.\nDallas got to within 107-100 on a pair of J.J. Barea baskets. Turner’s jumper made it 109-100 with 3:01 to play.\nMatthews scored on a banker to trim the difference to 113-106 with 1:03 to go. Smith scored on a driving layup to close the gap to 113-108 with 47.5 seconds left. Ed Davis’ dunk sealed the verdict for Portland with 17.1 ticks on the clock.\nPortland sank 4 of 6 attempts from 3-point range in the first four minutes to spring ahead 16-9. The Blazers, with Lillard providing 13 points, extended the difference to 33-20 after one quarter.\nThe Blazers stoked their edge to 57-39 advantage late in the second quarter. The margin was 17 points at intermission.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
