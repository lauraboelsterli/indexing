    "text": "January 19, 2018 / 1:56 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Tennis-Angry Wozniacki battles past Bertens after tantrum Ian Ransom 2 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Second seed Caroline Wozniacki overcame a late temper tantrum to forge into the fourth round of the Australian Open with a 6-4 6-3 win over Kiki Bertens on Friday. \nServing for the match at 5-3 under the lights of Rod Laver Arena, the former world number one harangued the chair umpire when a line call went against her and pounded her racquet into the blue hardcourt when Bertens saved a second match point. \nBertens, seeded 30th, cancelled out a third match point with a ripping return down the line but Wozniacki sealed the fourth with a huge serve that the Dutchwoman could only fire long. \nIn her previous match, Wozniacki had to save two match points on an epic comeback from 5-1 down in the third set against Croatian Jana Fett, so she was thrilled to avoid another drawn-out battle against Bertens. \n“Right now I‘m playing with house money,” the Dane, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2011, said in her post-match interview on court. \n“Right now I’ve got nothing to lose ... I got a second chance and I‘m going to try to take it and see how far I can go.” \nWozniacki will meet Slovakian 19th seed Magdalena Rybarikova for a place in the quarter-finals.
