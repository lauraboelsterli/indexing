    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 6:34 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago Aryzta's problems deepen as Europe, U.S. weakness leads to profit warning Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 25 (Reuters) - Swiss-Irish baked goods maker Aryzta AG said on Thursday 2018 core profit was expected to fall 15 percent on a like-for-like basis as recent weakness in the European and U.S. markets was not likely to improve this year. \nThe profit warning comes two weeks after it announced the appointment of a new chief in North America, where issues with undocumented workers and a failed strategy led to Aryztaâ€™s record $1 billion loss in 2017. \nThe company had previously forecast 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to be broadly in line with 2017. \nIn Europe, Brexit-related pressures hurt its UK business, while double-digit inflation in distribution costs and higher-than-expected labour costs dent U.S. profits.
