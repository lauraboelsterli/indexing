It should generate more than a billion dollars flowing into the bottom line,” said Ron Weiner president and founder of RDM financial in Westport Connecticut.\nWells Fargo fell 0.8 percent after it set aside $3.25 billion in the fourth quarter to cover legal expenses related to probes into its mortgage and sales practices.\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase on an average by 12.1 percent in the quarter with profit for financial services companies likely to increase 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAt 11:08 a.m. ET (1608 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 194.76 points, or 0.76 percent, at 25,769.49 and the S&P 500 was up 13.89 points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,781.45.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 39.36 points, or 0.55 percent, at 7,251.14.\nThe S&P consumer discretionary index jumped 0.81 percent after an increase in retail sales showed households bought more goods and figures for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting the economy exited 2017 with strong momentum.\nAmazon rose 1.8 percent and provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq. Home Depot rose 1.6 percent and Walmart rose 1 percent.\n“A lot of these companies like Target and Home Depot are getting on with the internet ecosystem of e-commerce,” said Josh Jalinski, president of Jalinski Advisory Group.\nSales at online retailers soared 1.2 percent.\nAnother data showed U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest rise in 11 months in December on gains in the cost of rental accommodations and healthcare, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year.\nAmong other stocks, Facebook fell 4 percent after the company started changing the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed.\nAdvanced Micro Devices fell 2.66 percent after the chipmaker said its microprocessors are prone to both variants of the Spectre security flaw, days after saying its risk for one of them was “near zero”.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,557 to 1,220. On the Nasdaq, 1,864 issues rose and 920 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n ",
