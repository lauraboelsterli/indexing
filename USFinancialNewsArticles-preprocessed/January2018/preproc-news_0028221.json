Dowley will take up his role on May 1.\nDowley has sat on many boards involved in takeover situations, including insurer Novae and Wyevale Garden Centres, and has previously been head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch Europe. He was also chairman of investment manager ICG for six years until July 2016. (Reporting by Christopher Spink; Editing by Steve Slater)\n ",
