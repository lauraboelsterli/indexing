I look forward to seeing this therapy meaningfully change patients’ lives.”\nDr. Brosgart was initially introduced to ABIVAX through LifeSci Advisors’ Board Placement Initiative (BPI) , which seeks to help companies in the life sciences industry strengthen and diversify their corporate boards.\nAbout ABIVAX ( www.abivax.com/en ) .\nABIVAX is mobilizing the body’s natural immune machinery to treat patients with viral infections, autoimmune diseases and cancer.
