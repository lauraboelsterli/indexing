    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Fibre broadband provider CityFibre said it had picked the English new town of Milton Keynes to launch its gigabit-capable home fibre network in partnership with Vodafone.\nCityFibre will invest at least 40 million pounds ($55 million) in building its network in Milton Keynes, the first roll-out in a plan to connect around 12 cities and 1 million premises with fast broadband marketed by Vodafone.\nThe two companies announced their partnership in November, putting pressure on Britain’s biggest network provider, BT’s Openreach, which nearly all operators rely on to provide broadband connections in Britain.\n($1 = 0.7241 pounds)\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
