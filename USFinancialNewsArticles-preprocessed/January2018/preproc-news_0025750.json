    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 6:19 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago UK PM tells bankers they are a priority for Brexit: sources   \nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told executives from financial services firms on Thursday that they are a priority in the upcoming Brexit talks with the European Union, sources familiar with a meeting held in Downing Street said. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May walks through the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust's (WWT) grounds ahead of a speech to launch the government's environment plan at the London Wetland Centre in west London, Britain, January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Dan Kitwood/Pool \n“It was an encouraging, positive meeting,” a banker briefed on the talks told Reuters. “It felt like the meeting was about telling the finance industry ‘you are a priority for us’.” \nLast year bankers complained that they were not being listened to by May’s government as Britain prepared for Brexit, which is due to happen in March 2019.
