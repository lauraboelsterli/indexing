    "text": "  8:33 a.m. ET Share \nFilm fell about $200 million short of some analysts’ forecasts in U.S. and Canada, flopped in China Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection Adam Driver as Kylo Ren in Walt Disney Co.’s “The Last Jedi” \nBy Ben Fritz Erich Schwartzel \nSix years after Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.06% spent $4 billion to buy a single franchise, “Star Wars” is looking a little less stellar. \nDespite being one of the past year’s most successful movies, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” has fallen short of Wall Street’s expectations due to a faster-than-expected falloff at the box office, declining toy sales and a poor showing in China. \nWith $1.3 billion in global box office for “The Last Jedi,” the most of any movie released in 2017 and No. 9 of all time, Disney’s problems are ones other entertainment companies would kill to have. Nonetheless, for a property as valued as “Star Wars,” any sign audiences are losing faith is concerning and could prove costly down the road if the trend continues. \nAcross Hollywood, studios have prioritized franchises that spawn sequels, move toys and provide maximum negotiating power over movie theaters. If the Skywalker saga is starting to lose its must-see status, that could spell trouble for the company as it prepares to release new movies from this May well into the 2020s.",
