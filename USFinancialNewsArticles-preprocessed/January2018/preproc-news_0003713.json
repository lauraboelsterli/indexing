( bit.ly/2A7nOIj ) \nThe unit, Sterilmed has not received any reports of adverse events due to the recalled devices, a Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices spokeswoman told Reuters. \nAbout 110 Agilis Steerable Introducer Sheath devices made and distributed between Jan. 1 and May 5 are a part of the Class I recall, according to the FDA. ( bit.ly/2lFe3N6 ) \nSterilmed said it had initiated a recall of the devices in June, and the issue had been fixed. \nA Class I recall is the strictest form of recall issued by the health regulator, in situations where the use of faulty devices may cause serious injury or death.
