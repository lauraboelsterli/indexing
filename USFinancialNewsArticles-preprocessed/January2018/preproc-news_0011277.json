    "text": "January 9, 2018 / 7:35 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Vodka maker Stock Spirits says 2017 trading ahead of its expectations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Vodka maker Stock Spirits Group Plc ( STCK.L ) said trading in 2017 was slightly ahead of its expectations, led by a recovery in its key market Poland. \nThe company, which has been stabilising its Polish business after a period of sales declines, said the business performed well despite high competition. \nStock Spirits, which makes three-quarters of its revenue from Poland and Czech Republic, said both these markets continued to show growth in both volume and value terms. \nThe Eastern Europe-focused vodka maker had net sales revenue of 261 million euros (230.07 million pounds) and earned 28.4 million euros last year.
