FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Serie A - Torino vs Napoli - Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, Turin, Italy - December 16, 2017 Torino coach Sinisa Mihajlovic before the match REUTERS/Massimo Pinca \nThe Serbian-born coach, who as a player was regarded as one of the game’s best-ever freekick specialists, had been in charge at the club for 18 months. \nTorino are 10th in Serie A and did not give any reasons for the unexpected decision. \n“Torino announce the release of Sinisa Mihajlovic from his post of first-team coach,” said a brief statement. “We thank Sinisa and his staff for the effort and passion he has shown in these 18 months.” \nThere was no immediate comment from Mihajlovic himself.
