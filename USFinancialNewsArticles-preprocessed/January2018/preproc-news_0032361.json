    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, Jan 18 (Reuters) - South Africaâ€™s central bank kept its benchmark repo rate unchanged at 6.75 percent on Thursday, saying that risks to the inflation forecast were still assessed to be on the upside.\nThe majority of analysts polled by Reuters last week had predicted the repo rate would stay on hold.\nCentral bank governor Lesetja Kganyago told a news conference that five members of the monetary policy committee had voted to hold rates and one member had voted for a 25 basis point cut.
