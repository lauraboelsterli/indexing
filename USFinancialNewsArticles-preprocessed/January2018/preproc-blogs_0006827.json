    "text": "Action camera maker GoPro is cutting about 200 to 300 jobs in its aerial products division this week, technology news website TechCrunch reported on Thursday.\n\nThe job cuts are part of a bigger restructuring in the company, TechCrunch reported, citing a letter sent to impacted employees . \n\nThe employees were relieved from duties on Thursday, but will continue to be on the company's payroll until Feb. 16, TechCrunch reported, citing sources.\n\nGoPro, whose cameras are worn by surfers, skydivers and other action junkies, has been struggling in recent years as cheaper rivals emerge and smartphones feature increasingly advanced cameras.\n\nGoPro did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.",
