De‘Aaron Fox and Garrett Temple scored 15 each, and George Hill had 14.\nAnthony Davis had 23 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Pelicans, who fell to 0-2 since losing All-Star forward DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending Achilles injury. They had won seven of eight prior to his injury. Jrue Holiday added 21 points, Ian Clark scored a season-high 20, and Darius Miller and Jameer Nelson each had 10 off the bench.\nSacramento out-rebounded New Orleans 49-36 as it took a 2-1 lead in a season series in which the road team has won each game with one more to play.\nThe Pelicans led by one point at halftime, but the Kings scored the first six points of the third quarter.\nHoliday made a jumper for New Orleans’ first points of the quarter, but Randolph scored five points during a 14-6 run that gave Sacramento an 81-70 lead.\nThe Pelicans scored the next six points before the Kings rebuilt the lead to 12. Clark scored five points as New Orleans scored the final seven points to cut the lead to 90-85 after three quarters.\nClark scored five points and the Pelicans got within one point before Sacramento scored eight consecutive points for a 102-93 lead.\nA basket by Clark ended the run and New Orleans got within five before Hill made a 3-pointer and the Kings took a 109-99 lead with 2:44 left.\nHoliday and Davis made back-to-back baskets, but Randolph converted a three-point play and Koufos added another basket to put Sacramento in command.\nHoliday had nine points and four assists and the Pelicans had 10 assists on 11 field goals as they took a 29-25 lead after the first quarter.\nNew Orleans led by as many as nine points and the Kings by six in the second quarter before the Pelicans took a 62-61 halftime lead.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
