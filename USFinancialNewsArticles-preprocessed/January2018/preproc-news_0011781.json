    "text": "Joe Arpaio, Controversial Sheriff President Trump Pardoned, Is Running for U.S. Senate in Arizona Ross D. Franklin/AP January 09, 2018 12:58 PM This story originally appeared on Fortune \nControversial former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio says he plans to run for the U.S. Senate, just four-and-a-half months after receiving a presidential pardon . \nMaking the announcement via Twitter, Arpaio said he’s running “to support the agenda and policies of President Donald Trump in his mission to Make America Great Again.” I am running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Arizona, for one unwavering reason: to support the agenda and policies of President Donald Trump in his mission to Make America Great Again. https://t.co/ANppBdDOtp \n— Sheriff Joe Arpaio (@RealSheriffJoe) January 9, 2018 \nArpaio is seeking to fill the vacancy being created by Sen. Jeff Flake’s announcement that he would not seek re-election , a decision he says he made because of the current political environment and Trump. \nThe former Maricopa County Sheriff was convicted in 2017 for violating a 2011 court order to stop traffic patrols aimed at immigrants. He faced a maximum of six years in prison. Arpaio also once referred to his outdoor “tent city” jail as a “concentration camp.” A Department of Justice expert said at the time that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history . \nRELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \nTrump, though, said Arpaio was a “patriot” and “protected our borders.” He also accused President Obama of treating the 85-year-old Arpaio unfairly. \n“Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election that he would have won,” Trump said after the pardon . “And he was elected many times. So I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe. And I think the people of Arizona who really know him best would agree with me.” \nArizona, while a fiercely Republican state, could be an uphill battle for Arpaio. His last run for public office in 2016 fell short, resulting in him leaving the Maricopa County Sheriff’s office.
