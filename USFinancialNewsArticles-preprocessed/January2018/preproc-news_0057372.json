Mr. Dinges won multiple leadership awards, including the President's Achievement Award in 2001, awarded to one of 32 Business Directors each year.

The company developed the AsepticSure ® system to combine oxidative compounds (O 3 and H 2 0 2 ) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H 2 O 3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare and non-healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, Medizone released its AsepticSure ® system for use in Canada, and several other global markets.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
