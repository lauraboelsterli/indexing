    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun on Wednesday said Israeli comments urging firms not to bid on a Lebanese offshore energy tender were “a threat to Lebanon”.\nEarlier on Wednesday Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman described Lebanon’s offshore oil and gas licensing process as “very provocative” and urged international firms not to bid.\n“Lieberman’s words about Block 9 are a threat to Lebanon and its right to sovereignty over its territorial waters,” Aoun said on his official Twitter account.\nLebanon considers Israel an enemy state and has an unresolved maritime border dispute with it over a triangular area of sea.\n(This version of the story refiles capitalizing title of President Aoun in first paragraph)\nWriting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
