    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRegulatory News:\nIpsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) today announced the appointment of Richard Paulson as Executive Vice-President and Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen North America, responsible for all commercial operations throughout the region. Mr Paulson will assume oversight of all areas supporting the North American business effective from February 5th. The role reports directly to David Meek, CEO of Ipsen, and Mr Paulson will be a member of the Ipsen Executive Leadership Team. He joins Ipsen from Amgen where he most recently served as Vice-President and General Manager of the Oncology Business Unit.\nDavid Meek, Ipsen’s CEO , commented, “We are extremely delighted to welcome Richard to Ipsen, to drive the continued growth of our North American business and further our development as a leading biopharma company focused on innovation and specialty care. Richard brings a wealth of great leadership experience, vision, and a track record of exceptional execution in leading and growing businesses, both in the US and internationally. He will bring great passion and energy to our work with patients.”\nDuring a 10-year career at Amgen, Richard Paulson held a number of positions in the company, including General Manager, Central and Eastern Europe, and subsequently General Manager Germany, before assuming leadership positions in Amgen’s Oncology Business Unit. Prior to joining Amgen, he held international positions in general management, marketing and market access with Pfizer. He also served in a number of sales and marketing roles with increasing seniority for GlaxoWellcome in Canada. He holds an MBA from the University of Toronto.\nRichard Paulson added: “I am honored to join Ipsen at this time of rapid transformation and growth, as the company progresses in its evolution as a leading global biopharma company. Throughout my career, in markets around the world, I have been passionate about building and leading diverse, high-performing teams, and driving innovation for patients. I am extremely excited to join this dynamic company, with its clear mission and commitment to developing patient-focused solutions that put the patients’ needs first.”\nWith the former President North America Cynthia Schwalm leaving Ipsen to pursue other interests, Ipsen would like to thank Cynthia for her many contributions to the growth of Ipsen’s North American business, and wishes her well in her future endeavors.\nAbout Ipsen\nIpsen is a global specialty-driven biopharmaceutical group focused on innovation and specialty care.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates\" and \"expects\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favourable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and financial re",
