    "text": "Waltham, MA, Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PatientKeeper®, Inc. , a leading provider of healthcare applications for physicians, today announced that Christopher Maiona, M.D., has joined the company as Chief Medical Officer. In this role, Maiona is PatientKeeper’s senior clinical leader, providing guidance to PatientKeeper customers and staff on product development, deployment and optimization.\nChris Maiona, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, PatientKeeper, Inc.\nFor nearly 20 years, Maiona has devoted his career to hospital medicine, both as a practicing physician and as an executive at provider organizations. Prior to joining PatientKeeper, Maiona was the national medical director at Team Health and IPC Healthcare where he focused on performance improvement, patient experience and care quality. He has also spearheaded hospital medicine initiatives at several multi-site practice groups in the Boston area and in Maine.\n“When it comes to information technology, physicians are stuck between a rock and a hard place -- they are expected to deliver superior patient care using technology that often complicates an already challenging task. As a result, some physicians regard IT as a hindrance rather than a help,” Maiona said. “PatientKeeper is changing the way physicians view and use technology to deliver better patient care. I look forward to advancing that important mission.”\n“As a physician, Chris knows first-hand how technology can impact the ability to deliver high-quality care, and that if IT isn’t making physicians’ jobs easier, they won’t want to use it,” said Paul Brient, Chief Executive Officer at PatientKeeper. “His experience will be a tremendous asset to PatientKeeper customers seeking to maximize the value of IT to benefit their physicians, patients, and the organization as a whole.”\nMaiona has served as an Instructor in Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School, and is active in the Society of Hospital Medicine, where he is a Senior Fellow in Hospital Medicine (SFHM). Maiona received his medical degree from St. George’s University School of Medicine, and conducted a Fellowship in Hospital Medicine at University of California San Francisco. He is board certified in Internal Medicine.\nAbout PatientKeeper\nPatientKeeper®, Inc. is a leading provider of healthcare applications for physicians. PatientKeeper provides highly intuitive software that streamlines physicians’ workflow to improve productivity and patient care.
