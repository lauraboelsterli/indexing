    "text": "OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Brown & Toland Physicians' Board of Directors announced today that Kelly Robison is the company's new chief executive officer.\nRobison, a healthcare industry veteran with 25 years' experience, including 18 with Brown & Toland, replaces Richard Fish, who informed the Board in 2017 of his desire to step down as CEO. Fish has been with Brown & Toland since 2007 and has served as CEO since 2011.\n\"We are thankful to Richard for his years of outstanding leadership, integrity, and strategic acumen,\" said Neal Birnbaum, M.D., Brown & Toland's chairman of the board. \"We are excited to welcome back Kelly as chief executive officer.
