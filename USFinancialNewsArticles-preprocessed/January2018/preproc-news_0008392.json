Net sales were $334 million with a comparable store sales increase of 1.6%, which was comprised of a 1.7% increase in customer transactions, slightly offset by a 0.1% decrease in average ticket.\nSteve Becker, Chief Executive Officer said, “We delivered a 1.6% comp for our second fiscal quarter and a 2.4% comp for the six months ending in December. Throughout the peak season, we experienced significant improvement in our supply chain operations, benefiting from the management, personnel, systems and process changes that we have made. We continued to effectively manage our working capital, reducing our overall inventory balance by approximately $30 million or 12% versus December quarter end last year and we ended the quarter with no outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit. As is typical, we will begin to use our line again during the March quarter as our inventories build. We are pleased with our inventory composition and are well positioned for a positive spring season with the freshness and quality of inventory, especially relative to the challenges faced last spring in the aftermath of the Phoenix distribution center opening. We remain comfortable with our previously provided outlook for a 2% to 5% comp sales increase and a significant improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018, which includes a material increase in gross margins in the spring season reflecting reduced distribution costs. We are focused on opportunities to improve our sales and profitability, including continued improvement in inventory levels in subsets of our store base.”\nThe Company will report complete financial results for the second quarter on Thursday, February 1, 2018.\nAbout Tuesday Morning\nTuesday Morning Corporation (NASDAQ:TUES) is one of the original off-price retailers specializing in name-brand, high quality products for the home, selling luxury textiles, furnishings, housewares and seasonal decor.
