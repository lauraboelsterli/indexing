The chicken salad was packaged with a chicken wrap label. The chicken salad contains milk, a known allergen, which is not declared on the chicken wraps’ product labels.\nThe ready-to-eat chicken salads were produced on Jan. 12, 2018. The following products are subject to recall:\n15-oz. clamshell containers labeled “southwest-style chicken wrap” but containing southwest-style chicken salad products, with a “best by” date of “Jan. 20, 2018” on the labels.\nThe products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. P-34641” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.\nThe problem was discovered by a retail customer, who then notified the company. Following the company’s internal investigation, they contacted FSIS.\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.\nConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.
