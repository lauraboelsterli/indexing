    "text": "MARION, N.Y., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Seneca Foods Corporation (NASDAQ:SENEA) (NASDAQ:SENEB) today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended December 30, 2017.\nHighlights (vs. year-ago, third quarter results):\nNet sales increased $23.0 million, or 6.2% to $392.7 million. The increase in sales attributed to favorable sales mix and higher selling price variance of $34.5 million partially offset by a sales volume decrease of $11.5 million. Results for the quarter include the Truitt Bros., Inc. acquisition which contributed $28.2 million in net sales. Net earnings decreased to $7.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share. A tax rate change occurred during the quarter which reduced the tax provision by $3,040,000 due to the recently passed Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\n“Due to a significant LIFO charge for the quarter and nine month periods, we are reporting slightly lower earnings than the prior year periods. FIFO net earnings and sales are up compared to the prior year. Overall, operating earnings, excluding LIFO and plant restructuring charges, are ahead of the prior year,” stated Kraig Kayser, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFinancial Results for the Third Quarter of 2018\nThe Company reported net earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 of $7.7 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $8.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in the fiscal third quarter of 2017. Net sales for the third quarter ended December 30, 2017, increased from the third quarter ended December 31, 2016, by 6.2%, to $392.7 million. The increase is attributable to favorable sales mix and higher selling price variance of $34.5 million partially offset by a sales volume decrease of $11.5 million. Results for the quarter include the Truitt Bros., Inc. acquisition which contributed $28.2 million in net sales.\nOperating earnings, excluding LIFO and plant restructuring impact, was $12.6 million and $11.3 million for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. A reconciliation of reported operating income to operating earnings excluding LIFO and plant restructuring charges is provided below.\nHighlights (vs. year-ago, year-to-date results):\nNet sales increased $69.6 million, or 7.1% to $1,049.2 million. The increase in sales attributed to favorable sales volume variance of $32.9 million and favorable sales mix and higher selling price variance of $36.7 million. Year-to-date results include the Truitt Bros., Inc. acquisition which contributed $69.4 million in net sales. Net earnings decreased to $5.8 million or $0.58 per diluted share.\nFinancial Results for the Fiscal 2018 Nine Months Year-to-Date\nDuring nine months ended December 30, 2017, the Company reported that net earnings for the nine months of 2018 was $5.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $14.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2017. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased from the first nine months of fiscal 2017 by 7.1%, to $1,049.2 million. The increase is attributable to increased sales volume of $32.9 million and higher selling prices/more favorable sales mix of $36.7 million.\nOperating earnings, excluding LIFO and plant restructuring impact, was $32.9 million and $29.1 million for the nine months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
