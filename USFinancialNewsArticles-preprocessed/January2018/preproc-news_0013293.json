    "text": "Paris, January 11, 2018 - Sodexo, world leader in Quality of Life services, today announced it has taken a majority stake in French start-up FoodChéri, a Food-Tech pioneer. This move is in line with Sodexo's strategy to continually adapt its offers to meet emerging consumer trends and reinvent the customer experience.\nSodexo's investment enables FoodChéri to consolidate its strategic positioning as a \"virtual restaurant\" with a focus on serving businesses, and to expand nationally in France. FoodChéri will continue to be managed by its co-founders.\nFounded in 2015, FoodChéri now has 70 staff and delivers over 12,000 fresh meals prepared by professional chefs every week, in the Paris metropolitan area. With a healthy, balanced and diversified offer, FoodChéri targets both individuals and companies, over 200 of which now look to the start-up to provide meals for their employees.\nKey differentiating factors for FoodChéri are:\nIn-house cooking, while many competitors subcontract food preparation; in 2018 FoodChéri will invest in a new 2,000 m2 kitchen; An offer focused on fresh, healthy food; half the menu is vegetarian, and all ingredients are sustainable including Label Rouge meat and organic vegetables sourced from local suppliers.\nSodexo believes the consumer experience of the future will be underpinned by flexibility, nomadism, simplicity and hyper-responsiveness. The partnership with FoodChéri will help Sodexo adapt to today's changing work environment, which is increasingly less dependent on where employees are physically located.\nPatrick Asdaghi, FoodChéri co-founder and CEO, said: \"At FoodChéri we strive every day to develop the future of food delivery. Our commitments to cooking in-house and a streamlined supply chain have made us very agile. We don't believe people should have to choose between quality, convenience and price and we created our offer to reflect this. Sodexo will help us expand our reach and we're very proud of their confidence in us\" .\nBelen Moscoso del Prado, Sodexo Chief Digital and Innovation Officer, said: \"At Sodexo, we aim to provide an ever more tailored offering to consumers in keeping with their growing demand for meals that are both healthy and environmentally friendly. We believe investing in FoodChéri is a perfect fit with our mission to reshape and enhance the customer experience\" .\nAbout FoodChéri\nFoodChéri is a virtual restaurant currently striving to simplify, diversify, and improve the daily meals of Parisians and those of all French people in the future. Every day, the firm offers a selection of fresh fine food dishes prepared by professional and passionate chefs and delivered to individuals and businesses, based on just three clicks to order. FoodChéri, as a French FoodTech pioneer and leader, employs 70 people and currently delivers throughout Paris and its suburbs. The firm is committed to transparency, quality and environmental principles - a first in the industry.\nIn January 2018, FoodChéri joined Sodexo.
