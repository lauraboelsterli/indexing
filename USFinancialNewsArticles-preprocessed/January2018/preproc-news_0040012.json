Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net EUROPEAN OPEN: TECH AND UTILITIES HIT STOXX 600 (0832 GMT) European shares are trading slightly in the red in early trading with utilities leading fallers after a profit warning from Suez, itself down 15 percent. Tech stocks were also under pressure after JP Morgan cut its rating for Apple supplier AMS to neutral, pointing to iPhone X order weakness. A strong update from Novartis however lifted healthcare stocks, providing support to the broader market and helping the Swiss index SMI stand out as the only gainer among major European benchmarks. Among single stocks, Maersk was the second biggest gainer on the STOXX after Novartis. Maersk was supported by reports it is seeking a partner for its drilling unit , while a trader also cited an upgrade to buy at SEB Equities. (Danilo Masoni) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0746) European shares are seen opening flat to slightly lower ahead of the release of PMI data later today. Some strong corporate updates however could provide support, helping the regional STOXX 600 benchmark index stay close to its highest levels since August 2015. Futures were last trading between flat and a fall of 0.1 percent, reversing opening gains. The pharma sector, recently penalized by a rotation into cyclicals, could be on the watchlist after Swiss heavyweight Novartis posted better-than-expected core net income in the fourth quarter and forecast 2018 operating profit would grow faster than sales as revenue from drugs accelerates. The retail sector could find support after Dutch-Belgian supermarket Ahold Delhaize reported fourth-quarter sales growth at at the high end of market expectations, while France's Carrefour saw upgrades from SocGen, Bernstein and HSBC.

Some strong corporate updates including from drugmaker Novartis, which we mentioned in our previous post, and Dutch-Belgian supermarket Ahold Delhaize could provide support, while on the macro front PMI data will grab the attention ahead of tomorrow's European Central Bank meeting. And Talking about the ECB here is a graphic piece from Reuters with five questions for Mario Draghi. Here is your futures snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) PHARMA IN FOCUS AFTER NOVARTIS BEAT (0632 GMT) The healthcare sector could be one to watch this morning after Swiss-based heavyweight Novartis posted better than expected results. European healthcare stocks have underperformed the broader market so far this year as expectations of stronger economic growth caused a switch from defensives into cyclicals. The Swiss drugmaker forecast 2018 operating profit would grow faster than sales as revenue from drugs including its latest blockbuster Cosentyx accelerates and the company exits a period when patent losses dented results. Will Novartis figures help the sector catch up today? (Danilo Masoni)",
