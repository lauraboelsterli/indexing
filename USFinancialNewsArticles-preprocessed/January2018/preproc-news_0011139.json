News Sentinel) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE If you ask the executive team at Ruby Tuesday, they won't be shy about telling you the company is in trouble. That's why they are bringing in Ray Blanchette. Blanchette will take the mantle of CEO immediately, the company said Tuesday, with the aim of turning around the struggling brand. The restaurant has shuttered more than 100 restaurants since August. As of Dec. 1, it operates just under 600 locations. \"Clearly, it's a turnaround,\" Blanchette told CNBC at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida. \"We're not being shy about calling it that.\" Blanchette will replace interim CEO Aziz Hashim, managing partner of NRD Capital. Hashim took the reins from former CEO Jim Hyatt in December after Ruby Tuesday was taken private in a $335 million deal. Hyatt had been at the company since April. In Blanchette's more than 25 years in the industry, this isn't the first time his has been called upon to revive a company. Before becoming CEO of Au Bon Pain, which was recently acquired by JAB Holding's Panera, he revitalized Joe's Crab Shack as CEO of Ignite Restaurant Group. \"I feel like I grew up in bar and grill,\" said Blanchette, who worked with TGI Friday's for 18 years. \"This is kind of a homecoming for me. I'm excited to now lead a brand that I've competed with for decades.\"",
