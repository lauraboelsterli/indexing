    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge denied on Wednesday a preliminary injunction filed by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Deputy Director Leandra English seeking to stop White House budget director Mick Mulvaney from taking control of the agency.\nEnglish has challenged Mulvaneyâ€™s right to lead the consumer watchdog agency, citing her endorsement by former CFPB Director Richard Cordray, an appointee of the Obama administration who stepped down in November.\nEnglish sued the Trump administration in November, claiming that Cordray had legal grounds to name his successor until a full-time director was named by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\nReporting by Eric Beech\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
