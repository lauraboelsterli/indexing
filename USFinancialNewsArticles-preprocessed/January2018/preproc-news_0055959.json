    "text": "COLOMBO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee ended weaker on Tuesday as demand for dollars from banks and importers surpassed selling of the greenback, dealers said.\nThe spot rupee ended at 154.00/10 per dollar, compared with Monday’s close of 153.75/85. The rupee gained 0.2 percent last week.\n“There was demand throughout the day from foreign banks and smaller banks for imports. There were remittances, but the demand was heavy,” said a currency dealer.\nDealers expect a 2-3 percent depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year on account of debt repayment by the government.\nSri Lanka mopped up 80 billion rupees ($520.66 million) on Monday via treasury bonds after raising $470.6 million on Jan.18 via development bonds, the central bank said.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans, and a total of $5.36 billion in interest.\nForeign investors bought 3.9 billion rupees worth of government securities this year up to Jan. 24, central bank data showed.\nThe rupee fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nSri Lanka’s stock, bond and foreign exchange markets are closed on Wednesday for a Buddhist religious holiday. Markets will resume trading on Thursday. ($1 = 153.6500 Sri Lankan rupees) (Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Vyas Mohan)\n ",
