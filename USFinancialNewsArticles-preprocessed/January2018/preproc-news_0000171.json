Parts of the central, northern and eastern regions could see up to 30 cm (12 inches) of snow, it said. \nVariFlight said Hefei Xinqiao   Fuyang Xiguan Airport in eastern Anhui province, and Jining Qufu Airport in coastal Shandong province had been shut. Some runways at other airports had been closed, causing delays, it said. \nBeijing Capital   one of China’s busiest, was also experiencing some delays, it said. \nChina’s National Meteorological Center has also urged domestic authorities to take precautions regarding roads, railways, electricity supplies and telecommunications, according to Xinhua. \nThe northwestern part of central Hubei province saw its first snowfall of 2018 on Wednesday. \nSome highways were shut due to snow in central Henan province and northwestern Ningxia Autonomous Region. Snowfall in Xian, the capital of Shaanxi province, also led to the delay of many high-speed trains. \nThe meteorological center expects widespread rain or snow in China’s central and eastern regions over the next week.
