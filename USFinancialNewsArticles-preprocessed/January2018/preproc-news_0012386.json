    "text": " 56 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Versace family disowns 'fiction' of U.S. TV series on designer's death Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - The family of Italian designer Gianni Versace has distanced itself from a long-awaited U.S. television series about his violent death. \nThe nine-part series, made by 21st Century Fox and premiering next week, stars Spanish actress Penelope Cruz and Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin. \nVersace was gunned down in 1997 at the entrance gate of his Miami beach mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. \nThe Versace company “did not authorize and was not involved in the television series,” it said in a statement on Monday. \nThe series had to be considered “an act of fiction”, it said, given it drew inspiration from a book that was not authorized - Maureen Orth’s ‘Vulgar favours’. \nA spokesman for 21st Century Fox had no immediate comment. \nVersace founded his eponymous fashion house, famous for its Medusa head logo, in 1978. In 2014 U.S. private equity firm Blackstone bought a 20 percent stake. Gianni’s sister Donatella is artistic director and vice-president of the group.
