    "text": " 57 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago Storm disrupts traffic at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport   \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A storm disrupted air traffic at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on Wednesday, with many flights canceled or delayed. \nAirlines canceled 176 out of a total of more than 1,200 incoming and outgoing flights on Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the Dutch national airport said. \nThat number was expected to rise, as the storm would grow stronger during the day, with wind gusts reaching speeds of up to 120 kph (75 mph). \nFlights that were not canceled faced an average delay of about an hour, the airport said. \nSchiphol is Europe’s third busiest airport in number of total passengers per year, after London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
