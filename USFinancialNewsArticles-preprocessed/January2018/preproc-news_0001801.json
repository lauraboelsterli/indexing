    "text": "ATLANTA, Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NIIT Limited (\"NIIT\"), a global skills and talent development company and leading provider of managed training services, announced today that it has acquired Eagle International Institute, Inc. doing business as Eagle Productivity Solutions (\"Eagle\") through its wholly owned subsidiary, NIIT (USA) Inc. Headquartered in Rochester USA, Eagle is a top-rated global provider that specializes in training solutions for companies adopting sophisticated cloud-based applications in the Pharmaceutical and Life sciences industry.\nThe blending of these two companies will further help NIIT expand its capabilities in global application rollouts of enterprise applications requiring high adoption and deepen its domain expertise in the pharmaceutical and life sciences domain. In turn, Eagle's clients will gain access to more evolved service models, expanded capabilities including a richer variety in training content, and a stable and established global structure.\nUnder the NIIT umbrella, Eagle will continue to exist as an individual practice and maintain its mission to deliver quality, innovation, and above all, results.

We see this as a major opportunity to support the explosive growth of cloud software - introduced with expertise, maintained with thoughtful attention. No single company will be more capable of this than this new combination. We can service this market extraordinarily well. We have some of the finest methods and a strong track record.\"\n\"The Life Sciences domain and Software Application Adoption expertise have been of keen interest to NIIT. Learning plays a key role as a key enabler of change in both these areas. Eagle's unique mastery learning pedagogy enables their customers to rapidly achieve greater than 90% adoption of new processes and applications. This is a distinguishing reason why Eagle has a loyal and strong list of customers in the Life Sciences space. The coming together of Eagle's expertise and penetration in the Life Sciences space creates great opportunity for NIIT in both the Life Sciences and the Software Application domains.
