On a go forward basis, the Company will be using an estimated tax rate of 21.5% to account for its federal and state income tax expense; Relationship-based transactional deposits (noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, and escrow accounts) increased $24.0 million, or 8.5%, to $306.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $282.7 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $87.7 million, or 40.1%, from $219.0 million at December 31, 2016; On September 12, 2017, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering, 587,234 shares of its common stock at a price of $47.00 per share, and received $25.6 million in net proceeds; and Capital levels at the Bank increased to 16.3% for total risk-based capital and 12.6% for Tier 1 leverage capital at December 31, 2017, compared to 13.9% and 10.3% at December 31, 2016, respectively.\nBalance Sheet and Credit Quality\nTotal assets decreased $12.1 million, or 1.2%, to $981.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $993.9 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $153.9 million, or 18.6%, from $827.9 million at December 31, 2016. The quarter over sequential quarter decrease of $12.1 million in total assets included decreases in total cash and cash equivalents of $12.4 million, and loans held for sale (“HFS”) of $11.6 million, partially offset by increases in loans receivable, net of $7.7 million which is net of the $21.4 million in portfolio loan sales, and increases in securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) of $4.4 million. The year over year increase of $153.9 million in total assets included increases in loans receivable, net of $168.2 million, certificates of deposit at other financial institutions of $2.9 million, accrued interest receivable of $1.0 million, and loans HFS of $910,000, partially offset by a decrease in total cash and cash equivalents of $17.5 million and servicing rights of $1.7 million. These increases in assets year over year were primarily funded by growth in deposits and net proceeds from the underwritten public offering in the third quarter of 2017.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent REAL ESTATE LOANS Commercial $ 63,611 8.2 % $ 63,180 8.3 % $ 55,871 9.2 % Construction and development 143,068 18.5 129,407 16.9 94,462 15.6 Home equity 25,289 3.3 24,026 3.1 20,081 3.3 One-to-four-family (excludes HFS) 163,655 21.2 170,187 22.2 124,009 20.5 Multi-family 44,451 5.7 43,408 5.7 37,527 6.2 Total real estate loans 440,074 56.9 430,208 56.2 331,950 54.8 CONSUMER LOANS Indirect home improvement 130,176 16.8 124,387 16.2 107,759 17.8 Solar 41,049 5.3 40,082 5.2 36,503 6.1 Marine 35,397 4.6 35,173 4.6 28,549 4.7 Other consumer 2,046 0.3 2,032 0.3 1,915 0.3 Total consumer loans 208,668 27.0 201,674 26.3 174,726 28.9 COMMERCIAL BUSINESS LOANS Commercial and industrial 83,306 10.8 83,221 10.9 65,841 10.9 Warehouse lending 41,397 5.3 50,468 6.6 32,898 5.4 Total commercial business loans 124,703 16.1 133,689 17.5 98,739 16.3 Total loans receivable, gross 773,445 100.0 % 765,571 100.0 % 605,415 100.0 % Less: Allowance for loan losses (10,756 ) (10,598 ) (10,211 ) Deferred costs, fees, premiums and discounts, net (1,131 ) (1,119 ) (1,887 ) Total loans receivable, net $ 761,558 $ 753,854 $ 593,317 Loans receivable, net increased $7.7 million to $761.6 million at December 31, 2017, from $753.9 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $168.2 million from $593.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans receivable, net quarter over sequential quarter was primarily a result of increases in real estate and consumer loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial business loans. Total real estate loans increased $9.9 million including increases in construction and development loans of $13.7 million, home equity loans of $1.3 million, and multi-family loans of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in one-to-four-family portfolio loans of $6.5 million which is net of the $19.4 million loan sale. Total commercial business loans decreased $9.0 million primarily from a decrease in residential warehouse lending of $9.1 million associated with seasonal paydowns. Total consumer loans increased $7.0 million primarily from growth of $5.8 million in indirect home improvement loans and $967,000 in solar loans.\nOne-to-four-family loans originated through the home lending segment which includes loans HFS, loans held for investment, fixed seconds, and loans brokered to other institutions decreased $35.5 million, or 14.5%, to $208.6 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $244.1 million for the preceding quarter, and increased from $187.8 million for the same quarter one year ago. Originations of one-to-four-family loans to purchase a home (purchase production) increased by $109.1 million, or 21.2% with $624.3 million in loan purchase production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $515.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. One-to-four-family loan originations for refinance (refinance production) decreased $77.5 million, or 29.3% with $186.9 million in refinance production closing during the year ended December 31, 2017, down from $264.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold $206.2 million of one-to-four-family loans including the $19.4 million in portfolio loans, compared to sales of $204.3 million for the preceding quarter, and sales of $195.5 million for the same quarter one year ago.\nPurchase production was 75.8% of the total one-to-four-family loan originations versus 24.2% for refinance production during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 63.3% in purchase production versus 36.7% in refinance production during the same period in 2016. Purchase production for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 77.0% of the total one-to-four-family loan originations versus 23.0% for refinance production, compared to 66.1% in purchase volume versus 33.9% in refinances for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in purchase production and corresponding decrease in refinance production reflects management’s focus on residential home buyers in the markets we serve.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) at December 31, 2017 increased to $10.8 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans HFS, compared to $10.6 million, or 1.4% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans HFS at September 30, 2017, and $10.2 million, or 1.7% of gross loans receivable, excluding loans HFS, at December 31, 2016. Non-performing loans, consisting of non-accrual loans, decreased to $1.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $1.3 million at September 30, 2017, and increased from $721,000 at December 31, 2016. Substandard loans decreased to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $6.6 million at September 30, 2017, and decreased from $8.0 million at December 31, 2016. The $1.5 million decrease in substandard loans from one year ago was primarily due to the sale of a shared national credit of $1.9 million of which a slight discount to book value was charged off against the ALLL in the third quarter of 2017. There was no other real estate owned (“OREO”) at December 31, 2017, at September 30, 2017, or at December 31, 2016.\nTotal deposits decreased $10.7 million, to $829.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $840.6 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $117.2 million, from $712.6 million at December 31, 2016. Relationship-based transactional deposits increased $24.0 million, to $306.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $282.7 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $87.7 million, from $219.0 million at December 31, 2016. Money market and savings accounts decreased $8.2 million, to $300.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $309.0 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $3.0 million, from $297.8 million at December 31, 2016. Time deposits decreased $26.6 million, to $222.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $248.8 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $26.5 million, from $195.7 million at December 31, 2016. The quarter over sequential quarter decrease in time deposits was primarily from the maturity of $32.9 million in brokered deposits during the fourth quarter.\nNon-retail certificates of deposit which includes brokered certificates of deposit, online certificates of deposit, and public funds decreased $33.2 million to $66.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $99.7 million at September 30, 2017, as a result of the maturity of the brokered deposits discussed above, and increased $6.3 million from $60.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on growth in lower cost relationship-based deposits to fund long term asset growth.\nDEPOSIT BREAKDOWN (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Noninterest-bearing checking $ 177,739 21.4 % $ 162,208 19.3 % $ 145,377 20.4 % Interest-bearing checking 119,872 14.4 109,584 13.0 63,978 9.0 Savings 72,082 8.7 72,974 8.7 54,996 7.7 Money market 228,742 27.6 236,036 28.1 242,849 34.1 Certificates of deposit less than $100,000 111,489 13.4 143,169 17.0 93,791 13.2 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 through $250,000 77,934 9.4 73,733 8.8 74,832 10.5 Certificates of deposit of $250,000 and over 32,833 4.0 31,927 3.8 27,094 3.8 Escrow accounts related to mortgages serviced 9,151 1.1 �� 10,947 1.3 9,676 1.3 Total $ 829,842 100.0 % $ 840,578 100.0 % $ 712,593 100.0 % At December 31, 2017, borrowings decreased $2.7 million, or 26.7%, to $7.5 million, from $10.3 million at September 30, 2017, and decreased $5.1 million, or 40.6%, from $12.7 million at December 31, 2016, the year over year decrease was primarily due to the repayment of FHLB fixed rate advances from growth in retail deposits.\nTotal stockholders’ equity increased $3.8 million, to $122.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $118.2 million at September 30, 2017, and increased $41.0 million, from $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders’ equity from the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to net income of $3.7 million, and the increase from December 31, 2016 was primarily from net proceeds of $25.6 million from the underwritten public offering and 2017 net income of $14.1 million. Book value per common share was $34.47 at December 31, 2017, compared to $33.52 at September 30, 2017, and $28.32 at December 31, 2016.\nThe Bank is well capitalized under the minimum capital requirements established by the FDIC with a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.3%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 12.6%, and a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 15.0% at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.9%, the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.3%, and the CET1 capital ratio was 12.6%.\nThe Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.7%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 12.1%, and a CET1 ratio of 14.5% at December 31, 2017, compared to 12.9%, 9.5%, and 11.6% at December 31, 2016, respectively.\nOperating Results\nNet interest income increased $2.1 million, or 22.8%, to $11.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $9.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $2.2 million, or 22.7% increase in loans receivable interest income. Net interest income increased $7.4 million, or 21.8% to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $7.7 million, or 21.5% increase in loans receivable interest income.\nThe net interest margin (“NIM”) increased six basis points to 4.72% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from 4.66% for the same period in the prior year, and increased 22 basis points to 4.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 4.43% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increased NIM reflects growth in higher yielding loans, and reductions in securities AFS and cash and cash equivalents. The average cost of funds increased six basis points to 0.64% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from 0.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and increased two basis points to 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 0.59% the year ended December 31, 2016. Management remains focused on matching deposit duration with the duration of earning assets where appropriate.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $300,000, compared to $600,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs totaled $143,000 compared to net recoveries of $25,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses was $750,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $205,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to net recoveries of $26,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the provision for loan losses for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the relatively low levels of charge-offs, delinquencies, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the increasing percentage of real estate loans compared to consumer loans and improving real estate values in our market areas reducing the increase in the provision for loan losses required for loan growth.\nNoninterest income decreased $175,000, or 3.2%, to $5.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $5.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease during the period was primarily due to a $191,000 reduction in gain on sale of loans. Noninterest income increased $505,000, or 2.1%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase during the year was primarily due to increases in the gain on sale of investment securities of $234,000, in service charges and fee income of $157,000, and in other noninterest income of $133,000. The $1.1 million gain on sale of servicing rights transacted in the second quarter of 2017 helped offset the decrease in gain on sale of loans of $1.1 million, mainly associated with a reduction of gain on sale margins associated with the product mix in the Pacific Northwest. There was no sale of mortgage servicing rights in 2016.\nNoninterest expense increased $998,000, or 9.9%, to $11.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $10.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily a result of a $949,000 increase in salaries and benefits, which included $464,000 in incentives and commissions for the loan production staff associated with continued strong loan production growth, and $207,000 of increased ESOP expense from our strong stock performance.\nNoninterest expense increased $5.1 million, or 13.0%, to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily a result of a $4.6 million increase in salaries and benefits, which included $1.4 million in incentives and commissions for the loan production staff, $593,000 of increased ESOP expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last year, an increase of $387,000 data processing expense, $268,000 in occupancy expense, $205,000 in expenses related to operations, and $147,000 in loan costs. These increased expenses were partially offset by a $389,000 decrease in acquisition costs, a $246,000 decrease in professional and board fees. There was no gain on the sale of OREO in the current year to offset the increase in expenses as compared to $150,000 last year.\nAbout FS Bancorp\nFS Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the holding company for 1st Security Bank of Washington.
