    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (“Volt” or “the Company”) (NYSE-AMERICAN: VISI), an international provider of staffing services and managed service programs, today reported results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year ended October 29, 2017. Key highlights include:\nFourth quarter net revenue of $288.5 million, down 15.5% year-over-year; on a same-store basis, net revenue declined 11.3% year-over-year excluding net revenue contributed from businesses sold or exited during the past year and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations; full-year net revenue of $1,194.4 million, down 10.5% year-over-year and down 6.6% year-over-year on a same-store basis Fourth quarter gross margin percentage of 16.5%, down 14 basis points year-over-year; full-year gross margin percentage of 15.7% increased 52 basis points year-over-year Completed the sale of the quality assurance business of the Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment, a non-core business, which resulted in net cash proceeds of $66.8 million Received $5 million in net cash as part of early payment of note and a settlement agreement with NewNet Communications Technologies, LLC Reduced debt balance by $50.0 million from the prior quarter, ending the year with a total debt balance of $50.0 million\nCommenting on Volt’s performance, Michael Dean, President and CEO, said, “Volt’s full year results showed continued evidence of improvement in several key financial and operational metrics. I am pleased our focus on higher margin business resulted in expanding our gross margins by 52 basis points year-over-year to 15.7%. In addition, our ongoing focus on achieving operational efficiencies and cost containment has continued to deliver lower selling, administrative and other operating costs.”\nMr. Dean continued, “The turnaround strategy that we have executed over the past two years has successfully helped us address many of Volt’s operational challenges and we have a strong foundation from which we continue to build. During this time, we have dramatically simplified our operating structure through the sale of non-core assets, which has strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position. At the same time, we have also been successful in streamlining our cost structure and gross margins continue to improve. While much has been accomplished, we now must ensure our efforts and investments convert to topline growth, as well as continue to explore a broad range of opportunities to enhance shareholder value. I look forward to overcoming Volt’s remaining challenges and emerging as a stronger company.”\nFiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nTotal revenue for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $288.5 million, down $53.1 million, or 15.5%, compared to $341.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On a same-store basis, net revenue declined 11.3% year-over-year excluding net revenue contributed from businesses sold or exited during the past year and the effect of currency fluctuations.\nNorth American Staffing revenue, which provides a broad spectrum of contingent staffing, direct placement, recruitment process outsourcing and other employment services, was $224.2 million, a $31.0 million, or 12.1% decrease compared to North American Staffing revenue of $255.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The decline was primarily driven by lower demand from customers in both professional and commercial job families, as well as customers experiencing decreased demand for their services and changes in their staffing models.\nInternational Staffing revenue, which includes the Company’s contingent staffing, direct placement and managed service programs businesses in Europe and Asia, was $30.2 million, a $1.5 million, or 4.9% decrease compared to $31.7 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of softening economic demand in the United Kingdom.\nTechnology Outsourcing Services and Solutions revenue, which provides quality assurance, business intelligence and analytics and customer service support for companies in a variety of industries, was $26.4 million, down $4.1 million, or 13.7%, compared to $30.5 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower volume in quality assurance testing services, which was sold at the end of the quarter. While the overall segment was down year-over-year, the remaining call center business experienced sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter as well as year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2017.\nCorporate and Other revenue, which now primarily consists of the Company’s North American managed service business, was $9.7 million, down $17.9 million, or 65.0%, compared to $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by the impact from the sale of Maintech, which occurred early in the second quarter of 2017. On a same-store basis, excluding businesses sold or exited of $17.6 million, Corporate and Other revenue decreased $0.3 million, or 3.6%, year-over-year.\nSelling, administrative and other operating costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased $0.5 million, or 1.0%, to $50.1 million from $50.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily due to ongoing cost reductions throughout the business as well as the sale of Maintech. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and software license expenses related to completion of the first phase of the upgrade of the Company’s back-office financial suite and information technology tools.\nIncome from continuing operations of $39.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $37.0 million from $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned gain on the sale of the Company’s quality assurance testing division of the Technology Outsourcing Services and Solutions segment for $48.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a Non-GAAP measure, was $0.1 million in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, down $7.9 million from $8.0 million (Non-GAAP) in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of special items, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, other income/loss and share-based compensation expense. For a reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP financial results, please see the tables at the end of this press release.\nFiscal 2017 Full Year Results\nTotal revenue for the full year of fiscal 2017 was $1,194.4 million, down $140.3 million, or 10.5%, compared to total revenue of $1,334.7 million for the full year of fiscal 2016. On a same-store basis, net revenue declined 6.6% year-over-year excluding net revenue contributed from businesses sold or exited during the past year and the effect of currency fluctuations.\nNorth American Staffing revenue was $919.3 million, down $75.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to $994.3 million for the full year of fiscal 2016. International Staffing revenue was $119.8 million, down $11.7 million, or 8.9%, from $131.5 million in the p",
