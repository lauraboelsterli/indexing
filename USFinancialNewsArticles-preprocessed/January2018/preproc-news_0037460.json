    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Three of Israel’s leading banks have agreed to sell back shares in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ahead of the bourse’s planned initial public offering.\nThe exchange had offered to buy out its shareholders, comprised of commercial and investment banks, before it lists on its own market next year, valuing the total shares at 500 million shekels ($146 million).\nBank Leumi ( LUMI.TA ), Israel’s second largest lender, said it agreed to sell its entire 9.3 percent stake in the bourse, adding that the transaction would have minimal impact on its finances.\nThe First International Bank of Israel ( FTIN.TA ), the country’s fifth biggest bank, which holds the largest stake of around 20 percent, said it would sell back 15.4 percent.\nSmaller rival Bank of Jerusalem ( JBNK.TA ) said it would sell its entire 5.39 percent stake.\nThe exchange demutualized and became for-profit in September as part of a plan to boost trading volumes and company listings.\nReporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Tova Cohen\n ",
