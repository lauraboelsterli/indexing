    "text": "VICTORIA, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: AUPH / TSX: AUP) (“ Aurinia ” or the “ Company ”) today announced that in order to replace its prior expired base shelf prospectus and corresponding shelf registration statement it has filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus (the “ Preliminary Shelf Prospectus ”) with the securities commissions in each of the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia in Canada, and a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) under the U.S./Canada Multijurisdictional Disclosure System.\nThe Preliminary Shelf Prospectus and corresponding shelf registration statement, when made final or effective, will allow Aurinia to offer up to US$250,000,000 of common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debt securities or any combination thereof during the 25-month period that the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus is effective. The Company has no immediate intention to undertake an offering. However, the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus will enable Aurinia to potentially access new capital if and when needed. The amount and timing of any future offerings will be based on the Company’s financial requirements and market conditions at the time. In addition, the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus and corresponding shelf registration statement allows Aurinia to meet its contractual obligation to maintain a valid registration statement to certain holders of warrants issued under a private placement that took place in June 2016.\nThe specific terms of any future offering under the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus will be established at the time of such offering. At the time any of the securities covered by the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement containing specific information about the terms of such offering will be filed with applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the SEC.\nThe shelf registration statement filed today with the SEC has not yet become effective. No securities may be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualifications under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nA copy of the Preliminary Shelf Prospectus can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and a copy of the corresponding shelf registration statement can be found on EDGAR at www.sec.gov or may be obtained upon request to Aurinia’s Investor Relations Department using the contact information set out below.\nAbout Aurinia\nAurinia is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies to treat targeted patient populations that are suffering from serious diseases with a high unmet medical need. The company is currently developing voclosporin, an investigational drug, for the treatment of lupus nephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease and dry eye syndrome. The company is headquartered in Victoria, BC and focuses its development efforts globally.\nForward-Looking Statement Disclaimer\nCertain of the statements made in this news release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities law and forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable United States securities law.
