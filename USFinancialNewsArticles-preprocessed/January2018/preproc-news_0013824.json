    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 12:28 PM / Updated 38 minutes ago TIMELINE-Troubled Carillion's tale of woe Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \nJan 11 (Reuters) - British construction company Carillion has been hurt by costly contract delays, a downturn in new business, the departure of its CEO and a string of profit warnings. \nCarillion’s shares have lost 88 percent of their value since its first profit warning in July. Its troubles have been compounded by heavy debt, pension obligations and delays in collecting cash from clients. \nShareholders are waiting for the outcome of the company’s meeting with its creditors on Jan. 10. \nBelow is a timeline of news related to Carillion: \nJan. 9, 2018 \nCarillion said it was not aware of any development to support a recent share price rise, a day after reports of a government bailout. \nJan. 6, 2018 \nCarillion said it would meet creditors on Jan. 10 as it seeks a financial rescue plan. \nJan. 3, 2018 \nBritain’s Financial Conduct Authority said it was investigating statements made by Carillion over seven months up to and including a profit warning last July. \nDec. 22, 2017 \nCarillion said it had received all necessary consents from lenders to defer two financial covenants to April 30 from the end of the year. \nDec. 20, 2017 \nCarillion moved the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies forward to Jan. 22 from April 2. \nDec. 13, 2017 \nCarillion said it had reached a deal to sell a large part of its UK healthcare facilities management business to outsourcing group Serco, helping it cut debt by 41.4 million pounds. \nDec. 11, 2017 \nScottish investment firm Kiltearn Partners, the largest shareholder in Carillion, halved its stake, a regulatory filing showed. \nNov. 17, 2017 \nCarillion’s shares tumbled 34 percent after it issued its third profit warning in five months and said it was heading towards a breach of debt covenants and would need fresh capital. \nNov. 6, 2017 \nCarillion won two contracts with state-owned Network Rail, which should generate revenue of almost 200 million pounds for the company over the next three years. \nOct. 27, 2017 \nCarillion named Davies as its chief executive, bringing in a former executive of defence company BAE Systems to help turn around its business. \nOct. 24, 2017 \nCarillion agreed to new credit facilities and deferrals on some debt repayments, sending its shares up as much as 25 percent. \nOct. 12, 2017 \nCarillion confirmed that it had received proposals from more than one counterparty for the possible acquisition of its UK healthcare business. \nSept. 29, 2017 \nCarillion had its second profit warning in 2017 and said it may need to sell shares to shore up its balance sheet. \nSept. 11, 2017 \nCarillion announced the departure of its finance chief along with a series of changes to its management. \nAug. 24, 2017 \nCarillion said it had been named as the main contractor on a 300 million pound ($405 million) Manchester property development. \nJuly 18, 2017 \nA Carillion joint venture won contracts worth 158 million pounds to supply catering and other services for British military sites. \nJuly 17, 2017 \nA consortium that includes Carillion won a 1.4 billion pound contract to help build Britain’s High Speed 2 railway. \nJuly 14, 2017 \nCarillion added HSBC to its team of financial advisers, fuelling speculation that it was preparing a rights issue. \nJuly 11, 2017 \nCarillion shares fell a 30 percent as analysts doubted whether a string of measures to conserve cash would be enough to stave off a rights issue. \nJuly 10, 2017 \nThe chief executive of Carillion quit as the group warned on full-year profit and said it was pulling out of three construction markets in the Middle East. The company also said payment problems on four construction contracts nearing or reaching completion had forced it take a provision of 845 million pounds.
