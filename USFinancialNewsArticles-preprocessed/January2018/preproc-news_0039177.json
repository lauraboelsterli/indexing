    "text": "Connor Carrick’s go-ahead goal midway through the third period helped the Toronto Maple Leafs erase a two-goal deficit to beat the Ottawa Senators 4-3 in the Battle of Ontario on Saturday night at Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa.\nCarrick fired his dragging wrist shot through a crowded crease and past Ottawa goalie Craig Anderson for the decisive strike with 11:02 remaining in the game. It was Carrick’s third goal of the season.\nZach Hyman, Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner each scored a goal for Toronto, which snapped its season-high four-game losing streak (0-1-3) and avenged Wednesday’s 4-3 loss to the Senators.\nThe Maple Leafs had lost four straight against Ottawa and were 1-6-3 in the past 10 meetings.\nFrederik Andersen made his ninth straight start and stopped 15 shots for Toronto.\nErik Karlsson, Mike Hoffman and Tom Pyatt scored for Ottawa -- all in the second period -- and Anderson stopped 29 of 33 shots as the Senators lost their second straight after Thursday’s 4-1 loss to St. Louis.\nThe Senators have dropped three of their last four and fell to 3-3-1 in 2018.\nHyman fought through chaos in front of the net and slipped the loose puck past Anderson to put the Maple Leafs ahead 1-0 with 12:34 left in the first period.\nKarlsson, who missed practice Friday with an illness but was healthy enough to play, tied the game at 1-1 with a wrist shot from the right circle during a power play only 3:08 into the middle period.\nHoffman’s goal came just over four minutes later to put Ottawa in control. After taking a feed from Cody Ceci on a rush, Hoffman beat Andersen stick side with his wrister.\nPyatt tacked on his sixth goal of the year while shorthanded with just under two minutes to play in the second, giving Ottawa a two-goal cushion.\nMatthews lit the lamp for his 20th goal just 2:53 into the third before Marner’s sixth tally tied it at 4:21 on the power play.\nDespite being a game-time decision, Toronto’s Morgan Rielly missed the game with an upper-body ailment he sustained Thursday against Philadelphia. Ottawa third-liner Nate Thompson also sat out with a lower-body injury.\nToronto breaks up a stretch of four out of five games on the road with a home tilt against Colorado on Monday. Ottawa begins a quick two-game road trip Monday in Minnesota.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
