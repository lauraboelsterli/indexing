    "text": "January 16, 2018 / 5:26 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Kim Kardashian announces birth of 3rd child, this one by surrogate Reuters Staff 2 Min   Kim Kardashian and her rapper husband Kanye West announced their third child on Tuesday, a girl born to a surrogate.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \n“Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,” Kardashian said in a message on her app. \nThe couple thanked the unidentified surrogate “who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give.” \nThey said the baby was born on Monday but they did not announce a name. \nKardashian, 37, and West are already parents to North, 4, and Saint, 2. The “Keeping Up with the Kadashians” reality and social media star has said she decided to use a surrogate after doctors warned of serious health risks if she became pregnant again. \nKardashian has given detailed accounts on her blog about the difficulties she experienced during her two labors. \nTwo of Kardashian’s sisters are also expecting babies. Khloe Kardashian, 33, announced in December that she is six months pregnant with her basketball player boyfriend Tristan Thomas, while their half-sister Kylie Jenner, 20, is reported to be expecting her first child soon. \nThe arrival of Kardashian and West’s third child swiftly became on of the top five trending topics on Twitter.
