The bodies of two sailors were recovered from the ship while a third body was pulled from the sea near the vessel. The remaining 29 crew of the ship are presumed dead. \n(Infographic: Tanker blaze burns bright interactive - tmsnrt.rs/2DmrPvL ) \nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Transport said the salvage team had located the wreck, which was at a depth of 115 metres (377 feet) under sea level, and were preparing to send underwater robots to explore it. \nThe SOA said vessels had taken 31 water samples in the area around the wreck containing black grease with heavy oil smells, and a concentration of petroleum that exceeds some seawater quality standard limits.

China's Ministry of Transport/Handout via REUTERS \nClean-up teams were continuing to monitor the wreck area to assess the distribution and drift of the oil spill and the ecological impact. \nThe Japan Coast Guard said on Wednesday the oil slick was “diffusing and disappearing”. \nThe slick is meandering across an area about 35 km (21.8 miles) long and 28 km (17.4 miles) wide, with a width of between 200 metres and 300 metres, the coast guard said in a statement after observing the area with a patrol ship and an airplane. \n(Burning Iranian tanker drifts to Japan: tmsnrt.rs/2DqMwH7 ) \nThe Sanchi had been adrift and ablaze after crashing into the freighter CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Jan. 6. Strong winds pushed it away from the Chinese coast, where the incident happened, and into Japan’s exclusive economic zone. \nThe ship, which was carrying 136,000 tonnes or almost 1 million barrels of condensate - an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil - sank after several explosions weakened the hull. \nOn Tuesday Japan’s environment ministry said it did not see much chance that the spill would reach its shores.
