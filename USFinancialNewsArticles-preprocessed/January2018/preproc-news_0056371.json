    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China’s central bank said on Tuesday it hoped European authorities would reconsider proposed rules on a threshold of 30 billion euro needed to set up an Intermediate Parent Undertaking (IPU).\nIt also asked the Council of the European Union to reconsider its rules and not to include the total assets of branches at non-EU financial institutions in their calculations on the setting-up of an IPU.\nThe joint letter, issued by the People’s Bank of China and China Banking Regulatory Commission, was in response to suggestions by the Council of the European Union in November.
