Junior forward Nicholas Baer, freshman forward Luka Garza and sophomore forward Cordell Pemsl added 10 points apiece as Iowa gave coach Fran McCaffery his 400th career victory.\nJunior forward Jordan Murphy had 21 points and 17 rebounds while recording his 20th double-double of the season for Minnesota (14-10, 3-8). Senior forward Davonte Fitzgerald had 16 points and freshman guard Isaiah Washington scored a season-best 15 as the Golden Gophers dropped their fourth straight contest and seventh in the past eight.\nMinnesota, which shot 44.8 percent from the field, played without sophomore guard Amir Coffey (shoulder).\nIowa shot 60.6 percent from the field in the second half to finish at 55 percent. Bohannon and Moss each made four 3-pointers as the Hawkeyes were 12 of 25 from long range.\nThe margin was four points before the Hawkeyes delivered the decisive 11-2 burst. Moss ended the charge with a 3-pointer to give Iowa an 81-68 edge with 4:27 left.\nThe Golden Gophers didn’t creep close than nine points the rest of the way.\nA dunk by Cook gave the Hawkeyes a nine-point lead 70 seconds into the second half, and the advantage reached 50-37 on a 3-pointer by Moss with 16:49 to play.\nMinnesota ran off the next eight points, with a 3-pointer by Fitzgerald cutting the Iowa lead to five with 15:43 to play. Washington’s basket pulled the Golden Gophers within 57-53 with 13 minutes left before Bohannon knocked down a 3-pointer to start a 10-2 surge that saw the Hawkeyes take a 12-point lead with 10:09 left.\nMinnesota answered with an 11-3 burst to move with 70-66 with 6:34 to play.\nCook had 11 points and five rebounds in the first half as Iowa led 37-33 at the break.\nThe Hawkeyes started the game with an 11-1 burst before the Golden Gophers scored the next seven points.
