Prior to joining BioSig Technologies, Mr. Chaussy has been the sole proprietor of Anna & Co., Inc., a consulting company that offers financial and accounting services to small publicly traded companies. Mr. Chaussy has an extensive entrepreneurial growth and development background learned from working for Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., a subsidiary of Penske Corporation, where his improvements of management and reporting tools have allowed the company to double in size. During his career, Mr. Chaussy also served as Chief Financial Officer to a number of private and public companies. The systems introduced by Mr. Chaussy have been key drivers of profitability and development of international business lines. Mr. Chaussy is a CPA and received his degree in Accounting from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\nIn his role as CFO, Mr Chaussy will be responsible for ensuring the financial organization required to support the Company’s aggressive growth strategy while establishing a strong foundation for long-term progress.\n\"Steve has been supporting BioSig from the very beginning of our journey. As we step up our efforts towards commercialization, we needed a highly experienced, full-time CFO with the strong expertise in supporting emerging growth companies and successfully managing rapidly developing environments,” stated Mr. Kenneth Londoner, Chairman & CEO of BioSig Technologies, Inc. “Steve’s ability to navigate complex markets is a definite value-add in both our pre-commercial activities and future growth of our organization.”\n“I am both honored and excited to be joining the BioSig team at such a key point in their trajectory,” said Steven Chaussy. “I am impressed with the company current assets, management team and near-term commercialization prospects. I look forward to contributing to the future success of the Company.”\nAbout BioSig Technologies\nBioSig Technologies is a medical device company developing a proprietary biomedical signal processing technology designed to improve the $4.6 billion electrophysiology (EP) marketplace ( www.biosigtech.com ).
