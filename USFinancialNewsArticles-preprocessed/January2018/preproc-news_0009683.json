It offers grocery delivery in five markets via Uber [UBER.UL] or Deliv and is testing delivery with its own trucks in Denver. \nKroger Co ( KR.N ), the largest traditional supermarket operator, offers its own HomeShop delivery service in Denver. It also partners with third parties including Instacart, Uber and Roadie. \nAmazon has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts. \nWal-Mart comes in at No. 2 with 9 percent, followed by Ahold USA’s ( AD.AS ) Peapod at 7 percent, FreshDirect with 6 percent and Instacart at 5 percent, Packaged Facts said.
