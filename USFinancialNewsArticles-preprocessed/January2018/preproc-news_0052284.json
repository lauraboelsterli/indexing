    "text": "Jan 29 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia has named Matt Comyn as its new chief executive, effective April 9, the country’s largest lender by market capitalisation said on Monday.\n“Matt’s appointment will enable a smooth transition to new leadership, as CBA responds to the current regulatory processes and legal proceedings, accelerating the related changes and improvements already underway,” CBA Chairman Catherine Livingstone said in a statement.\nComyn replaces outgoing Chief Executive Ian Narev, who has led CBA since December 2011, in a period marked as much by record profits as allegations of serious misconduct.
