    "text": "By David Z. Morris 11:18 AM EST \nA security researcher with Kaspersky Labs has found pirated digital copies of Michael Wolffâ€™s Fire and Fury containing malware that could help hackers gain access to other peopleâ€™s computers. \nThe exploit was highlighted by researcher Michael Molsner and reported by the Daily Beast . The Beast noted that the compromised version of the book, in PDF format, has only a little over 230 pages, instead of the 328 pages in the official version. In tests conducted by the Daily Beast , the included malware was easily detected by antivirus software. Sometimes we come across strange malware ðŸ˜‚ 8667949f8fd4ce4da0424af4208104e3 pic.twitter.com/D9l4xu62A6 \nGet Data Sheet , Fortuneâ€™s technology newsletter. \nItâ€™s intriguing that the discovery of the malware came from a researcher with Kaspersky Labs. The Russian-headquartered cybersecurity firm has recently faced allegations that it is linked to Russian intelligence services . According to U.S. intelligence reports, those agencies interfered with U.S. election systems and online news, in ways that appear to have been broadly supportive of Trumpâ€™s candidacy. The U.S. government recently banned the use of Kaspersky products by its agencies. \nTo avoid being a hackerâ€™s plaything, readers should stick to official e-book versions of Fire and Fury , as sold by Amazon and other retailers. Torrent sites serving pirated material infect as many as 12 million users a month with malware. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
