In addition to connecting to 75 data centers in Texas, LOGIX operates its own high-performance data center facilities in the DASH markets.\nThe combined company was renamed LOGIX Fiber Networks, and as part of the transaction, David Dane became the Chief Executive Officer of LOGIX, succeeding Interim CEO Matthew Murphy, Co-Founder and Partner of Astra Capital Management.\n\"We are excited to welcome Alpheus employees and customers to the LOGIX family, and we're eager to rapidly integrate our combined networks, products and customer care operations,\" said David Dane. \"Our dedication to providing superior, local customer service with the most technologically advanced services to our enterprise and carrier customers will allow us to drive continued strong growth for our company and our clients.\"\nMatthew Murphy, currently the Executive Chairman of the LOGIX board of directors, said, \"LOGIX has been successfully transformed by the exceptional direction of our management team that came on board when Astra bought the company in 2016. The expanded network created from this acquisition perfectly positions LOGIX to capitalize on the enormous opportunities we see in our markets.\"\nKevin Beebe and Mark Johnson, Partners of Astra Capital Management and members of the LOGIX board of directors, added, \"The LOGIX investment and subsequent Alpheus acquisition embody the type of investments that Astra is uniquely equipped to make, and we are highly confident that LOGIX is now even better positioned for future growth with its enhanced scale, exceptional management team and supportive capital funding partners.\"\nEquity investors in the transaction comprised the existing ownership group led by Astra, as well as Astra Partners I and other co-investment partners, including Portfolio Advisors.
