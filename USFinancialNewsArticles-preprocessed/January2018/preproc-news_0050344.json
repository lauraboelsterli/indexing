    "text": " 48 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Lockheed Martin revenue beats, profit to rise in 2018 Reuters Staff 2   Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) reported fourth-quarter revenue on Monday that beat Wall Street estimates, helped by higher sales from the F-35 fighter jet programme, while also forecasting a rise in earnings in 2018. \nShares of the U.S. defence contractor rose 2.4 percent to $353.15 in premarket trading. \nThe U.S. defence contractor took a $1.9 billion (1.34 billion pounds) charge in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to the change in U.S. tax law. \nExcluding a deferred non-cash gain of $122 million or 43 cents per share, and the tax charges, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S calculations showed Lockheed earned $3.87 per share versus analysts estimate of $4.07 per share. \nLockheed gave an adjusted figure for earnings from continuing operations of $4.30 per share. \nNet sales rose to $15.14 billion from $13.75 billion a year earlier, beating Wall Street estimates of $14.72 billion. \nAdjusted for new accounting standards from Jan. 1, Lockheed said it expects 2018 net sales in the range of $50.00 billion-$51.50 billion and earnings per share of $15.20-$15.50. \nLockheed, like its peers in the United States, is expected to gain from an increase in defence spending under President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration. \nThe U.S. Defense Department expects to spend some $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy 2,456 of the supersonic warplanes. \nLockheed said sales in its aeronautics business, its biggest, grew 11.8 percent to $6.05 billion.
