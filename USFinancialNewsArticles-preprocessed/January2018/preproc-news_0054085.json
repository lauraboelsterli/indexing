    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 9:39 PM / in 6 minutes Goodell, President Trump remain at odds over player protests Steve Keating 3 Min Read \nMINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell and President Donald Trump remained on a collision course after both men conceded no ground on the issue of players kneeling in protest at racial injustice during the national anthem. \nJust 14 hours after Trump raised the issue during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Goodell would not back away from the league’s position that they need to work with players to address their concerns which include the police shootings of minorities and racial disparities in the justice system. \n“What the players are really interested in is making our communities better, seeing injustices that they see in their local communities that we can address collectively and support from the players. That’s where our focus is,” said Goodell during his own State of the League address on Wednesday. \nOver the course of the season players were caught in Trump’s Twitter crosshairs, the President repeatedly calling out Goodell and NFL owners for not taking action. \nTrump scorned any player who protests as a “son of a bitch” who should face suspension. Goodell praised the athletes as political activists. \nTrump renewed his criticism on Tuesday when he singled out a speech guest, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for leading an effort to put American flags on the graves of 40,000 veterans, saying the initiative was “why we proudly stand for the national anthem”. \nGoodell said a committee of league representatives and players would continue to meet in an effort to find a compromise to an issue that has divided fans.
