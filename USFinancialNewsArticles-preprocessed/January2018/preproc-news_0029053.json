    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 12:58 AM / a minute ago Toshiba sees $3.7 billion balance sheet improvement from Westinghouse deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said on Thursday it would sell its claims in bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse Electric Co to a group led by the Baupost Group - a move that would contribute to an improvement of about 410 billion yen ($3.68 billion) in its balance sheet. \nConfirming an earlier Reuters report, the Japanese conglomerate also said it had agreed a deal to transfer its stake in the unit to Brookfield WEC Holdings. \nThe 410 billion yen figure includes profits of about 240 billion yen from the sale of its claims, and tax benefits of about 170 billion yen, Toshiba said in a statement. \nCombined with the 600 billion yen in new shares it issued last month, Toshiba would be able to avoid falling into negative net worth for the business year to end-March, it said. \nThe transfer of Westinghouse shares to Brookfield, for $1, is expected to be completed by March 31, Toshiba said.
