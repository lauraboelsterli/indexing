    "text": "Iranian oil tanker burns, 32 missing after collision off China's coast Oil tanker still on fire on Sunday afternoon The tanker's 32 crew members are missing The ship was carrying almost 1 million barrels of ultra light crude Published 4 Hours Ago SHARES Korea Coast Guard via AP In this photo provided by Korea Coast Guard, the Panama-registered tanker \"Sanchi\" is seen ablaze after a collision with a Hong Kong-registered freighter off China's eastern coast Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018. \nA tanker carrying Iranian oil and run by the country's top oil shipping operator was ablaze and spewing cargo into the East China Sea on Sunday after colliding with a Chinese bulk ship, leaving its 32 crew members missing, the Chinese government said. \nThick clouds of dark smoke could be seen billowing out of the Sanchi tanker, engulfing the vessel as rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather and fire on and around the ship, Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran's Ports and Maritime Organisation, told Iranian television. \nThe Sanchi collided with the CF Crystal about 160 nautical miles off the coast near Shanghai on Saturday evening, the Chinese Ministry of Transportation said in a statement. \nThe Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices. \n\"Sanchi is floating and burning as of now,\" the ministry said. \"There is an oil slick and we are pushing forward with rescue efforts.\" \nState media CCTV showed pictures of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke. \nIt had sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site by 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday, it added. \nSouth Korea also sent a ship and helicopter to help. A Korean Coast Guard official confirmed the tanker was still raging at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT). He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media. \nThe tanker's 32 crew members were all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi nationals, the Chinese transport ministry said. \n\"There is a wide perimeter of flames around the vessel because of the spillage and search and rescue efforts are being carried out with difficulty,\" Rastad said. \n\"Unfortunately, up to this moment, there is no news of the crew,\" he said. \nCF Crystal's 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued and the ship suffered \"non-critical\" damage, China's transport ministry said. Major maritime incident \nThe incident marked the first major maritime incident involving an Iranian tanker since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in January 2016. \nThere was a collision involving an NITC-operated supertanker in the Singapore Strait in August 2016, but there was no loss of life or pollution. \nThe Chinese government gave no details of the size of the spill. The Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement that the cause of the incident was under investigation. \nReuters ship tracking data shows Sanchi was built in 2008 and was managed by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). Its registered owner is Bright Shipping Ltd. \nIt was due to arrive at Daesan in South Korea from Kharg Island in Iran on Sunday, according to Reuters ship tracking. \nThe Sanchi tanker, leased by Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd, had \"valid foreign insurance\", Iranian oil ministry spokesman Kasra Nouri told Iran's state television. \nHanwha Total was not immediately available for comment. \nSanchi collided with CF Crystal, registered in Hong Kong, which was carrying 64,000 tonnes of grain from the United States to China's southern province of Guangdong, the government said. \nCF Crystal, which was built in 2011, was due to arrive in China on Jan. 10, according to Reuters ship tracking data.",
