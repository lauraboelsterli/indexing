    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Propanc Biopharma Inc. (OTCQB: PPCB) (\"Propanc Biopharma\" or \"the Company\"), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on development of new and proprietary treatments for cancer patients suffering from solid tumors such as pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers, today announced the engagement of Mr. Alan Morell as a Senior Strategic Advisor for the Company, focusing on branding, growth strategy and market positioning. Mr. Morell currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Creative Management Partners LLC, an internationally recognized Media and Public Relations firm and will be advising the Company on a consulting basis.\n\"For a number of months I held numerous discussions with Alan and observed his important contacts at the highest level among Fortune 500 Companies, including within the Pharma and Biotech sectors,\" said James Nathanielsz, Propanc Biopharma's Chief Executive Officer. \"Alan is highly respected on Wall Street within the Microcap sector and has excellent contacts across all Media. We look forward to maximizing the exciting growth potential of the Company with Alan's involvement, as we advance our lead product, PRP, towards a First-In-Human study in 2018.\"\n\"It is an incredibly enlightening journey to witness the advancement of this innovative technology and dedication of the management team at Propanc Biopharma under CEO James Nathanielsz,\" said Mr. Morell, Senior Strategic Advisor to the CEO at Propanc Biopharma. \"I share James' belief that PRP have the ability to direct cancer stem cells (CSCs) to become benign, converting cancerous cells into normal cells by reprogramming gene expression in CSCs, but not healthy cells. Our job is to get this positive word out.\"\nCurrently progressing towards a First-In-Human study, PRP aims to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis from solid tumors. Eighty percent of all cancers are solid tumors and metastasis is the main cause of patient death from cancer. According to the World Health Organization, 8.2 million people died from cancer in 2012. Consequently, a report by IMS Health states innovative therapies are driving the global oncology market to meet demand, which is expected to reach $150 billion by 2020. The Company's initial target patient populations are pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers, representing an estimated combined market segment of $14 billion in 2020, according to GBI Research.\nTo view Propanc Biopharma's \"Mechanism of Action\" video on anti-cancer product candidate, PRP, please click on the following link: http://www.propanc.com/news-media/video\nTo be added to Propanc Biopharma's email distribution list, please click on the following link: http://ir.propanc.com/email-alerts and submit the online request form.\nAbout Creative Management Partners LLC, Agent Alan Morell, Consulting and Advisory:\nCreative Management Partners assists clients with Brand Growth Strategy, which includes identifying relevant cancer support associations for media campaigns, such as video news releases, social media, and print and online placement for business-focused publications.

In future, we intend to develop our lead product to treat (i) early stage cancer and (ii) pre-cancerous diseases and (iii) as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening.
