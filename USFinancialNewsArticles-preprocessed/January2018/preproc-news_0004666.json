    "text": "Snapchat wanted its New Year's Eve party to be so exclusive that it banned photos and blocked all snaps coming from the venue, according to The Daily Beast .\nUnfortunately for the company, the strict \"no photos\" regulation reportedly led the partygoers to turn to rival Instagram to document their experiences . \nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel personally paid at least $4 million to throw a New Year's Eve party for employees and guests at the L.A. Live complex in Los Angeles, featuring musicians Diplo and Drake, The Daily Beast wrote. \nBut there was one rule: No photos. People were encouraged to leave their phones at home, and those who brought their devices had tape placed over the cameras. The company also blocked snaps from being posted at the venue.\nHowever that didn't stop people from removing the tape and taking pictures. Or, people took photos of the polaroids and photo booth strips Snap provided at the event and posted them online .\nYou gotta come to my side and see how we live, I cannot see Heaven being much better than this.... #lit #bestnyeparty #bestnyeever #dopeaf #drake #snapchatevent #snapchatnyeparty #2018 #friendshipgoals #awesomenezz #exclusiveparty #hadablast #snapchat #snapchatpartiesbelike #yougottacometomysideandseehowwelive #instagood #instadaily \nA post shared by Staycee :penguin: (@awesomenezz13) on Jan 1, 2018 at 7:08pm PST \nBut without Snapchat at their disposal, m any attendees posted their photos on Instagram â€” even Drake posted some videos from the event on his Instagram Stories. \nAfter all, today's cardinal rule is if you can't post your experiences on social media then there's no proof it actually happened.\nSnap did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nWATCH: CNN pulling Snapchat daily news story show chapters CNN is pulling its Snapchat daily news story, reportedly because of challenges making money      4:04 PM ET Fri, 22 Dec 2017 | 00:40",
