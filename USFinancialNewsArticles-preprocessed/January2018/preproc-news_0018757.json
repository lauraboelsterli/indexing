    "text": "RAIT continues making progress reducing its commercial property portfolio as part of its strategic transition to concentrate primarily on its commercial lending business\nPHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RAIT Financial Trust (NYSE: RAS) (“RAIT”) today announced that it has completed sales of five properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $110.4 million and divested an additional two properties with an aggregate net carrying value of approximately $14.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. RAIT expects these transactions to result in a reduction of related indebtedness by approximately $128.3 million. These sales and divestitures align with RAIT’s previously announced strategy of transforming RAIT into a more focused and cost-efficient business concentrated on its core commercial real estate lending activities. During 2017, consistent with this strategy, RAIT sold or divested approximately $399.3 million of its property portfolio and reduced related indebtedness by approximately $356.2 million. During 2016 and 2017, RAIT sold or divested $737.2 million of its property portfolio and reduced related indebtedness by approximately $652.0 million.\nThe properties sold by RAIT during the fourth quarter of 2017 were two parcels of land in Daytona Beach, Florida, an office property in Scottsdale, Arizona, a retail property located in Round Rock, Texas, an office property in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and an office property in Charlotte, North Carolina. RAIT used approximately $90.8 million of the gross proceeds received from these sales to repay related indebtedness, pay transaction costs and for other items. RAIT received net cash proceeds of approximately $5.7 million related to these sales.\nThe properties divested by RAIT during the fourth quarter of 2017 were two industrial properties in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania and Marysville, Ohio. These properties had a net carrying value of approximately $14.3 million and related debt of $39.9 million. As previously disclosed, these divestitures completed RAIT’s divestiture of an industrial portfolio which RAIT expects to result in RAIT recognizing a non-cash gain of approximately $25.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAbout RAIT Financial Trust\nRAIT Financial Trust is an internally-managed real estate investment trust focused on providing debt financing options to owners of commercial real estate throughout the United States.
