    "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - And the name is .... Chicago West.\nKim Kardashian’s new baby daughter with rapper husband Kanye West has been named Chicago, the reality star announced on her app on Friday.\nThe baby girl was born to a surrogate on Monday, a third child for the celebrity couple.\nFILE PHOTO - Kim Kardashian attends the Tom Ford Spring Summer 2018 collection during New York Fashion Week in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., September 6, 2017. REUTERS/Brenna Weeks Kardashian revealed the name, without explanation, in a simple update to the birth announcement she made earlier this week.\nWest, 40, was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago.\nKardashian, 37, and West are already parents to North, 4, and Saint, 2.\nThe “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” reality and social media star has said she decided to use a surrogate after doctors warned of serious health risks if she became pregnant again.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Andrew Hay\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
