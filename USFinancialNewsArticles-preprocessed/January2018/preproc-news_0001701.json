    "text": "NORTHVALE, N.J., Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Elite\" or the “Company\") (OTCBB:ELTP) a specialty pharmaceutical company developing abuse-deterrent opioids and niche generic products, today announced that it has received approval of the Company’s abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Phendimetrazine Tartrate Tablets USP, 35 mg.\nBased on recent QuintilesIMS Health data from March 2017, the retail sales for this product is approximately $4.5 million with three generic competitors. These sales numbers do not include most institutional sales or sales to clinics.\nThe Phendimetrazine Tartrate approval is from an Elite ANDA filed approximately six years ago. Since the filing, Elite obtained a second, approved Phendimetrazine Tartrate ANDA through Mikah Pharma. Elite has been selling this generic product for more than five years. Elite is considering strategic options, including divestiture, for this newly approved ANDA.\n“An ANDA approval for Phendimetrazine Tartrate at the end of 2017 was a welcome occurrence,” commented Nasrat Hakim, President and CEO of Elite. “We look forward to additional approvals in 2018 from more recent filings.”\nAbout Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nElite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company which is developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse deterrent opioid products as well as niche generic products. Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products which have high barriers to entry. Elite owns generic and OTC products which have been licensed to TAGI Pharma, Epic Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Elite currently has nine commercial products being sold, four products under review pending approval by the FDA, additional approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and the NDA filing for SequestOx™. Elite’s lead pipeline products include abuse-deterrent opioids which utilize the Company’s patented proprietary technology and a once-daily opioid. These products include sustained release oral formulations of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. These formulations are intended to address two major limitations of existing oral opioids: the provision of consistent relief of baseline pain levels and deterrence of potential opioid abuse. Elite also provides contract manufacturing for Ascend Laboratories (a subsidiary of Alkem Laboratories Ltd.). Elite operates a GMP and DEA registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing located in Northvale, NJ.
