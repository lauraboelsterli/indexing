    "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CIM Commercial Trust Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCT) (TASE: CMCT), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that principally invests in, owns, and operates Class A and creative office investments in vibrant and improving urban communities throughout the United States, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to purchase the fee simple interest in 9460 Wilshire Boulevard in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills, California.\nThe mid-century, nine-story, 97,000-square-foot Class A office building with significant retail street frontage was built in 1959 and last renovated in 2008. The building is located at the prominent corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Beverly Drive, adjacent to the Four Seasons Beverly Wilshire Hotel, and at a prime location one block from the future Metro Purple Line Wilshire/Rodeo Station. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.\n“9460 Wilshire, situated in the prominent Golden Triangle and surrounded by first-class retailers, restaurants, hotels, and services, is in a highly-desirable and high barrier to entry office market. It is a strong addition to CIM Commercial Trust’s portfolio,” said Charles Garner, CEO of CIM Commercial Trust Corporation. “The property has not changed ownership in almost forty years, and is positioned for growth by tapping CIM’s operational expertise and long-term experience in the Los Angeles market. Our goal is to continue to invest in high-quality urban assets possessing attractive growth prospects, such as 9460 Wilshire.”\nABOUT CIM COMMERCIAL TRUST CORPORATION\nCIM Commercial Trust Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that principally invests in, owns, and operates Class A and creative office investments located in vibrant and improving urban communities throughout the U.S. Properties are primarily located in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, D.C.
