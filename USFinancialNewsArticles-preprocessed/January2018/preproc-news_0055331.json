    "text": "Yante Maten scored 20 points and led Georgia to a rare win over No. 23 Florida, 72-60 Tuesday in Southeastern Conference play at Stegeman Coliseum in Athens, Ga.\nMaten converted a three-point play and knocked down a 3-pointer from the top of the key in the second half to help the Bulldogs snap a three-game losing streak.\nChris Chiozza scored 15 points, and Egor Koulechov added 13 points for the Gators (15-7, 6-3 SEC), who have lost two of three.\nFlorida had owned the series recently, winning the past four meetings and seven of the past eight games against the Bulldogs overall. However, the Gators couldn’t overcome a cold stretch in the second half.\nFlorida endured a four-minute scoring drought late in the second half. Koulechov hit a pair of free throws with 5:18 to play, and the Gators didn’t score again until Keith Stone hit a 3-pointer that trimmed Georgia’s lead to 66-56 with 1:09 to play.\nKoulechov knocked down a 3-pointer that gave Florida a 20-16 lead midway through the first half.\nTyree Crump ignited a Georgia spurt with a pair of 3-pointers, and the Bulldogs closed out the half with a 19-8 run to take a 32-27 lead into halftime. William Jackson had 10 points in the first half to lead the Bulldogs.\nFlorida opened the second half with a 12-2 run to regain the lead. Jalen Hudson sank a 3-pointer, and KeVaughn Allen had a dunk in the Gators’ quick start.\nGeorgia battled back and was up 55-51 after a three-point play by Maten with seven minutes left.\nJackson finished with 16 points, and Juwan Parker added 10 points for the Bulldogs (13-8, 4-5 SEC).\nGeorgia hit 12 consecutive free throws down the stretch to seal the win.\nFlorida returns home for two SEC games, beginning with a visit from Alabama on Saturday.\nThree of Georgia’s next four games are on the road, starting at Mississippi State on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
