    "text": "January 27, 2018 / 6:27 AM / in 13 hours ICA Fluor wins $198 million Mexico City airport tender Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico-based company ICA Fluor has won a contract to build the medium-voltage electrical distribution network for the new Mexico City airport, the state-run company overseeing the project said on Friday. \nGrupo Aeroportuario de Mexico City (GACM) said ICA Fluor won the 3.656 billion peso ($198 million) tender in conjunction with Mexican firm Industria del Hierro. \nICA Fluor is a joint venture between Mexican construction company ICA ( ICA.MX ) and U.S. engineering firm Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ). \nStruggling with heavy debt, ICA said in August it had filed a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan that had been subscribed to by the majority of its creditors.
