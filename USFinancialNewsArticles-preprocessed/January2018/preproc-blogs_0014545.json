    "text": "Authorities say five people have been killed by mudslides that have destroyed homes in Southern California.\nStorms dumping rain on the state have increased the risk of mudslides in communities already ravaged by fires.\nNorthern California was hit hardest Monday evening, while Southern California was bracing for the worst to arrive overnight.\nLAPD tweet \nBoth regions have been plagued by destructive wildfires.\nProperty owners stacked sandbags in devastated northern wine country areas where deadly fires struck in October and well over an inch of rain had fallen Monday night.\nTo the south in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, evacuations were called for over 20,000 people in neighborhoods below hillsides left bare by the state's largest wildfire in history. Mud and debris flows are a serious threat.",
