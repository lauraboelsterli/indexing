    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 8:01 AM / in 27 minutes S.Africa govt pension fund says shareholding in Steinhoff eroded after scandal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) said on Wednesday its shareholding in Steinhoff depreciated from 24.1 billion rand ($2 billion) on Nov. 30 to 1.8 billion rand by Dec.31 in the wake an accounting scandal at the retail group. \nGEPF made the remarks in a presentation handed in to a joint committee meeting at parliament, where a preliminary hearing on Steinhoff was being held. \nSteinhoff, owner of more than 40 retail brands including Poundland in Britain, has admitted “accounting irregularities”, triggering an 85 percent share slide. ($1 = 11.8900 rand) (Reporting by Wendell Roelf; Writing by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by James Macharia)",
