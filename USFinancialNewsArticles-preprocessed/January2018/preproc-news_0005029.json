[nL4N1OV07D] \nThe Mercury News said the 54-year-old Gruden had signed the richest coaching contract in the NFL, with the agreement worth $100 million over 10 years. \nGruden coached the Raiders from 1998 to 2001 before being traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and capturing Super Bowl XXXVII. He has a career coaching record of 95-81. Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
