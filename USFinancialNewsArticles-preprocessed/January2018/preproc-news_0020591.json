    "text": "January 16, 2018 / 12:01 AM / Updated 17 hours ago China consumer group seeks answers from Apple about slowing iPhones Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Chinese consumer group has asked Apple ( AAPL.O ) for information about the slowing of older iPhones after operating system updates, demanding a reply before Friday, state news agency Xinhua reported. \nThe query from the Shanghai Consumer Council came in response to consumer feedback that old iPhones became sluggish after upgrading the software to iOS 10.2.1, it said. \nIn a letter to Apple on Monday, the council requested an explanation for the slow-down and information about what Apple planned to do to rectify the problem, Xinhua reported. \nThe California-based company acknowledged in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems and apologized for the issue. It also cut battery replacement costs and said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council, a non-government organization approved by the Chinese authorities, said it had received 2,615 complaints about Apple products and services in 2017, compared with 964 complaints in 2015.
