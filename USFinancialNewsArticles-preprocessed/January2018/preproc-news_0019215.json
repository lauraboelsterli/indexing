    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft ( TRNF_p.MM ) has resolved its dispute over financial derivatives with the country’s largest lender, Sberbank, on “mutually beneficial terms”, a Transneft official said on Friday.\nThe dispute was over deals on derivatives concluded in 2013 that resulted in losses for Transneft of around 67 billion roubles ($1.2 billion) due to a sharp depreciation in the rouble.\nMaxim Grishanin, Transneft’s first vice president, also told reporters that the company expects its dividend payout this year to be on a par with what it paid last year.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
