    "text": "January 8, 2018 / 9:17 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Germany's conservatives, SPD want tax relief for high earners - source Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) want to raise the bar for a top income tax rate for high earners to an annual income of 60,000 euros, a source with knowledge of their coalition talks said on Monday. Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz delivers a speech before exploratory talks about forming a new coalition government at the SPD headquarters in Berlin, Germany, January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nThe measure, an election promise by the conservatives, is designed to provide tax relief for high earners. It signals a compromise by the SPD who had wanted to raise taxes for high earners and expand welfare payments. \nA top tax rate of 42 percent at the moment applies for those who earn some 53,700 euros and above (47,490 pounds) annually.
