He covered the ground easily and certainly played like a really good footballer tonight.” \nThe draw means West Ham go above Watford into 10th place, while Palace remain a point back in 12th. \nJust eight points separate the bottom 12 clubs in the Premier League, meaning neither side is yet free of relegation danger.
