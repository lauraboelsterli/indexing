LATE DISMISSAL Soccer Football - FA Cup Fourth Round - Cardiff City vs Manchester City - Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - January 28, 2018 Cardiff City's Neil Etheridge saves from Manchester City's Raheem Sterling REUTERS/Rebecca Naden \nCardiff twice went close after the interval through Kenneth Zohore and Junior Hoilett but City always looked comfortable and Sterling and Silva spurned chances to extend the lead. \nDanilo also drew an excellent save from home keeper Neil Etheridge before Championship side Cardiff’s day got worse with the late dismissal of Joe Bennett for a second bookable offence. \nHis first clattering challenge on Sane led to the German’s substitution at the interval. Slideshow (7 Images) \n“We knew how they played -- they caught us a few times and that is football,” said De Bruyne. \nGuardiola said Sane’s injury would be assessed on Monday. “He will be out for a while, minimum two to three weeks or a month. We will see tomorrow exactly,” he added. \nThe Spaniard again dismissed the notion that the quadruple was a feasible target for City this season even though they lead the Premier League by 12 points, face Arsenal in the League Cup final and are through to the Champions League last 16. \nThey lost their unbeaten league record in a 4-3 loss at Liverpool on Jan. 14 after Guardiola scotched suggestions they might be able to go through the domestic season undefeated. \nAsked again on Sunday if City could claim the quadruuple he said: “No. They asked me if we would be invincible in the Premier League and I said no. I do not have enough players, I have players out injured. It is impossible.” Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Ken Ferris and Clare Fallon",
