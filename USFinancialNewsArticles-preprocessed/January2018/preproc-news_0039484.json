    "text": "TULSA, Okla., Jan. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE: MMP) has increased the partnership's quarterly cash distribution to 92 cents per unit for the period Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, 2017, representing the 63 rd distribution increase since its initial public offering in 2001.\nThe fourth-quarter 2017 distribution is 8% higher than the fourth-quarter 2016 distribution of 85.5 cents per unit and represents a 2% increase over the third-quarter 2017 distribution of 90.5 cents. For the year, Magellan declared distributions of $3.5875 per unit for 2017, or 8% higher than distributions of $3.315 per unit for 2016.\nThe new distribution, which equates to $3.68 per unit on an annualized basis, will be paid Feb. 14 to unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 6.\nThis announcement is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b), with 100% of the partnership's distributions to foreign investors attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.
