The disappointment of Arsenal fans will have been eased by their attacking display against Crystal Palace in a 4-1 win at the Emirates. \nArsenal, who hadn’t won in their last five games in all competitions, struck their four goals inside the first 22 minutes.

With Brighton pushing forward, Hazard brilliantly netted a third 13 minutes from time before Victor Moses made it four late on. \nThe win took Chelsea above Liverpool -- who play on Monday -- into third. With one win in 13 league games, Brighton are 16th, just two points above the relegation zone. \nStoke City got themselves out of the bottom three, with new manager Paul Lambert enjoying a 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town. \nFellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion picked up a useful point at Everton in a 1-1 draw.
