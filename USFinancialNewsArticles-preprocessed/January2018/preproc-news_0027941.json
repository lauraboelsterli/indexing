    "text": "Facebook is announcing a second major tweak to its algorithm, saying it will prioritize news based on survey results of trustworthiness.\nThe company said in a blog post and Facebook post from CEO Mark Zuckerberg Friday that it is surveying users about their familiarity with and trust in news sources. That data will influence what users see.\nFacebook announced last week that it would try to have users see fewer posts from publishers, businesses and celebrities, and more from friends and family. Zuckerberg said Friday because of that, news posts will make up 4 percent of the news feed , down from 5 percent today.\nThe changes come as Facebook has struggled to deal with fake news on its platform and Russian-linked content meant to influence the 2016 U.S. elections.",
