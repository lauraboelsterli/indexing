    "text": "Market Insider Years with the big January's for stocks have also had mighty big selloffs So goes January, so goes the year is the Wall Street saying that means a good January should foreshadow a positive year for stocks. Strategas looked at the top 10 January's for the S&P 500 since 1950 and found they all preceded a positive year for the market, but they also preceded an intra-year correction, with some of them fairly significant. Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty Images Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange \nThe 10 best January's for stocks have two things in common — the full year ended with a gain and there was also a fairly significant sell off. \nStrategas studied the 10 biggest January gains for the S&P 500 since 1950, and found the advances ranged from 5.8 percent, in 1980, to 13.2 percent, in 1987. If the S&P ends the month where it is now, it would be No. 6 of the top 10 with a 7 percent gain. \nEach of those strong January performances led to a full year gain, averaging about 22.3 percent. Wall Street strategists, surveyed by CNBC, expect the S&P to rise to 3,000 by year end, from its current 2,860 level. \nSo in the top 10 January years, the old Wall Street adage — 'so goes January, so goes the year' worked well, but it left out the part about the correction. \nIn each of those years, there was a selloff ranging from a low 4 percent to as much as 34 percent — in 1987. The median loss in the intra-year selloffs was 8.2 percent, and the average correction was 11.8 percent. \nAfter January, the S&P had a positive 11 months from Feb. 1 to Dec. 31, in all of the top years except for 1987. In 1987, the year of the crash, it lost 9.9 percent in that period and was up only 2 percent for the year. The other nine years averaged an 11-month gain of 13 percent. \n\"A strong January typically bodes well for the rest of the year, but we shouldn't ignore the possibility of a correction. You typically see some form of a pull back, but the end result is a typically strong full-year performance,\" said Todd Sohn, technical strategist at Strategas. \nSource: Strategas Research Patti Domm CNBC Markets Editor Related Securities",
