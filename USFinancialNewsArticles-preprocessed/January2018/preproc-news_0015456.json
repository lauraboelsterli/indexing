    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will next month hold a hearing with the countryâ€™s top markets regulators to discuss the risks posed by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThe Senate Banking Committee will take testimony from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton in early February, the source said.\nThe hearing comes amid heightened concerns over a bubble in the bitcoin market after the currency soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December, only to slump more than 28 percent.
