The storm has already caused road closures in Georgia and some flight delays throughout the Southeast. \nThe frigid temperatures have been blamed for at least 12 deaths. Forecasters expect these cold temperatures and wintry conditions to worsen over the next few days. \nAbove: Visitors take photographs at the brink of Horseshoe Falls in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on Dec. 29, 2017.
