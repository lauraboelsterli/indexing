    "text": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Fingerpaint Marketing, an independent, full-service nationwide marketing agency, has signed a contract to acquire 395 Broadway and the adjacent parking lot in downtown Saratoga Springs, NY from Myron M. Hunt, Inc. The deal is expected to close within the next three to six months.\nThe current two-story building has 25,000 square-feet of office space and a 55-car parking lot.\nFingerpaint has been a tenant in the building since it signed a ten-year lease back in October 2012. At that time, the company had 42 employees and $4.3 million in annual revenue. In 2018, the company is projecting $45 million in revenue with a staff of nearly 200, with more than half located in the Saratoga Springs location.\nThe company plans to add a third floor to the existing building to allow for further company expansion.

We absolutely love our current location, and it has been a wonderful complement to all of the restaurants, bars and retail shops downtown,\" said Ed Mitzen, Fingerpaint's founder. \"We are thrilled that we will continue to be a major player in downtown Saratoga Springs for years and years to come.
