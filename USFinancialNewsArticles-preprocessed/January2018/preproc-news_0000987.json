    "text": "Published: Jan 2, 2018 3:28 p.m. ET Share \nUtah Republican’s decision creates opening for Mitt Romney \nBy Siobhan Hughes Bloomberg News Hatch played a key role in passage of the Republican tax plan last year as chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. \nWASHINGTON — Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said he would retire when his term ends early next year, setting off a race for his seat in 2018 and giving Republicans an additional seat to defend. \n“Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves,” Hatch, 83 years old, said in a statement. “And for me, that time is soon approaching. That’s why, after much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I’ve decided to retire at the end of this term.” \nHatch’s decision reverses the position he took last year, when he said that his chairmanship of the tax-writing Finance Committee would make it hard for him to leave the Senate. It comes after he helped pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut last year, delivering President Donald Trump a major achievement. \nHatch, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Republican senator.",
