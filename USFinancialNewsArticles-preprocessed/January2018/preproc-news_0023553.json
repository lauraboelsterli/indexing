    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trend Micro Incorporated ( TYO: 4704 ; TSE: 4704 ), a global leader in cybersecurity solutions, was named a Leader in Gartner, Inc.’s 2018 Magic Quadrant for Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems*. Trend Micro improved its position in the Leaders quadrant compared to the previous year.\nIn under two years since the acquisition of TippingPoint, Trend Micro has further advanced its Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) solution. From Trend Micro’s perspective, the placement in this Gartner report demonstrates the company’s commitment to protect critical infrastructures from known and unknown vulnerabilities.\n“We are proud of the strategic value customers are getting from our TippingPoint IPS and its elegant integration into our Deep Discovery threat detection technology,” said Don Closser, vice president and general manager for Trend Micro TippingPoint. “We continually assess the global changes in technology infrastructure, user behaviors and the evolving threat landscape. Overlaying these three lenses shows us where to refine our solutions to provide one of the most complete security portfolios in the industry.”\nTrend Micro’s IPS offering gives organizations a proactive approach to network security by equipping them with comprehensive contextual awareness and in-depth network traffic analysis to prevent intrusions before they occur. By inspecting and blocking inbound, outbound and lateral network traffic in real time, it defends datacenters and distributed enterprise networks with automated remediation of vulnerable systems. The solution pulls from intelligence gathered from Trend Micro’s security research teams to stay ahead of ever-changing threats and offer the industry’s most advanced detection capabilities.\nTo download a complimentary copy of the full Gartner Magic Quadrant for Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems report, please visit here .
