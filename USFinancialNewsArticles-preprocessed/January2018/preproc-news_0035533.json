Inter Milan (42 points) host AS Roma (39) in the late game. \n“We’ve won a really difficult match against a team that always makes us suffer. I‘m very happy for us and our supporters.” Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri said. “This was a very valuable win.” \nMertens ran on to a through ball by Jose Callejon and let the ball bounce several times before scoring with a dipping half-volley over goalkeeper Etrit Berisha in the 65th minute. \nThe Belgian, who had not scored in his last nine league games, took his tally for the season to 11 as his side extended their unbeaten away record in the league to 24 games. \nLazio went ahead through Luis Alberto in the 23rd minute, were pegged back by Manuel Pucciarelli’s goal two minutes later and regained the lead through Sergej Milinkovic-Savic just after the half hour.

Soccer Football - Serie A - Atalanta vs Napoli - Stadio Atleti Azzurri, Bergamo, Italy - January 21, 2018 Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri REUTERS/Alberto Lingria \nMilinkovic-Savic scored the third with a brilliant volley in the 68th minute before Bastos and Nani added two more in the final 10 minutes to floor the Flying Donkeys. \nQuagliarella opened his account against Fiorentina after half an hour, fired home the second after 60 minutes and completed his hat-trick with a close-range effort as Sampdoria moved up to sixth on 33 points. \nCarlos Sanchez scored a consolation for the visitors. \nCrotone won the relegation battle at Verona 3-0 and Bologna beat bottom club Benevento by the same score. Udinese were held 1-1 at home by SPAL and Torino’s visit to Sassuolo ended with the same scoreline. \nMilan fell behind after eight minutes at Cagliari when Nicolo Barella, later sent off for a second bookable offence, scored with a shot which bounced awkwardly in front of Gianluigi Donnarruma. \nKessie levelled from a penalty in the 35th minute and the Ivorian struck again six minutes later. Milan defender Ricardo Rodriguez was sent off in the 81st minute for two yellow cards, both for fouls on Paolo Farago. Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern,; Editing by Ed Osmond",
