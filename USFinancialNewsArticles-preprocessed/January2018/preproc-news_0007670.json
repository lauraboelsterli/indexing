Agribusiness revenue was $14.6 million, compared to $18.2 million in the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to the previously announced decrease in lemon revenues stemming from the delayed lemon harvest at its Arizona ranches that were impacted by excessive heat during the quarter and lower prices. Rental operations revenue was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. There were no real estate development revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nAgribusiness revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes $12.0 million in lemon sales, compared to $16.4 million of lemon sales during the same period of fiscal year 2016, with the decrease primarily the result of the aforementioned delay in the timing of the lemon harvest as well as lower prices versus the prior year period. Approximately 414,000 cartons of fresh lemons were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at a $21.01 average price per carton compared to approximately 521,000 cartons sold at a $25.91 average price per carton during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As anticipated, the Company recognized minimal avocado revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, similar to the same period last year. The Company recognized a similar amount of orange revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at $0.6 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Specialty citrus and other crop revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $0.8 million higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased wine grape harvest volume.\nTotal costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $20.2 million, compared to $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to decreases in the Company’s agribusiness costs mainly due to decreased third-party grower costs partially offset by increased packing, growing and depreciation costs and expenses. In addition, lemon packing costs were $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, approximately 3.2 million cartons of fresh lemons were packed at an average cost per carton of $6.75 compared to 2.9 million cartons of fresh lemons packed at an average cost of $7.55.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $4.3 million, compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year, with lower lemon revenues being the primary factor in the decrease. Net loss applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $2.8 million and compares to a net loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $0.19 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $0.01 for the same period of fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to earnings of $2.0 million in the same period of fiscal year 2016. A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided at the end of this release.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, revenue was $121.3 million, compared to $111.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $11.9 million, compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. Net income applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, was $6.0 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, compared to net income applicable to common stock of $7.4 million in the same period last year. Net income per diluted share for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $0.42, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.52 in the same period of fiscal 2016. Net income per diluted share for the fiscal year ended October 31 2017 and 2016 is based on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 14.3 million and 14.2 million, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $19.0 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $20.1 million in the same period last year. A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided at the end of this release.\nThe results of operations for the prior year fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 include a $3.4 million gain on sale of Calavo Growers, Inc. stock, a $1.0 million gain on sale of conservation easement, and $1.2 million of transaction costs associated with entering into the real estate development joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nDuring fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $18.5 million, compared to $14.3 million in the prior year.
