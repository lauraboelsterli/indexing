    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has banned speedskater Xiaoxuan Shi from the national team for two years after failing a drug test, removing her from their squad for next month’s 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the China Skating Association said in a statement.\nShi tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol on Dec. 14, the governing body said in a release posted on China’s General Administration of Sports.\nClenbuterol is a performance-enhancing substance sometimes found in weight-loss pills and is on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned list.\nThe penalty is a “wake-up call” for Chinese athletes preparing for the Winter Olympics, which will take place in South Korea from Feb. 9-25, the Association said.\n“There are loopholes in our education campaign against doping. We will take more measures and responsibility to prevent this from happening again,” the organization added.\nThe positive test is a blow for China, which will host the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nShi, 21, won a gold medal for the 500-metre sprint at the Junior Speedskating World Cup in 2016.\nReporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
