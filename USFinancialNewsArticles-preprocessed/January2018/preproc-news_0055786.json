The company is in the process of having its white paper/private placement memorandum developed to launch its Pre-ICO offering. The digital tokens or custom coins known as cryptocurrency similar to (e.g. Bitcoin and Ether) will be offered via a known credible Fintech public blockchain Etherum based platform, which will enable digital coin traders known as miners to purchase the utility coins in fiat currency, Bitcoin or Ether.
