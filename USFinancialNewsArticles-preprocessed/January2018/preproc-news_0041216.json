    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 7:56 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Free-scoring Lazio move closer to top two Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - Free-scoring Lazio produced another impressive attacking display to brush aside Udinese 3-0 on Wednesday and close the gap on Serie A leading pair Napoli and Juventus. \nAn unlucky own goal by Samir in the first half followed by one each from Nani and Felipe Anderson after the break ended Udinese’s seven-match unbeaten league run and took Lazio’s goal tally to 56 from 21 league games. \nLazio moved up to 46 points, seven behind Juventus with leaders Napoli a further point ahead. \nThe hosts went ahead in the 22nd minute when Sergej Milinkovic-Savic fired a low ball across the face of the goal and Samir, attempting to get the ball first, headed it into his own goal. \nPortugal forward Nani tapped in from Felipe Anderson’s low cross two minutes after halftime and the Brazilian scored the third himself three minutes from time as he burst past two defenders and curled his shot into the net. \nUdinese had penalty appeals for an alleged foul on Jens Stryger turned down when they were 2-0 behind, the referee making the decision without reviewing the incident on the video replay system (VAR). \nNani has been hampered by injury since his move to Lazio and his goal was his third in eight games for them.
