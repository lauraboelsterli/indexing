    "text": "Jan 10 (Reuters) - Brink’s Co said on Wednesday an international gold shipment was stolen on Dec. 6 and the secure logistics firm said it would result in a fourth-quarter pretax charge of about $11 million.\nThe robbery is currently under investigation and the customer affected by the theft has been reimbursed, Brink’s said in a statement.\nDue to the ongoing investigation and related security protocols, the company said it does not plan to make additional comments regarding the robbery.\nDespite the charge, the company, which specializes in secure transportation and handling of currency and valuables, said it continues to expect to post strong fourth-quarter results.
