    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 9:13 PM / in 6 minutes Texas Instruments fails to beat earnings estimates, shares fall Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc’s ( TXN.O ) fourth-quarter earnings failed to exceed Wall Street expectations after several quarters of better-than-expected results, sending its shares down 5 percent on Tuesday. \nThe Dallas-based company reported a 67 percent slump in profit to $344 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to tax-related expenses from new U.S. tax laws. \nExcluding the tax expense, Texas Instruments earned $1.09 per share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nNet revenue rose 9.8 percent to $3.75 billion and edged past analysts’ estimate of $3.74 billion. \n“It’s not a blow-out result, but it is perfectly fine,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein. \nRevenue from the company’s analog chips division, its largest, rose 11 percent, while its embedded processing unit posted revenue growth of 20 percent. \nTexas Instruments’ analog chips are used by industries to calculate changes in sound and temperature. The company also makes chips for the automotive sector. \nTexas Instruments forecast current-quarter earnings of $1.01 to $1.17 per share and revenue of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion.
