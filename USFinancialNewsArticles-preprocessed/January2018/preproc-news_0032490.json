Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.7 percent to C$107.66, while Toronto-Dominion Bank added 0.6 percent to C$74.17. \n* The overall financial services group, which accounts for more than one-third of the TSX’s weight, gained 0.5 percent, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.6 percent. \n* Barrick Gold Corp climbed nearly 1 percent to C$17.88. Gold futures rose 0.5 percent to $1,333 an ounce. \n* Industrials advanced 0.6 percent as railroad stocks gained ground. \n* Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd was up 1.4 percent at C$230.28 after the company reported on Thursday fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates. \n* Canadian manufacturing sales jumped 3.4 percent in November, their biggest increase in 2-1/2 years, on strength in transportation equipment and petroleum and coal products, Statistics Canada said. \n* Eight of the index’s 10 main groups gained. \n* Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd climbed 6.4 percent to C$17.81 after Canada’s National Energy Board on Thursday set out a process for resolving permit disputes related to the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. \n* Still, the energy group fell 1 percent. U.S. crude prices were down 0.6 percent to $63.56 a barrel. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",
