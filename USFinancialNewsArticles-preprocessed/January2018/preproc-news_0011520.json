    "text": "January 9, 2018 / 11:05 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago France welcomes Chinese investment, not \"looting\" - minister   \nBEIJING (Reuters) - France welcomes long-term investments from China, but only after screening deals to ensure French assets are not “looted”, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday in Beijing. French President Emmanuel Macron (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the first meeting of the French-Chinese business council in Beijing, China, January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Ludovic Marin/Pool \nIn China on a three-day state visit, French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a more balanced trade relationship, hoping in particular to reduce France’s 30 billion euro ($35.8 billion) trade shortfall with the country. \nLe Maire said more balance would mean better access to Chinese markets while protecting French technologies and setting limits on Chinese investments in France. \nAsked if his ministry would from now on screen Chinese investments, Le Maire said: “Yes, and I reject many.” \nHe added that he would announce plans on Jan. 15 to boost a 2014 decree requiring foreign companies to get permission from the French state before taking control of French firms in the energy, telecoms, transport, water and the health sectors \n“We accept long-term investments but not looting,” he added. \n($1 = 0.8373 euros)",
