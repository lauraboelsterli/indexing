As a result, the need to import gold dropped.”\nNet imports by China through Hong Kong fell to 31.221 tonnes in December from 35.554 tonnes in November, according to data emailed to Reuters by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department.\n“Prices shot up in December, curbing demand, and normally people would like to have low inventories during the year-end,” said Dick Poon, general manager at Heraeus Precious Metals in Hong Kong.\nTotal gold imports via Hong Kong also dropped to 34.326 tonnes in December from 37.121 tonnes in November.\nGold prices rose more than 2 percent in December, recovering from nearly five-month lows hit during the middle of the month. Prices hit 1-1/2-year highs on Thursday.\nChina does not provide trade data on gold and the Hong Kong figures serve as proxy for flows to the mainland.\nThe Hong Kong data might not provide a full picture of China’s purchases as gold is also imported via Shanghai and Beijing.
