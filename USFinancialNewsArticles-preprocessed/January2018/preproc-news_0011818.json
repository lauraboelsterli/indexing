    "text": " 06 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago White House: Lawmakers agreed immigration bill to focus on four areas   A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday agreed to work toward an immigration bill that focuses on four areas: border security, so-called chain migration, the visa lottery system and the plight of ‘Dreamer’ immigrants. \nIn a statement, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the agreement to focus on the four “high-priority areas” was reached during a closed-door portion of a meeting the group held earlier on Tuesday at the White House.
