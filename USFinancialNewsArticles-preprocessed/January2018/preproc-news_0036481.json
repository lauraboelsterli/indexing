    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 9:09 AM / a few seconds ago TPP-11 members to sign trans-Pacific trade pact in March: Kyodo Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Eleven countries aiming to forge a new Asia-Pacific trade pact after the United States dropped out of an earlier version last year will hold a signing ceremony in Chile in March, Kyodo news agency said on Tuesday, citing a Japanese source. \nTrade officials from the 11 countries have been meeting in Tokyo to try to resolve rifts including Canadaâ€™s insistence on protection of its cultural industries such as movies, TV and music. \nJapan has been lobbying hard to save the pact, originally called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the original 12-nation trade agreement last year. The new deal is known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP), or TPP-11. Writing by Linda Sieg; Editing by Nick Macfie",
