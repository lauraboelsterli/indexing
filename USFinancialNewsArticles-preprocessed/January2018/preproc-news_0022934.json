The spending per tourist is increasing,” Pongpanu told a news conference.\nIn 2018, Thailand expects 37.55 million visitors to spend 2.1 trillion baht.\nAlthough the baht is near a 3-1/2-year high against the dollar and up more than 12 percent since the start of 2017, inflation is less than one percent.\nThe currency strength was having little impact, said Ittirit Kinglek, the president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, adding, “The overall trend looks positive.”\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries of the tourism boom is majority state-owned airports operator Airports of Thailand , which recently said it planned to upgrade its 2018 earnings outlook.\nShares of AOT have risen 78 percent since the start of 2017, with its market capitalisation reaching 1 trillion baht ($31 billion), making it the largest airport operator in the world by market capitalization.\nIt trades at a valuation of 49 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 times for the second largest airport operator, Spain’s Aena SME SA.\nFaced with stiff competition and higher fuel prices, however, Thai airlines have fallen short of a rise of 16 percent in the benchmark index.\nHotels and shopping malls are among other winners.\nCentral Plaza Hotel Pcl, whose shares have risen 40 percent since the start of 2017, forecasts 2018 revenue growth of 7 percent to 8 percent.\nMall operator Central Pattana Pcl aims for profit growth of 20 percent this year. Its shares have risen 53 percent since the start of 2017.\nThailand’s tour and leisure index rose 30 percent since 2017 and was trading at 37 times earnings.\nThere is still plenty of room for growth, said Douglas Martell, chief executive of ONYX Hospitality Group, the hotel arm of Italthai Group, which also owns a construction company, Italian-Thai Development Pcl.\n“There is also potential for the industry to transition towards higher room pricing,” he told Reuters.
