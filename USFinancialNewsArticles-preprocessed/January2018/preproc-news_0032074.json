    "text": " 09 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago UPDATE 1-BNY Mellon profit rises 37 pct on tax gain Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds details on Q4 results) \nJan 18 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp reported a 37 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, benefiting from a one-time gain of $427 million from the federal tax overhaul. \nBNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, said net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $1.13 billion, or $1.08 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $822 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier. \nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of 91 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. \nAdjusted net interest revenue rose 2.25 percent to $862 million, benefiting from the three hikes in benchmark interest rate by the Federal Reserve in 2017. BNY Mellon’s non-interest expenses rose 14.25 percent to $3 billion. \nOn an adjusted basis, the bank’s total revenue fell 1.8 percent to $3.72 billion. \nThe company’s assets under custody and administration rose 3.42 percent sequentially to $33.3 trillion as of Dec.31. \nShares of BNY Mellon were up nearly 2 percent at $57.89 in premarket trading.
