    "text": "PARIS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Acquisitive French media conglomerate Vivendi on Thursday trimmed its revenue and core earnings (EBITA) forecasts for 2017.\nThe group said in a statement it expected revenues to increase close to 5 percent in 2017, compared with a previous forecast of more than 5 percent. It did not explain the change.\nIt said EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation) would rise between 20 and 25 percent, compared with a November estimate of around 25 percent. It said the revision was down to a 40 million euro ($48 million) restructuring cost at its Canal+ Group unit.\n$1 = 0.8304 euros Reporting by John Irish and Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
