    "text": "Jan 8 (Reuters) - Axovant Sciences Ltd said on Monday it would discontinue its intepirdine program after the experimental treatment failed in a mid-stage study on patients suffering from a type of dementia.\nNeither of the two doses of intepirdine given to patients with dementia with Lewy bodies resulted in improving their motor function, compared with patients given a placebo, Axovant said.\nIn September, Axovant stopped testing the drug on patients suffering from Alzheimer’s after a late-stage trial failure.
