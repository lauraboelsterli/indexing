FILE PHOTO: People walk past an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo \nActivity was restrained somewhat as a U.S. holiday curbed trade in cash Treasuries, though E-Mini futures for the S&P500 ESc1 still made gains of 0.26 percent. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.7 percent, having finally cleared the former all-time top of 591.50 from late 2007. \nAustralia's main index firmed 0.1 percent, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 added 0.3 percent. \nStocks in Hong Kong .HSI jumped 0.9 percent from Friday's record closing high. Investors were optimistic that Chinese gross domestic product data for the December quarter due on Thursday would show growth of at least 6.7 percent for the world's second biggest economy. \nWall Street was on a roll as the fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off with solid results from banks and robust retail sales, driving investor optimism about economic growth. \nThe Dow .DJI amassed gains of 2 percent last week, while the Nasdaq .IXIC gained 1.8 percent and the S&P 500 .SPX 1.6 percent. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq scored eight record closing highs out of the first nine trading days of 2018, while the Dow boasted its sixth closing high of the year. \nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase on average by 12.1 percent in the quarter, with profit for financial services companies likely to increase 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n“The big consensus trade of being short U.S. dollars into 2018 and long European and U.S. financials continues to work in earnest and this remains the key focal point in the week ahead,” said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG. \n“The decline in the USD index was actually the biggest sell-off since 27 June, with prices closing below the Sept. 8 low. It just shows how much sway the USD bears have right now.” DOLLAR IN DECLINE \nThe dollar index showed no sign of bouncing early on Monday, instead edging down to a fresh trough at 90.622 .DXY. \nThe euro was up at a three-year peak of $1.2241 EUR= and holding all of Friday's 1.3 percent surge. \nThe single currency has been bolstered by speculation European Central Bank policymakers are preparing to temper their vast monetary stimulus campaign. \nAlso helping was news German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party and the Social Democrats (SD) were moving toward formal coalition talks. \nLeading members of the Social Democrats said on Sunday they would press for improvements to the coalition blueprint, seeking to win over sceptical party members who can torpedo the deal. \nThe dollar slipped to a six-week low on the yen at 110.73 yen JPY= , even as the head of the Bank of Japan reiterated his commitment to keeping yields low. \nThe Chinese yuan hit hit a two-year high of 6.4155 per dollar CNH=D4 in offshore trade. \nThe pound was at its highest since mid-2016 at $1.3741 GBP= , while the Canadian dollar held firm CAD= on wagers the country's central bank would hike interest rates at a policy meeting on Wednesday. [CAD/] \nA softening U.S. dollar combined with resilient Chinese demand has been positive for most commodity prices. \nGold XAU= hit a four-month top of $1,344.7. \nOil prices consolidated following six straight sessions of gains, with output cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as healthy demand keeping crude near December 2014 highs. [O/R] \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 ticked up 12 cents to $69.99 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 rose 22 cents to $64.52. Reporting by Wayne Cole; editing by Sam Holmes and Richard Pullin",
