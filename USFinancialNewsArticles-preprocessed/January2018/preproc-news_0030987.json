    "text": "OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMCON Distributing Company (“AMCON”) (NYSE MKT:DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska based consumer products company is pleased to announce fully diluted earnings per share of $2.13 on net income available to common shareholders of $1.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2018. Our business philosophy is centered on customer service and reliability which enables us to compete in a challenging environment. We expect to continue to operate the enterprise with a view toward sustained capital expenditures. This investment is necessary to maintain and enhance our strong competitive position in light of current operating conditions,” said Christopher H. Atayan, AMCON’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. He further noted, “As a leader in the convenience distribution industry, AMCON is actively seeking acquisitions in the convenience distribution and foodservice industries that can benefit from our extensive platform of services.”\nFor the first fiscal quarter, the Wholesale Distribution Segment reported revenues of $309.2 million and operating income of $3.2 million. Our Retail Health Food Segment reported revenues of $6.3 million and an operating loss of $0.5 million.\n“Foodservice category sales are growing industry wide. We are among the leaders in program development and strive to continue to enhance our capabilities in this category,” said Kathleen M. Evans, President of AMCON’s Wholesale Distribution Segment.\n“We opened our second store in the Lakeland, Florida market early in fiscal 2018 which has been well received,” said Clifford Ginn, President of AMCON’s Retail Health Food Segment. “We will continue to invest in brand reimaging, social media, new stores, store remodeling, and marketing as we seek to address the competitive challenges we face in the industry. Our Midwestern markets operate in a highly challenging environment.”\n“We closed the December 31, 2017 quarter with shareholders’ equity of $70.5 million and consolidated debt of $15.6 million,” said Andrew C. Plummer, AMCON’s Chief Financial Officer. Plummer added, “During the first fiscal quarter, the Company benefitted approximately $0.9 million from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. This tax cut will facilitate our continued development in technology products for our internal and external customers in a rapidly changing environment. In addition, we have a commitment to investing in our facilities and transportation equipment to serve our long term strategic initiatives in foodservice. We continue to actively manage our working capital and liquidity which affords us the ability to invest in our businesses for the long-term which benefits our customers.”\nAMCON is a leading wholesale distributor of consumer products, including beverages, candy, tobacco, groceries, foodservice, frozen and chilled foods, and health and beauty care products with locations in Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. AMCON also operates sixteen (16) health and natural product retail stores in the Midwest and Florida.
