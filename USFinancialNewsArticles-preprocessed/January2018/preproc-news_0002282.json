    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices dipped as soaring equities dented the allure of safe-haven debt, amid subdued trading as investors tip-toed into the first trading day of 2018.\nThe 10-year JGB yield was 1 basis point higher at 0.055 percent.\nThe 30-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.810 percent.\nJGB losses were limited as the Bank of Japan conducted a regular debt-purchasing operation, through which it bought 960 billion yen ($8.52 billion) of one- to 10-year bonds.\nThe debt market showed little reaction to BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who vowed on Thursday that the central bank will maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy to beat deflation.\nJapanese stocks rallied on the first trading day of 2018, with the Topix probing its highest levels since 1991 as securities and oil shares gained.\n$1 = 112.6400 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
