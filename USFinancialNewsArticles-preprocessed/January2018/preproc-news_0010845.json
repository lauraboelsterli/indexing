FILE PHOTO: Formula One - Singapore Grand Prix 2017 - Practice - Singapore - September 15, 2017 Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat during practice REUTERS/Edgar Su \nThe 23-year-old Russian was dropped by Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso last season after he had previously lost his place at the Red Bull Racing senior team to young Dutch sensation Max Verstappen. \nKvyat had also been linked to former champions Williams, who have yet to announce a replacement for now-retired Brazilian Felipe Massa. \nFerrari have several young drivers on their books, including Monaco-born rookie and Formula Two champion Charles Leclerc who will make his debut for Sauber, and Italian Antonio Giovinazzi.
