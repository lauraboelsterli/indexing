His leadership experience and long track record working with corporate boards will provide crucial guidance and insight to companies looking to close the gap between their strategy and culture.\n\"I am delighted to join the THRUUE team,\" Williams said. \"I look forward to helping both profit and non-profit companies and organizations align their culture and strategy.\"\nIn addition to his work at Easter Seals, Williams currently serves as Chairman of the National Trust for Our Wounded and as a director of the United States Veterans Chamber of Commerce. He also served as Chairman of the National Health Council, as Chair of the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities and on the Pfizer Advisory Board on Patient Engagement and the Advisory Board of Campaign Partners.\nOther boards he has served on include the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation for Military Caregivers, the Institute for Philanthropy, the National Foundation for Dentistry for People with Disabilities, the JM Foundation Search for Excellence, the Missouri Commission on Comprehensive Health Planning, and the Montessori School of Lake Forest.\nAs Executive in Residence, Williams will be responsible for expanding THRUUE's strategic planning and culture change offerings, identifying market trends and expansion opportunities and advising CEOs on social impact, business and governance.

Jim is going to be an integral part of strengthening our expertise in corporate social responsibility and increasing our client's employee and customer loyalty.
