Kemin has acquired the assets of its long-time distributor Agri-Marketing Corp. Agri-Marketing was founded in 1973 in Mont-Saint-Hilaire and has provided exclusive distribution and manufacturing services for Kemin products in Canada.\n\"With this new location in Canada, we are increasing our efforts to better serve our current customers as well as explore new opportunities for our product and services to improve the quality of life for people and animals in Canada,\" said Dr. Chris Nelson, President and CEO of Kemin. \"Kemin continues to grow, and having a larger presence in Canada is a logical next step for our global expansion.\"\nAgri-Marketing has been distributing Kemin products since its inception more than 35 years ago. Kemin expects a seamless transition for customers as Agri-Marketing sales employees become Kemin employees. The new Kemin location will focus on serving the animal nutrition and health market, as well as the pet food and rendering industries. Kemin will look to grow its business through offering an expanded portfolio.\n\"The partnership with Kemin has been longstanding and imperative to our business. We consider our customers to be our top priority and we know Kemin will maintain that close relationship with them through the transition,\" said Scott Ross, President of Agri-Marketing.\nSince early 2017, Kemin has continued to increase its global reach with acquisitions and with the addition of new locations. In March, Kemin acquired Algal Scientific, a Michigan-based company specializing in beta-glucan technology for antibiotic alternatives for animals. In April, Kemin opened an office and manufacturing facility in Lipetsk, Russia.\nAbout Kemin Industries\nKemin ( www.kemin.com ) has been dedicated to using applied science to improve the quality of life for over half a century.
