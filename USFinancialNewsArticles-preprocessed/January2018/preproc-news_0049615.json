    "text": "Purdue senior center Isaac Haas scored 26 points to power the No. 3 Boilermakers to a 74-67 victory over Indiana on Sunday in Big Ten action in Bloomington, Ind.\nHaas hit 10 of 17 shots and all six free throws. Vincent Edwards chipped in with 19 points on 7-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds for the Boilermakers (21-2, 10-0 Big Ten), who set a school record with their 17th consecutive victory. Sophomore guard Carsen Edwards added 10 points for Purdue.\nIndiana junior forward Juwan Morgan paced the Hoosiers (12-10, 5-5) with 24 points on 10-of-18 shooting. Senior guard Robert Johnson added 21 points, hitting 8 of 16 shots.\nVincent Edwards hit the second of two throws to put Purdue up 63-62 with 4:44 left. Haas hit two free throws to push the lead to 65-62 with 4:17 to go. Sixteen seconds later, a layup by Freddie McSwain Jr. put the Hoosiers down one point.\nAfter Purdue’s Dakota Mathias missed a 3-pointer, Haas got the putback to give the Boilermakers a 67-64 edge. Haas scored again with 1:26 to go to put Purdue ahead 69-64. Morgan’s layup trimmed the deficit to 69-66. That’s as close as Indiana could get as the Boilermakers hit five of their next six free throws to take a 74-66 advantage.\nPurdue shot 48.2 percent from the field while Indiana shot 50 percent. Purdue was 15 of 18 from free-throw line while the Hoosiers were 10 of 17.\nNeither team shot well from the 3-point line. The Boilermakers made 5 of 18 while Indiana was 3 of 16.\nJohnson drilled a 3-pointer with 26 seconds left to give Indiana a 37-35 halftime lead.\nWith the score tied at 39, Purdue went on a 5-0 run to take a 44-39 advantage. Trailing 46-41, Indiana went on a 12-2 run to take a 53-48 lead.\nTwo consecutive 3-pointers by Mathias put the Boilermakers ahead 56-53. The two teams traded the lead over the next several minutes.\nIndiana shot 57.7 percent in the first half. Purdue hit 46.9 percent (15 of 32) but was 3 of 11 from 3-point range.\nThe Hoosiers took a 14-4 lead with 14:05 to go and stayed in front most of the first half.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
