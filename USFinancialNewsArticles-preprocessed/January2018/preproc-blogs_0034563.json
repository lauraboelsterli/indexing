    "text": "Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk SHARES \nThe prospect of visiting a construction site may not sound that exciting — unless the invite comes from billionaire serial entrepreneur Elon Musk and the site is The Boring Company's Los Angeles tunnel. \nIn December, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla tweeted that anyone who bought one of the 50,000 logoed baseball caps The Boring Company was selling would be entered in a raffle to win a tour of the tunnel the infrastructure company is digging. 10 hat aficionados, in appreciation for their exquisite taste in millinery, will be picked at random to tour the LA tunnel & drive boring machine \nNow those lucky hat owners have been picked. \nFred Lambert , the editor in chief at electric vehicle website Electrek, was a winner. The Boring Company says winners were picked at random. According to Lambert, he bought five of the $20 hats to increase his odds. \nThursday, Lambert shared the text of the letter he received from the company. It reads: \n\"Congrats! Per Elon's tweet, you've been randomly selected as one of 10 lucky hat aficionados invited to tour The Boring Company's LA tunnel, drive our boring machine, and attend our Hyperloop Competition weekend this summer! \n\"Expect to receive more information in late February as to the specific dates. Note that, if you choose to attend, you will need to cover your own transportation and accommodation costs. \n\"Bring some shoes you're comfortable getting dirty… and your hat, of course.\" \nMusk regularly tweeted updates about the sale of the $20 ball caps emblazoned with The Boring Company logo. The hats went on sale in October and were sold out by December, raising $1 million to fund the business. ",
