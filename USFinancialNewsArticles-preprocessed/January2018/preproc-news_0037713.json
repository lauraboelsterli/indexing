It slashed fees on this part of the forward curve to pre-2012 sale levels. \n“Tom-next” is the shortest-dated spread of them all and the sharp drop in activity after fees were increased in 2015 became totemic of the broader debate about the cost of trading on the LME. \n“Tom-next” volumes, however, have shown no significant improvement since fees were cut again in October. Activity on copper and zinc fell by almost 18 percent year-on-year in the last three months of 2017, while “tom-next” volumes on aluminium were down by almost 26 percent. \nQuite evidently, the pick-up in volumes is happening elsewhere in the LME’s arcane trading structure. \nNeither LME nor brokers will care too much about the specifics but the link, or non-link, between fee cuts and volumes is far from academic. \nThe exchange has made it clear that it will increase fees again if volumes do not return. What happens if volumes pick up, but not on the specific spreads subject to fee reductions, is a moot point. NEW CONTRACTS, OLD CONTRACTS \nPart of the LME’s improved volume picture last year is down to new contracts. \nThe exchange launched both gold and silver contracts in July and cumulative volumes reached 639,546 over the rest of the year, gold activity outpacing that on silver. \nThe LME’s two steel contracts notched up their second full year of trading in 2017 and experienced exponential growth. Activity in the scrap contract surged to 307,532 lots from 49,099 lots in 2016, while rebar volumes totalled 64,430 lots last year, up from 8,637. \nBoth precious and steel contracts are simple cash-settled futures products and the robust performance, particularly of steel scrap, will reinforce the LME’s ambitions to roll out more such products in the next year or so. \nThe LME’s core traditional base metal contracts had a more mixed performance. \nZinc, nickel and lead all registered volume growth, suggesting that broader market conditions have played an important part in the LME turnaround story. \nIt’s surely no coincidence, for example, that zinc saw the strongest performance with a 10 percent increase in volumes in a year characterised by a series of fresh 10-year trading highs. \nThe other main contracts all saw volumes drop year-on-year, albeit in most cases with signs of stabilisation over the closing months of 2017. \nOnly the aluminium alloy contract looks in need of emergency restorative action. Volumes slumped by 52 percent last year, marking the sixth consecutive year of decline. \nIn broad brush terms, though, the LME will take heart from a positive headline performance after two years of decline. \nGraphic on CME copper contract: tmsnrt.rs/2DZ77m6 CME TURNS UP THE HEAT \nThe exchange will still be casting a nervous eye over its shoulder, however. \nAcross the Atlantic the CME has been rolling out ever more products in competition with the grand old London lady of metals trading. \nSome of these, such as the aluminium, zinc and lead contracts have shown only minimal activity. \nCME’s four aluminium premium contracts, by contrast, all saw volume growth last year, led by the European duty-unpaid contract, in which activity more than doubled, and the U.S. Midwest contract, which grew for the fourth straight year. \nAlso worth noting is the CME’s alumina contract, currently the only futures contract for this part of the aluminium supply chain. \nLaunched in 2016, it traded only 200 lots in the first half of 2017 before seeing a sharp rise in activity over the second half. Full-year volumes ended up totalling 6,685 contracts with open interest surging to 2,710 lots from just 60 a year earlier. \nThe real stand-out among CME’s base metals offering, however, has been its oldest contract. \nCopper volumes grew by 26 percent last year, in sharp contrast to the 7.9 percent fall in LME copper volumes. \nThe accepted wisdom is that this is primarily down to new speculative players, particularly those in Asia, gravitating towards the CME because of its simpler structure, facilitating arbitrage with the Shanghai copper market, and its cheaper transaction fees. \nAnd it’s true that rising volumes on the CME copper contract have coincided with money manager positioning hitting historical highs. \nBut there’s an interesting flip side to this phenomenon. Producer and merchant short positioning has also experienced a step-change over the same time frame. \nCME stocks of copper surged by over 111,000 tonnes to 191,575 tonnes last year. They are now bigger than those registered with the Shanghai Futures Exchange and almost as large as those in the LME warehouse system. \nThis unusual development may well have started as a physical merchant play to get ahead of potential U.S. import tariffs from a protectionist Trump administration. \nBut the trend now seems to have taken on a life of its own with traders actively directing spare units to CME warehouses in Arizona and Utah to capitalise on cheap rent. \nThe inference, borne out by the leap in producer and merchant short positioning, is that they are now using the CME contract to finance inventory. \nThat may be a far more worrying prospect for the LME than a new generation of Asian wealth managers using the CME copper contract. \nThe LME, after all, likes to differentiate itself from both CME and Shanghai markets by highlighting its industrial rather than speculative user-base. \nThat demarcation line is starting to blur.
