Vivendi's Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine attends a conference at the Cannes Lions Festival, Cannes, France June 22, 2017. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard - RC12B7442C50 \nThe group, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, was the worst performer on France’s benchmark CAC-40 stock market index, dropping by around 3 percent in early trading. \nVivendi said late on Thursday that it expected revenues to increase by close to 5 percent in 2017, compared with a previous forecast of more than 5 percent. \nIt said earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) would rise between 20 and 25 percent, compared with an earlier target of about 25 percent. \nShares in Bollore’s holding company also fell by 1.8 percent.
