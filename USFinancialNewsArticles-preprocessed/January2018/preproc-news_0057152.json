Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net EARLY MORNING EUROPEAN HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0736 GMT) It's a busy day of earnings today, so here's a summary of the headlines we're looking at. Europe: H&M Q4 pretax profit falls less than expected Siemens Q1 profit dips on Power and Gas business declines ArcelorMittal upbeat about 2018, slowly resumes dividend Ericsson posts bigger than expected Q4 loss Santander Q4 profit falls 4 pct on U.S. impairments Truck maker Volvo raises market outlook after Q4 order boom Lonza's full-year core profit soars 82 pct on acquisitions Electrolux Q4 operating profit tops forecast Infineon slashes revenue guidance on weak U.S. dollar SEB raises dividend as Q4 profit beats expectations Energy group Total announces major deepwater oil discovery in Gulf of Mexico ING quarterly profit misses on costs, weaker financial markets Dutch telco KPN's Q4 results slip as roaming rules hurt Sanofi and partner seek European Medicines Agency review for sleep sickness product Wartsila Proposes Share Split UK: Britain's Capita plans rights issue after profit warning Britain's SSE raises FY profit outlook Centamin posts fall in 2017 core profit on lower output, higher costs Wizz Air posts record passenger numbers and profit in third quarter UK's Britvic Q1 revenue up 3.3 pct Dairy Crest says 9-month revenue well ahead of last year Shell says to sell its stake in Thai Bongkot fields to PTTEP for $750 mln Macro: German retail sales fall unexpectedly in December (Kit Rees) FUTURES INDICATE HESITANT RECOVERY FOR EUROPEAN STOCKS (0708 GMT) Stock futures have opened up 0.1 percent across the major European benchmarks, suggesting a rather hesitant recovery from yesterday's sharp falls. While the STOXX, DAX and CAC40 are set to rise, ending January on a positive note, the FTSE 100 is on track to fall further with futures down 0.2 percent. A rising pound could be piling extra pressure onto the British index. (Helen Reid) WEAK DOLLAR WOES FOR INFINEON (0657 GMT) In an early sign the weak dollar could be a strain on some European companies, particularly those reliant on exports, chipmaker Infineon just cut its 2017/18 revenue guidance, blaming the greenback's weakness. The stock is indicated down 1.9 percent in pre-market trade. (Helen Reid) RESULTS WATCH: SIEMENS STRUGGLES, ARCELORMITTAL RESUMES DIVIDENDS (0641 GMT) Results are rolling in thick and fast today from industrials as well as several banks. German engineering group Siemens reports a fall in quarterly industrial profit due to continued weak demand from the power and gas sector. Profit was in line with analysts' forecasts, but profit margin shrank. Interestingly the group says it got a net 437 million euro benefit from U.S. tax reforms in the first quarter. The world's largest producer of steel, ArcelorMittal, was more upbeat, with profit ahead of expectations and resuming dividend payments after skipping them for 2015 and 2016. The $0.10 payout undershoots analysts' expectations of $0.30, though. A slew of banks reporting today as well, with ING's Q4 profit missing expectations while Sweden's SEB raises its dividend after strong results. Meanwhile impairments in its U.S. unit dented Santander's numbers. The pressure's on for European banks, a leading sector in this year's rally, to deliver convincing results, so it'll be interesting to see how banking shares react today. Also in results to watch today, especially considering the tech rally after AMS results earlier this week, will be chipmaker Infineon. More on that soon. (Helen Reid)",
