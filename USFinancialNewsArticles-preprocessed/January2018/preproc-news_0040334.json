We delivered outstanding financial results, continued to expand our merchant business with the Cayan acquisition announcement and finished the year having met or exceeded our goals,” said M. Troy Woods, chairman, president and chief executive officer of TSYS.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 vs. 2016:\nTotal revenues were $1.3 billion, an increase of 12.5%. Net revenue (non-GAAP), which excludes reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees, was $870.6 million, an increase of 10.8%.

Net revenue (non-GAAP), which excludes reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees, was $3.4 billion, an increase of 11.8%.

Diluted EPS were $3.16, an increase of 82.4%. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) were $624.2 million, an increase of 20.9%. Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) were $3.37, an increase of 20.2%. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $1.2 billion, an increase of 15.1%. 3.85 million shares were purchased for $282.6 million. Debt was reduced by $400 million and totaled $800 million over the past two years.\n“We expect the momentum of 2017 to carry over into 2018. We are projecting strong organic revenue growth as we remain laser focused on executing on our strategic plan and delivering outstanding results,” said Woods.\n2018 Outlook\nOn January 1, 2018, TSYS adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective transition method. The 2018 guidance is below and includes the expected impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard, the expected impact of the acquisition of Cayan, the expected impact of the new tax law (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and the expected effective date of October 2018 of the prepaid rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n2018\nFinancial Outlook\nRange (1)\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Total revenues (GAAP) $3,850 to $3,950 (22 %) to (20 %) Net revenue (non-GAAP) $3,650 to $3,750 7 % to 10 % Earnings per share: Diluted EPS (GAAP) $2.85 to $2.95 (10 %) to (7 %) Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to TSYS common shareholders (non-GAAP)\n$4.10\nto\n$4.20\n22\n%\nto\n25\n%\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 184 (1) The estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on TSYS’ 2018 Outlook is as follows:\nTotal revenues ($1,600) to ($1,575) Net revenue ($62) to ($69) Diluted EPS ($0.04) to ($0.03) Adjusted diluted EPS ($0.04) to ($0.03) The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers will be presented “net” of the amounts paid to them, as opposed to the “gross” presentation for certain of these fees in 2017.\nConference Call\nTSYS will host its quarterly conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, January 23. The conference call can be accessed via simultaneous Internet broadcast on the “Investor Relations” section of TSYS’ website at investors.tsys.com where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available. The replay will be archived for 12 months and will be available approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the call.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains information prepared in conformity with GAAP as well as non-GAAP information. It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of its consolidated financial information as prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.\nAdditional information about non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, net revenue, adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included on pages 12 to 15 in the financial schedules of this release.\nAbout TSYS\nTSYS ® (NYSE: TSS) is a leading global payments provider, offering seamless, secure and innovative solutions across the payments spectrum — from issuer processing and merchant acquiring to prepaid program management.

Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the expectation that the momentum of 2017 will carry over into 2018, the projected strong organic revenue growth and TSYS’ earnings guidance for 2018 total revenues, net revenue, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, and the assumptions underlying such statements, including with respect to TSYS’ earnings guidance for 2018 those set forth under the caption “2018 Outlook” above. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS’ management, are based on management’s assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS’ ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the material breach of security of any of TSYS’ systems; TSYS’ ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve the anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits of the acquisitions, particularly the recently completed Cayan acquisition; the effect of current domestic and worldwide economic conditions; risks associated with foreign operations, including adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates, and in particular with respect to the current environment, adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (Brexit); expenses incurred associated with the signing of a significant client; TSYS does not convert clients’ portfolios as scheduled; the deconversion of a significant client; changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules, prepaid industry rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS and our clients that may result in costly new compliance burdens on TSYS and our clients and lead to a decrease in the volume and/or number of transactions processed or limit the types and amounts of fees that can be charged to customers, and in particular the CFPB’s new rule regarding prepaid financial products, including its effective date; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments relating thereto; adverse developments with respect to the payment card industry in general, including a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism; and growth rates of TSYS’ existing clients are lower than anticipated or attrition rates of existing clients are higher than anticipated. Additional risks and other factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. TSYS disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise except as required by law.\nTSYS Financial Highlights

This non-GAAP measure presents fourth quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results using the previous year’s foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, TSYS’ total year-to-date revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 18.5% as compared to a reported GAAP increase of 18.2%. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities and capital expenditures to free cash flow. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of 2018 guidance of total revenues to net revenue and diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. The tax rate used in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and year is equal to an estimate of our annual effective tax rate on GAAP income. This effective rate is estimated annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that materially impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the mix of revenues and expenses by entity and other significant events. TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and potential investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS’ ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS’ current and ongoing business operations. Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS’ operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. TSYS believes that its provision of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with important key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS’ operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.

Based on its preliminary analysis of the Tax Act, including the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, TSYS estimates that it will receive an additional, non-recurring income tax benefit of approximately $135.9 million due to the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities and the repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Act.\nAdjusted EBITDA (unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, Percent Percent 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Net income (GAAP) (a) $ 243,871 74,375 nm % $ 592,216 325,972 81.7 % Adjust for: Less: Equity in income of equity investments (9,613 ) (7,162 ) (34.2 ) (40,532 ) (26,115 ) (55.2 ) Less: Income tax (benefit)/expense (88,039 ) 33,209 nm 65,878 161,175 (59.1 ) Add: Interest expense, net 28,217 29,823 (5.4 ) 116,028 113,523 2.2 Add: Depreciation and amortization 102,085 102,077 0.0 405,906 373,546 8.7 Less: (Gain)/loss on foreign currency translations (343 ) (84 ) nm 907 (1,748 ) nm Less: Other nonoperating (income)/expenses (172 ) 386 nm (453 ) 575 nm Add: Share-based compensation 13,947 9,937 40.4 42,409 43,728 (3.0 ) Add: TransFirst and Cayan M&A expenses* 3,281 2,267 44.7 13,367 28,176 (52.6 ) Add: Litigation, claims, judgments or settlements 43 21,719 (99.8 ) 1,947 21,719 (91.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (b) $ 293,277 266,547 10.0 % $ 1,197,673 1,040,551 15.1 % Total revenues (c) $ 1,273,289 1,132,224 $ 4,927,965 4,170,077 Net income margin on total revenues (GAAP) (a)/(c) 19.2 % 6.6 % 12.0 % 7.8 % Net revenue (d) $ 870,613 785,709 $ 3,400,332 3,041,876 Adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue (non-GAAP) (b)/(d) 33.7 % 33.9 % 35.2 % 34.2 % * Costs associated with the TransFirst and Cayan acquisition and integration that are both included in selling, general and administrative expenses. nm = not meaningful na = not applicable Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (unaudited) (in thousands) Twelve Months Ended Free cash flow: December 31, 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 856,492 718,029 Capital expenditures (196,026 ) (142,573 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 660,466 575,456 Guidance Summary (unaudited) (in millions, except per share data) Revenue: 2018 (1)\n% Change Total revenues (GAAP) $ 3,850 to $ 3,950 (22.0 %) to (20.0 %) Less: reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees\n200 to 200 Net revenue (non-GAAP) $ 3,650 to $ 3,750 7.0 % to 10.0 % Earnings per share (EPS): Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 2.85 to $ 2.95 (10.0 %) to (7.0 %) Acquisition intangible amortization, share-based compensation, litigation, claims, judgments or settlements and for TransFirst and Cayan M&A expenses, less the tax impact of adjustments\n1.25 to 1.25 Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to TSYS common shareholders* (non-GAAP)\n$ 4.10 to $ 4.20 22.0 % to 25.0 % * Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 184 (1) The estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on TSYS' 2018 Outlook is as follows: Total revenues ($1,600) to ($1,575), Net revenue ($62) to ($69), Diluted EPS and Adjusted diluted EPS of ($0.04) to ($0.03). The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees.
