Felix brings more than 25 years of experience in risk management, having managed global teams across a broad range of industries. Prior to joining Oakwood, she most recently worked for American Apparel, where she led several cross-functional, global teams including environmental health and safety, corporate social responsibility and global compliance, all while minimizing risk and liability across the organization.
