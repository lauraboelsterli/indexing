Stockholm district court said the trial would start in February. \nIn April last year, Uzbek asylum seeker Akilov allegedly hijacked a truck and sped down a busy pedestrian street in Stockholm hitting 19 people before crashing into a department store. \nHe was taken into custody just hours afterwards. His lawyer said he had confessed to committing a terrorist crime. Reporting by Johan Ahlander",
