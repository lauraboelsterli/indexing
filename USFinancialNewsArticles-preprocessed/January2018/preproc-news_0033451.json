    "text": "BEACHWOOD, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Real Alloy Holding, Inc. (“Real Alloy” or the “Company”) today announced several operational updates.\nReal Alloy Receives Court Approval on Debtor-in-Possession (“DIP”) Financing\nOn January 17, 2018, Real Alloy received final approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware for its DIP financing, which is the existing $265 million Real Alloy DIP facility provided by Bank of America and certain bondholders of the Company approved in November. This DIP financing allows Real Alloy to continue uninterrupted operations throughout the reorganization process, giving Real Alloy the authority to make payments to suppliers and service providers as well as to continue to pay employees wages, salaries and benefits.\nReal Alloy’s DIP financing is entirely separate from the DIP financing provided to Real Industry, Inc. (“Real Industry”).\nSignificant Progress Made from Real Alloy Since Filing\nSince the filing of Chapter 11 in November 2017, Real Alloy has successfully negotiated contracts for 2018 production with several longstanding customers including major multinational automobile manufacturers and large-scale aluminum producers. The Company’s average tenure on its relationship with these customers is over 20 years.\nReal Alloy has continued to work closely with its suppliers and critical vendors throughout this restructuring process, and has received strong support from customers and vendors alike.\nStrategic Review of Existing Operations\nAs part of the Company’s continued focus on rationalizing costs and improving efficiency, Real Alloy announced that it will cease operations at its Mt Pleasant, WI facility, which was acquired from Beck Aluminum at the end of 2016. Real Alloy expects to utilize available production capacity in nearby Indiana and Michigan facilities, and feels that shutting down the facility allows the business to better utilize production capacity and reduce overall capital needs.\nReal Alloy does not expect significant customer disruption as a result of the Mt. Pleasant closing and will handle customer needs from its other facilities.\nReal Alloy Sales Process\nReal Alloy continues to receive a significant amount of interest in its sales process and remains on track to receive multiple bids in line with the court approved bid deadline of January 31, 2018. Real Alloy does not expect any customer disruption as part of the sale.\nManagement Comments\nTerry Hogan, President of Real Alloy, stated, “We have been very pleased with the progress made since our filing in November, and appreciate the support and patience of many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors throughout our restructuring. Given our strong liquidity position, the support from our customers and suppliers and the favorable spread prices, we believe we are well positioned for strong performance in the future. We look forward to completing our sale process with the right capital partner in the near future and continuing to grow our core operations in North America and Europe.”\nAdditional Information on the Chapter 11 Proceedings\nCourt filings and other information related to the court-supervised proceedings are available at a website administered by the Company’s claims agent, Prime Clerk, at https://cases.primeclerk.com/realindustry .
