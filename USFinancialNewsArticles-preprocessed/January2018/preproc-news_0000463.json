    "text": "Montreal, QC, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jubilant DraxImage Inc. (“DraxImage”), a Jubilant Pharma wholly-owned subsidiary, is pleased to announce approval of new pulmonary indications for DRAXIMAGE® DTPA (Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate Injection) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nDRAXIMAGE DTPA is a widely-used nuclear medicine imaging agent that has now received the expanded indication for lung ventilation assessments.\nSpecifically, DRAXIMAGE DTPA is a kit for the preparation of Technetium Tc99m pentetate injection. Technetium Tc99m pentetate is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for: Brain imaging in adults by intravenous injection; Renal visualization, assessment of renal perfusion, and estimation of glomerular filtration rate in adult and pediatric patients by intravenous injection; Lung ventilation imaging, and evaluation of pulmonary embolism, when paired with perfusion imaging in adult and pediatric patients when administered by nebulizer for inhalation. This product is immediately available in the US market.\nThis expanded labeling provides flexibility to clinicians and enhances the broad utility of DRAXIMAGE DTPA to potentially include clinical applications to image and diagnose key functional aspects of the pulmonary system. Depending upon their patient evaluation, this will allow physicians to consider lung ventilation studies for a much larger patient population suffering from compromised pulmonary function. DraxImage and Jubilant Pharma Senior Vice-President of Medical & Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Norman LaFrance stated, “Jubilant DraxImage is very proud of this latest FDA approval and with the newly approved pulmonary indications, DRAXIMAGE DTPA will be more useful and valuable as a diagnostic imaging agent.”\n“This recent FDA approval further demonstrates the continued commitment by Jubilant DraxImage to the sustainability and further investment in the field of nuclear medicine. Our goal is to grow SPECT and PET imaging globally as part of our company’s continued mission to bring value to products that enable physicians to deliver high quality diagnostic imaging studies,” commented Mike Rossi, Jubilant DraxImage President.\nDRAXIMAGE® DTPA is available to all US customers, today.
