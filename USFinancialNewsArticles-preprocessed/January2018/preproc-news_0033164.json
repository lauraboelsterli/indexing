    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers said White House chief of staff John Kelly offered no legislative solutions to protect people brought to the United States illegally as children in a meeting on Wednesday with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez told Reuters the White House is making unacceptable demands on immigration measures related to “Dreamer” protections. Luis Gutierrez, a Democratic congressman, said the caucus’ meeting with Kelly was positive but he offered no solution to the immigration standoff.\nReporting by Richard Cowan and Blake Brittain; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott\n ",
