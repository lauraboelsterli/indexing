Kitewheel also launching two new lines of business - one aimed at direct brands and the other at OEM technology partners. This is the fifth successive year that Kitewheel has experienced at least 100% growth within the business.\nIn addition to the major growth in its licensing business, Kitewheel’s brand-direct offering began winning customers within only a few months of its summer launch, including one of America’s top performers in customer experience - evidencing the central role of customer journey orchestration in delivering superior CX.
