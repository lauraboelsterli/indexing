    "text": " 19 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Lam Research's second-quarter revenue rises 37 pct Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 24 (Reuters) - Chip equipment manufacturer Lam Research Corpâ€™s revenue rose 37.1 percent in the fourth quarter, as chipmakers spent heavily to make the most of rising semiconductor prices and booming demand. \nFremont, California-based Lam said on Wednesday its revenue rose to $2.58 billion in the second quarter ended Dec. 24 from $1.88 billion a year earlier. \nThe company recorded a net loss of $10 million or 6 cents per share, compared to a profit of $332.8 million or $1.81 per share in the year-ago period, due to a $757 million one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws.
