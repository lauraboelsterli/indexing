Our solid market leading position is underscored by a 36.6% market share in mobile subscribers and a 37.2% market share in mobile revenue. At the same time, we maintained the lowest churn rate and the lowest decline of mobile service revenue among our peers despite an increasingly competitive landscape.\"\n\"We are also pleased with solid progress in our other segments. The number of users signing up for, or upgrading to, connection speeds of 100Mbps or higher grew by 9.5% year over year to 1.28 million in the fourth quarter as a result of broadband subscribers consistently migrating to our higher-speed, higher-value fiber services. Furthermore, our IPTV subscribers exceeded 1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 20.3% increase year over year, driving a 15.7% year-over-year growth in IPTV revenue, which was also helped by the healthy growth of SVOD subscribers.\n\"Going forward, we remain focused on margin expansion and will continue to guide mobile subscribers toward higher-end plans and encourage our broadband subscribers to migrate to higher-speed services. We are confident in our ability to carry our strong growth momentum into 2018 and, with our competitive advantages in network infrastructure, IDC, and CDN, we will be able to further consolidate our market leading position.\" Mr. Cheng concluded.\nRevenue\nChunghwa Telecom's total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 4.4% to NT$60.92 billion, which was comprised of 47.6% mobile, 12.7% internet, 32.2% domestic fixed, 5.8% international fixed, and 1.7% from other businesses.\nMobile communications revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 2.1% to NT$28.97 billion. This was mainly due to the continued growth in mobile VAS revenue and smart device sales, which partially offset decrease of mobile voice revenue. The decline of mobile voice revenue was due to increased market competition and VoIP substitution.\nInternet business revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 2.4% year over year to NT$7.75 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Data Communication revenue and revenue from services provided to the government.\nDomestic fixed revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 10.9% year over year to NT$19.62 billion, primarily reflected by the increase of ICT project revenue, which offset the decrease of local and DLD service revenue that represented 6.9% and 7.7% decrease respectively due to increased mobile and VoIP substitution. Broadband access revenue also decreased by 2.5% to NT$4.63 billion as a result of intense market competition.\nInternational fixed revenue decreased by 0.3% to NT$3.55 billion, mainly due to the decline of international long distance revenue, which resulted from increased market competition.\nTotal revenue for the full year of 2017 decreased by 1.1% year over year to NT$227.55 billion, which was comprised of 48.1% mobile, 12.7% Internet, 31.3% domestic fixed, 5.9% international fixed, and 2.0% other.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nTotal operating costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 5.2% year over year to NT$50.40 billion.\nTotal operating costs and expenses for 2017 decreased by 0.4% year over year to NT$180.73 billion, which was mainly due to lower interconnection expenses and depreciation, but partially offset by the increase in ICT project costs and cost of goods sold.\nOperating Income and Net Income\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 5.1% to NT$10.46 billion. The operating margin was 17.2%, compared to 17.1% in the same period of 2016. Net income attributable to stockholders of the parent increased by 11.7% to NT$8.67 billion.

These statements constitute \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Chunghwa's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Investors are cautioned that actual events and results could differ materially from those statements as a result of a number of factors including, but not limited to the risks outlined in Chunghwa's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms F-1, F-3, 6-K and 20-F, in each case as amended. The forward-looking statements in this press release reflect the current belief of Chunghwa as of the date of this press release and Chunghwa undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that occur subsequent to such date, except as required under applicable law.\nThis press release is not an offer of securities for sale in the United States. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration. Any public offering of securities to be made in the United States will be made by means of a prospectus that may be obtained from the issuer or selling security holder and that will contain detailed information about the company and management, as well as financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to the requirements of the Financial Supervisory Commission, or T-IFRSs, Chunghwa Telecom also provides EBITDA, which is a \"non-GAAP financial measure\". EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) excluding (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) total net comprehensive financing cost (which is comprised of net interest expense, exchange gain or loss, monetary position gain or loss and other financing costs and derivative transactions), (iii) other income, net, (iv) income tax, (v) (income) loss from discontinued operations.\nIn managing the Company's business, Chunghwa Telecom relies on EBITDA as a means of assessing its operating performance because it excludes the effect of (i) depreciation and amortization, which represents a non-cash charge to earnings, (ii) certain financing costs, which are significantly affected by external factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates, which have little or no bearing on the Company's operating performance, (iii) income tax (iv) other expenses or income not related to the operation of the business.\nC AUTIONS ON USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to the consolidated financial results prepared under T-IFRSs, Chunghwa Telecom also provide non-GAAP financial measures, including \"EBITDA\". The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with another method for assessing its operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations.\nChunghwa Telecom's management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, the Company recognizes that:\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with T-IFRSs and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principle.\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to Chunghwa Telecom, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies. Readers are cautioned not to view non-GAAP results as a substitute for results under T-IFRSs, or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies.\nAbout Chunghwa Telecom\nChunghwa Telecom (TAIEX 2412, NYSE: CHT) is Taiwan's largest integrated telecommunications services company that provides fixed-line, mobile, broadband, and internet services.
