    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords fourth graf, removes two extraneous first references\nAlexander Steen collected one goal and one assist, and goalie Carter Hutton made 36 saves as the St. Louis Blues claimed a 3-1 victory over the suddenly struggling Colorado Avalanche on Thursday night in St. Louis.\nThe Blues have won two straight and four of their last five games to maintain their hold on third place in the ultra-competitive Central Division, while the Avalanche have dropped two straight since cobbling together a 10-game winning streak.\nPaul Stastny opened the scoring for the Blues with a late first period power-play goal at the Scottrade Center. Alex Pietrangelo’s shot was stopped, but Stastny was on the doorstep and shoved home the rebound past Colorado goalie Jonathan Bernier.\nBrayden Schenn doubled the lead just past the midway point with another man-advantage marker. Schenn grabbed a loose puck after a point shot was blocked, and he ripped a short-side shot inside the post for his 21st goal of the season. Schenn is now riding a four-game point streak in which he has collected four goals and six points.\nSteen rounded out the scoring with just over a minute remaining in regulation. He has amassed four goals and six points in a four-game run.\nPietrangelo also had a two-point outing for the Blues.\nColorado rookie Alexander Kerfoot gave his team some life with his 12th goal of the season at 17:09 of the second period. Hutton stopped a high point shot but couldn’t corral the rebound before Kerfoot got his stick on the puck and banged it home. Rookie Anton Lindholm collected an assist on the goal for his first NHL point, but that was as close as the Avs could get.\nBernier made 31 saves for the Avalanche.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
