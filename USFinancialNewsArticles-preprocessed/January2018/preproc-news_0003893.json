    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar fell Thursday, as investors bet on faster monetary policy tightening outside the U.S.\nThe Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was down 0.2% to 85.63. The measure has fallen in 12 of the last 14 trading days.\nInvestors expect more central banks around the world to begin unwinding nearly a decade of postcrisis stimulus policies in 2018, paving the way for interest-rate increases down the road. That is likely to make the dollar less attractive to some investors, who for years had sought U.S. assets because they offered yields that were high compared with other developed economies.\nThe gradual shift in capital flows from the U.S. to the eurozone and other resurgent economies will continue weighing on the dollar in coming months, analysts at TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n“We remain firmly in the dollar bear camp at the start the year,” the report said.\nThe dollar dropped 7.5% last year, its largest annual percentage decline since 2007.\nInvestors are also looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Signs that an economic recovery is pushing up wages would bolster the case for the Fed to raise rates more aggressively this year and set up a potential dollar rebound, analysts said.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
