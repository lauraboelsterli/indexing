Pfizer Inc was down 3.1 percent despite its better-than-expected earnings and upbeat 2018 guidance.\nHarley-Davidson Inc closed down 8.0 percent after announcing it would close a Kansas City plant in the face of declining shipments.\nApple Inc declined for a second day, falling 0.6 percent on news that the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the company’s disclosure that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries.\nEarnings so far have been stronger than expected. S&P 500 earnings growth is now forecast at 13.2 percent, up from 12 percent a month ago. Among companies that have reported so far, 80 percent are exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nInvestors will likely scrutinize Trump’s first State of the Union address for clues on trade policy and infrastructure spending. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 43 new lows.\nVolume so far on U.S. exchanges was 8.1 billion shares, compared with the 7.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
