    "text": "TINTON FALLS, N.J., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Two River Bancorp (Nasdaq:TRCB) (the \"Company\"), the parent company of Two River Community Bank (\"the Bank\") , today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, highlighted by solid loan growth during the quarter. All share and per share data for all referenced reporting periods have been adjusted for a 5% stock dividend paid on February 28, 2017.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. Among the other changes was a permanent reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of this change, the Company had to revalue its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017. The Company reduced its net deferred tax asset by $1.78 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which was recorded as a one-time non-cash charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The reduction of the Company’s 2018 Federal corporate tax rate to 21% will result in a significant tax benefit in 2018 and beyond and it is anticipated that the majority of this charge will be recouped in 2018. A portion of this tax benefit will be used to reinvest in the Company’s people, fund its growth, and further support the communities it serves. The charge impacted several metrics throughout the quarter and annual results.\nOperating and Financial Highlights\n(all comparisons to the respective prior year’s period unless otherwise noted)\nFourth Quarter 2017\nNet income was $335,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $2.57 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.\n-- The 2017 fourth quarter included the above-mentioned charge to income tax expense of $1.78 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. Excluding this one-time charge, 2017 fourth quarter net income was $2.11 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. Net interest income increased 12.3% to $8.53 million due to strong loan growth. Total loans increased $34.8 million in the fourth quarter to $850.9 million. As a result of this loan growth, the Company reported a $675,000 loan loss provision, compared to a loan loss recovery of $345,000 in the same prior year period. Total deposits grew by $39.7 million during the quarter to $861.6 million as core checking deposits increased by $28.0 million.\nAnnual 2017\nNet income was $6.50 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $8.63 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. Net income for 2017 was impacted by the above-mentioned charge to income tax expense of $1.78 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. In 2016, the Company received an $862,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, tax-free BOLI death benefit. Excluding the one-time charge to income tax expense and the BOLI event in the prior year, 2017 net income increased 6.6%. Net interest income increased 10.4% to $32.53 million, largely due to higher interest-earning assets driven by loan growth. Non-interest income decreased 0.5% to $5.46 million, due the impact of the previously announced BOLI death benefit received in 2016. Excluding the BOLI death benefit, non-interest income increased 18.0%. Non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.20% at December 31, 2017, from 0.23% at September 30, 2017, and increased from 0.19% at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share was $10.44 at December 31, 2017, compared to $10.46 at September 30, 2017 and $9.88 at December 31, 2016. Total assets at December 31, 2017 were a record $1.04 billion, an increase of $99.6 million, or 10.6%, from $940.2 million at December 31, 2016. Total loans as of December 31, 2017 were $850.9 million, an increase of $97.8 million, or 13.0%, from $753.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits as of December 31, 2017 were $861.6 million, an increase of $85.0 million, or 10.9%, compared with $776.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nManagement Commentary\nWilliam D. Moss, President and CEO, stated, “The Company achieved exceptional loan and deposit growth in the fourth quarter, which fueled a strong finish to the year and provides a very strong base for 2018. Commercial real estate loans remain the strongest catalyst for this growth, as we benefited from a robust loan pipeline across our geographic footprint. The fee income contributions from both our SBA and mortgage business lines were strong throughout 2017, reflected in a 21.1% and 36.2% increase, respectively. We are pleased to have exceeded the $1.0 billion mark in assets during the year, and expect earnings to benefit by loan growth in future quarters, along with the positive impact of the lower tax rate.”\nDividend Information\nOn January 17, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.045 per share, payable on February 28, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2018. This marks the 20 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, which is in addition to the 5% stock dividend paid in February 2017.\nKey Quarterly Performance Metrics\n4 th Qtr.\n3 rd Qtr.\n2 nd Qtr.\n1 st Qtr.\n4 th Qtr.\n12 Mo.\nEnded\n12 Mo.\nEnded\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2016\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nNet Income (in thousands) $ 335 $ 2,237 $ 2,128 $ 1,802 $ 2,567 $ 6,502 $ 8,631 Earnings per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.04 $ 0.26 $ 0.25 $ 0.21 $ 0.30 $ 0.75 $ 1.01 Return on Average Assets 0.13 % 0.89 % 0.87 % 0.76 % 1.08 % 0.66 % 0.96 % Return on Average Tangible Assets (1) 0.13 % 0.91 % 0.88 % 0.77 % 1.10 % 0.67 % 0.98 % Return on Average Equity 1.24 % 8.39 % 8.26 % 7.18 % 10.25 % 6.22 % 8.94 % Return on Average Tangible Equity (1) 1.49 % 10.13 % 10.01 % 8.74 % 12.53 % 7.52 % 11.00 % Net Interest Margin 3.56 % 3.62 % 3.49 % 3.45 % 3.43 % 3.53 % 3.53 % Non-Performing Assets to Total Assets 0.20 % 0.23 % 0.32 % 0.18 % 0.19 % 0.20 % 0.19 % Allowance as a % of Loans 1.25 % 1.25 % 1.25 % 1.25 % 1.27 % 1.25 % 1.27 % (1) Non-GAAP Financial Information.

Loan Composition\nThe components of the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\n(in thousands) December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016 Commercial and industrial $ 101,371 $ 93,697 Real estate – construction 118,094 111,914 Real estate – commercial 537,733 460,685 Real estate – residential 64,238 59,065 Consumer 30,203 28,279 Unearned fees (765 ) (548 ) 850,874 753,092 Allowance for loan losses (10,668 ) (9,565 ) Net Loans $ 840,206 $ 743,527 Deposit Composition\nThe components of the Company’s deposits at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\n(in thousands) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Non-interest-bearing $ 167,297 $ 160,104 NOW accounts 232,673 152,771 Savings deposits 242,448 261,438 Money market deposits 59,818 62,495 Listed service CD’s 44,436 47,648 Time deposits / IRA 74,183 56,489 Wholesale deposits 40,702 35,622 Total Deposits $ 861,557 $ 776,567 2017 Fourth Quarter and Year End Financial Review\nNet Income\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $335,000, or $0.04 per diluted common share, compared to $2.57 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share, for the same period last year. The decrease in net income was largely the result of the previously mentioned $1.78 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, write-down of the Company’s deferred tax asset from 34% to 21%, which will be the Company’s new corporate tax rate beginning in 2018. Additionally, the provision for loan losses was $675,000 for the quarter due to strong loan growth, compared to a loan loss recovery of $345,000 in the same prior year period, which was the result of a recovery related to a credit previously charged off.\nOn a linked quarter basis, fourth quarter 2017 net income decreased to $335,000 from $2.24 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $6.50 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $8.63 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the same prior year period. Excluding the effect of the previously mentioned deferred tax asset writedown in 2017 and the BOLI death benefit in 2016, net income increased 6.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $8.53 million, an increase of 12.3% compared to $7.59 million in the corresponding prior year period. This increase was largely due to an increase of $71.6 million, or 8.4%, in total interest earning assets, primarily attributable to growth in the loan portfolio. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased $113,000, or 1.3%, from $8.42 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased 10.4% to $32.5 million from $29.5 million in the prior year.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe Company reported a net interest margin of 3.56% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.62% in the third quarter of 2017 and 3.43% reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. The margin improvement from the prior year was primarily the result of slightly higher yielding interest-earning assets coupled with a higher level of average core checking deposits.\nNet interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.53%, unchanged from the prior year.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $1.34 million, a decrease of $104,000, or 7.19%, compared to the same period in 2016. The Company reported lower loan fees and, to a lesser extent, lower gains from the sale of SBA loans. Residential mortgage banking revenue was $325,000 during the quarter, as compared to $331,000 in the prior year period.\nOn a linked quarter basis, non-interest income decreased by $110,000 from the third quarter of 2017, mainly due to decreases in residential mortgage banking income and gains from the sale of SBA loans. Residential mortgage banking revenue decreased $33,000, or 9.2%, from $358,000 during the third quarter of 2017. Gains from the sale of SBA loans decreased $71,000, or 23.2%, from $306,000 during the third quarter of 2017 due to the timing of loan closings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income decreased slightly by $30,000, or 0.5%, to $5.46 million from the prior year due to the BOLI death benefit in 2016. Excluding this death benefit, non-interest income increased $832,000, or 18.0%. Mortgage banking revenue increased by 36.2% to $1.58 million, while gains from the sale of SBA loans increased 21.2% to $1.05 million.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5.92 million, an increase from the $5.36 million reported in same period in 2016, primarily due to a rise in salaries and employee benefits along with a one-time $144,000 expense recovery in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to a credit previously charged off. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense decreased $256,000, or 4.1%, from $6.18 million due to lower salaries and benefits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense increased $2.47 million, or 11.5%, to $23.9 million compared to the prior year. The increase in non-interest expense was largely attributable to a rise in salaries and employee benefits coupled with $394,000 of one-time expense recoveries in 2016 relating to both the settlement of an OREO property and the collection from the above-mentioned credit previously charged off.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nDuring the quarter, the Company expensed a $675,000 loan loss provision, compared to a loan loss recovery of $345,000 in the same prior year period. The loan loss provision was largely due to the $34.8 million of loan growth in the fourth quarter 2017. The Company had net charge-offs of approximately $230,000 for the period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, a loan loss provision of $1.53 million was expensed, compared to $515,000 for the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's allowance for loan losses was $10.67 million, compared to $9.57 million as of December 31, 2016. The loss allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.25% at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.27% at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Condition / Balance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company maintained capital ratios that were in excess of regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions. The Company's Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio was 8.85%, common equity Tier 1 to risk weighted assets ratio was 9.68%, Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 9.68%, and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 11.93%.\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2017 were $1.04 billion, an increase of 10.6% compared to $940.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal loans as of December 31, 2017 were $850.9 million, an increase of 13.0% compared to $753.1 million reported at December 31, 2016.\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2017 were $861.6 million, an increase of 10.9% compared to $776.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Core checking deposits at December 31, 2017 increased to $400.0 million, up $87.1 million, or 27.8%, from December 31, 2016.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company's non-performing assets at December 31, 2017 were $2.07 million compared to $2.35 million at September 30, 2017 and $1.81 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets to total assets at December 31, 2017 declined to 0.20%, compared to 0.23% at September 30, 2017, and remained relatively unchanged compared to 0.19% at December 31, 2016.\nNon-accrual loans decreased to $2.07 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.35 million at September 30, 2017, and increased from $1.55 million at December 31, 2016. There was no OREO at both December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, compared to OREO of $259,000 at December 31, 2016.\nTroubled debt restructured loan balances amounted to $7.05 million at December 31, 2017, with all but $994,000 performing. This compared to $8.05 million at September 30, 2017 and $8.23 million at December 31, 2016.\nAbout the Company\nTwo River Bancorp is the holding company for Two River Community Bank, which is headquartered in Tinton Falls, New Jersey.
