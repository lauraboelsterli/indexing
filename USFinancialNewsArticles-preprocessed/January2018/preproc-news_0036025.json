    "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A blogger has reported that Paychex founder and chairman B. Thomas Golisano is \"open\" to a merger with the Buffalo, N.Y.-based M&T Bank. There is no foundation in fact in this blogger's article. Golisano has never talked directly or indirectly with anyone, offered his opinion, or considered this merger. Anything of this nature would go through official Paychex channels as part of a comprehensive process that includes thorough review and consideration by the Paychex Board of Directors. This report is false.\nAbout Paychex\nPaychex, Inc. (NASDAQ: PAYX) is a leading provider of integrated human capital management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services.
