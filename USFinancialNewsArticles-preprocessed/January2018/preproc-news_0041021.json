    "text": "Costa Mesa, CA, Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- M Line Holdings, Inc. (OTC Pink: MLHC; \"M Line\" or the “Company”), announces that it has formed two new subsidiaries, M Line Coal Development, Inc., a Kentucky Corporation, and M Line Transportation, Inc., a Wyoming Corporation.\nM Line Coal Development, Inc. has been formed with the express intent to acquire permits for the mining and distribution of coal out of mines located in Kentucky. The Company is currently negotiating two permits with further opportunities coming available. The market for coal is excellent with the current local demand exceeding supply. More information will be provided as the transactions are completed.\nM Line Transportation, Inc. has been formed to manage the transportation of mined coal to its distribution points. M Line plans to have four trucks hauling some 40 tons of coal every two to three hours sixteen hours per day.
