    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 11:54 AM / Updated 31 minutes ago Police raid French rugby HQ in Laporte investigation - source Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Police raided the headquarters of the French Rugby Federation (FFR) on Tuesday as part of an investigation into alleged conflict of interest involving the federation’s president Bernard Laporte, a source close to the matter said. \nThe police search was first reported by the L‘Equipe newspaper. The source confirmed the operation and said Laporte’s home had also been searched. \nLaporte, a former France coach and sports minister, denies allegations he put pressure on the rugby federation’s appeals board to reduce sanctions against Top 14 side Montpellier. \nMontpellier are owned by Syrian-born scaffolding billionaire Mohad Altrad, with whom Laporte’s company BL Communication had a business relationship. \nCalls to the rugby federation’s spokeswoman went unanswered, and attempts by Reuters to contact an FFR official who worked with Laporte on promoting a bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup were also unsuccessful. \nAltrad’s eponymous business was a backer for that bid, which succeeded, and this month secured sponsorship rights for the French national rugby team’s shirt in a five-year 35 million euro deal. \nThere was no immediate reaction to the raids from Laporte.
