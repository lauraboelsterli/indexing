    "text": "CNBC.com David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images \nJefferies analysts have isolated their top stock picks for 2018, assembling a master list of favorite ideas for their clients. \nCompiling thoughts from over 20 analysts, Jefferies highlighted \"a number of less obvious, less well performing, turnaround-type stocks that ascended the ranks.\" \n\"All of the selected stocks have one thing in common as far as Jefferies analysts are concerned â€“operationally, things can get better from here,\" the team's Wednesday report read. \"Some have seen recent improvements, some have seen recent setbacks, but in all cases, there is a path to greater things driven by factors other than just tax.\" \nThe team mentioned dozens of equities that fit their criteria, complete with price targets and analyst theses. \nHere are some of the stocks Jefferies selected for their upside potential in the next year.",
