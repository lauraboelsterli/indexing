Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports \nTeenager Tennell, who was nearly flawless in her free skate programme on Friday, will be joined by Mirai Nagasu and fellow teen Karen Chen as officials selected the top three finishers in their national championships at San Jose, California. \nAshley Wagner, who was controversially named to the 2014 Olympic team, again finished fourth and was selected first alternate. \nBoth Tennell, 19, and Chen, 18, will be participating in their first Olympics.

Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports \n“I‘m furious,” the 2016 world silver medallist told reporters. “I am absolutely furious. I know when I go and I lay it down and I absolutely left one jump on the table (turning a triple salchow into a single) but for me to put out two programmes that I did at this competition, as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.” \nThe 2018 Winter Games will take place Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea. \nU.S. Figure Skating will announce its men‘s, pairs and ice dance athletes on Sunday after the men’s and pairs competition the previous day.
