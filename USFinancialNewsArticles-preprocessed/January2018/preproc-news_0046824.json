    "text": "January 26, 2018 / 7:39 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago Sanchez to make first start for United in FA Cup clash at Yeovil Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez will make his debut for Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round at Yeovil Town, after being named in the starting line up on Friday. \nThe 29-year-old lines up for Jose Mourinho’s side having joined from Arsenal last week in a swap deal involving Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mykhitaryan. \nSanchez was not in the squad for Arsenal’s third round exit to Nottingham Forest earlier this month, so therefore avoided being cup-tied for United. \nHe will be joined in attack by Marcus Rashford who takes the place of Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, while Sergio Romero also gets a rare start in goal taking the place of David de Gea.
