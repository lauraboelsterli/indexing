Not on the back of any news, but just on the back of folks having sizeable positions already in place.”\nBorthwick added that traders are feeling some uncertainty going into this week’s Fed meeting.\n“Depending on the new Fed leadership, which is being run now by (Jerome) Powell, the market is concerned about whether we’re going to see continued rate rises at the current velocity that’s expected or whether it’s going to be increased somewhat,” he said.\nReuters data points to market expectations of about three more Fed rate hikes this year, starting in March, although some analysts, including at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Asset Management, expect the Fed to raise four times.\nTraders also are awaiting a U.S. Department of Labor report, set to be released on Friday, that will include data on nonfarm payrolls, average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate.\nOn Monday a Commerce Department report said U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in December, but savings dropped to a 10-year low. The dollar increased marginally after the report.\nData on Friday showed U.S economic growth accelerated to 2.3 percent in 2017, faster than the 1.5 percent logged in 2016, although growth in the December quarter slowed on a sequential basis and was below market expectations.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gave U.S. currency bears a major boost last week with a tacit endorsement of a weak dollar. While U.S. President Donald Trump, who has advocated a strong dollar, tried to minimize those comments, the remarks had already made an impact and the greenback’s downturn since November showed little sign of abating.\nU.S. Treasury yields surged to more than three-year highs on Monday after comments from a European Central Bank official added to expectations that central banks globally will reduce stimulus as the economic outlook improves. The 10-year yield rose to 2.71 percent, its highest since early 2014.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ",
