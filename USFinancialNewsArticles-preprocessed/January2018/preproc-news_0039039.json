    "text": "Scientists have developed a soft pinworm-sized robot that can walk, roll, jump, swim and even transport tiny cargo, in a step toward eventually putting robots to work inside the human body.\nThe robot, a tiny rectangular sheet approximately four millimeters long and one millimeter wide, is made of silicone rubber and embedded with magnetic particles. The researchers, who described their work on Wednesday in the journal Nature, maneuvered the bot with an external magnetic control.\n... ",
