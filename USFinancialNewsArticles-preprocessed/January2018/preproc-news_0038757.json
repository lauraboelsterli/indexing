    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and forecast higher profit for the full year on Wednesday, benefiting from a record year for the commercial jet market.\nBoeing Co ( BA.N ) said earlier this month it delivered an industry-record 763 jetliners in 2017, and both it and European rival Airbus ( AIR.PA ) reported gross orders for more than 1,000 planes last year.\nSales in United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney unit, which makes aircraft engines, were up 11.7 percent, while aerospace systems sales, which include engine parts and aircraft lighting, rose 5.7 percent.\nEven as it gains from the surge in aircraft demand, the company is trying to speed up production of its fuel-saving turbofan engines that power Airbus’ newest narrow-body jet, the A320neo, and Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft.\nThe production ramp is expected to result in $1.1 billion worth of engine margin losses in 2018, the company said.\nThe company, which also makes Otis Elevators, forecast full year adjusted earnings in the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share, up 3 percent to 6.8 percent from a year earlier. The midpoint of that range came in slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $7.00 per share.\nIts sales forecast of $62.5 billion to $64.0 billion, while analysts’ were expecting $63.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company’s shares, up 23.3 percent in the past 12 months, were little changed at $135.75 in premarket trading.\nChief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters on Wednesday that the company expects to quickly repatriate $2 billion in overseas cash under the new U.S. tax law.\nThe latest quarter included a 90-cent charge related to the new U.S. tax law. UTC expects to make net cash payment of $1.5 billion through 2026, and use the tax windfall partly to reduce borrowing for its acquisition of Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ).\nFor the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7 percent to $15.68 billion, topping Wall Street’s expectation of $15.40 billion.\nThe company’s income from continuing operations attributable to common share owners fell to $397 million, or 50 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, UTC earned $1.60 per share, higher than the $1.56 per share expected by analysts.\nRelated Coverage United Tech to quickly repatriate $2 bln under new tax law: CFO Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Alwyn Scott in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
