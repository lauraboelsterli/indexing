    "text": "MONROE, Mich., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MBT Financial Corp., (Nasdaq:MBTF), the parent company of Monroe Bank & Trust, reported a preliminary net loss of $144,000 ($0.01 per share), in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a profit of $3,578,000 ($0.16 per share, basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2016. The profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $10,609,000, compared to $14,501,000 for 2016. The Company recorded Federal income Tax Expense of $5,559,000 in the fourth quarter, which included $4,278,000 to adjust the value of its deferred tax assets following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. When adjusting for non-recurring items such as negative loan loss provisions, gains and losses on securities, a life insurance benefit, and an adjustment to the wealth management fee income accrual, the adjusted operating income for 2017 was $19,509,000, an increase of 18.4% compared to $16,472,000 earned in 2016.\nIn addition, the Company announced that it will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per common share and a special dividend of $0.60 per common share. The dividends will be paid as a single distribution on February 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2018. This is compared to the quarterly dividend of $0.05 and special dividend of $0.70 paid in the same quarter last year.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2 million shares of its common stock. This represents 8.7% of the shares currently outstanding. Repurchases may be conducted from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The authorization commences February 1, 2018 and expires January 31, 2020. The authorization replaces a two year authorization to repurchase up to 2 million shares that is set to expire on January 31, 2018. During that authorization, 192,080 shares were repurchased.\nThe Net Interest Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $799,000, or 8.3% as the net interest margin improved from 3.14% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 3.43% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher interest rates and growth in the loan portfolio.\nThe provision for loan losses was a negative expense of $500,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $500,000 compared to last year’s fourth quarter, when we recorded a negative expense of $1,000,000. Asset quality and historical loss ratios improved, but the growth in the loan portfolio reduced the size of the negative provision expense required to adjust the Allowance for Loan Losses. Total Loans increased $42.4 million, or 6.5% during 2017, while the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses was reduced from $8.5 million, or 1.30% of loans to a still relatively strong $7.7 million, or 1.10%.\nNon-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $148,000, or 3.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding gains and losses on securities and ORE transactions in both periods and a gain from life insurance proceeds that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, the non-interest income increased $46,000, or 1.2%. Non-interest expense decreased $154,000, or 1.7%, as a $532,000 decrease in salaries and benefits was partially offset by increases in equipment expense and professional fees.\nTotal assets of the company decreased $9.9 million, or 0.7%, compared to December 31, 2016, to $1.35 billion. Capital decreased $8.5 million during the year as the payment of the special and regular dividends exceeded the net income. The ratio of equity to assets decreased from 10.40% at the end of 2016 to 9.84% at the end of 2017. The Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage ratio decreased from 10.75% as of December 31, 2016 to 10.33 % as of December 31, 2017.\nH. Douglas Chaffin, President and CEO, commented, “We continue to see solid loan growth, and the improvement in net interest margin combined with well-controlled non-interest expenses contributed to improved core earnings this year. Our new business pipeline remains strong and we expect loan growth to continue in 2018, which should lead to further margin improvement. Notably, we also expect credit quality to remain strong, as we see nothing that might inhibit our strong quality metrics in the near term. Our focus on managing our capital has also allowed us to bring more value to our shareholders, through the regular and special dividends and the repurchase authorization we announced today. We will continue to keep our eyes open for the right opportunities to grow through strategic acquisitions, while remaining disciplined in that regard. We remain confident in our ability to maintain our position as the premier independent provider of financial services in the communities we serve.”\nConference Call\nMBT Financial Corp. will hold a conference call to discuss the Fourth Quarter 2017 results on Friday, January 26, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
