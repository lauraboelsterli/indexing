    "text": " 57 AM / Updated 8 minutes ago Head of security at Mexican refinery shot dead Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of security at one of Mexico’s six state-run oil refineries was shot dead on Thursday, becoming the latest victim of violent crime that has seeped into the industry. \nState prosecutors in the central state of Guanajuato said Tadeo Lineol Alfonzo was killed in the city of Salamanca, home to one of the refineries operated by state oil firm Pemex. \nDrug cartels seeking to diversify income streams have preyed upon Salamanca and other refineries, making fuel theft one of Mexico’s most pressing security dilemmas, sapping more than $1 billion in revenue from state coffers annually. \nLocal media said that two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle shot Alfonzo in his car early on Thursday as he was taking two of his children to school. The prosecutors’ office said it is investigating the case to identify the culprits. \nWorkers at Mexican refineries are targeted by the criminal gangs, and sources familiar with the situation in Salamanca said Alfonzo had received threats before his death. \nSeveral Pemex workers have been killed in the city in recent years. \nPemex condemned the killing in a statement, and the company’s chief executive officer Carlos Trevino expressed his condolences about the loss of Alfonzo. \nThis week Reuters published an investigation into fuel theft and the problems it is causing in Mexico, which has sought to increase foreign investment by opening up the long-closed oil and gas industry to private firms. \nGuanajuato, a centre of industry in Latin America’s no. 2 economy, has recently suffered a substantial increase in murders, which hit a record high in Mexico in 2017.
