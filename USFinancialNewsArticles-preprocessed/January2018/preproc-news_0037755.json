    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse has launched an index that tracks companies that are leaders in artificial intelligence (AI) by using an algorithm to identify early adopters of the technology.\nCompanies in the index include Apple, Deutsche Telekom, Bank of America and Facebook, the German stock exchange operator said on Monday.\nIt said it had found a way to identify AI-related patent filings to select the 200 companies that compose the index, called the AI STOXX Global Artificial Intelligence Index.\nThe patents are an early indicator of AI innovators and the index, the first of its kind, will help index-tracking funds interested in companies focused on artificial intelligence, Deutsche Boerse said.\n“Today’s early adopters are set to be tomorrow’s AI leaders,” Matteo Andreetto, chief executive of Deutsche Boerse’s index business STOXX, said in a statement. “Investors need solutions to discern hype from a real opportunity.”\nDeutsche Boerse, which announced the index at an exchange-trade fund conference in the United States, has partnered with Yewno, an AI company based in Redwood City, California, to create the index.\nDeutsche Boerse’s Stoxx unit operates more than 7,500 indexes, including the Euro Stoxx 50.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
