Apart from that, the earnings numbers did not have any major surprises, specifically any negative ones to breach the ongoing positive momentum,” said Anand James, chief market strategist at Geojit Financial Services.\n“Whatever has come in till now, say, IT company results or private sector bank results such as South Indian Bank Ltd and IndusInd Bank Ltd, the numbers are largely in line with expectations.”\nMarkets are waiting for more corporate results to flow in to see signs of recovery after the goods and services tax and the withdrawal of high-value bank notes, he added.\nRefiners advanced on the back of weaker oil prices. Reliance Industries gained 1.5 percent, while Indian Oil Corp Ltd rose 0.8 percent.\nLenders also rose, with ICICI Bank up 1.2 percent and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd gaining 0.6 percent.\nMeanwhile, IT stocks slipped, with the NSE IT index down for the first time in seven sessions.\nTata Consultancy Services Ltd shed 1.4 percent after posting its third straight dip in quarterly net profit.\nMeanwhile, Dish TV India Ltd fell to a seven-week low after it said it was evaluating the impact of insolvency proceedings against certain entities of Videocon Group on its merger deal with Videocon d2h Ltd.
