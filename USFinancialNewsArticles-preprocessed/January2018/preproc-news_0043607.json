    "text": "MATTOON, Ill., First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FMBH) (the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the quarter and full year period ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nRecord Fourth Quarter Loan Growth of $71.9 million, or 3.9% Announced the Acquisition of First BancTrust Corporation on December 11, 2017 Net Income of $4.6 million, or $0.37 Diluted Earnings per Share Deferred Tax Asset Impairment of $1.4 million, or $0.11 per Share\n“I am pleased with our strong year of operating and financial results in what was a very successful 2017,” said Joe Dively, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We ended the year with a record quarter of loan growth providing a great start to 2018. Similar to most in the industry, our fourth quarter net income was negatively impacted by a deferred tax asset impairment tied to the new tax law that was signed in December. In addition, the strong loan growth, combined with the impairment of two credits, contributed to an elevated provision expense. Looking ahead to 2018, the outlook for growth is positive for both organic and M&A activity.”\n“The announcement of the acquisition of First BancTrust Corporation (“First Bank”) continues our strategic initiative to deepen and expand our presence in attractive markets and increase shareholder value. First Bank is a highly respected community bank in the Champaign-Urbana and surrounding markets and is a great cultural fit with First Mid. We see significant benefits with the opportunities to introduce new services to First Bank’s customers and a higher combined legal lending limit. I’m excited about what lies ahead for the combined organizations and how we can be better together,” Dively concluded.\nFirst BancTrust Corp. Acquisition Update\nOn December 11, 2017, the Company announced the acquisition of First Bank. First Bank is a $466 million asset financial services holding company headquartered in Champaign, IL. Subject to regulatory approvals, the Company currently expects to close on the acquisition in the second quarter with a merger of the banks in the third quarter. The Company has submitted all of its initial regulatory applications and filed the registration statement related to the acquisition on January 22, 2018.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $0.6 million, or 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $0.8 million in accelerated accretion income recognized in the fourth quarter versus $0.1 million in the third quarter. Regular accretion tied to the First Clover Leaf acquisition was $0.5 million in each quarter. Excluding accretion, increases to the loan income were offset by higher deposit costs and lower investment income tied to a lower balance in the portfolio.\nIn comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016, net interest income increased by $2.0 million, or 9.1%. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in earning assets and increased interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit costs.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.72% for the fourth quarter compared to 3.68% in the prior quarter and 3.43% in the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in the ratio was due to higher yields on loans and investments, which outpaced the increase in cost of funds. In addition, accretion income associated with the First Clover Leaf acquisition helped drive the margin higher. On a full year basis, the net interest margin for 2017 was 3.70% compared to 3.39% for 2016.\nLoan Portfolio\nTotal loans increased by $71.9 million, or 3.9%, in the quarter and ended at $1.94 billion compared to $1.87 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The increase was mostly in the categories of commercial real estate and construction and land development. Loans increased by $113.5 million, or 6.2% for the year.\nThe Company has launched a loan production office in the Indianapolis, Indiana metro market and is off to a strong start. This step continues the strategic focus of the organization on maintaining a diversified geographic footprint and loan portfolio.\nAsset Quality\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming loans were 0.90% of total loans compared to 1.06% at September 30, 2017, allowance for loan losses were 1.03% of total loans compared to 1.00%, and the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans were 114.1% versus 93.9%. Non-performing loans were $17.5 million, which was a decrease of $2.3 million versus the prior quarter.\nNet charge-offs were $1.0 million during the fourth quarter compared to $1.1 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter number included one credit in the construction industry that was charged off for a total of $0.9 million. In addition, the company recorded an impairment of approximately $0.5 million on a financial services credit. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.4 million during the fourth quarter compared to $1.5 million during the third quarter of 2017 and $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits ended the quarter at $2.27 billion, which represented an increase of $57.2 million from the prior quarter and a decrease of $55.2 million from the same quarter last year. The Company’s average rate on cost of funds was 0.29% for the quarter compared to 0.28% in the third quarter and 0.23% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s core deposit franchise continues to be a differentiator and strategic advantage for First Mid.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.2 million compared to $7.7 million in the third quarter. The previous quarter included a $0.5 million benefit from a BOLI claim. In addition, the fourth quarter securities gains were lower by $0.2 million compared to the prior quarter. Excluding these items, noninterest income increased in the fourth quarter by $0.2 million with increases across multiple categories. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income increased $0.3 million. The Company has continued to gain momentum in the former First Clover Leaf markets with its cross selling initiatives in the insurance and wealth management divisions.\nNoninterest Expenses\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter totaled $19.2 million, or $1.3 million higher than the previous quarter. During the quarter, the Company recorded a $0.5 million loss on the sale of a former First Clover Leaf credit. The quarter also included approximately $0.4 million of additional stock compensation expense for the acceleration of shares pursuant to the 8-K that was filed on December 19, 2017. In addition, the quarter included $0.1 million in acquisition related costs.\nNoninterest expense increased by $2.3 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to a combination of higher legal and professional fees, the loss on the sale of a loan and accelerated stock compensation expense. The Company’s efficiency ratio, on a tax equivalent basis, for the fourth quarter 2017 was 59.1% compared to 55.7% for the same period last year.\nRegulatory Capital Levels\nThe Company’s capital levels remained strong above the “well capitalized” levels and ended the period as follows:\nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets 12.70%\nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 11.83%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.78%\nLeverage ratio 9.91%\nThe capital ratios declined in the fourth quarter due to the recognition of the DTA and the strong loan growth, which drove a higher capital allocation on risk-weighted assets.\nCapital Raise\nUnder the previously announced ‘at-the-market’ equity offering, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold 3,400 common shares at a weighted average price of approximately $36.97, representing gross proceeds of $0.1 million and net proceeds of $0.1 million.\nAbout First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc.: First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. is the parent company of First Mid-Illinois Bank & Trust, N.A.
