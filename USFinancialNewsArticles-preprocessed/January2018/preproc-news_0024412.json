REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo \n“The German economy is experiencing a strong upturn,” the ministry said, though it added: “At the end of 2017 the strong economic dynamics probably weakened a bit.” \nData published on Thursday showed the German economy grew by 2.2 percent last year, its strongest rate of expansion since 2011, with consumer spending - boosted by ultra-low borrowing costs, record high employment and rising wages - providing the biggest impetus.
