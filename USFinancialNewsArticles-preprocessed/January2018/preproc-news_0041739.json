    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 12:22 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Syrians with temporary U.S. protection brace for Trump decision Yeganeh Torbati 5 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Targeted by the Syrian government after providing humanitarian supplies to civilians fleeing air strikes, Mohammad Alala and his wife escaped in 2012, eventually obtaining student visas to enter the United States. \nThey received a form of temporary protected status (TPS) extended to Syrians in the United States because of Syria’s civil war. After moving to Florida, Alala found work as an engineer and his wife, Dania Kassas, enrolled in graduate school. \nNow, the couple’s ability to remain in the United States legally is uncertain. Their asylum claims are unresolved and TPS for Syrians will expire at the end of March unless the Department of Homeland Security decides to extend it. \nThe decision, due by Jan. 30, will affect some 6,000 Syrians. If their status is withdrawn, they could lose the ability to work in the United States and face possible deportation back to Syria, where the war rages into a seventh year. \nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has demonstrated deep scepticism towards TPS, a programme established by Congress in 1990 to provide temporary reprieve for immigrants whose home countries face disaster or conflict. \nSince Trump took office, DHS has announced an end to protections for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. It has extended the protection for South Sudanese, and deferred a decision on Hondurans to later this year. \nAdministration officials have criticized previous presidents for leaving the status in place long after the crises that prompted it were over. \nStephen Yale-Loehr, a law professor at Cornell University, said the decision on Syria could indicate whether the administration dislikes the entire concept of TPS or simply thinks it was too leniently renewed in the past. \n“If the administration wants to make it known that they are considering whether to extend TPS on a case-by-case basis, Syria presents a much clearer case why it should be extended,” Yale-Loehr said. If they rescind the protection for Syrians, “then it signals that they think the concept and philosophy of TPS is unwarranted.” \nA DHS spokesman said the administration has not made a decision on Syria’s TPS, which was put in place in 2012, the year after the war began.

REUTERS/Saul Martinez \nSome groups traditionally critical of the programme are holding back in Syria’s case. Roy Beck, president of Numbers USA, which favours immigration restrictions, said the group has not taken an official position on whether TPS for Syrians should be rescinded. The group supported ending protections for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras. \n‘DANGEROUS SIGNAL’ \nAlala said he came under suspicion from the government of President Bashar al-Assad when he refused to participate in pro-government rallies. He also quietly helped families fleeing government air strikes with humanitarian aid. \nAlala and his family are awaiting a decision on their asylum application, which they made in 2013. In the meantime, he dreads the prospect of being sent back.
