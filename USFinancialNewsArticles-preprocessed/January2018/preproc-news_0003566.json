(OTCQX:FFHD) (“FirstAtlantic”), the parent company of FirstAtlantic Bank, with and into NCC. Concurrently with the merger, FirstAtlantic Bank merged with and into NBC, but its offices will continue to operate under the “FirstAtlantic Bank” trade name, and its management team will continue with NBC.\n“We are extremely pleased to partner with the team at FirstAtlantic,” said Richard Murray, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer of NCC. “Mitch Hunt and his team have built a great bank, and we believe they are an excellent fit for our company. We welcome the clients, shareowners and employees of FirstAtlantic Bank to NCC. We look forward to working together with Mitch and Paul Grube as they lead our growth in the greater Jacksonville market.”\nMitchell W.
