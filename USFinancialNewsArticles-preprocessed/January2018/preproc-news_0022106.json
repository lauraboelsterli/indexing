    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA ) and Plains GP Holdings (NYSE: PAGP ) today announced their quarterly distributions with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPAA announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per common unit ($1.20 per unit on an annualized basis), which is unchanged from the distribution paid in November 2017. PAGP announced a corresponding quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per Class A share ($1.20 per Class A share on an annualized basis), which is unchanged from the distribution paid in November 2017. With respect to PAA’s Series A Preferred Units, PAA announced a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) of the quarterly distribution, which will result in the issuance of an additional 1,393,926 Series A Preferred Units. The PIK amount equates to a quarterly distribution of $0.525 per Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.10 annualized. These distributions will be payable on February 14, 2018 to holders of record of each security at the close of business on January 31, 2018.\nThe PAGP cash distribution is expected to be a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of a Class A Shareholder’s tax basis in each PAGP Class A Share and a reduction in the tax basis of that Class A Share. To the extent any cash distribution exceeds a Class A Shareholder’s tax basis, it should be taxable as capital gains.\nPlains All American Pipeline, L.P. is a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and provides logistics services for crude oil, natural gas liquids (\"NGL\"), and natural gas.
