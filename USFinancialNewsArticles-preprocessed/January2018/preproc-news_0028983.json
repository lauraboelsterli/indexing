Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net STOXX 600 - ENJOY THE MOMENTUM WHILE YOU CAN (1121 GMT) The economic momentum which has driven the STOXX 600 up to 400 points is set to fade in the next couple of months, meaning the pan-European index should settle on a downward path, Deutsche Bank reckons. \"Accelerating growth momentum has done wonders for European asset prices over the past 18 months, but we expect this acceleration to start reversing over the coming months,\" Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at Deutsche Bank just told us. \"We project the fair-value level for the Stoxx 600 declining from around 410 at the moment to around 370 by mid-year\", he said. With December's euro zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 60.6, the highest since the survey began in June 1997, there isn't much room left for the pace to improve further and DB expects it to decline this month. \"When the Euro area PMI is above 56, PMI momentum is rarely positive over the following six months\", Raedler said, explaining that \"it's not the level of growth that matters for equities, but the rate of change of growth, i.e. whether growth is accelerating or decelerating\". Based on this model, Deutsche has been \"tactically neutral\" on the STOXX 600 since September while most of its peers generally take a more optimistic view. Here's their chart : (Julien Ponthus) EURO ZONE STOCKS LOOK PAST FX STRENGTH, HITTING 10-YEAR HIGH (1015 GMT) Deutsche Bank may be bearish on euro zone stocks because of the single currency's strength but the market appears to be going in another direction: the euro zone's STOXX benchmark index has just risen to its highest level in 10 years. A number of analysts and fund managers are very upbeat on euro zone equities because of their cheap valuations relative to the U.S., an economic recovery that gets stronger and stronger and the underlying quality of company earnings. That is boosting confidence euro zone stocks could outperform Wall Street in 2018 and catch up with stellar gains seen across the pond. Strength in the euro could surely reduce competitiveness in the region but at the same time it also reduces its import costs. (Danilo Masoni) SEMIS: IN CHIP SHAPE (0951 GMT) You'd think European semiconductor stocks wouldn't have much impetus for going higher given the gains we saw last year: ASML, AMS, Infineon and STMicro rose between 36 and 208 percent in 2017. But the tech sector is once again outstripping the STOXX even this early in the year, while this week's results from ASML and subsequent 5 percent rise in its shares plus broker upgrades suggest that there is further strength in these stocks, defying Morgan Stanley's view in their November note \"Global Technology: Time for a Pause\". Marcus Morris-Eyton, European equities portfolio manager at Allianz, for whom ASML is a core holding, said that ASML's results and commentary illustrated the end market demand that semis are seeing at the moment. \"At the moment, (ASML are) in a beautiful place where their demand is outstripping their production so they are getting increasing demand from customers to bring forward some of their equipment,\" Morris-Eyton said. \"A company like ASML with their EUV technology - that will be the market-leading technology now for many, many years to come.\" Extreme Ultra Violet technology aims to make smaller and more powerful mobile devices. Morris-Eyton added that while he is confident for tech in 2018 and it remains his biggest sector, it is unlikely to see the same multiple expansion as in 2017. Allianz Global Investors are the biggest shareholder in Infineon, one of Morris-Eyton's top three positions. As you can see in the chart below, European tech firm valuations are approaching those of the U.S.: (Kit Rees) FURTHER EURO STRENGTH COULD DENT EARNINGS, SAYS DEUTSCHE (0943 GMT) With the euro rising again to a new 18-month high against the dollar, Deutsche Bank's forex strategists up their forecasts for the currency - which they say doesn't bode well for European earnings and could worsen the region's underperformance relative to the US. They've raised their year-end prediction for the trade-weighted index by 4 percent, implying 7 percent upside from current levels. Every 10 percent rise in the euro TWI reduces STOXX 600 EPS growth by 5 percentage points, they reckon. This could bring them closer to increasing their relative underweight Europe vs US equities, which we mentioned earlier this week. They see European EPS growing 2 percent this year, already significantly under the 9 percent consensus estimate. (Helen Reid) UK FIRMS UNDER THE COSH ONCE AGAIN (0836 GMT) It's a familiar story with Carpetright and Dignity - big falls after profit warnings, which has been the case this year with UK firms such as Mothercare, Countrywide and Debenhams. Inflationary pressures on consumers seem to be to blame, with Dignity caught in a price battle and forced to cut funeral prices, while Carpetright's sales in the post-Christmas period missed expectations. \"Again it's the same old story as with other brands that have failed to adapt to changing consumer trends – lower footfall has left transaction numbers down significantly from last year,\" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said in relation to Carpetright. \"We must also consider weaker consumer sentiment for big ticket items as a factor, as well tougher competition from a more diverse marketplace.\" Dignity is also in the top 20 most-shorted stocks in the UK, according to regulatory data. As you can see from the chart below, shares in both stocks have struggled over the past two years. (Kit Rees) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES NUDGE HIGHER, PROFIT WARNINGS DOMINATE UK STOCKS (0812 GMT) It's not a particularly strong open in Europe as gains for basic resources and defensive stocks only just outweigh losses among financials and energy. Likewise moves among individual stocks are limited to a range of between +3 to -3 percent on the STOXX, but elsewhere UK firms Dignity and Carpetright have just opened and slumped 41 percent and 48 percent respectively. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (0750 GMT) European shares are expected to open little changed at the end of a directionless week that has seen the top pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark steady around a 2 ½ year peak as confidence over economic and earnings growth helped consolidate a strong start of the year. In spite of the flat weekly performance EPFR Global said it was a good week for European equity funds with inflows into Sweden and the UK more than offsetting outflows from France and Italy.
