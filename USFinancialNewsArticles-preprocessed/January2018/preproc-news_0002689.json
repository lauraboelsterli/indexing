As the longest tenured employee of APB, Mike has unparalleled experience, a proven track record of excellence leading the design, development, and certification of all of APB's products, and extremely valuable relationships with both our suppliers and customers that have been forged over the past two decades. Mike knows where APB needs to go next and is best suited to lead us there,\" commented Joe Clark, Chairman of APB and CEO of Aviation Partners, Inc.\nThe planned departure of APB's prior CEO, Bill Ashworth, follows 6+ years of remarkable company performance continuing APB's status as one of the industry's most successful aircraft modification and FAA Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) companies.\n\"Leaving APB was a difficult decision,\" said Ashworth who joined the company in 2011. \"I am proud to have been associated with the APB team.
