Ivo Karlovic of Croatia shakes hands with Yuichi Sugita of Japan after Karlovic won their match. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nKarlovic faced four break points in the second game of the deciding set but saved all four, one with a second-serve ace. He then struck decisively in the 21st game of the set when he moved forward to force a forehand error from his opponent. \nHe completed victory a game later with a nerveless backhand volley and now sets his sights on another battle. Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne, Australia, January 17, 2018. Yuichi Sugita of Japan hits a shot against Ivo Karlovic of Croatia. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nKarlovic, a gentle giant off the court, said he still loved the combat and would keep playing as long as his serve keeps firing him to victories like Wednesday‘s. \n“I still like it, that’s why I‘m still here and doing it,” he said. “We’ll see how much longer I carry on.” \nTurning his thoughts to Seppi, he said he was prepared for another slog. \n“It’s going to be very tough because he returns unbelievably,” he said. “I will try to play my game and we will see. It’s going to be very hot and that will make my serve a little faster. But it will not be easy.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty/Nick Mulvenney",
