    "text": "SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Key Tronic Corporation (Nasdaq:KTCC), a provider of electronic manufacturing services (EMS), today announced its results for the quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, Key Tronic reported total revenue of $111.7 million, compared to $118.5 million in the same period of fiscal year 2017. For the first six months of fiscal year 2018, total revenue was $220.9 million, compared to $235.7 million in the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nAs a result of the U.S. corporate tax reform in December 2017, the GAAP results for the second quarter of 2018 were impacted by discrete charges for unrepatriated overseas earnings and a write-down of certain deferred tax assets related to U.S. tax reform and an adjustment relating to foreign exchange totaling approximately $1.1 million in tax expense or $0.10 per share. In coming quarters, the Company will benefit from the tax reform through a reduction in its estimated effective tax rate from 25% to 20%.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company had a net loss of approximately $0.2 million or $(0.02) per share, compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, excluding the impact of the discrete tax adjustments, net income was approximately $0.9 million or $0.08 per share, compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nFor the first six months of fiscal year 2018, net income was $0.2 million or $0.02 per share, compared to net income of $3.3 million or $0.30 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2017. For the first six months of fiscal year 2018, excluding the impact of the discrete tax adjustments that occurred during the second quarter, net income was approximately $1.3 million or $0.12 per share, compared to net income of $3.3 million or $0.30 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2017.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, gross margin was 7.9% and operating margin was 1.5%, compared to 8.1% and 2.1%, respectively, in the same period of fiscal 2017.\n“New programs continue to ramp and we have continued to win significant new business from EMS competitors, including two new programs involving products for new and established customers in IoT for consumers and commercial applications,” said Craig Gates, President and Chief Executive Officer. “While changes in the U.S. corporate tax law may have caused a net loss in the second quarter, we expect to benefit by paying less taxes in the U.S. under the new law in coming periods.”\n“Moving into the third quarter, we continue to see a strong pipeline of potential new business and our new programs continue to ramp. Recent customer wins are expected to contribute to sales growth in coming quarters. The details of the manufacturing ramp discussed last quarter relating to a consumer security product are yet to be finalized.”\nDuring the third quarter, the Company anticipates charges of approximately $0.7 million for legal expenses in connection with a binding arbitration hearing relating to roughly $10 million of purchased and paid inventory and receivables due from a former customer. In addition to the inventory at issue in the arbitration, the Company is pursuing reimbursement for certain cancellation fees and other carrying costs already expensed but believed to be contractually due from the former customer. The Company has not accrued for any outcomes related to this claim which could result in a one-time gain or loss. Legal costs are being expensed as incurred. The ultimate disposition of this matter is unknown and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n“We will also be incurring approximately $0.5 million for severance costs related to streamlining our facilities in Mexico during the third quarter as we expect that recently won new programs will require less labor content. We expect these changes to reduce our overall Mexican facility expenses by approximately 9% in our fourth quarter and beyond. Moreover, our U.S. facilities are proving to be increasingly profitable. While we are carefully managing our expenses, our investments in SMT, sheet metal and plastic molding capabilities in Mexico, China and the U.S. are expected to enable planned future growth.”\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to report revenue in the range of $110 million to $115 million, and earnings in the range of break-even to $0.05 per diluted share. These expected results assume the legal fees and severance costs discussed above with an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter.\nConference Call\nKey Tronic will host a conference call today to discuss its financial results at 2:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Eastern).
