    "text": "1 Hour Ago | 14:27 \nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake commanded the Senate floor on Wednesday to deliver a much-anticipated speech directly attacking President Donald Trump and the White House for launching an \"unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press.\" \nThis is not the first time Flake has discussed principles and the state of America under Trump from the Senate podium. After announcing that he would not run for re-election in October, Flake took to the chamber to give remarks about \"the state of our disunion\" in America. \nIn Wednesday's speech, Flake defended on the principles of truth and free expression, and warned of a creeping authoritarianism around the world. \nRead the full speech below: \nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident...\" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America. \nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\" During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan's proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history. \nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last. \n2017 was a year which saw the truth – objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \"alternative facts\" into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \"The enemy of the people,\" was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017. \nMr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \"enemy of the people,\" that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \"annihilating such individuals\" who disagreed with the supreme leader. \nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president's party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward – despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot's enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn't suit him \"fake news,\" it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press. \nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \"fake news\" are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice. \nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \"false news\" charges. \nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president's time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful – in fact, we question the powerful most ardently – to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality. \nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it. \nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don't. \nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism – who must constantly deflect and distort and distract – who must find someone else to blame — is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger. \nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \"most corrupt and dishonest\" media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are. \nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism. \nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction. \nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial – such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year's inaugural. \nBut many untruths are not at all trivial – such as the seminal untruth of the president's political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate – to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing unt",
