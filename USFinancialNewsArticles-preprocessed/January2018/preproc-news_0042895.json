    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sonic Corp. (NASDAQ:SONC), the nation's largest chain of drive-in restaurants, today announced that certain of its subsidiaries (the “Co-Issuers”) have priced $170 million of Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes (\"Senior Notes\"). The Senior Notes will have an expected life of seven years and bear interest at 4.026% per annum, payable monthly.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes will be used to repay in full the amount drawn on the Series 2016-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes”), together with related fees and expenses. The Co-Issuers will retain $100 million in undrawn capacity on the Variable Funding Notes. Sonic Corp. expects the Senior Notes and Variable Funding Notes transactions to close on February 1, 2018.\nThe Co-Issuers are indirect subsidiaries of Sonic Corp. that own substantially all of the Sonic system's franchising assets and real estate. The servicing and repayment of the Senior Notes will be made solely from the cash flows derived from these indirect subsidiaries' assets. Neither Sonic Corp., the ultimate parent of each of the subsidiaries involved in the securitization, nor any other subsidiary of Sonic Corp., will be liable for any obligations under the Senior Notes.\nThe Senior Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Senior Notes.\nAbout Sonic\nSONIC, America's Drive-In is the nation's largest drive-in restaurant chain serving approximately 3 million customers every day.
