    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Logikcull.com , the San Francisco-based technology company that helps legal professionals instantly find evidence, today announced that it has hired cloud software executive Patrick Barry as Chief Operating Officer.\nIn this role, Barry will guide Logikcull’s go-to-market strategy as it pursues its mission to reduce the cost and risk inherent in litigation, and democratize discovery.\nOver his more than 20-year technology career, Barry has managed and grown organizations across all functions and stages. He comes to Logikcull to lead the scaling of the business team.\n“In Patrick, we are adding an individual with exceptional character, leadership ability, and talent,” Andy Wilson, Logikcull CEO, said. “His experience and guidance will be crucial as we continue to develop the people, processes and platforms needed to grow a world-class company.”\nBarry is leaving his SaaS operational consulting practice to join the company.

Having joined Demandforce as a startup, Patrick was the company’s CMO, leading marketing, business development and product through the scaling phase, ultimately resulting in Intuit acquiring the company for more than $400 million in 2012.\nBefore that, he was a VP and GM at Yahoo!, among other roles in tech startups and investing. He also practiced corporate and securities law at Venture Law Group, and has a J.D. from U.C. Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.\nInstant Discovery for Modern Legal Teams\nLogikcull.com provides instant discovery for modern legal teams.
