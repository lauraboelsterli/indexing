    "text": "(Corrects typo in headline)\nJan 17 (Reuters) - Newstrike Resources Ltd’s shareholders approved the sale of the Canadian cannabis producer to CanniMed Therapeutics Inc, which is fighting off a hostile takeover bid from fellow medical marijuana company Aurora Cannabis Inc.\nCanniMed has a shareholder meeting on Jan. 23 to vote on the Newstrike acquisition, which Aurora has called a “terrible deal”.\nEarlier this month, CanniMed signed a deal with Up Cannabis, which is owned by Newstrike, for the supply of raw materials in the face of rising demand as Canada prepares to legalize recreational pot.\nCanniMed has filed a $725 million lawsuit as it tries to fend off Aurora’s hostile takeover.
