Handball - Men's EHF European Handball Championship - main round Group I - Croatia v Belarus - Arena Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia - January 18, 2018. Croatia’s head coach Lino Cervar and Luka Cindric react after winning the match. REUTERS/Marko Djurica \nRoared on by a passionate crowd, the host nation appeared to be in the driving seat after carving out a 19-15 lead midway through the second half before Belarus came storming back and levelled the scores. \nWith Croatia running on empty in the home straight, livewire playmaker Luka Cindric restored their lead and right back Marko Kopljar sealed the victory on the buzzer. Slideshow (8 Images) \nNorway produced a strong second half to down Serbia after a high-scoring opening period ended 17-17 with both teams netting almost at will. \nThe Norwegians moved up a gear after the break and never looked back after a 7-1 run gave them a 24-19 advantage against a physical Serbian team lacking the mobility and energy to keep up with their rivals. \nNorway thrived on a flurry of fast breaks as Kristian Bjornsen and Sander Sagosen rifled in eight goals each.
