    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange trading out of London declined 4 percent in October 2017 to $2.23 trillion, compared with six months earlier, thanks to a drop in volumes in cash spot and swaps, a semi-annual survey by the Bank of England showed on Thursday.\nThe survey showed spot turnover in London, the worldâ€™s biggest currency trading hub, declined by $45 billion per day from six months ago to $677 billion daily.\nThe decline in volumes traded was across the board for all major currencies, according to the survey, perhaps a reflection of falling market volatility.\nDaily cash volumes for sterling GBP= fell 6 percent to $285 billion over the six months to October 2017. The fall in dollar/yen JPY= spot trading volumes was the biggest with a 20 percent drop over the last six months.\nDaily turnover in the euro-dollar exchange rate EUR= decreased by 14 percent to $673 billion per day, according to the survey.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
