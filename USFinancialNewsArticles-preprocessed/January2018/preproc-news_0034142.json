    "text": "January 21, 2018 / 12:35 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Migrants stuck in Serbia want to move on Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \nBELGRADE (Reuters) - After traversing several countries en route to the rich West, Najibullah, a former policeman from the Afghan town of Kholm, his pregnant wife and four children, got stuck in Serbia. \nNow they spend days of relative normalcy in a drab refugee camp in Krnjaca, an industrial area on the outskirts of the Serbian capital Belgrade, hoping they will ultimately move to Germany where 30-year-old Najibullah has relatives. \nIf they get their wish, they would join more than a million other migrants who have arrived in Germany since 2015, when Chancellor Angela Merkel offered sanctuary to those fleeing war and poverty. \nAlthough lauded in some quarters, Merkel’s actions meant she paid a political price in German elections in 2017, where the far right surged on anti-migrant sentiment. In that light, the challenges of migration remains high on the agenda of western states, not least those gathering at Davos this month, under the banner of “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World”. \nThe path many took to Germany, the so-called ‘Balkan route’, was shut in 2016 when Turkey agreed to stem the flow of people in return for EU aid and a promise of visa-free travel for its own citizens. \nBut migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia continued to arrive in Serbia, mainly from Turkey, via neighboring Bulgaria, attempting to enter the EU through bloc members Hungary and Croatia. \nAccording to officials there are as many as 4,500 migrants in government-operated camps in Serbia. Rights activists say that hundreds of others are scattered in the capital Belgrade and towns along Croatian and Hungarian borders. \nIn Krnjaca, Najibullah’s eight-year-old daughter Sonya, started attending school and soon excelled in Serbian, enough to serve as an interpreter with her father in an interview on Tuesday. Sonya, 8, daughter of Afghan refugee Najibullah, and her sister, have lunch at the camp for refugees and migrants in the Belgrade suburb of Krnjaca, Serbia, January 16, 2018.

Their numbers vary as while some families leave camps to enter Hungary and proceed further to Europe, others arrive. \nOf the migrants that arrived in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, since mid-2015, many have struggled to find their feet in the labor market due to a language barrier or vocational skills. Germany needs skilled labor, given its aging population.
