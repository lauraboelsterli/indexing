Carillion's Midland Metropolitan Hospital construction site is seen after the company went into liquidation, in Smethwick, Britain January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples \nIn one of the biggest British corporate failures in recent years, Carillion went into compulsory liquidation after costly contract delays and a slump in new business left it swamped by debt and pensions liabilities of around 1.5 billion pounds. \nThe demise of the 200-year-old business poses a headache for Theresa May’s government which had employed Carillion to work on 450 projects including the building and maintenance of hospitals, prisons, defence sites and a high-speed rail line. \nThe government’s priority is to ensure that public services are not disrupted, said David Lidington, the minister in charge of the Cabinet Office which oversees the running of government. \nSome contracts handled by Carillion would go to alternative providers, he added. Lidington urged the company’s staff to continue to work and said the government would pay their salaries. \nAlthough the government has promised to support workers and ensure contracts are delivered, it has stopped short of bailing out the company as it did with major banks during the financial crisis almost a decade ago. WEEKEND TALKS FAIL \nCarillion owed around 900 million pounds to banks which include the country’s five biggest - RBS, Santander UK, Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays - and it has a pension deficit of 580 million pounds. \n“In recent days we have been unable to secure the funding to support our business plan and it is therefore with the deepest regret that we have arrived at this decision,” Chairman Philip Green said. \n“This is a very sad day for Carillion, for our colleagues, suppliers and customers that we have been proud to serve over many years.” \nEmploying 43,000 people around the world, including 20,000 in Britain, Carillion has been fighting for survival since July when it revealed it was losing cash on several projects and had written down the value of its contract book by 845 million pounds. \nWith banks refusing to accept the group’s latest attempt to restructure, May’s senior ministers met around the clock in recent days, under pressure from the opposition Labour Party and unions not to use taxpayer money to prop up the failing company. \nMinisters, top bankers and company bosses scrambled to find a way to save the company in last ditch talks over the weekend. But Carillion announced its own “compulsory liquidation” just over an hour before the London Stock Exchange opened on Monday.

REUTERS/Darren Staples GOVERNMENT UNDER PRESSURE \nSpun out of Tarmac nearly 20 years ago and having bought Alfred McAlpine in 2008, Carillion has worked on major construction projects including London’s Royal Opera House, the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto’s Union Station. \nIn July last year, a week after its initial profit warning, it was named as one of the contractors on Britain’s new High Speed 2 rail line, a flagship project that will better connect London with the north of England. \nAt its headquarters in Wolverhampton, central England, a handful of workers could be seen holding meetings. \nShares in rival businesses such as G4S, Interserve, Balfour Beatty and Kier Group advanced on hopes they would pick up some additional work.

Staff that are engaged on public sector contracts still have important work to do.” Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Guy Faulconbridge/Keith Weir",
