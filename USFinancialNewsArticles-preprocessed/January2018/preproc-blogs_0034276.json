    "text": "Americans are now as satisfied with the U.S. economy as they were during the dotcom boom, a new poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found.\nSixty-nine percent of Americans said they were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with economic conditions in the country. That figure is up sharply from the mere 37 percent who said they were satisfied in June 2015.\nThat economic satisfaction was found across the political spectrum. While 86 percent of Republicans said they felt good about the economy, 65 percent of independents and 57 percent of Democrats said they were satisfied.\nRobin Alam | Icon SMI/Icon Sport Media | Getty Images One in five respondents cited the low unemployment rate and recent stock market records as Trump administration accomplishments.\nWhile President Donald Trump was often praised for his impact on the economy, his approval rating remains remarkably low. The president scored a 39 percent approval rating in this poll, the lowest in the survey's history for any modern president one year into his term.\nBelow are some other takeaways from this poll:\nThe tax bill remains unpopular , but Americans may be warming up to it. Thirty percent of respondents said the bill is a good idea, up from the 24 percent last month. The Democratic advantage for the general midterm ballot narrowed to 6 points, down from the 11 points last month. But the GOP can't breathe easy just yet . About 38 percent of respondents said they will head to the ballot box in 2018 hoping to send a message to the president. That's the highest level since October 2006, just before Republicans lost 30 House seats during the George W. Bush administration. Sixty percent of Americans now say they actively support or favor a state law that would legalize marijuana . That's up from 55 percent in 2014. The NBC/WSJ poll of 900 adults was conducted Jan. 13-17. It carries a margin for error of 3.3 percentage points.\nâ€” NBC News contributed to this report.",
