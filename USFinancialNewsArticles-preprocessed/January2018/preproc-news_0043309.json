    "text": "PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX):\nNet income attributable to common stock totaled $1.0 billion, $0.71 per share, for fourth-quarter 2017. After adjusting for net gains of $291 million, $0.20 per share, fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $750 million, $0.51 per share. Consolidated sales totaled 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 593 thousand ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for fourth-quarter 2017 and 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold and 95 million pounds of molybdenum for the year 2017. Consolidated sales for the year 2018 are expected to approximate 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 675 thousand ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018. Average realized prices for fourth-quarter 2017 were $3.21 per pound for copper, $1,285 per ounce for gold and $9.79 per pound for molybdenum. Average unit net cash costs for fourth-quarter 2017 were $1.04 per pound of copper and $1.20 per pound for the year 2017. Unit net cash costs are expected to average $0.97 per pound of copper for the year 2018. Operating cash flows totaled $1.7 billion (including $0.2 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) for fourth-quarter 2017 and $4.7 billion (including $0.6 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) for the year 2017. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $3.15 per pound for copper, $1,300 per ounce for gold and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum, operating cash flows for the year 2018 are expected to exceed $5.8 billion (including $0.3 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments). Capital expenditures for fourth-quarter 2017 totaled $390 million (including approximately $250 million for major mining projects) and $1.4 billion for the year 2017 (including $0.9 billion for major mining projects). Capital expenditures for the year 2018 are expected to approximate $2.1 billion, including $1.2 billion for major mining projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star oxide project. During fourth-quarter 2017, FCX repaid $1.7 billion in debt , including the redemption of $617 million of senior notes due 2020 and the repurchase of $74 million of senior notes due 2018 in open-market transactions. At December 31, 2017, consolidated cash totaled $4.4 billion and consolidated debt totaled $13.1 billion. FCX had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under its revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017.\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported net income attributable to common stock of $1.0 billion ($0.71 per share) for fourth-quarter 2017 and $1.8 billion ($1.25 per share) for the year 2017, compared with net income attributable to common stock of $292 million ($0.21 per share) for fourth-quarter 2016 and a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion ($3.16 per share) for the year 2016. After adjusting for net gains of $291 million ($0.20 per share) primarily related to tax benefits associated with U.S. tax reform, partly offset by charges for adjustments to environmental obligations, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $750 million ($0.51 per share) for fourth-quarter 2017. Refer to the supplemental schedule, \"Adjusted Net Income,\" on page VII, which is available on FCX's website, \" fcx.com ,\" for additional information.\nRichard C.

Fourth-quarter 2017 gold sales were higher than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 405 thousand ounces, primarily reflecting anticipated higher ore grades from Indonesia.\nFourth-quarter 2017 molybdenum sales of 24 million pounds were slightly higher than the October 2017 estimate of 23 million pounds and fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 22 million pounds.\nSales volumes for the year 2018 are expected to approximate 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 675 thousand ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum in first-quarter 2018.\nConsolidated Unit Costs\nConsolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mines of $1.04 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were lower than unit net cash costs of $1.21 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting higher by-product credits, partly offset by lower copper sales volumes and higher mining and milling costs in South America.\nAssuming average prices of $1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum for 2018 and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for copper mines are expected to average $0.97 per pound of copper for the year 2018. The impact of price changes on 2018 consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate $0.03 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $0.025 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum.\nMINING OPERATIONS\nNorth America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. In addition to copper, certain of FCX's North America copper mines produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver.\nAll of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 72 percent undivided joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method.\nOperating and Development Activities. FCX has significant undeveloped reserves and resources in North America and a portfolio of potential long-term development projects. Future investments will be undertaken based on the results of economic and technical feasibility studies, and are dependent on market conditions. FCX continues to study opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of its potential long-term development projects.\nThrough exploration drilling, FCX has identified a significant resource at its wholly owned Lone Star project located near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. FCX has commenced a project to develop the Lone Star oxide ores with first production expected by the end of 2020. Total estimated capital costs for the project, including mine equipment and pre-production stripping, approximates $850 million and will benefit from the utilization of existing infrastructure at the adjacent Safford operation. Production from the Lone Star oxide ores is expected to average approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year with an approximate 20-year mine life. The project also advances the potential for development of a larger-scale district opportunity. FCX is conducting additional drilling as it continues to evaluate longer term opportunities available from the significant sulfide potential in the Lone Star/Safford minerals district.\nOperating Data.

North America copper sales are estimated to approximate 1.5 billion pounds for the year 2018, compared with 1.5 billion pounds in 2017.\nAverage unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of $1.68 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than unit net cash costs of $1.44 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes.\nAverage unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines are expected to approximate $1.67 per pound of copper for the year 2018, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of $10.00 per pound. North America's average unit net cash costs for the year 2018 would change by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.\nSouth America Mining. FCX operates two copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru (in which FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest) and El Abra in Chile (in which FCX owns a 51 percent interest). These operations are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver.\nOperating and Development Activities. The Cerro Verde expansion project commenced operations in September 2015. The project expanded the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day, and averaged 374,200 metric tons of ore per day in fourth-quarter 2017. Cerro Verde's expanded operations benefit from its large-scale, long-lived reserves and cost efficiencies.\nFCX continues to evaluate a major expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Exploration results at El Abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities recently constructed at Cerro Verde. Future investments will depend on technical studies, which are being advanced, economic factors and market conditions.\nOperating Data. Following is summary consolidated operating data for the South America mining operations for the fourth quarters and years 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Copper (millions of recoverable pounds) Production 303 342 1,235 1,328 Sales 312 359 1,235 1,332 Average realized price per pound $ 3.22 $ 2.50 $ 2.97 $ 2.31 Molybdenum (millions of recoverable pounds) Production a 6 7 27 21 Unit net cash costs per pound of copper b Site production and delivery, excluding adjustments $ 1.71 $ 1.35 $ 1.59 $ 1.26 By-product credits (0.20 ) (0.10 ) (0.18 ) (0.10 ) Treatment charges 0.21 0.25 0.22 0.24 Royalty on metals 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Unit net cash costs $ 1.73 $ 1.51 $ 1.64 $ 1.41 a.\nRefer to summary operating data on page 3 for FCX's consolidated molybdenum sales, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at Cerro Verde.\nb.\nFor a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, \"Product Revenues and Production Costs,\" beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, \" fcx.com .\"\nSouth America's consolidated copper sales volumes of 312 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2017 were lower than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 359 million pounds, primarily reflecting lower recovery rates at Cerro Verde. Sales from South America mining are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper for the year 2018, compared with 1.2 billion pounds of copper in 2017.\nAverage unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining of $1.73 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than unit net cash costs of $1.51 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes and higher mining and milling costs at Cerro Verde, partly offset by higher by-product credits. Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining are expected to approximate $1.63 per pound of copper for the year 2018, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $10.00 per pound of molybdenum.\nIndonesia Mining. Through its 90.64 percent owned and consolidated subsidiary PT-FI, FCX's assets include one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits at the Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia. PT-FI operates a proportionately consolidated joint venture, which produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver.\nRegulatory Matters. PT-FI continues to actively engage with Indonesian government officials to address regulatory changes that conflict with its contractual rights in a manner that provides long-term stability for PT-FI’s operations and investment plans, and protects value for FCX’s shareholders.\nFollowing a framework understanding reached in August 2017, the parties have been engaged in negotiation and documentation of a special license (IUPK) and accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and fiscal terms to provide PT-FI with long-term rights through 2041. In addition, the IUPK would provide that PT-FI construct a smelter within five years of reaching a definitive agreement and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the project area interests to Indonesian participants at fair market value.\nIn late 2017, the Indonesian government (including the regional government of Papua Province and Mimika Regency) and PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum), a state-owned enterprise, which will lead a consortium of investors, agreed to form a special purpose company to acquire Grasberg project area interests. Inalum is owned 100 percent by the Indonesian government and currently holds 9.36 percent of PT-FI's outstanding common stock.\nFCX is engaged in discussions with Inalum and PT-FI’s joint venture partner regarding potential arrangements that would result in the Inalum consortium acquiring interests that would meet the Indonesian government’s 51 percent ownership objective in a manner satisfactory to all parties, and in a structure that would provide for continuity of FCX’s management of PT-FI’s operations and governance of the business. The parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement for PT-FI’s extended operations and to reach agreement on timing, process and governance matters relating to the divestment. The parties have a mutual objective of completing negotiations and the required documentation during the first half of 2018.\nIn December 2017, the Indonesian government extended PT-FI’s temporary IUPK to June 30, 2018, and PT-FI is seeking an extension of its export license which currently expires on February 16, 2018, to enable normal operations to continue during the negotiation period.\nUntil a definitive agreement is reached, PT-FI has reserved all rights under its Contract of Work (COW).\nOperating and Development Activities. PT-FI is currently mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit, which contains high copper and gold ore grades. PT-FI expects to mine high-grade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine in the first half of 2019.\nPT-FI has several projects in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the Grasberg open pit. Substantial progress has been made to prepare for the transition to mining of the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine. Mine development activities are sufficiently advanced to commence caving in early 2019. The ore flow system and underground rail line are expected to be installed during 2018.\nSubject to reaching a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government to support PT-FI's long-term investment plans, estimated annual capital spending on these projects would average $0.9 billion per year ($0.7 billion per year net to PT-FI) over the next five years. Considering the long-term nature and size of these projects, actual costs could vary from these estimates. In response to market conditions and Indonesian regulatory uncertainty, timing of these expenditures continues to be reviewed. If PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, FCX intends to reduce or defer investments significantly in its underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under its COW.\nOperating Data. Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the fourth quarters and years 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Copper (millions of recoverable pounds) Production 337 369 984 1,063 Sales 351 352 981 1,054 Average realized price per pound $ 3.25 $ 2.48 $ 3.00 $ 2.32 Gold (thousands of recoverable ounces) Production 562 424 1,554 1,061 Sales 584 401 1,540 1,054 Average realized price per ounce $ 1,285 $ 1,174 $ 1,268 $ 1,237 Unit net cash (credits) costs per pound of copper a Site production and delivery, excluding adjustments $ 1.36 b $ 1.50 $ 1.58 b $ 1.63 Gold and silver credits (2.18 ) (1.34 ) (2.05 ) (1.30 ) Treatment charges 0.26 0.27 0.27 0.28 Export duties 0.15 0.09 0.12 0.09 Royalty on metals 0.19 0.13 0.17 0.13 Unit net cash (credits) costs $ (0.22 ) $ 0.65 $ 0.09 $ 0.83 a.\nFor a reconciliation of unit net cash (credits) costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, \"Product Revenues and Production Costs,\" beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, \" fcx.com .\"\nb.\nExcludes fixed costs charged directly to production and delivery costs totaling $8 million ($0.02 per pound of copper) in fourth-quarter 2017 and $120 million ($0.12 per pound of copper) for the year 2017 associated with workforce reductions.\nIndonesia's consolidated copper sales of 351 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2017 approximated fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 352 million pounds. Indonesia's consolidated gold sales of 584 thousand ounces in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 401 thousand ounces, reflecting higher gold ore grades.\nPT-FI's labor productivity continues to improve following disruptions that occurred in the first half of 2017. During fourth-quarter 2017, PT-FI and union officials reached terms for a new two-year labor agreement, effective October 1, 2017.\nAssuming achievement of planned operating rates for 2018, consolidated sales volumes from Indonesia mining are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper and 2.4 million ounces of gold for the year 2018, compared with 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold for the year 2017.\nA significant portion of PT-FI's costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending on production volumes and other factors. As a result of higher gold and silver credits, Indonesia had unit net cash credits (including gold and silver credits) of $0.22 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017, compared with unit net cash costs of $0.65 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016.\nAssuming an average gold price of $1,300 per ounce for 2018 and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, unit net cash credits (including gold and silver credits) for Indonesia mining are expected to approximate $0.57 per pound of copper for the year 2018. Indonesia mining's unit net cash credits for the year 2018 would change by approximately $0.09 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold. Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit net cash credits/costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on copper and gold volumes.\nIndonesia mining's projected sales volumes for the year 2018 are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, workforce productivity, timing of shipments, the extension of PT-FI's export license (which currently expires on February 16, 2018), the extension of PT-FI's IUPK after June 30, 2018, and satisfactory progress on the resolution of PT-FI's long-term mining rights.\nMolybdenum Mines. FCX has two wholly owned molybdenum mines - the Henderson underground mine and the Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. The majority of molybdenum concentrate produced at the Henderson and Climax mines, as well as from FCX's North America and South America copper mines, is processed at FCX's conversion facilities.\nOperating and Development Activities. Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled 8 million pounds of molybdenum in fourth-quarter 2017 and 7 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2016. Refer to summary operating data on page 3 for FCX's consolidated molybdenum sales and average realized prices, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at the Molybdenum mines, and from FCX's North America and South America copper mines.\nUnit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines averaged $8.40 per pound of molybdenum in fourth-quarter 2017 and $8.26 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, average unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines are expected to approximate $9.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2018.\nFor a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, \"Product Revenues and Production Costs,\" beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, \" fcx.com .\"\nMining Exploration Activities. FCX's mining exploration activities are generally associated with its existing mines, focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North America and South America. Exploration spending is expected to approximate $65 million for the year 2018, compared to $72 million in 2017.\nPreliminary Recoverable Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. FCX has significant reserves, resources and future development opportunities within its portfolio of mining assets. FCX's preliminary estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves from its mines at December 31, 2017, include 86.7 billion pounds of copper, 23.5 million ounces of gold and 2.84 billion pounds of molybdenum, which were determined using $2.00 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum. The preliminary recoverable proven and probable mining reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserve volumes are those which FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.\nPreliminary Recoverable Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves Estimated at December 31, 2017 Copper Gold Molybdenum (billion pounds) (million ounces) (billion pounds) North America 33.5 0.3 2.22 South America 28.1 — 0.62 Indonesia a 25.1 23.2 — Consolidated basis b 86.7 23.5 2.84 Net equity interest c 71.3 21.3 2.56 a.\nPreliminary recoverable proven and probable reserves from Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041. Refer to \"Indonesia Mining\" above and to \"Risk Factors\" in FCX's U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for discussion of PT-FI's COW and Indonesia regulatory matters.\nb.\nConsolidated reserves represent estimated metal quantities after reduction for joint venture partner interests at the Morenci mine in North America and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia. Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of 273.4 million ounces of silver, which were determined using $15 per ounce.\nc.\nNet equity interest reserves represent estimated consolidated metal quantities further reduced for noncontrolling interest ownership. Excluded from the table above were FCX’s estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of 218.2 million ounces of silver.\nThe following table summarizes changes in FCX's preliminary estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper, gold and molybdenum reserves during 2017:\nCopper Gold Molybdenum (billions of lbs) (millions of ozs) (billions of lbs) Reserves at December 31, 2016 86.8 26.1 2.95 Net additions (revisions) 3.6 a (1.0 ) (0.02 ) Production (3.7 ) (1.6 ) (0.09 ) Reserves at December 31, 2017 86.7 23.5 2.84 a.\nIncludes 4.4 billion pounds associated with the Lone Star project located near the Safford mine.\nIn addition to the preliminary consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves, FCX's preliminary estimated mineralized material at December 31, 2017, which was assessed using $2.20 per pound for copper, totaled 92 billion pounds of incremental contained copper (including 5 billion pounds associated with Kisanfu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is an asset held for sale). FCX continues to pursue opportunities to convert this material into reserves, future production volumes and cash flow.\nCASH FLOWS, CASH and DEBT\nOperating Cash Flows. FCX generated operating cash flows of $1.7 billion (including $0.2 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) in fourth-quarter 2017 and $4.7 billion (including $0.6 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) for the year 2017.\nBased on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $3.15 per pound of copper, $1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to exceed $5.8 billion for the year 2018 (including $0.3 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments). The impact of price changes during 2018 on operating cash flows would approximate $360 million for each $0.10 per pound change in the average price of copper, $115 million for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $130 million for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $390 million for fourth-quarter 2017 (including approximately $250 million for major mining projects) and $1.4 billion for the year ended 2017 (including $0.9 billion for major mining projects). Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.1 billion for the year 2018, including $1.2 billion for major mining projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star oxide project.\nIf PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, FCX intends to reduce or defer investments significantly in its underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under its COW.\nCash. Following is a summary of the U.S. and international components of consolidated cash and cash equivalents available to the parent company, net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs at December 31, 2017 (in billions):\nCash at domestic companies $ 3.3 Cash at international operations 1.1 Total consolidated cash and cash equivalents 4.4 Noncontrolling interests' share (0.4 ) Cash, net of noncontrolling interests' share 4.0 Withholding taxes and other — Net cash available $ 4.0 Debt. Following is a summary of total debt and the related weighted-average interest rates at December 31, 2017 (in billions, except percentages):\nWeighted- Average Interest Rate Senior Notes $ 11.8 4.4% Cerro Verde credit facility 1.3 3.5% Total debt $ 13.1 4.3% During fourth-quarter 2017, FCX redeemed $617 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2020 and repurchased $74 million of FCX senior notes due 2018 in open-market transactions, resulting in annual cash interest savings of over $40 million. During fourth-quarter 2017, FCX also repaid $730 million of senior notes due 2017 and $220 million of the Cerro Verde credit facility. Debt repayments in fourth-quarter 2017 totaled $1.7 billion.\nAt December 31, 2017, FCX had no borrowings, $13 million in letters of credit issued and $3.5 billion available under its revolving credit facility.\nFINANCIAL POLICY\nIn December 2015, FCX's common stock dividend was suspended. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors (the Board) and will depend upon FCX’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nWEBCAST INFORMATION\nA conference call with securities analysts to discuss FCX's fourth-quarter 2017 results is scheduled for today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
