Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe pilgrimage to the mystic’s tomb is held on the Jewish-calendar anniversary of his death and part of the memorial ritual involves faithful prostrating themselves on his grave stone and tossing unlit candles into a furnace. \nAbuhatzeira was noted for his piety and was revered by his followers, who believed in his ability to perform miracles and heal the sick, among other means, through sprinkling drops of water on them. \nIsraeli politicians of North African descent have also used Abuhatzeira to rally their voters. He was born in Morocco either in 1889 or 1890 where he spent most of his life studying the Hebrew scriptures. He settled in Israel in 1970.
