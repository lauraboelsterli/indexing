    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., Jan. 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADT Inc. (“ADT”), the leader in security and automation solutions for homes and businesses in North America, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 105,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of $14 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, ADT granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 15,750,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. ADT’s existing shareholders will not sell any shares in the offering.\nThe shares are expected to begin trading on The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \"ADT\" on January 19, 2018.

ADT intends to use the gross proceeds from the offering to partially redeem outstanding second lien notes, and deposit approximately $750 million of the net proceeds from this offering into a separate account, which will be used to redeem ADT Inc.’s preferred securities on a date to be determined, following the consummation of the initial public offering, and pay fees and expenses in connection with the offering.\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs & Co.
