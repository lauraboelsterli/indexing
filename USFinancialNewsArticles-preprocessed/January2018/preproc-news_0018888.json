    "text": "(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) unveiled its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions developed with Harman International, which it bought about a year ago in a major push into the auto electronics market.\nThe automotive industry is one of the fastest-growing segments of the technology market, with carmakers looking to add more autonomous features as the race to put driverless cars on the road heats up.\nAt an annual trade show in Las Vegas this week, Samsung Electronics unveiled an automotive camera system featuring collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, developed in collaboration with Harman.\nSamsung bought Harman in an $8 billion deal that closed in March 2017, the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a South Korean company.\nSamsung plans to begin shipping the camera system, which is built on machine learning and augmented reality, this year. It did not give details on the exact timing.\nSamsung also showcased a “digital cockpit” that allows drivers to personalize cars even if they do not own them as it pulls users’ profile from their mobile devices and cloud.\nHarman and Samsung outlined their plan to deliver 5G technology for cars, adding Harman had secured a \"leading European automaker\" as a client. bit.ly/2qLEINs\nSamsung in September had announced that it set up a strategic business unit for autonomous and advanced driver assistance services, together with a $300 million fund to invest in automotive start-ups and technology.\nReporting by Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru and Joyce Lee in Seoul; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
