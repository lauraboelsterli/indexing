Among those were economic influence, power, citizenship and quality of life, which collectively helped determine each country's success as a modern nation. \nTo determine which countries were perceived to have the best quality of life, researchers measured these nine country attributes: affordability, quality of local job market, economic stability, family-friendliness, income equality, political stability, safety, quality of public education system and quality of public health system. \nWhile Canada is ranked first, \"Scandinavian countries that are well-known for their strong social welfare networks dominate the top 10,\" U.S. News & World Report data editor Deidre McPhillips tells CNBC Make It . show chapters 11:54 AM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 01:01 \nThe rankings are part of an analysis project called the 2018 Best Countries Report, conducted now for three years by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and global consumer insights firm Y&R's BAV Group. \n\"The Best Countries report speaks to the effect a nation's brand can have on its economic prosperity and perceived standing in the world,\" Wharton professor of marketing David Reibstein said in a statement. \nY&R Global CEO David Sable added that nations need to think carefully about their brand appeal and show off qualities like innovation and compassion in order to set themselves apart. \n\"For the countries that rose to the top of this year's rankings, it is once again clear that military vigor and economic power are no longer the key determinants to a country's brand success,\" Y&R Global CEO David Sable said in a statement. \nHere are the 10 countries that offer the best quality of life, along with how the U.S. News & World Report ranked them on other lists this year: 10.

But data now exists to show us how to optimize your surroundings so you're more likely to be happy,\" he says. \"Living by water, in a bikable community and in a place with easy access to fruits and vegetables all stack the deck in favor of happiness.\" \nBuettner's offers this advice to millennials who may feel unhappy living or working where they do: \"As long as you make enough for food, shelter, healthcare and some mobility, you should only do a job you love and uses your skills/passions,\" he says. \"You will be much happier in the long run.\"",
