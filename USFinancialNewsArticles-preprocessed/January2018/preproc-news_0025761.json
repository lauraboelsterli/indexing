    "text": "  3:00 p.m. ET Share Mistaken alert warns Hawaiians of missile threat. \nBy Natalie.Andrew \nAn emergency alert sent to Hawaiians on Saturday warning that a “ballistic missile threat” was “inbound to Hawaii” was a false alarm, according to the state’s Office of Emergency Management. \nThe alert, which was pushed to mobile phones at 8:07 a.m. Hawaii time, read “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” \nThe message caused immediate alarm among residents. Some have warned the state could be a target of an attack against the U.S. by North Korea, given the Hawaiian islands’ location in the Pacific Ocean. \nAt 8:45, a second message followed, saying, “There is no missile threat or danger to the state of Hawaii. Repeat false alarm.” The second message was not in all-capital letters. \nLawmakers in Hawaii were quick to call for fixes to the system. HAWAII - THIS IS A FALSE ALARM. THERE IS NO INCOMING MISSILE TO HAWAII. I HAVE CONFIRMED WITH OFFICIALS THERE IS NO INCOMING MISSILE. pic.twitter.com/DxfTXIDOQs",
