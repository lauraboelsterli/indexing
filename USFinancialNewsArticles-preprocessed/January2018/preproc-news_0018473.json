    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Montecito Medical Real Estate, one of the fastest growing, privately held firms in the country devoted exclusively to medical real estate, has acquired Medical Pavilion South, a 63,486 square-foot medical office building in Dyer, Indiana on the campus of Franciscan Health Dyer Hospital. Founded in 1898, Franciscan Health is one of the largest acute-care hospitals in Northwest Indiana, operating 14 hospitals with more than 18,000 employees.\nBuilt in 2008, Medical Pavilion South is a four-story medical office building that is connected to the hospital via a covered walkway. The multi-tenant facility is 92 percent leased and located Dyer, Ind., a bedroom community 33 miles south of Chicago. Both Money Magazine and CNN have listed Dyer as one of the nation’s “Best Places to Live.”\n\"Holladay Properties is pleased with the opportunity to work with Montecito Medical on the sale of this important asset,\" said Mike O’Connor, Vice President of Development and Leasing for Holladay Properties, the owner of the building and one of the largest medical office management firms in the country. “We are confident the valued building tenants and Franciscan Health system will benefit from the Montecito professional ownership culture and we look forward to continuing our working relationship with the Montecito team by way of our ongoing management and leasing services.”\n“This was a rare, on-campus opportunity, anchored by and attached to one of the largest acute care hospitals in the Northwest Indiana region,” said Chip Conk, CEO of Montecito Medical. “Our company enjoyed a banner year in 2017, we are proud to open the new year with this exceptional medical office building acquisition.”\nThe Franciscan Alliance, Inc., anchors the building, occupying four suites totaling 44 percent of the rentable area.
