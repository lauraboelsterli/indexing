In this role, Dr. Mendlein will be responsible for corporate strategy, product advancement and strategy, partnering and product protection. He will serve on Moderna’s Executive Committee and report to Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel. He will also continue to serve on Moderna’s Board of Directors where he has been a member since 2012.\n“I have had the privilege of working closely with John for almost six years and I am delighted to now bring him into our company where he will contribute to our mission with a unique set of capabilities and experiences, including his scientific expertise and his insights from having run several successful biotech companies,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer. “We will benefit from his deep product and platform experience ranging from platform development, to the successful transition of product candidates into the clinic, to product and platform protection. John will be a great addition to our executive team, and I am thankful that he decided to deploy his many talents during this important time in the evolution of our organization.”\n“Moderna represents a rare and vast opportunity to change the lives of patients and medicine from vaccines to immuno-oncology to rare diseases to newly emerging areas of its mRNA product engine,” said Dr. Mendlein. “Over the past six years, under Stéphane’s leadership, I witnessed as a board member one of the most remarkable enterprise transformations as the team here took a captivating idea from our Chairman Dr. Noubar Afeyan, applied world-class science, and created an unrivaled product engine that generates high-impact product opportunities for patients at a scale and speed not previously achieved by our industry. The implications of Moderna’s ability to program life with mRNA are both profound and impactful. I feel very lucky and privileged to join the Moderna team at this exciting time and to work with Stéphane and the team to benefit patients and shareholders alike.”\nDr. Mendlein has helped start and lead numerous innovative life sciences companies. He is Vice Chairman of the Board and a founder of Fate Therapeutics, Inc., and holds board positions with Editas Medicine, Inc., and Axcella Health, Inc.
