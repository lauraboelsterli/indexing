    "text": "MIAMI LAKES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BankUnited, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: BKU) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $417.8 million, or $3.79 per diluted share, compared to $63.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of a discrete income tax benefit and related professional fees, net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $94.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $614.3 million, or $5.58 per diluted share, compared to $225.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the discrete income tax benefit and professional fees, net income was $291.3 million or $2.65 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017. The return on average stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 23.36% compared to 9.64% for the year ended December 31, 2016 while the return on average assets was 2.13% compared to 0.87% for the same periods. Excluding the impact of a discrete income tax benefit and related professional fees, the return on average stockholders’ equity and the return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 11.08% and 1.01%, respectively.\nRajinder Singh, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"2017 was a remarkable year for BankUnited. We delivered double digit growth in earnings, loans and deposits, while shifting our strategy to diversify our balance sheet and business mix. I’m also proud to say that tangible book value per share has grown at a compound annual rate of 11.7% since our 2011 IPO, to $27.59.\"\nPerformance Highlights\nEarnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 benefited from a discrete income tax benefit of $327.9 million, inclusive of an expected federal benefit of $295.0 million, estimated state benefits of $24.2 million and estimated interest of $8.7 million. Given the increase in capital generated by the income tax benefit discussed above, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $150 million in shares of its outstanding common stock. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in open market or private transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, the Company’s capital position and amount of retained earnings, regulatory requirements and other considerations. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law on December 22, 2017, reducing the statutory corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. A tax benefit of $3.7 million, representing the impact of the rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment was recognized in earnings during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net interest income increased by $11.3 million to $238.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $227.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Interest income increased by $34.7 million, driven by increases in the average balances of loans and investment securities outstanding and an increase in the yield on interest earning assets. Interest expense increased by $23.4 million, driven by increases in average interest bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased by $79.9 million to $950.3 million from $870.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased to 3.52% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 3.67% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 3.62% for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2017. Significant factors contributing to the decline in the net interest margin included the continued growth of non-covered loans and investment securities at yields lower than the yield on total interest earning assets and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.73% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gain on sale of covered loans totaled $19.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company sold substantially all of the covered home equity loans and lines of credit at higher than expected prices. The gain on sale was partially offset by a related loss on FDIC indemnification of $2.8 million, for a net impact on pre-tax earnings of $16.2 million. Non-covered loans and leases, including equipment under operating lease, grew by $852 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-covered loans and leases grew by $2.2 billion. Total deposits increased by $655 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, to $21.9 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total deposits increased by $2.4 billion. Book value per common share grew to $28.32 at December 31, 2017, a 22.0% increase from December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per common share increased by 22.8% over the same period, to $27.59 at December 31, 2017. These increases were impacted by the discrete income tax benefit recognized in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nCapital\nThe Company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory guidelines required to be considered well capitalized. The Company’s and BankUnited, N.A.'s regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nBankUnited, Inc.\nBankUnited, N.A.\nTier 1 leverage 9.7 % 10.5 % Common Equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital 13.1 % 14.1 % Tier 1 risk-based capital 13.1 % 14.1 % Total risk-based capital 13.8 % 14.8 % Loans and Leases\nLoans, including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs, increased to $21.4 billion at December 31, 2017 from $19.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Non-covered loans grew to $20.9 billion while covered loans declined to $503 million at December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, non-covered commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and loans and leases originated by our commercial lending subsidiaries, grew by $678 million to $16.7 billion. Equipment under operating lease, net, grew by $11 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-covered residential and other consumer loans grew by $162 million to $4.2 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Florida franchise contributed non-covered loan growth for the quarter of $465 million and the New York franchise contributed net growth of $29 million. The Company's national platforms contributed non-covered loan and lease growth of $359 million. We refer to our commercial lending subsidiaries, our mortgage warehouse lending operations, the small business finance unit (\"SBF\") and our 1-4 family residential loan portfolio as national platforms. The most significant contributors to growth across the national platforms were residential at $162 million and the commercial lending subsidiaries at $191 million. In Florida, all portfolio segments contributed to non-covered loan growth with the most significant contributions coming from the C&I portfolio, with growth of $175 million, and the non-owner occupied CRE portfolio, with growth of $233 million. The increase in New York reflected continued expected runoff in multi-family loans of $169 million, more than offset by growth of $198 million across other portfolio segments. At December 31, 2017, the non-covered loan portfolio included $7.4 billion, $6.1 billion and $7.4 billion attributable to the Florida franchise, the New York franchise and the national platforms, respectively.\nA comparison of portfolio composition at the dates indicated follows:\nNon-Covered Loans Total Loans December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nResidential and other consumer loans 19.8 % 18.4 % 21.7 % 21.0 % Multi-family 15.4 % 20.4 % 15.0 % 19.8 % Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 21.5 % 19.9 % 21.0 % 19.3 % Construction and land 1.5 % 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.6 % Owner occupied commercial real estate 9.7 % 9.3 % 9.4 % 9.0 % Commercial and industrial 19.9 % 18.1 % 19.4 % 17.5 % Commercial lending subsidiaries 12.2 % 12.2 % 12.0 % 11.8 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nFor the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded provisions for loan losses of $5.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively, including provisions related to non-covered loans of $6.5 million and $9.0 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded provisions for loan losses of $68.7 million and $50.9 million, respectively, including provisions related to non-covered loans of $67.4 million and $52.6 million. The provision related to taxi medallion loans totaled $8.6 million and $2.2 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $58.2 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe decrease in the provision for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 reflected (i) a net decrease in the relative impact on the provision of changes in quantitative and qualitative loss factors, (ii) a reduction in the reserve established at September 30, 2017 related to the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and (iii) a decrease in provisions related to classified and specifically reserved loans, offset in part by (i) the increase in the provision related to taxi medallion loans and (ii) higher loan growth.\nThe increase in the provision for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was driven by the increase in the provision related to taxi medallion loans, which was partially offset by (i) a net decrease in the relative impact on the provision of changes in quantitative and qualitative loss factors, (ii) a decrease in provisions for classified and specifically reserved loans and (iii) lower loan growth.\nNon-covered, non-performing loans totaled $172.0 million or 0.82% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $132.7 million or 0.71% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2016. Non-performing taxi medallion loans comprised $106.1 million or 0.51% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2017 and $60.7 million or 0.32% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the entire taxi medallion portfolio was on non-accrual status.\nThe ratios of the allowance for non-covered loan and lease losses to total non-covered loans and to non-performing, non-covered loans were 0.69% and 84.03%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, compared to 0.80% and 113.68% at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the ratio of the allowance for non-covered loan and lease losses to non-performing non-covered loans was primarily a result of charge-offs related to taxi medallion loans and the increase in non-performing taxi medallion loans in 2017. The ratio of net charge-offs to average non-covered loans was 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.13% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The ratio of charge-offs of taxi medallion loans to average non-covered loans was 0.29% and 0.06% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 ACI\nLoans\nNon-ACI\nLoans\nNon-\nCovered\nLoans\nTotal ACI\nLoans\nNon-ACI\nLoans\nNon-\nCovered\nLoans\nTotal Balance at beginning of period $ 1,812 $ 3,036 $ 153,725 $ 158,573 $ — $ 2,785 $ 151,691 $ 154,476 Provision (recovery) (1,812 ) 477 6,509 5,174 — (562 ) 9,024 8,462 Charge-offs — (3,272 ) (16,832 ) (20,104\n) — (130 ) (10,146 ) (10,276 ) Recoveries — 17 1,135 1,152 — 7 284 291 Balance at end of period $ — $ 258 $ 144,537 $ 144,795 $ — $ 2,100 $ 150,853 $ 152,953 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2016 ACI\nLoans\nNon-ACI\nLoans\nNon-\nCovered\nLoans\nTotal ACI\nLoans\nNon-ACI\nLoans\nNon-\nCovered\nLoans\nTotal Balance at beginning of period $ — $ 2,100 $ 150,853 $ 152,953 $ — $ 4,868 $ 120,960 $ 125,828 Provision (recovery) — 1,358 67,389 68,747 — (1,681 ) 52,592 50,911 Charge-offs — (3,327 ) (77,866 ) (81,193 ) — (1,216 ) (25,894 ) (27,110 ) Recoveries — 127 4,161 4,288 — 129 3,195 3,324 Balance at end of period $ — $ 258 $ 144,537 $ 144,795 $ — $ 2,100 $ 150,853 $ 152,953 Charge-offs related to taxi medallion loans totaled $9.5 million and $6.9 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $56.6 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2017, deposits totaled $21.9 billion compared to $19.5 billion at December 31, 2016. The average cost of total deposits was 0.94% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.87% for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2017, and 0.69 % for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The average cost of total deposits was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 0.66% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased to $238.8 million from $227.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income was $950.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $870.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Increases in interest income were partially offset by increases in interest expense. The increases in interest income were primarily attributable to increases in the average balances of loans and investment securities and related average yields. Interest expense increased due to an increase in average interest bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of funds.\nThe Company’s net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.52% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.62% for the immediately preceding quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 3.67% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.73% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSignificant offsetting factors impacting the declines in net interest margin for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, included:\nThe tax-equivalent yield on loans increased to 5.15% for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 from 5.01% and 5.11% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting increased yields on both non-covered and covered loans. The tax-equivalent yield on non-covered loans was 3.80% and 3.75%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3.56% and 3.58% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The most significant factor contributing to increased yields on non-covered loans was the impact of increases in benchmark interest rates. The tax-equivalent yield on covered loans increased to 60.90% and 55.22%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 from 46.43% and 41.82% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities increased to 2.89% and 3.02%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 from 2.87% and 2.84% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Growth of non-covered loans and investment securities at yields lower than the overall yield on interest earning assets. The average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased to 1.25% and 1.12%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 from 0.93% for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting higher average rates on both interest bearing deposits and FHLB advances. Increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities primarily reflect increases in short-term market interest rates.\nThe Company’s net interest margin continues to be impacted by reclassifications from non-accretable difference to accretable yield on ACI loans. Non-accretable difference at acquisition represented the difference between the total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received on these loans. The accretable yield on ACI loans represented the amount by which undiscounted expected future cash flows exceeded the recorded investment in the loans. As the Company’s expected cash flows from ACI loans have increased since the FSB Acquisition, the Company has reclassified amounts from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.\nChanges in accretable yield on ACI loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at December 31, 2015 $ 902,565 Reclassifications from non-accretable difference 76,751 Accretion (303,931 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 675,385 Reclassifications from non-accretable difference, net 81,501 Accretion (301,827 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 455,059 Non-interest income\nNon-interest income totaled $46.5 million and $157.9 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.3 million and $106.4 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $17.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $16.1 million in gain on sale of covered loans, net of the related loss on FDIC indemnification.\nThe most significant factors contributing to the $51.5 million increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 included (i) an increase of $19.0 million in gain on sale of investment securities available for sale, (ii) an increase of $18.7 million in gain on sale of covered loans, net of the related loss on FDIC indemnification, and (iii) an increase of $9.1 million in lease financing income.\nIncreases in gain on sale of investment securities primarily reflected gains recognized in 2017 from the sale of certain securities formerly covered under the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement and originally acquired at significant discounts in the FSB Acquisition. Increases in gain on sale of covered loans, net of the related loss on FDIC indemnification, primarily related to better than expected pricing on the sale of substantially all of the covered home equity loans and lines of credit in the fourth quarter of 2017. Increases in lease financing income generally corresponded to growth in the operating lease portfolio.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expense totaled $161.3 million and $635.0 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $156.2 million and $590.4 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The most significant driver of the increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was professional fees of $6.8 million related to the discrete income tax benefit recognized during the quarter.\nThe most significant components of the $44.5 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were (i) an increase in amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset of $16.4 million, (ii) an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $14.8 million and (iii) an increase of $9.4 million in professional fees.\nAmortization of the FDIC indemnification asset was $41.1 million and $176.5 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $43.4 million and $160.1 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The amortization rate increased to 49.65% and 42.90%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 from 31.05% and 25.14%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. As the expected cash flows from ACI loans have increased, expected cash flows from the FDIC indemnification asset have decreased, resulting in continued increases in the amortization rate.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe effective income tax rate was (251.3)% and (51.9)%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 31.3% and 32.7%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The effective income tax rates for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 reflect a discrete income tax benefit of $327.9 million related to a matter that arose during an ongoing audit of the Company's 2013 federal income tax return. During that audit, the Company asserted that U.S. federal income taxes paid in respect of certain income previously reported by the Company for its 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years related to the basis assigned to certain loans acquired in the FSB Acquisition should be refunded to the Company, in light of guidance issued after the relevant returns had been filed (including Treasury Regulations finalized in October 2017 clarifying and modifying the treatment of such acquired loans). The IRS issued a Field Attorney's Advice in the fourth quarter of 2017 agreeing with the Company's position. The discrete tax benefit recognized includes expected refunds of federal income tax of $295 million, as well as estimated interest on the federal refund and estimated refunds from certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. Although the Company expects to receive the federal tax refund following completion of the audit, the Company cannot provide assurances as to when or if it will ultimately receive the refund (or the related state and local refunds) because the IRS has not yet finalized its entire internal process, or provided the Company with a notice of proposed adjustment or revenue agent report and the refund claims are subject to review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Company is continuing to evaluate whether it has claims in other state jurisdictions and whether it may have any claims for federal or state income taxes relating to tax years prior to 2012. The Company cannot provide assurances as to when or to what extent it may have any claims relating to such other state and local taxing jurisdictions or in respect of prior tax years.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law on December 22, 2017, reducing the statutory corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment was recognized in earnings during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a tax benefit of $3.7 million. The decrease in the corporate income tax rate is currently expected to reduce the Company's effective tax rate to a range of approximately 23% to 24%.\nExcluding the impact of the discrete income tax benefit and the impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the effective income tax rate was 27.6% and 30.1%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 31.3% and 32.7%, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The adjusted effective income tax rate in all of the periods presented differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the effect of income not subject to tax, partially offset by state income taxes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is relevant to understanding the capital position and performance of the Company. Disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure also provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions.

Concurrently with the FSB Acquisition, BankUnited entered into two loss sharing agreements, or the Loss Sharing Agreements, which covered certain legacy assets, including the entire legacy loan portfolio and OREO, and certain purchased investment securities. Assets covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements are referred to as “covered assets” (or, in certain cases, “covered loans”). The Loss Sharing Agreements do not apply to subsequently purchased or originated loans or other assets. Effective May 22, 2014 and consistent with the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, loss share coverage was terminated for those commercial loans and OREO and certain investment securities that were previously covered under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, the covered assets are subject to a stated loss threshold whereby the FDIC will reimburse BankUnited for 80% of losses, including certain interest and expenses, up to the $4.0 billion stated threshold and 95% of losses in excess of the $4.0 billion stated threshold. The Company’s current estimate of cumulative losses on the covered assets is approximately $3.6 billion. The Company has received $2.7 billion from the FDIC in reimbursements under the Loss Sharing Agreements for claims filed for incurred losses as of December 31, 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance.\nThe Company generally identifies forward-looking statements by terminology such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on the historical performance of the Company and its subsidiaries or on the Company’s current plans, estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by the Company will be achieved. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions, including (without limitations) those relating to the Company’s operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity, as well as risks that the tax refund for which a discrete income tax benefit was recorded is not received by the Company or is delayed, further determinations by or communications with the IRS that may supplement or change the notifications provided by the IRS to the Company to date, formal or informal changes in policy of the IRS with respect to the tax position giving rise to the discrete income tax benefit, the ability of the Company to pursue and obtain recoveries in respect of tax years prior to 2012 and the ability of the Company to pursue and obtain refunds in respect of previously paid state or local taxes. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the Company’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company’s actual results may vary materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.
