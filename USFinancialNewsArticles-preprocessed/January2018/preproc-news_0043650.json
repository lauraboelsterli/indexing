    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT) today announced leadership updates as the company continues to focus on growth and development of its core business lines. Mike Jones, who previously led the company's Equipment Finance business, was named president of the Business Capital unit, effective immediately. Jeff Lytle, a 22-year veteran of the railcar leasing industry and currently a senior vice president in CIT's Rail operation, has been named president of the Rail business, effective April 1, 2018. In these roles, both will report to CIT Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Ellen R. Alemany and serve on the company's Executive Management Committee.\nSteve Solk, who previously was president of both the Business Capital and Consumer Banking units, will now focus on the Consumer Banking business as CIT continues to grow its deposit franchises. Solk will also maintain oversight for the Commercial Services unit, which was previously part of Business Capital. George Cashman, president of Rail, has elected to retire in June 2018, and will work with Lytle over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition.\n\"We entered 2018 with a strong focus on growing our business and expanding on our core strengths in the marketplace. I'm pleased to have Mike and Jeff lead two of our key business lines and build upon the progress we have made in these areas,\" said Alemany. \"One of CIT's strengths is our deep expertise in our business segments, and we were able to draw on that internal strength in naming the new heads of our Business Capital and Rail units.\"\nAlemany continued, \"These changes will also allow Steve to focus primarily on the growth and evolution of our deposit franchises and consumer banking initiatives. This is an important area for CIT, and I'm pleased to have Steve build on the momentum created over the last year. I also want to thank George for his steadfast leadership in managing the Rail business and developing a strong team of professionals in that business.\"\nCIT's Business Capital unit empowers small, mid and large cap businesses by providing equipment financing solutions via technology-enabled platforms and market leading structuring expertise.
