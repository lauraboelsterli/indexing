    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (NYSE: KS) (\"KapStone\") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to WestRock Company (NYSE: WRK) (\"WestRock\").\nOn January 29, 2018, KapStone announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with WestRock. Under the terms of the agreement, KapStone stockholders will have the option to receive $35.00 per share in cash, or to elect to receive 0.4981 WestRock shares per KapStone share, with elections of stock consideration capped at 25% of the outstanding KapStone shares but no limit on the number of KapStone shares that can receive cash consideration.\nThe investigation concerns whether the KapStone board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for KapStone shares of common stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of KapStone and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
