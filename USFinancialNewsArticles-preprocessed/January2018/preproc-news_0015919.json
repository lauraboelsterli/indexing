    "text": "CASABLANCA, Morocco, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Moroccoâ€™s economic growth will slow to 2.8 percent this year, down from 4 percent in 2017, officials forecast on Wednesday, blaming a decline in agricultural production.\nA lack of rainfall will cause farming output to fall by 1.3 percent this year after a 13.6 percent gain last year due to better weather conditions, officials told reporters.\nAnnual inflation will rise to 1.5 percent in 2018 from 0.2 percent last year, the government said in a statement. The budget deficit would fall to 3.5 percent in 2018 from 4 percent last year.
