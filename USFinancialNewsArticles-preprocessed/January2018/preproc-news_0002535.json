    "text": "PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Athene Holding Ltd. (NYSE:ATH) (“Athene”) announced it has completed the deconsolidation of AGER Bermuda Holding Ltd. (“AGER”), the former holding company of Athene Holding Ltd.’s (“Athene”) European operations. With the deconsolidation of AGER from Athene, it is necessary to change the name of AGER to Athora Holding Ltd. which will be launched in mid-January 2018.\nAGER’s successful capital raise in April 2017, representing approximately €2.2 billion, laid the foundation for its growth in Europe and was an important step toward AGER’s goal of becoming a European run-off consolidator and life reinsurance partner. In August of 2017, AGER announced its intention to acquire Aegon Ireland, a Dublin-based insurer, and AGER expects to draw down capital to close the acquisition following satisfaction of all conditions to closing, including receipt of regulatory approval.\nAthene remains a minority shareholder in AGER along with other global investors including affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO). Additionally, Athene will be a preferred reinsurer for AGER’s spread liabilities and have representation on its board of directors.\nAbout Athene Holding Ltd.\nAthene, through its subsidiaries, is a leading retirement services company that issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. The products offered by Athene include:\nRetail fixed and fixed indexed annuity products; Reinsurance arrangements with third-party annuity providers; and Institutional products, such as funding agreements and group annuity contracts related to pension risk transfers.\nAthene Holding Ltd. is a New York Stock Exchange listed company (NYSE:ATH). Athene's principal subsidiaries include Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company, a Delaware-domiciled insurance company, Athene Annuity and Life Company, an Iowa-domiciled insurance company, Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company, and Athene Life Re Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
