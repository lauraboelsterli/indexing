Slideshow (3 Images) \nHe finished with 15 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists. \nPelicans coach Alvin Gentry says Cousins would get an MRI on Saturday. He had just been picked as part of LeBron James’ team in the upcoming All Star Game. \n”We just have to keep going, that’s all we can do,“ team mate Anthony Davis told reporters. ”We have just got to move on to the next game Sunday and try and go out there and do the same thing.” Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
