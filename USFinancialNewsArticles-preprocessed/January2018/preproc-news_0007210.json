    "text": "Stan Badz/PGA TOUR | Getty Images Golfers in Chandler, Arizona. \nChandler, Arizona topped WalletHub's list, thanks to high scores for the strength of its job market as well as favorable socioeconomic conditions for workers. The largest employer in Chandler is Intel . \nIn fact, four cities in Arizona made it into the top 10, including Scottsdale, Peoria and Gilbert. These cities benefit from the booming healthcare industry and significant elderly populations. \nThe highest ranking city outside of Arizona is San Francisco . Despite placing 43rd for its expensive socioeconomic environment , the city by the bay's red-hot job market helped propel it to the top of the list. \nEven though conditions seem bright for job seekers, Peter Cappelli, Professor of Management and Director for the Center for Human Resources at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania says that the current administration is not helping job seekers. \n\"Employers don't like uncertainty, and this administration hasn't been good on that dimension,\" he tells WalletHub . \"The macroeconomists expect the tax cuts, if they come as predicted, to have little effect on job growth; it is demand that causes companies to hire, not corporate tax rates.\" \nLike this story?
