    "text": "Jan 19 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories in the Financial Times. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nHeadlines\nHSBC agrees to $101.5 million penalty in settlement of FX rigging case\n( on.ft.com/2DrUkv6 )\nNestle looks to shake up board amid activist pressure\n( on.ft.com/2Do3zwz )\nRyanair strikes pay rise deal with UK air crew\n( on.ft.com/2DnbSZr )\nSteinhoff seeks lender support to save business\n( on.ft.com/2DljrzM )\nOverview\nHSBC Holdings Plc has agreed to pay a $101.5 million to settle a criminal probe with the U.S. Department of Justice over its attempts to manipulate foreign exchange markets.\nNestle SA was nominating three new independent directors to its board on Thursday, seven months after activist investor Dan Loeb, criticised the world’s biggest food company as being “stuck in its old ways.”\nRyanair Holdings Plc appeared to move a step closer to resolving a long-running battle with pilots over wages and conditions after air crew in the company’s 15 UK bases, including its biggest base at London Stansted, accepted pay increases of up to 20 percent.\nScandal-hit South African retailer Steinhoff was in talks with banks to secure additional financing and a temporary waiver over credit covenants in a move to ”meet business critical payments’ and keep the company afloat.
