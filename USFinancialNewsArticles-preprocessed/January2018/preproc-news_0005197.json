Reuters/Emmanuel Foudrot/File Photo \n(Reuters) - Action camera maker GoPro Inc ( GPRO.O ) is cutting about 200 to 300 jobs in its aerial products division this week, technology news website TechCrunch reported on Thursday. \nThe job cuts are part of a bigger restructuring in the company, TechCrunch reported, citing a letter sent to impacted employees. tcrn.ch/2CEcEAS ADVERTISEMENT \nThe employees were relieved from duties on Thursday, but will continue to be on the company's payroll until Feb. 16, TechCrunch reported, citing sources. \nGoPro — whose cameras are worn by surfers, skydivers and other action junkies — has been struggling in recent years as cheaper rivals emerge and smartphones feature increasingly advanced cameras. \nGoPro did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
