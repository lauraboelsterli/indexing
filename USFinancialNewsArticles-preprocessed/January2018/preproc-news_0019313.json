I am really looking forward to the rest of the year,” Kerber said in a court-side interview after claiming a first title since her U.S. Open triumph. \n“I am playing amazing tennis again and I am just feeling great.” Tennis - Sydney International - Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney, Australia, January 13, 2018. Germany's Angelique Kerber celebrates winning the Women's final against Australia's Ashleigh Barty. REUTERS/Steve Christo \nAfter some tight early service games, Barty double-faulted to hand Kerber the first break and a 3-2 lead, and the German served out the opening set with little trouble. \nThe second set witnessed an early exchange of breaks before Kerber broke the Australian to love to move 4-3 ahead and picked up her 11th career title when Barty found the net after yet another powerful Kerber forehand.
