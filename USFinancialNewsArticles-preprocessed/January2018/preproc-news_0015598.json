    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 7:58 PM / in 23 minutes Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: 'I expect new sanctions on Iran'   U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin   he expected U.S. President Donald Trump to impose new sanctions on Iran. \n“I am expecting new sanctions on Iran,” Mnuchin told reporters. “We continue to look at them. We’ve rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming.” \nTrump faces a Friday deadline on whether to waive sanctions on Iran as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. A U.S. official said on Wednesday that if Trump waived those sanctions, the administration would impose new, targeted measures against Iranian businesses and people.
