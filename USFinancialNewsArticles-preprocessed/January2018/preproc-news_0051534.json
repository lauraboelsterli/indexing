    "text": "AIKEN, S.C., Jan. 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Security Federal Corporation (“Company”) (OTCBB:SFDL), the holding company for Security Federal Bank (“Bank”), today announced earnings for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income before taxes increased $509,000 or 6.4% to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.8 million in 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”) was signed into law which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. The impact was a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax provision of approximately $628,000. As a result, the Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.9 million or $2.01 per common share (basic) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.2 million or $2.09 per common share (basic) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nChief Executive Officer Chris Verenes commented, “2017 was a solid year for Security Federal with strong growth in core earnings and continued loan growth. The results were muted slightly as a result of the Act however, looking beyond this we expect to see significant future benefits from the legislation.”\nNet loans receivable grew $30.8 million or 8.6% to $390.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $359.7 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits increased $48.0 million or 7.3% to $702.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $654.1 million at December 31, 2016. As a result, net interest income increased $740,000 or 3.0% to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-performing assets improved $1.4 million or 17.0% to $6.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $8.2 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets represented 0.79% and 1.01% of total assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Consistent with the decrease in non-performing assets, total charges to the provision for loan losses decreased as well. Total charges to the provision were $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, $200,000 of which was recorded during the fourth quarter. The provision for loan losses was $500,000 for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $943,000 or 14.7% to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $6.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $224,000 increase in gain on sale of loans combined with a $632,000 increase in bank owned life insurance income. During 2017, the Bank recognized $654,000 in death benefits in addition to $506,000 in income related to an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies.\nNon-interest expense increased $1.4 million or 6.0% to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The most significant increase was in salaries and employee benefits expense, which increased $1.3 million or 10.3%. The increase in non-interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in prepayment penalties on FHLB advances. The Bank prepaid $17.9 million in higher rate FHLB advances and incurred $789,000 in prepayment penalties during 2016 compared to no prepayment penalties in 2017.\nNet income available to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $909,000 or $0.31 per common share (basic) compared to $1.4 million or $0.49 per common share (basic) for the same quarter in 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company received a one-time preferred stock redemption discount of $660,000. The discount was recognized in net income available to common shareholders during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 and also contributed to the higher earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2017. Excluding the effects of the tax reform in 2017 and the preferred stock redemption discount in 2016, fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders increased $768,000 or 99.9% to $1.5 million in 2017 compared to $769,000 for the same quarter in 2016.\nTotal assets increased $56.1 million or 6.9% to $868.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $812.7 million at December 31, 2016. Investment and mortgage-backed securities increased $24.4 million or 6.3% to $412.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $387.6 million at December 31, 2016.\nSecurity Federal Bank has 15 full service branch locations in Aiken, Ballentine, Clearwater, Columbia, Graniteville, Langley, Lexington, North Augusta, Wagener, and West Columbia, South Carolina and Evans, Georgia. A full range of financial services, including trust and investments, are provided by the Bank and insurance services are provided by the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Insurance, Inc.\nFor additional information contact Jessica Cummins, Chief Financial Officer, at (803) 641-3000.\nForward-looking statements :\nCertain matters discussed in this press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
