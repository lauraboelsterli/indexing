    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus ( AIR.PA ) Chief Executive Tom Enders signed a non-binding agreement with Turkish Airlines ( THYAO.IS ) on a potential order for 25 A350-900 aircraft, during an official visit by Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in Paris on Friday.\nTurkish Airlines, one of the worldâ€™s fastest-growing carriers, is a major customer of both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing.\nState-owned Turkish Airlines is one of a handful of carriers whose dealings with plane-makers tend to accelerate around major diplomatic events.\nIn September, it signed a surprise provisional order for 40 Boeing 787-9 planes while Erdogan was in New York for the UN General Assembly.\nThe tentative Airbus deal was inked during a ceremony attended by Erdogan and his host, French President Emmanuel Macron. Turkish Airlines confirmed in a subsequent statement that it had begun negotiations with Airbus on the plane deal.\nAirbus is also in negotiations to sell planes to China during a visit by Macron next week.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Writing by Laurence Frost; Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ",
