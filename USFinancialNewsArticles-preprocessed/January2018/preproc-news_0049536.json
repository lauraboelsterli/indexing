    "text": "Getty Images Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. \nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who abruptly stepped down on Monday , told friends that he felt pressure to leave from the bureau's Director Christopher Wray, The New York Times reported . \nWray raised concerns about an impending inspector general report about the actions of FBI officials when the bureau was investigating both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, the report said. After Wray suggested putting McCabe into another job, which would have been a demotion, the FBI's No. 2 official chose to leave, according to the Times. \nAn FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. \nMcCabe already planned to leave in March, when he was eligible for full retirement benefits. \nPresident Trump has repeatedly and publicly blasted McCabe for what he calls political motivations behind the investigations into Clinton's email server and the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. The president and some congressional Republicans accused him of bias. \nMcCabe was a holdover from the tenure of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May. He had served in the FBI's No. 2 role since January 2016. \nMcCabe briefly was acting FBI director until Wray got confirmed to the post.",
