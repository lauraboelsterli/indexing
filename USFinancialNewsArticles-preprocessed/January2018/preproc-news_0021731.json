    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average eked out gains on Tuesday, with expectations for strong corporate earnings underpinning sentiment.\nInformation technology service provider Obic Co rose as much as 7.9 percent to an 18-year peak after the Nikkei reported that the company’s operating profit for the nine months through December likely rose by a fifth.\nExporters were also given some breathing space as the dollar’s recent weakening against the yen paused, with the greenback last up 0.3 percent against its Japanese peer.\nToyota Motor Corp edged up 0.5 percent and Nissan Motor Co added 0.3 percent.\nThe Nikkei was up 0.38 percent at 23,804.67 as of 0149 GMT, confined in a narrow range as Asian markets struggled to find firm leads with U.S. bourses closed on Monday for a holiday.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.18 percent to 1,887.31.\nOut of Tokyo’s 33 subindexes, 15 were in positive territory, led by fish and forestry and metal products . The losing sectors were led by iron and steel and sea transport. (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sam Holmes)\n ",
