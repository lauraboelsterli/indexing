In addition, AM0010 is being evaluated in a Phase 3 randomized pivotal clinical trial in pancreatic cancer patients, which compares a combination of AM0010 and FOLFOX to FOLFOX alone, as a second-line therapy after tumor progression during or following a gemcitabine-containing regimen. The Company also has a number of other immuno-oncology product candidates aimed at treating a variety of cancers in combination with standard of care treatments and emerging immunotherapies. These candidates are in various stages of pre-clinical development, and include: AM0001, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor; AM0003, an anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor; AM0015, a form of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokine; and AM0012, a form of recombinant human Interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/armo-biosciences-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-300588683.html\nSOURCE ARMO BioSciences, Inc.",
