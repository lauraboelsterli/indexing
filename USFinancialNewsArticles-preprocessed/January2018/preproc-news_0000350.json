Garner as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately.\nMr. Garner brings over two decades of senior finance and investor relations experience to CONMED, including 15 years at C. R. Bard, Inc. (Bard), where he most recently served as Vice President, Investor Relations. Prior to that, he was Vice President, Controller (Division CFO) of Bard’s Medical Division, Director of the company’s Corporate Financial Reporting, and Controller for the company’s Reynosa Operations. Prior to joining Bard, he served as Controller and Acting CFO at Echopass Corporation (currently Genesys) and Value Planning Manager at Futura Industries Corporation. Mr. Garner earned an MBA from University of Texas – Pan American and a BS in Accounting from Brigham Young University. He is also a Certified Public Accountant.\nCurt R. Hartman, CONMED’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are very excited to welcome Todd to CONMED and to our executive team. During his distinguished career, he has made significant contributions to building and transforming finance teams, implementing innovative reporting processes, as well as executing large-scale capital allocation and merger and acquisition strategies. Todd’s deep experience and senior leadership skills will be instrumental in continuing to advance our achievement of the Company’s growth and profitability goals.”\nTodd W. Garner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “CONMED has built an impressive executive team and product portfolio, both of which position the Company as an innovative industry leader. I am excited about the strategic milestones the Company has achieved to date and am committed to contributing to CONMED reaching its next level of operational and financial success.”\nIn November 2017, CONMED announced that Luke A. Pomilio, who has served as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the past three years, had announced his intention to retire. Mr. Pomilio will remain with CONMED in the role of Advisor to Chief Financial Officer and continue with the Company through March 1, 2019 in order to facilitate a smooth transition.\nThe Company has also announced the grant of an inducement award to Mr. Garner pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.

The Stock Options will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of CONMED's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on January 2, 2018.
