    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 4:45 AM / Updated an hour ago Tennis-Chung becomes South Korea's first grand slam semi-finalist Ian Ransom 1 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Chung Hyeon’s trailblazing run through the Australian Open continued on Wednesday as the South Korean tossed American Tennys Sandgren aside 6-4 7-6(5) 6-3 to become his nation’s first grand slam semi-finalist. \nBespectacled like Clark Kent but playing like Superman at a sunbathed Rod Laver Arena, world number 58 Chung became the lowest ranked player into the last four at Melbourne Park since Marat Safin in 2004. \nWorld number 97 Sandgren battled gamely to save five match points but finally surrendered when he sent a desperate retrieve ballooning over the baseline. \nThe 21-year-old Chung will meet the winner of Roger Federer and Tomas Berdych for a place in the final.
