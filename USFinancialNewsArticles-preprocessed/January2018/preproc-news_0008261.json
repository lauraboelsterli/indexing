    "text": "CLEVELAND, Jan. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ViewRay, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAY) today announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The preliminary results reported have not been audited and are subject to change.\nFourth Quarter & Full Year 2017 Preliminary Highlights:\nRecognized revenue on 4 MRIdian Linac Systems in Q4 2017. This resulted in total 2017 revenue of approximately $34 million primarily from 6 MRIdian Linac Systems. Received new orders for MRIdian Linac systems in Q4 2017 totaling approximately $34 million, compared to orders totaling $24.3 million in Q4 2016. Received new orders for MRIdian Linac systems in 2017 totaling over $110 million, compared to orders totaling $77.0 million in 2016.

Raanes, president and chief executive officer of ViewRay. \"We completed the shipment or installation of 5 MRIdian Linac systems in the fourth quarter, but expect to recognize revenue of approximately $7 million on one of them in a subsequent period.\"\nAbout ViewRay\nViewRay®, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAY), designs, manufactures and markets the MRIdian® radiation therapy system. MRIdian is built upon a proprietary high-definition MR imaging system designed from the ground up to address the unique challenges and clinical workflow for advanced radiation oncology. Unlike MR systems used in diagnostic radiology, MRIdian's high-definition MR was purposely built to deliver high-precision radiation without unnecessary beam distortion, and consequently, help to mitigate skin toxicity and other safety concerns that may otherwise arise when high magnetic fields interact with radiation beams.
