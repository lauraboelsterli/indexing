    "text": "TROY, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Horizon Global Corporation (NYSE: HZN), the world’s leading manufacturer of branded towing and trailering equipment, today announced expectations for full-year 2017 results, which are revised from the Company’s previous guidance. For full-year 2017, Horizon Global expects:\nRevenue growth in the range of 37.2 to 37.6 percent, revised from prior guidance of 38 to 41 percent Operating profit in the range of $34.0 million to $36.0 million, revised from prior guidance of $38.2 million to $44.2 million Adjusted operating profit (1) in the range of $49.0 million to $51.6 million, revised from prior guidance of $53.0 million to $59.0 million Diluted loss per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.08, revised from earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.60 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) in the range of $0.88 to $0.96, revised from prior guidance of $1.04 to $1.14 Operating cash flow in the range of $12.0 million to $16.0 million, revised from prior guidance of $40.0 million to $50.0 million\nThe revised expectations resulted from a number of factors in the Company’s business. Horizon Americas’ revenue fell below expectations for the full year due to a sales shortfall resulting from system stock take-out by retailers, as well as delivery delays during the fourth quarter related to the Company’s transition to its new distribution facility in Kansas City. Horizon Europe-Africa’s operating profit fell below expectations due to an unfavorable sales mix and increased material costs.\nIn addition, diluted earnings per share were reduced by our estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Operating cash flow fell short of our previous guidance on lower net income and higher-than-expected working capital levels.\n“While we are disappointed with the financial results in the fourth quarter and the impact on our full year, we are taking actions to address these operating issues,” said Mark Zeffiro, President and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Global. “We remain encouraged by the many accomplishments in 2017 that we expect will set the stage for future growth. We remain positive about our outlook for 2018, and will provide additional details on 2017 performance when we report our full results in early March. At that time, we will provide more information regarding the dynamics affecting Horizon Americas and an action plan to address the factors contributing to the shortfall. In the interim, we continue to move forward with the Brink Group acquisition and remain focused on driving improved performance over the long term.”\nAbout Horizon Global\nHorizon Global is the #1 designer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of high-quality, custom-engineered towing, trailering, cargo management and other related accessory products in North America, Australia and Europe.
