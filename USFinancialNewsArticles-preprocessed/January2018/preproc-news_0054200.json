He is the grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt, Hassan al-Banna. \nRamadan took a leave of absence from Oxford last November after two women filed complaints in France alleging rape. He has denied the allegations and filed a complaint for slander against author Henda Ayari, one of his accusers. Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Richard Lough",
