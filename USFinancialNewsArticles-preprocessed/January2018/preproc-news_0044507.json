    "text": "BROOKLYN, N.Y., Jan. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:DCOM) (the “Company”), the parent company of Dime Community Bank (the “bank”), today reported net income of $51.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, or $1.38 per diluted common share. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income was $15.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share.\nHighlights for the fiscal year of 2017 included:\nSuccessful launch of the Business Banking division, with commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan balances of $137 million and direct-sourced commercial real estate (“CRE”) loan balances of $98.6 million at year-end; Consolidated Company CRE concentration ratio declined to approximately 778% at year-end 2017, versus 903% at year-end 2016; Continued expense discipline, with operating expenses to average assets (adjusted for non-recurring expenses) remaining well-controlled on a year-over-year basis; and Reported book value per share and tangible book value (common equity less goodwill divided by number of shares outstanding) per share grew to $16.00 and $14.51, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 included:\nContinued the build out of the Business Banking division via the hire of Alan Green, Senior Vice President of Business Banking, who will operate from the bank’s Manhattan office; Hired a proven industry veteran, Nancy Tomich, Senior Vice President and Head of Residential Lending, who will be responsible for building the bank’s residential lending infrastructure; Significantly bolstered the risk management department with the hires of Chris Porzelt, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, who will be responsible for managing all aspects of the buildout of the bank’s enterprise risk management function, and Kevin Corbett, Senior Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, who will be responsible for overseeing the bank’s credit administration department; Successfully completed a $280 million securitization of multifamily loans in December through a Freddie Mac sponsored “Q-deal” securitization (“Loan Securitization”); transaction represents first such multifamily loan securitization for a bank headquartered in the metropolitan New York City marketplace; Loan-to-deposit ratio declined to 127% at year-end 2017 versus 137% at the end of the third quarter of 2017; and Credit quality continued to remain pristine, with total non-performing loans to loans of 0.01%.\nKenneth J. Mahon, President and CEO of the Company, commented, “During 2017, Dime put into place the necessary building blocks for our transformation towards a leading community commercial bank. The early results of our Business Banking initiative are extremely promising. Importantly, the Business Banking division ended the year with approximately $52 million of low-cost relationship-based deposits at an average cost of approximately 10 basis points and approximately 43% of the year-to-date originations have been floating rate loans.”\nMr. Mahon concluded, “Our focus in 2018 is to continue to grow relationship-based loans and improve the composition of our deposit base. At the same time, we will remain steadfast in maintaining our key competitive strengths of expense discipline and maintaining pristine credit quality.”\nManagement’s Discussion of 2017 Operating Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income in 2017 was $152.7 million, an increase of $9.2 million (+6.4%) from 2016. The increase reflects a $16.5 million increase in interest income compared to a $7.2 million increase in interest expense. The growth in interest income was driven by an increase of $656.6 million (+12.3%) in average interest-earning assets, which more than offset the 13 basis point decline in average yield. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase of $579.9 million (+16.4%) in average interest-bearing deposits as well as an increase in the cost of borrowed funds of 13 basis points. Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.54% during 2017, compared to 2.68% in 2016. NIM was negatively impacted in 2017 by lower income recognized from loan prepayment activity. For 2017, income from prepayment activity totaled $5.0 million, benefiting NIM by 8 basis points, compared to $9.0 million, or 17 basis points in 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets grew by $398.0 million (+6.6%) in 2017, primarily the result of an increase in investment securities by $338.3 million and cash by $56.0 million. While the decrease in total loans during 2017 was $34.8 million, a shift in the portfolio mix resulted in a decrease of real estate loans by $168.9 million and an increase in C&I loans by $134.6 million. Total loan originations were $899.9 million during 2017, down from $1.54 billion in 2016, of which $757.9 million were real estate loans and $139.7 million were C&I and other loans. The real estate loan payoff rate of 10.8% in 2017 was less than the 2016 payoff rate of 14.6%. Deposits remained relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. Borrowings rose by $381.8 million, primarily due to the increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $338.9 million. The additional increase of $42.9 million in borrowings during 2017 was the result of the issuance of subordinated debt in June 2017, offset by the redemption of trust preferred securities in July 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income of $21.5 million in 2017 included gains of $10.4 million from the sale of real estate property, $2.6 million from the sale of the Company’s pooled trust preferred securities portfolio, and $1.5 million from the sale of loans. Non-interest income of $75.9 million in 2016 included gains of $68.2 million from the sale of real estate property. Excluding these gains, non-interest income was $7.0 million in 2017 and $7.7 million in 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $85.0 million in 2017 and $83.8 million during 2016. During 2017, the Company recognized non-recurring expenses of $1.3 million for loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of trust preferred securities and $1.7 million related to de-conversion costs associated with the planned change in the bank’s core processor. During 2016, the Company recognized a non-cash, non-tax deductible expense of $11.3 million on the prepayment of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) share acquisition loan. Excluding these items, non-interest expense was $82.0 million in 2017 and $72.5 million in 2016, an increase of $9.5 million. The increase was primarily the result of higher occupancy expense of $2.1 million, data processing expense of $1.4 million, marketing expense of $1.7 million, accelerated consulting expenses of $1.4 million, and recognition of the bank’s first loss guarantee for the Loan Securitization totaling $0.4 million. The additional consulting expense was related to an earlier-than-anticipated completion of such services.\nThe ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 1.37% in 2017 compared to 1.51% in 2016. Excluding the non-recurring expenses mentioned above, the ratio was 1.32% and 1.31% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The efficiency ratio was 53.24% in 2017, down from 55.48% in 2016. Excluding the non-recurring expenses mentioned above, the ratio was 51.37% and 47.98% for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nManagement’s Discussion of Quarterly Operating Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38.7 million, comparable to the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of $0.8 million (+2.2%) over the fourth quarter of 2016. NIM was 2.50% during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 2.53% in the third quarter of 2017, and 2.67% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The linked quarter decrease in NIM was due to lower income recognized from loan prepayment activity and an increase in the cost of deposits of 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter of 2017, income from prepayment activity totaled $1.3 million, benefiting NIM by 8 basis points, compared to $1.4 million, or 9 basis points, during the third quarter of 2017, and $2.7 million, or 19 basis points, during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $6.20 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 7.8% (annualized) increase from $6.08 billion for the third quarter of 2017 and a 9.1% increase from $5.69 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.52%, 3.53%, and 3.64% for the fourth quarter of 2017, third quarter of 2017, and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Excluding prepayment income, the average yield on interest-earning assets was 3.44%, flat with the third quarter of 2017, and 2 basis points lower than fourth quarter 2016, while the average cost of funds was 1.19%, 5 basis points higher than the 1.14% cost of funds for third quarter of 2017 and 6 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLoans\nThe real estate loan portfolio decreased by $402.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Loan Securitization. Real estate loan originations were $70.6 million during the quarter, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%. Real estate loan amortization and satisfactions totaled $143.6 million, or 10.2% (annualized) of the portfolio balance, at an average rate of 4.11%. The annualized real estate loan payoff rate of 10.2% for fourth quarter 2017 was in line with the third quarter 2017 and lower than the fourth quarter 2016 (15.1%). Average real estate loans were $5.82 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $19.1 million (-1.3% annualized) from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of $263.7 million (+4.7%) from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncluded in total real estate loan originations during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $24.1 million of originations from the Business Banking division at a weighted average rate of 4.78%, compared to $41.5 million of originations at a weighted average rate of 4.62% during the third quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the bank had outstanding real estate loan commitments totaling $46.1 million, at an average interest rate approximating 4.20%, all of which are likely to close during the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nC&I loan originations were $27.5 million during the quarter, at a weighted average rate of 4.94%, compared to $44.6 million at a weighted average rate of 4.60% during the third quarter of 2017. Total C&I loan balances were $136.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $111.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nCash and Securities\nFourth quarter 2017 cash and securities balances increased by $320.4 million versus the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of the Loan Securitization which was completed in December 2017.\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds\nTotal deposits grew $32.3 million (+3.0% annualized) compared to the third quarter of 2017. This was primarily the result of a $66.4 million increase in certificates of deposits, offset by a $47.0 million decrease in money market accounts. Declines in money market accounts were primarily driven by outflows in DimeDirect, the bank’s online channel as the bank’s posted rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to lag many of its online competitors.\nThe average cost of deposits increased 5 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 0.91% as the bank selectively increased rates on certain deposit products in light of increased deposit competition.\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 127.2% at December 31, 2017, from 136.8% at September 30, 2017 and 128.3% at December 31, 2016. The linked quarter decline in the ratio was primarily the result of the Loan Securitization.\nTotal borrowings decreased $47.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the third quarter of 2017, as deposit growth outpaced loan growth. In the fourth quarter, the Company entered into $110.0 million of long-term borrowings (with initial terms of 2 years and more), at an average rate of 2.22%, versus $97.0 million of long-term borrowings at an average rate of 1.74% in the third quarter of 2017.\nNon-Interest Income\nNon-interest income was $13.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This includes gains of $10.4 million from the sale of real estate property and $1.5 million from the sale of loans. Non-interest income of $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2017 included gains of $2.6 million from the sale of the Company’s pooled trust preferred securities portfolio. Excluding these gains, non-interest income was $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.7 million during the third quarter of 2017, and comparable to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $22.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, $22.2 million during the third quarter of 2017, and $29.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company recognized non-recurring expenses of $1.3 million for loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of trust preferred securities and $1.7 million related to de-conversion costs associated with the planned change in the bank’s core processor. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a non-cash, non-tax deductible expense of $11.3 million on the prepayment of the ESOP share acquisition loan.\nExcluding these non-recurring items, non-interest expense was $19.2 million during the third quarter of 2017 and $18.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in non-interest expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 of $3.4 million versus the linked quarter was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and benefits by $1.2 million, accelerated consulting expenses of $1.4 million, and recognition of the bank’s first loss guarantee for the Loan Securitization totaling $0.4 million. The increase in salaries and benefits in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time bonus accrual of $0.4 million for non-executive employees, as part of the Company’s previously announced plan to share the benefits of the Federal tax cuts with employees. The accelerated consulting expense recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to an earlier-than-anticipated completion of such services.\nThe ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 1.41% during the fourth quarter of 2017, in line with the third quarter of 2017 (1.41%),and lower than the fourth quarter of 2016 (2.01%). Excluding the non-recurring expenses mentioned above, the ratio was 1.22% during the third quarter of 2017 and 1.25% during the fourth quarter of 2016. The efficiency ratio was 55.63% during the fourth quarter of 2017, comparable to 55.29% during the linked quarter, and lower than 74.58% during the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the non-recurring expenses mentioned above, the ratio was 47.8% during the third quarter of 2017 and 46.1% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense and Deferred Tax Asset and Liability Re-evaluation\nThe effective income tax rate was 50.0% during the fourth quarter of 2017, higher than the 35.2% recorded in the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of $3.1 million of tax expense, which represents a reduction of $0.08 per diluted share, recognized to re-value the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) that the President signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Company’s re-valuation of its net deferred tax asset is an estimate and subject to change as further clarification of the Act becomes available.\nThe Company estimates that its effective tax rate for 2018 will approximate 25% due to the new tax legislation.\nCredit Quality\nNon-performing loans were $0.5 million, or 0.01% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, a decrease from $0.8 million, or 0.01% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 0.38% of total loans at December 31, 2017, consistent with the 0.37% at September 30, 2017. At December 31, 2017, non-performing assets represented 3.4% of the sum of tangible capital plus the allowance for loan losses (this non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (“GAAP”) statistic is otherwise known as the \"Texas Ratio\") (see table at the end of this news release). A credit for loan losses of $1.0 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loan loss provision of $0.02 million during the third quarter of 2017, mainly as a result of the reduction in real estate loan balances by $402.5 million, (primarily as a result of the Loan Securitization), offset by growth in C&I loans on a linked quarter basis.\nCapital Management\nThe Company’s consolidated Tier 1 capital to average assets (“leverage ratio”), which was 8.61% at December 31, 2017, was in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe bank’s regulatory capital ratios continued to be in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements, inclusive of conservation buffer amounts. At December 31, 2017, the bank’s leverage ratio was 9.32%, while Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios were 12.73% and 13.13%, respectively.\nDiluted earnings per common share exceeded the quarterly $0.14 cash dividend per share by 192.86% during the fourth quarter of 2017, equating to a 34.15% payout ratio.\nBook value per share was $16.00 and tangible book value (common equity less goodwill divided by number of shares outstanding) per share was $14.51 at December 31, 2017.\nEarnings Call Information\nThe Company will conduct a conference call at 5:30 p.m. (ET) on January 25, 2018, during which President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth J. Mahon, will discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year performance, with a Q&A session to follow. Dial-in information for the live call is 1-888-317-6016.
