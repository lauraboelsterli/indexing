    "text": " 29 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Interserve sees higher 2018 profit outlook on lower costs Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British construction and services company Interserve ( IRV.L ), which issued multiple profit warnings last year, on Wednesday forecast better-than-expected operating profit for 2018 due to lower costs. \nInterserve has struggled with cost overruns in its energy from waste business, which it decided to exit in August 2016 after delays to a Glasgow contract caused it to book a provision. \nThe company said it was making good progress with its ‘Fit for Growth’ three-year initiative, focused on boosting efficiency and improving its company-wide procurement processes. \nInterserve said it expects cost savings of at least 40 million pounds to 50 million pounds by 2020 from the plan, with 2018 estimated to be 15 million pounds. \nThe company, which is reviewing its contract portfolio and non-trading balance sheet items, also said that discussions with lenders over longer-term funding were progressing. \nInterserve said it expects net debt to peak in the first half of 2018, partly due to ongoing refinancing activity. It expects net debt at year-end 2017 to be about 513 million pounds. Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr",
