    "text": "VIENNA, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Airline Niki filed for insolvency in Austria on Thursday, in a move to safeguard its agreed sale to British Airways owner IAG after a German court ruling put a question mark over the deal, a spokesman for Niki’s insolvency administrator said.\nNiki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany’s Lufthansa scrapped plans to buy the Austrian arm of insolvent Air Berlin, but a German regional court said earlier this week that Niki was not under German jurisdiction.\n“Niki filed for insolvency in Austria today,” a spokesman for administrator Lucas Floether said.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Shadia Nasralla\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
