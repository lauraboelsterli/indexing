    "text": "What the new tax withholding tables mean for your take-home pay Changes are coming to key forms that help determine your income tax. Withholding the right amount can be the difference between owing the IRS and getting a refund. SHARES Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a news conference in the Capitol where GOP senators said families and small businesses would benefit from tax reform on November 7, 2017. \nThe tax overhaul is likely giving your paycheck a boost come February. \nSo now is a good time to take a second look at your tax withholding at work. \nThe Treasury released its income tax withholding tables on Thursday, reflecting changes stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . In all, the new legislation has increased the standard deduction, done away with personal exemptions and trimmed individual income tax rates. \nThis means you could start seeing changes to your paychecks as early as next month. \nYou should take a look your withholding to make sure you're deducting the correct amount of taxes under the new legislation. \n\"You don't want a big refund, where you're giving an interest-free loan to the government,\" said Melissa Labant, director of tax policy and advocacy at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \n\"You also don't want a big balance due,\" she said. Your W-4 \nFor now, the Treasury's guidance is intended for employers to make adjustments to their payroll systems. \nIt's intended to work with a key form — the W-4 — that determines how much income tax is withheld from your pay, based on whether your spouse works, whether you have children and other factors. \nAt the moment, the IRS intends its guidance to work with the W-4 you currently have on file at your employer. \nHowever, the agency is working on a new Form W-4, and it plans on rolling out a calculator that will reflect the new tax law by the end of February. Further changes will be coming in 2019. A second look \nReviewing your W-4 is a good practice in any tax year. If not enough is withheld, you'll owe money come tax time. Pay too much, and you end up with a large refund . \n\"You may have different circumstances now compared to when you started working at your employer,\" Labant said. \nMajor life changes, including having a child or getting married, may warrant an update to your withholding. \nFor reference, here are the new income tax brackets for married couples.
