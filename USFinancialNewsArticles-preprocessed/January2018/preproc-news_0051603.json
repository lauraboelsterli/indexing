Elsewhere in the group, Toronto Dominion Bank rose 0.5 percent to C$74.61. \n* Shares of Shaw Communications rose 0.9 percent to C$26.98 after the company said it would offer about 6,500 of its 14,000 employees voluntary departure packages. \n* Financials and telecoms were the only two sectors to end in positive territory among the Toronto index’s 10 main groups. \n* The TSX posted three new 52-week highs and 10 new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 10 new 52-week highs and 57 new lows. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, down 10.3 percent at C$11.62; NGEx Resources, up 4.6 percent at C$1.15 and Bombardier , down 4.4 percent at C$3.44. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 227.04 million shares.
