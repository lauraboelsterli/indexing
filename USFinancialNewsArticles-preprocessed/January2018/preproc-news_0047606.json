    "text": "DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Thursday that a weaker U.S. dollar did not necessarily hurt his oil-producing nation.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Osinbajo also said the government was in constant consultation with all groups in the Niger Delta, the heart of the countryâ€™s oil industry.\nThe Niger Delta Avengers militant group has threatened to resume attacks in the region. Those attacks helped to push Nigeria into a recession in 2016. (Reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Mark Bendeich)\n ",
