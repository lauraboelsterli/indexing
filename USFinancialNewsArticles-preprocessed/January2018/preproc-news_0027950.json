    "text": "KITZBUEHEL, Austria (Reuters) - Germany’s Thomas Dressen tamed the dangerous Streif course to snatch a surprise victory in the men’s downhill on Saturday and beat specialist Beat Feuz and Aksel Lund Svindal.\nWith the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics only three weeks away, the 24-year-old was superb as he charged down the awe-inspiring course in a near flawless race for his first World Cup win.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “I still can’t believe it. It was always a dream to ski through the finish line and still be leading in Kitzbuehel,” a beaming Dressen told reporters. “It was just amazing.”\nSwiss Feuz, who led for a long time, was second a week after winning in Wengen, while Austrian Hannes Reichelt was third.\nNorwegian Svindal, who had suffered a season-ending injury at the Streif two years ago, won the Super-G on Friday but managed only eighth place in the downhill.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
