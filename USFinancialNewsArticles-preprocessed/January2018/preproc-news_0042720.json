It was up 4.5 percent from the prior week to 424.4 in the week ended Jan. 19, which was the highest since 462.1 in the Sept. 8 week. \nAverage interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages, or loans whose balances are $453,100 or less, rose to 4.36 percent, up 3 basis points from the prior week. This was highest since 4.46 percent in week of March 17. Reporting by Richard Leong",
