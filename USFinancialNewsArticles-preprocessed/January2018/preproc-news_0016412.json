    "text": "Wholesale inventories rebound strongly in November Wholesale inventories rose 0.8 percent in November. The Commerce Department's measure of wholesale inventories fell 0.5 percent in October, meeting expectations. An advance report from the U.S. Census Bureau showed wholesale inventories increasing 0.7 percent to $610.2 billion in November. Published 5 Hours Ago SHARES Xavierarnau | Getty Images \nU.S. wholesale inventories rose slightly more than initially estimated in November, suggesting that inventory investment will probably contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter. \nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories rebounded 0.8 percent after dropping 0.4 percent in October. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories jumped 0.7 percent in November. \nThe component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - also increased 0.8 percent in November. \nInventory investment contributed almost eight-tenths of a percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. Inventory investment accelerated in the third quarter after slowing sharply at the start of 2017. \nAuto inventories increased 0.7 percent in November, reversing October's 0.7 percent drop. There were also increases in inventories of petroleum, machinery and electrical goods. \nSales at wholesalers shot up 1.5 percent in November after increasing 0.8 percent in October. Sales of motor vehicles rose 1.2 percent in November after jumping 3.4 percent the prior month. \nAt November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.24 months to clear shelves, the fewest since November 2014, down from 1.25 months in October. \nThe monthly metric is built from a survey of about 4,200 U.S. wholesale firms. \nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates. \n--CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",
