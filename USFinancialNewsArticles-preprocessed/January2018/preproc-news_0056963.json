(Nasdaq:AEIS), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The company reported fourth quarter sales of $179.2 million. Fourth quarter GAAP loss from continuing operations was $29.0 million, or $0.73 per share. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $52.4 million, or $1.31 per diluted share.\n“Capped off by a strong fourth quarter in our semiconductor business, 2017 was a record-breaking year across the board as revenue and non-GAAP earnings grew to their highest levels in the company’s history,” said Yuval Wasserman, president and CEO of Advanced Energy. “Key to maintaining our market-leading position and continually outpacing the markets we serve is our ongoing innovation and technology leadership. We continued to demonstrate the sustainability of our model, allowing us to achieve our strategic and aspirational goals.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nSales were $179.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $176.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $135.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP loss from continuing operations was $29.0 million or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with income from continuing operations of $83.8 million or $2.09 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and income from continuing operations of $40.4 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 results were impacted by one-time tax expenses of $6.4 million associated with the write-down of solar inverter business and $72.9 million associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, which the company will continue to evaluate during the measurement period.\nNon-GAAP income from continuing operations was $52.4 million or $1.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, including $0.03 of favorable items. This compares with $48.0 million or $1.19 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and $42.6 million or $1.06 per diluted share in the same period last year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables below.\nThe company generated $49.6 million of operating cash from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFull Year 2017\nSales were $671.0 million in 2017 compared with $483.7 million in 2016, an increase of 39%.\nGAAP income from continuing operations was $136.1 million or $3.39 per diluted share in 2017 compared with $116.9 million or $2.92 per diluted share in 2016. Full year 2017 results were impacted by a one-time tax benefit of $33.8 million associated with the write-down of the solar inverter business and a one-time tax expense of $72.9 million associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, which the company will continue to evaluate during the measurement period.\nNon-GAAP income from continuing operations was $191.5 million or $4.77 per diluted share in 2017 compared with $124.6 million or $3.11 per diluted share in 2016. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables below.\nThe company generated $190.0 million in cash from continuing operations and ended the year with $410.4 million in cash and marketable securities.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe company’s financial statements for all periods presented reflect results for the continuing precision power business, with the discontinued inverter business included in discontinued operations for both the balance sheet and income statement. Further financial detail regarding the amounts related to the discontinued inverter business are available in the company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nBased on the company's current view, beliefs and assumptions, guidance for the first quarter of 2018 is within the following ranges and does not incorporate any potential adjustments during the measurement period associated with U.S. tax reform.\n﻿ Q1 2018 Revenues $183M - $193M GAAP operating margins from continuing operations 30.0% - 32.0% GAAP EPS from continuing operations $1.19 - $1.29 Non-GAAP operating margins from continuing operations 32.0% - 34.0% Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations $1.27 - $1.37 Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call tomorrow morning, Wednesday, January 31, 2018 at 6:30 a.m. Mountain Time/ 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss Advanced Energy's financial results.

Advanced Energy’s non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of non-cash related charges such as stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, as well as non-recurring items such as acquisition-related costs. Additionally, the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results exclude estimated income tax expense associated with U.S. tax reform. For the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 guidance, the company expects stock based compensation of $2.7 million and amortization of intangibles of $1.5 million. The non-GAAP measures included in this release are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, similar measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Advanced Energy believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of the company’s usual operations. The company uses these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, make business decisions, develop budgets, forecast future periods, assess trends and evaluate financial impacts of various scenarios. In addition, management's incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. Additionally, the company believes that these non-GAAP measures, in combination with its financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective. While some of the excluded items may be incurred and reflected in the company’s GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future, the company believes that the items excluded from certain non-GAAP measures do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. The use of non-GAAP measures has limitations in that such measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these measures should only be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Please refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe company’s guidance with respect to anticipated financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, potential future growth and profitability, our future business mix, expectations regarding future market trends and the company’s future performance within specific markets (e.g., statements regarding anticipated semiconductor and industrial market growth) and other statements herein or made on the above-announced conference call that are not historical information are within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
