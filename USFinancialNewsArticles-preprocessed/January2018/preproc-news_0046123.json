Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it,\" Musk wrote in a Twitter post. bit.ly/2l1A1JJ ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Model Y, to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 sedan, was tentatively scheduled to begin production in mid-2019, Reuters reported in June. \nThe electric vehicle maker first announced plans for a pickup truck last July, alongside a \"master plan\" to develop a commercial truck, a public transport bus and a compact sport utility vehicle.
