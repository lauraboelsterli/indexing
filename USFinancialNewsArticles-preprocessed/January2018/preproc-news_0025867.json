    "text": "QUINCY, Mass. (AP) — In a story Jan. 13 about a new Dunkin' Donuts store opening near Boston, The Associated Press reported erroneously that it would be the company's first location in the U.S. to be billed simply as Dunkin'. The chain says its first franchise to drop \"Donuts\" from its name did so last year in Pasadena, California.\nA corrected version of the story is below:\nDunkin' without the 'Donuts': New store tests shorter name\nA new Dunkin' Donuts store opening in the Boston suburb of Quincy is dropping 'Donuts' from its name\nQUINCY, Mass. (AP) — Dunkin' without the Donuts?\nA new Dunkin' Donuts store opening in the Boston suburb of Quincy is giving the idea a try, at least in name. Officials say the \"next generation\" store being unveiled Tuesday will be be billed simply as \"Dunkin.\"\nBut the chain's signature doughnuts aren't going anywhere. The restaurant will still serve the fried treats that have been a mainstay for the company since its founding in Quincy in 1950.\nThe shortened name is part of a broader rebranding at several of the company's stores. The Canton, Massachusetts-based company has been referring to itself as Dunkin' in advertisements for years, and last year, a franchise in Pasadena, California, became the first in the nation to drop \"Donuts\" from its name.\nThe Patriot Ledger reports the Quincy franchise also will pilot other new concepts, including multiple, high-tech drive-thru lanes.",
