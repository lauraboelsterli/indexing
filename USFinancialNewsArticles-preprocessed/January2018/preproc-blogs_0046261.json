    "text": "Last February, pop icon Britney Spears celebrated Valentine's Day in style. The singer spent the holiday at a secluded Airbnb in Malibu along with her boyfriend Sam Asghari and her two sons, Jayden and Sean.\nThe home, which is worth a reported $30 million according to People , provided an impeccable backdrop for envy-inducing Instagram posts from Spears. \"A touch of heaven,\" she captioned one video. \"No photo can capture the beauty of a family weekend getaway in Malibu,\" she wrote on another. \n\nThe \" Malibu Dream Escape ,\" as it's described on the listing, doesn't disappoint. It's equipped with all the necessities for a relaxing getaway, including private beach access, an infinity pool and space for 10 guests.\nBut luxury doesn't come cheap. Although Spears' stay was on the house from Airbnb, the villa typically costs $6,000 a night. \nLet's take a look inside.\nThe living room features high ceilings, a cozy fireplace and floor to ceiling windows.\nAirbnb Sliding glass doors open to the outside, and built in speakers both inside and out allow music to drift across the entire property.\nAirbnb The kitchen boasts stainless steel appliances, marble countertops and ample room to cook.\nAirbnb The estate has five bedrooms, including a master suite with its own fireplace.\nAirbnb When they're not enjoying California's breezy weather, guests can catch a flick in the theater room or get their sweat on in the home gym.\nAirbnb Best Nest Living , a company that provides personalized services to travelers in Southern California, is on call 24/7 to answer questions and provide services to guests, including sending personal chef or cleaning service to the residence.\nAirbnb In the backyard, guests can relax in the outdoor living room or take a dip in the infinity pool while overlooking the ocean below.\nAirbnb The home also offers a mini beach area, which is perfectly secluded.\nAirbnb Don't miss: Look inside the Airbnb mansion where Chrissy Teigen and John Legend stayed \nshow chapters New York City's 'Jenga building' is one of the most unique skyscrapers in Manhattan      12:33 PM ET Wed, 1 Nov 2017 | 00:54 Like this story?
