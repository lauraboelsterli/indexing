The index is a closely followed indicator for how healthy the U.S. economy is. Scott Mlyn | CNBC A shopper enters an H&M store in New York. \nA key economic indicator rose more than expected in December to build on momentum from the previous month. \nLeading indicators rose 0.6 percent in December, more than the 0.5 percent expected by economists surveyed by Reuters.
