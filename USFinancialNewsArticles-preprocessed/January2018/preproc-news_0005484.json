    "text": "January 7, 2018 / 6:08 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Figure skating: Chen, Rippon and Zhou make U.S. team   Twice national champion Nathan Chen will lead America’s men’s figure skating team at next month’s Winter Olympics, U.S. Figure Skating announced on Sunday. \nChen, the only undefeated male skater in the 2017-18 season, will be joined on the team by 2016 U.S. winner Adam Rippon and teenager Vincent Zhou, the 2017 world junior champion, as U.S. officials overlooked Ross Miner, the surprise runner-up at Saturday’s national championships in San Jose, California. \nThe Feb. 9-25 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, will be the first Olympics for all three selected. \nMiner was named the second alternate behind 2014 Olympian Jason Brown as the selection committee took numerous criteria into consideration in making its choices. \nRippon, 28, had finished fourth at the championships and Zhou third.

When he won a novice national title in 2010, he said on the broadcast that he would be a factor in the 2018 Olympics. \nU.S. Figure Skating earlier selected national champion Bradie Tennell, 2010 Olympian Mirai Nagasu and teenager Karen Chen for the 2018 Games. \nThe remainder of the U.S. team will be named later on Sunday.
