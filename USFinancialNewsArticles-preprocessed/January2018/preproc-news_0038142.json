He (Seppi) was hitting the ball very clean,” Edmund said in an on-court interview. \n”In the second set I tried to shift the momentum and once I broke him in the last game of the second set I took control of the match. \n“He plays very well here. He has reached the fourth round a few times and is playing very well but so was I. Through to my first quarter-final - I am very happy.” 0820 NADAL OVERCOMES SCHWARTZMAN CHALLENGE \nWorld number one Rafa Nadal survived a mid-match surge from Argentine Diego Schwartzman to prevail 6-3 6-7(4) 6-3 6-3 in the fourth round. \nThe Spaniard will make his 10th quarter-finals appearance at the Australian Open against sixth seed Marin Cilic. 0745 MERTENS EASES PAST MARTIC \nBelgium’s Elise Mertens reached her maiden grand slam quarter-finals with a 7-6(5) 7-5 victory over Petra Martic of Croatia. 0520 CILIC THROUGH TO QUARTER-FINALS \nSixth seed Marin Cilic recorded his 100th grand slam match win, beating Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta 6-7(2) 6-3 7-6(0) 7-6(3) in the fourth round. \nHe reached his 11th grand slam quarter-final, tying Goran Ivanisevic for most quarter-final appearances at majors by a Croatian man. \n“It’s beautiful to hear them (milestones).
