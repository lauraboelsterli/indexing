Denningham garnered over 40 years with the company, having started working as a clerk as a teenager. The Company has named Susan Morris Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, overseeing the company’s Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Operations functions.\nAlbertsons Companies has named Susan Morris Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, overseeing the company’s Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Operations functions.\n“Susan is a talented leader within our company, and she fully embraces our entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to running really good stores,” said Bob Miller, Chairman and CEO of Albertsons Companies. “Susan raised her hand to come to Albertsons LLC in 2010 when she was a Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for a competitor, and she took the only job we had open – a Grocery Sales Manager in our Southwest Division. She has proven herself to be a valuable part of our leadership team in readily accepting new challenges, developing others and bringing teams together, and I know that her broad experience will be of significant value to Albertsons Companies as we move forward.”\nMorris began her career in Albertsons Denver Division while still in high school and worked her way up in the ranks proving her ability to lead, execute and cultivate great teams in one assignment after another in her 30+ years in the retail grocery business. Her career has spanned roles from Store Director to Corporate Grocery Sales Director, Vice President of Bakery and Operations and, upon the sale of Albertson’s Inc.’s assets to SUPERVALU, Vice President of Customer Satisfaction. In 2013, Morris was named Intermountain Division President after a three-year stint in the company’s Southwest Division, and subsequently was asked to lead the Denver Division in 2015. Morris was named EVP, East Operations in April 2016 and was moved to lead West Region Operations in March 2017.\nMorris will continue to lead the Seattle, Portland, Northern California and Southern California divisions as part of her role. Jim Perkins, EVP Operations and Special Projects, will continue as President of the Acme and Eastern divisions. Mike Withers, EVP East Region Operations will lead the remaining 6 divisions, which include Denver, Intermountain, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, Southern, Southwest, and United.\nMorris will be based at the company’s Boise, Idaho corporate campus.\n###\nAbout Albertsons Companies\nAlbertsons Companies is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States, with both a strong local presence and national scale.
