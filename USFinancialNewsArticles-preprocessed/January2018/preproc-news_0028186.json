    "text": "FORT WASHINGTON, Pa., Walter Investment Management Corp. (\"Walter\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: WAC.BC) today announced that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the \"Court\") has approved the Company's prepackaged financial restructuring plan (the \"Prepackaged Plan\"). The Company expects to emerge from Chapter 11 by no later than January 31, 2018, after the conditions to the Prepackaged Plan are satisfied, and the Company is on track to complete its financial restructuring in the first quarter of 2018.\nAs previously announced, the Company's comprehensive financial restructuring plan is expected to reduce the Company's outstanding corporate debt by approximately $800 million 1 and create enhanced financial flexibility. Walter's operating entities, including Ditech Financial LLC (\"Ditech\") and Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. (\"RMS\"), are continuing to operate in the ordinary course.\nProposed Board Appointments\nIn connection with the approval of its Prepackaged Plan, Walter has also announced the proposed composition of its post-emergence date Board of Directors.\nThe Walter Board will be comprised of nine (9) directors. Current directors George Awad, Daniel Beltzman, and Neal Goldman will continue to serve as directors of the Company post-emergence. Messrs. Frederick Arnold, David Ascher, Seth Bartlett, Claude LeBlanc, Thomas Marano, and Thomas Miglis, who have each been designated by an ad hoc group of consenting senior noteholders, will also serve as directors.\nThe term of the new board members will begin upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 later this month, at which time the Company expects to supplement this press release with a formal announcement of the Company's emergence and the installation of its new board.\n\"We look forward to officially welcoming the incoming members of our Board, who will bring proven track records and new perspectives from both inside and outside our industry, and will play an important role in helping guide our Company forward following our financial restructuring process,\" said Mr. Awad, the current Chairman of the Board of Walter. \"Once formally appointed, I look forward to working closely with them to create value as we advance our mission of serving our customers throughout the homeownership journey.\"\nMr. Awad continued, \"I would also like to thank Walter's outgoing board members for their service to the Company. Their leadership was instrumental in building Walter into a diversified mortgage banking company and they helped oversee the transformation that is expected to position our Company for future growth and success.\"\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information about Walter's financial restructuring is available on the Company's website at http://www.walterinvestment.com/restructuring.html or by calling the Company's Restructuring Hotline, toll-free at 866-430-6844 or 1-646-795-6176 for calls originating outside of the U.S. Questions can also be emailed to walterinfo@PrimeClerk.com .
