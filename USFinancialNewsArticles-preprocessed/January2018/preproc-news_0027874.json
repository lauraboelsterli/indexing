    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 7:55 PM / in an hour North Korea Olympic officials in Switzerland ahead of IOC talks Stephanie Nebehay 2 Min Read \nGENEVA (Reuters) - North Korean Olympic officials arrived in Switzerland on Thursday ahead of weekend talks at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to finalize Pyongyang’s participation in the Winter Games in South Korea next month. \nNorth Korea’s involvement, marching under the same flag with the South Korean team, is seen by some as a sign of easing tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program. But 20 nations agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \nGuk Kim Il, President of the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), arrived at Geneva’s Cointrin airport on a flight from Beijing, but made no comments to reporters. \nNorth Korean IOC member Chang Ung met the delegation. Asked whether he expected North Korea and South Korea to settle outstanding issues at Saturday’s talks, he appeared optimistic.

They plan to march together under the same blue-and-white Korean peninsula flag, marking the revival of an emblem of warmer ties between the old foes from years past.
