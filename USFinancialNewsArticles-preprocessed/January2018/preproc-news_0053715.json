    "text": "(Reuters) - The Wynn Resorts Ltd ( WYNN.O ) board of directors formed a special committee on Friday to investigate sexual misconduct allegations reported in the Wall Street Journal against the company’s chairman and CEO, Steve Wynn, the board said in a statement.\nThe announcement came hours after the Journal detailed accounts it said were obtained from dozens of past and present employees who accused the billionaire casino mogul of creating a hostile work environment for women. The company’s stock fell more than 10.1 percent in heavy trading to close at $180.29 on the Nasdaq exchange following Friday’s article.\nReporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
