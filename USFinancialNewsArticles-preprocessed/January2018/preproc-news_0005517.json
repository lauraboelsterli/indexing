    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:EYEG) (“EyeGate” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage, specialty pharmaceutical company with two platform technologies for treating diseases and disorders of the eye, today announced the promotion of Sarah Romano from Interim Chief Financial Officer to Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2018.\n“I am pleased to announce Sarah’s promotion to Chief Financial Officer. Since joining EyeGate nearly two years ago, Sarah has been actively involved in the development of our financial systems and processes, and she has been responsible for all corporate finance and accounting activities of the Company since becoming Interim Chief Financial Officer last year. Sound financial planning and implementation are increasingly important as our pipeline advances through the clinic and into commercialization. With her deep understanding of our business, Sarah is well suited to lead our finance team,” commented Stephen From, President and Chief Executive Officer of EyeGate.\nMs. Romano joined EyeGate in 2016 serving as Corporate Controller. She was promoted to Interim Chief Financial Officer on February 1, 2017.\nPrior to joining EyeGate, Ms. Romano served as Assistant Controller at TechTarget and Corporate Controller at Bowdoin Group, a healthcare-focused executive recruiting firm. Previously, she held financial reporting positions of increasing responsibility at SoundBite Communications until its acquisition by Genesys in 2013, and was a Senior Financial Reporting Analyst at Cognex Corporation, a publicly-traded manufacturer of machine vision systems, software and sensors. Ms. Romano began her career as an Auditor in the Boston office of PricewaterhouseCoopers. A licensed CPA in Massachusetts, she holds a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting from College of the Holy Cross and Masters of Accounting from Boston College.\n“I am truly excited and grateful to be promoted to this position, especially at such a critical time in EyeGate’s corporate development. I look forward to continue working with Stephen and our talented team as we focus on executing our growth strategy and driving value for our shareholders,” added Sarah Romano, Chief Financial Officer of EyeGate.\nAbout EyeGate\nEyeGate is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products using its two proprietary platform technologies for treating diseases and disorders of the eye.\nEyeGate’s CMHA-S platform is based on cross-linking thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid, a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid (“HA”). This is a gel that possesses unique physical and chemical properties such as hydrating and healing when applied to the ocular surface. The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well-suited for treating various ocular surface injuries.\nEGP-437, EyeGate’s other product in clinical trials, incorporates a reformulated topically active corticosteroid, Dexamethasone Phosphate, that is delivered into the ocular tissues through EyeGate’s proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate II Delivery System. www.EyeGatePharma.com .\nEyeGate Social Media\nEyeGate uses its website ( www.EyeGatePharma.com ), Facebook page , corporate Twitter account , and LinkedIn page as channels of distribution of information about EyeGate and its product candidates. Such information may be deemed material information, and EyeGate may use these channels to comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.
