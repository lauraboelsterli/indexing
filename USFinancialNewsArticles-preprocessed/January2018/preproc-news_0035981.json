Accelerated has demonstrated strong top line growth with a five year CAGR of more than 25 percent.

Accelerated will continue to maintain its existing office locations with employees becoming part of the Digi team.\n\"The combination of our companies gives us a unique product mix, technology portfolio, and service capability in the IoT and enterprise connectivity marketplace,\" said Ron Konezny, President and CEO of Digi International. \"Accelerated successfully uses the same ease-of-use and fast time-to-market modular architecture design principles as Digi, as well as enjoying strong and deep relationships with key customers.
