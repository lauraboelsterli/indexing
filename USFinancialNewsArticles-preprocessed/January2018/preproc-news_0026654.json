That’s because I am doing the right things. Let’s see how far I can go,” Nadal, beaten in the final by Roger Federer last year, told reporters. \nNadal arrived in Australia with question marks over the state of his knees after he was forced to withdraw mid-tournament from the ATP Finals in November. \nYet back in the kind of sleeveless top in which he launched his spectacular assault on the grand slams in 2005, and wielding his trusty forehand like a lethal weapon, doubts about Nadal’s title prospects have quickly been cast aside. \n“I needed hours on court, hours of practice, hours of playing sets with different players,” Nadal said of his build-up to the year’s first grand slam.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai \n“I think I did a good preparation. I feel I‘m playing well.” \nArgentina’s 24th seeded Diego Schwartzman, who Nadal plays next, might prove a tougher obstacle than Dzumhur. \nThe 25-year-old from Sarajevo had actually walked off court a winner against Nadal in 2016 when the Mallorcan retired from their match at the Miami Masters with an illness.
