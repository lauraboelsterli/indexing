(NYSE:HEP) has declared a cash distribution of $0.6500 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the $0.6075 per unit distribution declared for the fourth quarter of 2016. Holly Energy has increased its distribution to unitholders every quarter since becoming a publicly-traded partnership in July 2004, with today’s distribution marking the 53 rd consecutive quarterly distribution increase. The distribution will be paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record on February 5, 2018.\nIn 2018, Holly Energy expects to increase the quarterly distribution by $0.0050 per unit, resulting in an annual distribution growth rate of 4%. HEP expects distribution coverage to average 1.0x for the full year of 2018 with higher coverage ratios in the second half of the year due to contractual tariff escalators.\nHolly Energy has also agreed to a private placement with certain funds managed by Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. for approximately $110 million of common equity. Holly Energy believes that this transaction will satisfy the majority of Holly Energy’s current equity needs. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to repay debt associated with Holly Energy’s previously announced acquisition of the Frontier and SLC pipelines, which closed on October 31, 2017.\nHolly Energy plans to announce results for its fourth quarter of 2017 on February 20, 2018 before the opening of trading on the NYSE. The Partnership has scheduled a webcast conference on February 20, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss financial results.\nThe webcast may be accessed at: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1177984&tp_key=1318d4fcc7\nAbout Holly Energy Partners, L.P.:\nHolly Energy Partners, L.P., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, provides petroleum product and crude oil transportation, terminalling, storage and throughput services to the petroleum industry, including HollyFrontier Corporation subsidiaries.
