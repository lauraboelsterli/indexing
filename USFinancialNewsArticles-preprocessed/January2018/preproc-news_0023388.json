    "text": "(Reuters) - Spaniard Carlos Sainz seized the lead in the Dakar Rally from Peugeot team mate Stephane Peterhansel on Saturday after the defending champion struck a rock and lost an hour and 45 minutes repairing his car.\nSainz, father of the Formula One driver of the same name, won the 425km timed section of the 727km seventh stage from La Paz to Uyuni to lead Toyota’s Qatari driver Nasser al-Attiyah by an hour and 11 minutes.\nPeterhansel, who had been 27 minutes ahead of Sainz after leading the rally from Peru into Bolivia, hit trouble while trying to overtake a motorbike at the 186km mark and came to a halt.\nThe Peugeot’s left rear wheel, upper suspension link, shock absorber and radiator were all damaged.\nThe Frenchman was helped back on the road by compatriot and team mate Cyril Despres, the five-times Dakar winner who had long dropped out of contention for the overall victory.\nDakar Rally - 2018 Peru-Bolivia-Argentina Dakar rally - 40th Dakar Edition stage seven, La Paz to Uyuni - January 13, 2018.
