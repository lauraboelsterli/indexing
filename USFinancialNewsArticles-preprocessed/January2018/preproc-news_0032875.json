Infrastructure will be the next major one, it should help boost economic and corporate activity.”\nAt 10:53 a.m. ET (1553 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77.54 points, or 0.3 percent, at 26,038.11, the S&P 500 was down 4.39 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,798.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.33 points, or 0.07 percent, at 7,292.95.\nEconomic data in the day was mixed. U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in December, recording its biggest drop in just over a year, while weekly jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low last week.\nData from China showed its economic growth accelerated for the first time in seven years, putting world stocks on a firm footing.\nRepublican leaders in the U.S. Congress intensified efforts to pass a temporary extension in funding government operations and avert a shutdown, scheduling a vote on the measure for later Thursday.\nThe government is operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1.\nAlcoa shares sank 8 percent after the aluminum producer’s quarterly earnings missed analysts’ estimates.\nAmazon said it has short-listed 20 cities, including one in Canada, to build its second headquarters after reviewing 238 proposals and expects to make a decision this year. Its shares rose 0.35 percent.\nBank of New York Mellon fell about 5 percent after the custodian bank said it expected to book more in severance costs in 2018.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,103 to 727. On the Nasdaq, 1,841 issues fell and 932 advanced. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
