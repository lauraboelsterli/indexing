    "text": "January 18, 2018 / 11:29 AM / in 41 minutes Ex-Baer boss says desire to be entrepreneur drove sudden exit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Former Julius Baer chief executive Boris Collardi said on Thursday the chance to go from employee to entrepreneur drove his decision to quit his job to become a partner at Geneva-based rival Pictet Group. \n“I’ll go from being an employee to an entrepreneur,” Collardi said on Thursday on the sidelines of a private banking event in the Swiss capital. \n“That had a lot of importance for me.” \nJulius Baer is publicly listed while Pictet is a private partnership. \nCollardi had been CEO at Julius Baer since 2009 and he had faced disputes with shareholders over his pay. He has not previously publicly stated a reason for his departure. \nCollardi was replaced by Chief Risk Officer Bernhard Hodler, who has agreed to take on the job while the bank evaluates the group’s long term leadership.
