    "text": " 22 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Two police killed in Colombia in more bombings targeting officers Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBOGOTA (Reuters) - Two overnight bombings that targeted police stations in Colombia’s Caribbean region killed two officers and wounded seven other people, authorities said on Sunday, a day after a similar attack killed five officers and wounded 40. \nOne of the new attacks killed two officers and wounded a third just before midnight in rural Bolivar province, police said in a statement, while the other occurred in Soledad about four hours later, according to a police source. \nSix people were wounded by the explosion there, five of them police officers, the police source said. \nDumek Turbay, the governor of Bolivar province, wrote on Twitter that the violence was “disgusting and vile”. \nAuthorities have arrested one person in connection to Saturday morning’s bombing in the port city of Barranquilla, which officials said could have been retaliation for police raids targeting criminal gangs. \nColombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the wounded after that explosion and vowed the government would not rest until the perpetrators were caught. \nColombia has myriad crime gangs, some of which operate across large swaths of rural territory and others in major cities. Many are involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine, largely to the United States and Europe, as well as extortion and other crimes.
