The two leaders gripped hands so tightly during their first meeting that their knuckles turned white. \nThey also have struggled to find common ground on two major international issues: the 2015 Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. \nBut in a July visit to Paris, Trump was delighted by a military parade to mark France’s annual Bastille Day holiday and the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One, and has said Macron is “doing a terrific job in France.” Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Paul Simao",
