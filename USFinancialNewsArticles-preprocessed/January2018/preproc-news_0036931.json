    "text": "* Australia’s overall export sales grow 15 pct in 2017\n* Pace of growth the fastest since 2004\n* Exports to China more than double since FTA deal in 2015\n* Tariffs to fall further, more growth expected\n* Chinese growers look to buy Australian vineyards\nBy Tom Westbrook\nSYDNEY, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Australia’s annual wine exports to China jumped 63 percent by value in 2017, industry figures showed on Tuesday, as high-end sales rose and a free trade agreement signed two years ago cut import duties.\nRising exports to China, Australia’s No. 1 wine export market, helped lift the total value of annual Australian wine shipments last year by 15 percent to A$2.56 billion ($2.05 billion), according to data from industry group Wine Australia.\nExcluding Hong Kong, Chinese sales hit A$848 million for the year, more than doubling since a free trade agreement between Australia and China took effect in December 2015, cutting tariffs from as high as 20 percent to around 3 percent.\nThe tariff cut and lower shipping costs than European and U.S. rivals have made Australian wines more competitive in China, where their reputation as a premium product is growing, said Stephanie Menere, finiancial controller at Canberra-based wine exporter Inland Trading Co.\n“I think this year we’ll see more of an increase again because of the tariffs being reduced,” she said. Tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated by 2019 under the free trade deal.\nAustralia’s quarter-share of the Chinese wine market is still only a little more than half that of France‘s.\nBut the cracking pace of China sales is benefiting major exporters such as Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates, the world’s biggest standalone winemaker, which reported a 55 percent profit rise last August as Asia sales surged.\nTreasury declined to comment on Tuesday ahead of its Feb. 15 earnings announcement.\nIt’s also lured Chinese producers to look at Australian terroir, with the purchase last month of a majority stake in Clare Valley vineyard Kilikanoon by Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co Ltd for $15.5 million, following several smaller deals in recent years.\nSales to the next top export markets behind China, the U.S. and Britain each fell 2 percent. Sales to Canada, where restrictions on foreign sales last week prompted an Australian complaint to the World Trade Organisation, fell 3 percent to A$187 million.\nIn volume terms, total exports grew 8 percent to a record high of 811 million litres for the calendar year, while at the same time, worldwide production hit its lowest since 1961.\nNineteen percent of Australia’s wine by volume was sold in China.\nThe fastest-growing segment of the export market was for expensive wine valued at more than A$200 per bottle.
