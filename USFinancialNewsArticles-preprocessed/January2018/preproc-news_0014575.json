    "text": " 42 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago UK's PM May to meet finance bosses to discuss Brexit-sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will meet executives from major finance companies on Thursday to give them a clearer idea of what Britain’s divorce from the European Union will mean for the industry, two sources familiar with the matter said. \nThe meeting will take place amid concerns that Brexit is threatening London’s status as the financial capital of Europe and that banks are preparing to move thousands of jobs to the continent to preserve their access to the EU’s single market. \nA spokesman for May was not immediately able to comment.
