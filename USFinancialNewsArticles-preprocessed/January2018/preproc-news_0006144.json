    "text": "GRAND BLANC, Mich. and INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- McLaren Health Care has completed its previously announced acquisition of MDwise. The acquisition establishes McLaren's first operations outside the state of Michigan, and grows the system's health plan assets to jointly serve more than 620,000 individuals, making it one of the region's largest provider-sponsored plans. MDwise will continue to operate under its current brand.\nWith completion of the transaction, total revenues for McLaren are expected to approach $6 billion annually. The organization anticipates achieving economies of scale and increased opportunities to share data and best practices to support not only financial operations, but population health efforts and risk-based contracting as well.
