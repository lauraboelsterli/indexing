His primary responsibilities will be to manage key sectors of NSF's global medical device business and to use his expertise and resources in meeting the needs of clients.\n\"Rob brings the utmost integrity and dedication to NSF International,\" said Kim Trautman, Executive VP for International Medical Device Services at NSF International. \"With his diplomatic manner, extensive knowledge and unique expertise, he accomplishes difficult projects while maintaining collaborative working relationships with colleagues and customers alike.

Ruff later moved to the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, where he led an international team of subject matter experts tasked with the development, implementation and maintenance of the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).\nThroughout his career, Ruff has been extensively published, authoring or co-authoring regulatory audit models – including Quality System Inspection Technique (QSIT) and the MDSAP Audit Model – as well as training programs, courses and articles.\nNSF International is a global, independent organization that writes standards, and tests and certifies products for the health sciences, water, food and consumer goods industries to minimize adverse health effects and protect the environment.
