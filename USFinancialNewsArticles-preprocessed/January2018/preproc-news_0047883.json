    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) announced today FDA clearance of Next Generation SedLine ® brain function monitoring. SedLine helps clinicians monitor the state of the brain under anesthesia with bilateral acquisition and processing of four leads of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Next Generation SedLine features an enhanced signal processing engine, driving a variety of performance improvements and helping give clinicians a more complete picture of the brain.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180129005445/en/\nMasimo Root® with Next Generation SedLine® Brain Function Monitoring (Photo: Business Wire)\nNext Generation SedLine provides an enhanced Patient State Index (PSi) – a processed EEG parameter related to the effect of anesthetic agents – based on its enhanced signal processing engine.\nIn addition, Next Generation SedLine displays an enhanced, Multitaper Density Spectral Array (DSA), developed by Dr. Emery Brown, MD, PhD, and Dr. Patrick Purdon, PhD, Director and Associate Director, respectively, of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. The DSA represents activity in both sides of the brain. When displaying a Multitaper DSA, EEG data are transformed into the frequency domain, and may provide a better display of EEG features.\nJoe Kiani, Founder and CEO of Masimo, said, “Masimo is committed to innovation in the brain function monitoring space. With the improved performance offered by its enhanced signal processing capabilities, we expect Next Generation SedLine to impact brain function monitoring just as SET ® impacted pulse oximetry.”\nWhen used with the RD SedLine™ EEG sensor, Next Generation SedLine can be used simultaneously with O3 ® regional oximetry on the Root ® patient monitoring and connectivity platform for even more insight into a patient’s brain. O3 may help clinicians monitor cerebral oxygenation in situations in which pulse oximetry alone may not be fully indicative of the oxygen in the brain.\n@MasimoInnovates | #Masimo\nAbout Masimo\nMasimo (NASDAQ: MASI) is a global leader in innovative noninvasive monitoring technologies. Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. In 1995, the company debuted Masimo SET ® Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry, which has been shown in multiple studies to significantly reduce false alarms and accurately monitor for true alarms. Masimo SET ® has also been shown to help clinicians reduce severe retinopathy of prematurity in neonates, 1 improve CCHD screening in newborns, 2 and, when used for continuous monitoring with Masimo Patient SafetyNet™* in post-surgical wards, reduce rapid response activations and costs. 3,4,5 Masimo SET ® is estimated to be used on more than 100 million patients in leading hospitals and other healthcare settings around the world, 6 and is the primary pulse oximetry at 17 of the top 20 hospitals listed in the 2017-18 U.S. News and World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll. 7 In 2005, Masimo introduced rainbow ® Pulse CO-Oximetry technology, allowing noninvasive and continuous monitoring of blood constituents that previously could only be measured invasively, including total hemoglobin (SpHb ® ), oxygen content (SpOC™), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO ® ), methemoglobin (SpMet ® ), Pleth Variability Index (PVi ® ), and more recently, Oxygen Reserve Index ™ (ORi™), in addition to SpO 2 , pulse rate, and perfusion index (Pi). In 2014, Masimo introduced Root ® , an intuitive patient monitoring and connectivity platform with the Masimo Open Connect™ (MOC-9™) interface, enabling other companies to augment Root with new features and measurement capabilities. Masimo is also taking an active leadership role in mHealth with products such as the Radius-7™ wearable patient monitor, iSpO 2 ® pulse oximeter for smartphones, and the MightySat™ fingertip pulse oximeter. Additional information about Masimo and its products may be found at www.masimo.com . Published clinical studies on Masimo products can be found at http://www.masimo.com/cpub/clinical-evidence.htm .\nORi has not received FDA 510(k) clearance and is not available for sale in the United States.\n*The use of the trademark Patient SafetyNet is under license from University HealthSystem Consortium.\nReferences\n1.
