    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - FAW Car Co Ltd ( 000800.SZ ) said on Sunday it was taking a 10 percent stake in Chinese bicycle-sharing startup Mobike’s new car-sharing unit Mobike Chuxing Technology Co. \nMobike Chuxing was set up in December with registered capital of 20 million yuan ($3 million). \nWith the strategic investment, FAW will provide electric cars for the project. \nFAW, in a statement, said it had signed a deal to buy the stake but did not disclose financial details. \nThe investment will not have a significant impact on FAW’s earnings. Mobike, whose backers include Tencent ( 0700.HK ) and Sequoia, has 100 million users and supports roughly 25 million rides a day. \nIts top competitor, ofo, raised $450 million in May last year from a range of investors, including Chinese ride-sharing service Didi Chuxing. \nReporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
