    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 6:15 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Aliens, apocalypse, lightning? ... No, just a meteor rocking Michigan Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - A bright meteor briefly swept across the sky over parts of the U.S. Midwest and Canada on Tuesday, weather and geology agencies said, and then caused a powerful explosion that rattled homes and onlookers. \nThe meteor was seen across the region in places such as Ohio, Michigan and Ontario at about 8 p.m. local time and registered a 2.0 magnitude tremor about 4 miles (7 km) east of Saint Clair Shores in Eastern Michigan, the United States Geological Survey said on its website. \nThe National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed it was not a meteorological event but more likely a meteor. \n“The NWS can confirm the flash and boom was NOT thunder or lightning, but instead a likely meteor,” the NWS in Detroit said on Twitter. A meteor is caught on security camera footage in a residential area in Newport, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018 in this still image from video obtained from social media. Kevin McCombs/via REUTERS \nThe meteor sighting lit up social media with people posting videos and reaction. \n“I can’t believe there was a Meteor! It shook our house and made a large bang! We thought someone hit our house,” Twitter user Jennifer Wilson said in a post. \nOthers had more ominous thoughts. \n“I thought for sure I was either seeing the alien invasion or the apocalypse. It’s awesome in retrospect, freaky ... in real time,” said a Twitter user who goes by the name Crash. Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Paul Tait",
