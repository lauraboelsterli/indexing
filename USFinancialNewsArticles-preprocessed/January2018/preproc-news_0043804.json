NIGERIA CENTRAL BANK A standoff between Nigeria's presidency and parliament over confirmation of new members of the central bank's interest rate committee is threatening the bank's independence and damaging fragile investor confidence in Africa's biggest economy. NIGERIA MARKETS Nigerian stocks fell 2.7 pct to a one-week low on Tuesday after the central bank called off an interest rate meeting scheduled for Jan. 22-23 because a backlog of appointments to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meant it would not be quorate. KENYA MARKETS The Kenyan shilling KES= strengthened to an 11-month high against the dollar on Tuesday due to inflows from offshore investors buying government debt and tightening money market liquidity, traders said. KENYA CENTRAL BANK Kenya's central bank governor forecast on Tuesday that the East African nation's economy would grow by 6.2 per cent in 2018.
