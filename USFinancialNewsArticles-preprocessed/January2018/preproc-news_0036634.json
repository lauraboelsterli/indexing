    "text": "BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Monday that his Forza Italia (Go Italy) party would seek to ensure that Italy respected the EU’s limit on budget deficits if it was elected to power.\nThe EU limits public sector deficits to 3 percent of GDP. Italy’s budget deficit came in at 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 and was below that level last year, according to Italy’s central bank.\n“The 3 percent deficit rule can be a debatable one, but we intend on respecting it,” Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels.\nOpinion polls show the centre-right grouping involving Berlusconi is in the lead ahead of an election on March 4.
