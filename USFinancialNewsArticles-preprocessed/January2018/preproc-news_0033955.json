    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GNC Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: GNC) (the \"Company\") reported an increase in fourth quarter same store sales for domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) of 5.7%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") is expected to be in the range of $0.24 - $0.25 compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.07 in the prior year quarter.\n\"In the fourth quarter of 2017, our efforts to reposition the business continued to gain momentum,\" said Ken Martindale, chief executive officer. \"As we head into 2018, we will continue to focus on our key initiatives including capital structure improvement, international business growth, exclusive and innovative products and services, a more engaging e-commerce and digital platform and further customer experience improvements.\"\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were $64.0 million and long-term debt was $1.3 billion. The Company paid down the Revolving Credit Facility in the fourth quarter and there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The Company is reiterating its free cash flow estimate of $190 - $210 million for the full year 2017.\nThe current quarter adjusted diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential non cash long-lived asset impairments, the convertible debt exchange and related debt financing costs, CEO executive placement costs related to make-whole stock-based compensation awards, a legal-related charge, tax reform and the Company's evaluation of the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which the Company is in the process of finalizing.\nThe Company recently announced the hiring of Goldman Sachs and Co. as its strategic advisor in order to optimize the Company's capital structure and enhance shareholder value. As part of this process the Company provided preliminary fourth quarter financial results. The Company does not plan to provide preliminary financial information in the future other than in unique circumstances, or in the event of a material event that requires disclosure.\nAbout Us\nGNC Holdings, Inc.

The Company is an omnichannel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store and through e-commerce channels which include its wholly-owned website GNC.com and third party websites (the sales from which are included in the GNC.com business unit) where product assortment and price are controlled by the Company, in which purchases are fulfilled by direct shipment to the customer from one of the Company's distribution facilities as well as third party e-commerce vendors. In-store sales are reduced by sales originally consummated online or through mobile devices and subsequently returned in-store. Sales of membership programs, including the new PRO Access loyalty program and former Gold Card program, which is no longer offered in the U.S., as well as the net change in the deferred points liability associated with the myGNC Rewards program, are excluded from same store sales.\nSame store sales are calculated on a daily basis for each store and exclude the net sales of a store for any period if the store was not open during the same period of the prior year. When a store's square footage has been changed as a result of reconfiguration or relocation in the same mall or shopping center, the store continues to be treated as a same store.
