    "text": "HOUSTON, Jan. 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. ® (NYSE: PB), the parent company of Prosperity Bank ® (collectively, \"Prosperity\"), reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $67.138 million or $0.97 per diluted common share. Additionally, nonperforming assets remain low at 0.19% of fourth quarter average interest-earning assets. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, the Company was required to recalculate its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on these assets and liabilities. The recalculation negatively impacted the Company's fourth quarter 2017 net income in the amount of $1.431 million or $0.02 per diluted common share (\"Tax Act Charge\"), but the reduction in corporate tax rates is expected to positively impact net income in the future. Excluding the Tax Act Charge, net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2017 were $68.569 million and $0.99, respectively.\n\"Texas survived Hurricane Harvey and bounced back to robust growth of 2.6% - adding 286,000 jobs through November 2017. The unemployment rate in Texas of 3.8% is the lowest since 1970 and higher oil prices continue to improve the energy sector,\" said David Zalman, Prosperity's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"Oklahoma's economy experienced a solid recovery in 2017. The state's energy sector led the initial stages of recovery, but most other sectors also improved in 2017. The outlook in Oklahoma for 2018 is positive,\" added Zalman.\n\"On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Act is expected to allow companies, such as Prosperity, to be more competitive, improve the lives of their employees and increase shareholder value,\" stated Zalman.\n\"At Prosperity, we communicate to our associates that they will be rewarded when the company does well. Accordingly, given the expected positive financial impact of the lower tax rate, we are pleased to announce that we will provide the following to all associates at Prosperity Bank, other than the members of Prosperity Bank's Executive Committee, whose compensation is reviewed and approved by Prosperity's Compensation Committee:\na 5% salary or pay rate increase effective March 1, 2018; and an increase in the pay rate for all hourly associates to a minimum of $11.00 per hour.\nWe are excited that we are able to reward our associates for the many contributions they have made to Prosperity's success,\" continued Zalman.\n\"Our customers are optimistic because of the reduced regulatory restrictions and the expected financial benefit from the reduced tax rates. In the fourth quarter 2017, loans increased 4.4% annualized, and exceeded $10 billion for the first time in Prosperity's history. Deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $913.984 million or 5.4% from $16.907 billion at September 30, 2017,\" added Zalman.\n\"We are excited going into 2018. I would like to thank all of our customers, associates, directors and shareholders for helping build a successful bank. Prosperity Bank was rated by Forbes as one of the Best Banks In America again for 2018 and we have been in the Top 10 for five consecutive years. Further, Prosperity Bank is the only Texas-based bank in the Top 10 and has been the highest ranked Texas-based bank for the past five years,\" concluded Zalman.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income was $67.138 million (2) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $68.793 million (3) for the same period in 2016. Net income per diluted common share was $0.97 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $0.99 for the same period in 2016. Net income and earnings per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were impacted by the one-time non-cash Tax Act Charge of $1.431 million or $0.02 per diluted common share. Excluding the Tax Act Charge, net income and earnings per diluted common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $68.569 million and $0.99, respectively. Annualized returns on average assets, average common equity and average tangible common equity for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were 1.20%, 7.04% and 14.31% (1) , respectively. Excluding the Tax Act Charge, annualized returns on average assets, average common equity and average tangible common equity for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were 1.23%, 7.19% and 14.62%, respectively. Prosperity's efficiency ratio (excluding credit loss provisions, net gains and losses on the sale of assets and taxes) was 43.78% (1) for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $156.050 million compared with $153.832 million during the same period in 2016, an increase of $2.218 million or 1.4%. This change was primarily due to an increase in the average balance and yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by an increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. Linked quarter net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $97 thousand or 0.1% to $156.050 million compared with $156.147 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $3.090 million.\nThe net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3.20% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with 3.26% for the same period in 2016. This change was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $2.756 million. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin was 3.20% compared with 3.22% for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $3.090 million.\nNoninterest income was $29.220 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $29.475 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $255 thousand or 0.9%. This change was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage income. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income increased $411 thousand or 1.4% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nNoninterest expense was $81.088 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $79.148 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1.940 million or 2.5%. This change was primarily due to the write-down of other real estate, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $3.579 million or 4.6% compared with the three months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the write-down of other real estate.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income was $272.165 million (4) for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $274.466 million (5) for the same period in 2016. Net income per diluted common share was $3.92 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $3.94 for the same period in 2016. Annualized returns on average assets, average common equity and average tangible common equity for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 1.22%, 7.26% and 15.06% (1) , respectively. Prosperity's efficiency ratio (excluding credit loss provisions, net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities and taxes) was 42.76% (1) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $616.863 million compared with $632.620 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $15.757 million or 2.5%. This change was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $17.064 million and an increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in average interest-earnings assets.\nThe net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.19% compared with 3.35% for the same period in 2016. This change was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $17.064 million and an increase in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities.\nNoninterest income was $116.633 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $118.425 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $1.792 million or 1.5%. This change was primarily due to the net loss on sale of assets and a decrease in brokerage and mortgage income, partially offset by a gain on sale of securities and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts.\nNoninterest expense was $313.101 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $318.387 million for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $5.286 million or 1.7%. This change was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits and core deposit intangibles amortization, partially offset by the write-down of other real estate.\n(1)\nRefer to the \"Notes to Selected Financial Data\" at the end of this Earnings Release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest GAAP financial measure.\n(2)\nIncludes purchase accounting adjustments of $2.771 million, net of tax, primarily comprised of loan discount accretion of $4.796 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n(3)\nIncludes purchase accounting adjustments of $4.602 million, net of tax, primarily comprised of loan discount accretion of $7.552 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n(4)\nIncludes purchase accounting adjustments of $12.909 million, net of tax, primarily comprised of loan discount accretion of $21.906 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n(5)\nIncludes purchase accounting adjustments of $23.822 million, net of tax, primarily comprised of loan discount accretion of $38.970 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet Information\nAt December 31, 2017, Prosperity had $22.587 billion in total assets, an increase of $256.220 million or 1.1%, compared with $22.331 billion at December 31, 2016.\nLoans at December 31, 2017 were $10.021 billion, an increase of $398.713 million or 4.1%, compared with $9.622 billion at December 31, 2016.

Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were primarily comprised of two commercial and industrial loans. Net charge-offs were $15.610 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $20.058 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDividend\nProsperity Bancshares, Inc. declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.36 per share to be paid on April 2, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of March 16, 2018.\nConference Call\nProsperity's management team will host a conference call on Wednesday, January 24, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss Prosperity's fourth quarter 2017 earnings. Individuals and investment professionals may participate in the call by dialing 877-883-0383. The elite entry number is 5067257.\nAlternatively, individuals may listen to the live webcast of the presentation by visiting Prosperity's website at www.prosperitybankusa.com . The webcast may be accessed from Prosperity's home page by selecting \"Presentations & Calls\" from the drop-down menu on the Investor Relations tab and following the instructions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nProsperity's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, Prosperity reviews tangible book value per share, return on average tangible common equity, tangible equity to tangible assets ratio and the efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities. Further, as a result of acquisitions and the related purchase accounting adjustments, Prosperity uses certain non-GAAP measures and ratios that exclude the impact of these items to evaluate its allowance for credit losses to total loans (excluding acquired loans accounted for under ASC Topics 310-20, \"Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\" and 310-30, \"Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\"). Prosperity believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding Prosperity's financial results and that their presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Prosperity's business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management, the entire financial services sector, bank stock analysts and bank regulators. Further, Prosperity believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its core operating earnings and business outlook. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor of greater importance than, GAAP basis measures and results; Prosperity strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Please refer to the \"Notes to Selected Financial Data\" at the end of this Earnings Release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest respective GAAP financial measures.\nProsperity Bancshares, Inc. ®\nAs of December 31, 2017, Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. ® is a $22.587 billion Houston, Texas based regional financial holding company, formed in 1983.

except per share data)\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nNOTES TO SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nProsperity's management uses certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, Prosperity reviews tangible book value per share, return on average tangible common equity, the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio and the efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities, for internal planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, due to the application of purchase accounting, Prosperity uses certain non-GAAP measures and ratios that exclude the impact of these items to evaluate its allowance for credit losses to total loans (excluding acquired loans accounted for under ASC Topics 310-20 and 310-30). Prosperity has included information below relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented.\nThree Months Ended\nYear-to-Date\nDec 31, 2017\nSep 30, 2017\nJun 30, 2017\nMar 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nReconciliation of return on average common equity to return on average tangible common equity:\nNet income\n$\n67,138\n$\n67,908\n$\n68,554\n$\n68,565\n$\n68,793\n$\n272,165\n$\n274,466\nAverage shareholders' equity\n$\n3,816,884\n$\n3,773,312\n$\n3,725,789\n$\n3,678,999\n$\n3,632,402\n$\n3,750,727\n$\n3,566,931\nLess: Average goodwill and other intangible assets\n(1,940,495)\n(1,942,159)\n(1,943,802)\n(1,945,607)\n(1,947,232)\n(1,942,999)\n(1,947,979)\nAverage tangible shareholders' equity\n$\n1,876,389\n$\n1,831,153\n$\n1,781,987\n$\n1,733,392\n$\n1,685,170\n$\n1,807,728\n$\n1,618,952\nReturn on average tangible common equity (F)\n14.31\n%\n14.83\n%\n15.39\n%\n15.82\n%\n16.33\n%\n15.06\n%\n16.95\n%\nReconciliation of book value per share to tangible book value per share:\nShareholders' equity\n$\n3,824,154\n$\n3,781,358\n$\n3,736,188\n$\n3,689,082\n$\n3,642,311\n$\n3,824,154\n$\n3,642,311\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets\n(1,939,687)\n(1,941,309)\n(1,942,995)\n(1,944,714)\n(1,946,629)\n(1,939,687)\n(1,946,629)\nTangible shareholders' equity\n$\n1,884,467\n$\n1,840,049\n$\n1,793,193\n$\n1,744,368\n$\n1,695,682\n$\n1,884,467\n$\n1,695,682\nPeriod end shares outstanding\n69,491\n69,484\n69,488\n69,480\n69,491\n69,491\n69,491\nTangible book value per share:\n$\n27.12\n$\n26.48\n$\n25.81\n$\n25.11\n$\n24.40\n$\n27.12\n$\n24.40\nReconciliation of equity to assets ratio to period end tangible equity to period end tangible assets ratio:\nTangible shareholders' equity\n$\n1,884,467\n$\n1,840,049\n$\n1,793,193\n$\n1,744,368\n$\n1,695,682\n$\n1,884,467\n$\n1,695,682\nTotal assets\n$\n22,587,292\n$\n22,143,263\n$\n22,296,543\n$\n22,477,419\n$\n22,331,072\n$\n22,587,292\n$\n22,331,072\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets\n(1,939,687)\n(1,941,309)\n(1,942,995)\n(1,944,714)\n(1,946,629)\n(1,939,687)\n(1,946,629)\nTangible assets\n$\n20,647,605\n$\n20,201,954\n$\n20,353,548\n$\n20,532,705\n$\n20,384,443\n$\n20,647,605\n$\n20,384,443\nPeriod end tangible equity to period end tangible assets ratio:\n9.13\n%\n9.11\n%\n8.81\n%\n8.50\n%\n8.32\n%\n9.13\n%\n8.32\n%\nReconciliation of allowance for credit losses to total loans to allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans:\nAllowance for credit losses\n$\n84,041\n$\n86,812\n$\n83,783\n$\n84,095\n$\n85,326\n$\n84,041\n$\n85,326\nTotal loans\n$\n10,020,773\n$\n9,911,202\n$\n9,864,019\n$\n9,739,253\n$\n9,622,060\n$\n10,020,773\n$\n9,622,060\nLess: Fair value of acquired loans (acquired portfolio loan balances less loan marks)\n$\n740,157\n$\n796,807\n$\n888,172\n$\n991,894\n$\n1,107,293\n$\n740,157\n$\n1,107,293\nTotal loans less acquired loans\n$\n9,280,616\n$\n9,114,395\n$\n8,975,847\n$\n8,747,359\n$\n8,514,767\n$\n9,280,616\n$\n8,514,767\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding acquired loans (non-GAAP basis)\n0.91\n%\n0.95\n%\n0.93\n%\n0.96\n%\n1.00\n%\n0.91\n%\n1.00\n%\nReconciliation of efficiency ratio to efficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities:\nNoninterest expense\n$\n81,088\n$\n77,509\n$\n76,442\n$\n78,062\n$\n79,148\n$\n313,101\n$\n318,387\nNet interest income\n$\n156,050\n$\n156,147\n$\n152,231\n$\n152,435\n$\n153,832\n$\n616,863\n$\n632,620\nNoninterest income\n29,220\n28,809\n27,780\n30,824\n29,475\n116,633\n118,425\nLess: net gain (loss) on sale of assets\n41\n62\n(3,783)\n1,759\n475\n(1,921)\n1,864\nLess: gain on sale of securities\n—\n—\n3,270\n—\n—\n3,270\n—\nNoninterest income excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities\n29,179\n28,747\n28,293\n29,065\n29,000\n115,284\n116,561\nTotal income excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities\n$\n185,229\n$\n184,894\n$\n180,524\n$\n181,500\n$\n182,832\n$\n732,147\n$\n749,180\nEfficiency ratio, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities\n43.78\n%\n41.92\n%\n42.34\n%\n43.01\n%\n43.29\n%\n42.76\n%\n42.50\n%\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prosperity-bancshares-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-earnings-300587323.html\nSOURCE Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.",
