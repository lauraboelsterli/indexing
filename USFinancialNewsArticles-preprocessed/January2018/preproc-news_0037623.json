    "text": "(Reuters) - A skydiver died after slamming into the roof of a home in southern California on Monday, authorities said, without releasing details as to what may have caused his fatal fall.\nThe male skydiver, found on the roof of a home in Perris, a small city that is a popular spot for skydiving, was pronounced dead at the scene, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office said.\nHis primary parachute was visible inside his backpack, KABC TV reported from the scene, adding his emergency chute was seen on the rooftop.\n“I was in complete shock,” Christina Blanco, who was in the home at the time of impact, told KABC. “I was like, no, this can’t be happening.”\nOfficials from the Perris Valley Airport did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration was not available due to the U.S. government shutdown.\nPerris, about 70 miles (115 km) east of Los Angeles, is also the small city where law enforcement said this month a California couple kept captive and nearly starved their 13 minor and adult children.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
