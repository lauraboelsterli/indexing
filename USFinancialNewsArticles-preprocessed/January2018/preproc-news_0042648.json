    "text": "Alex Radulov scored two goals and added an assist to lead the host Dallas Stars to a 6-1 win over the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night.\nThe game featured six fights, including four in the first period.\nDevin Shore, Jamie Benn, Mattias Janmark and Tyler Pitlick also scored for the Stars, who are 10-3-1 in their past 14 games.\nJohn Klingberg, who leads all NHL defensemen with 48 points, added two assists.\nBen Bishop made 31 saves to earn the win for Dallas. He stopped two breakaways in the third period, one each by Connor Brickley and Aleksander Barkov.\nFlorida got a goal from defenseman Aaron Ekblad, his ninth of the season, but lost goalie James Reimer to an apparent right-leg injury. Panthers first-string goalie Roberto Luongo is already out with a similar injury and is scheduled to return early next month.\nReimer, who has started 19 of Florida’s past 20 games, was hurt just 3:48 into the first period while making a save. He made three stops before being replaced by Harri Sateri, who made just his third NHL appearance.\nSateri finished with 27 saves for the Panthers, who have lost six of their past eight games.\nA first period that featured four fights and nine penalties on each team, the Stars emerged with a 1-0 lead. Klingberg’s shot from the top of the right circle was deflected in by Shore, past Sateri.\nThe Stars extended their lead to 2-0 with 6:43 expired in the second period. Radulov, who had his back to the net, made a no-look, backhand pass to a charging Benn, who scored his 20th goal of the season.\nDallas made it 3-0 when Jason Spezza’s cross-crease pass found Radulov, who scored with 9:57 gone in the second period.\nFlorida closed the second-period scoring on a power-play goal with 15:47 expired. After a shot by Nick Bjugstad was blocked, Ekblad picked up the loose puck and pounced on it to cut Florida’s deficit to 3-1.\nBut the Stars owned the third period, turning the game into a rout with goals by Janmark, Radulov and Pitlick.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
