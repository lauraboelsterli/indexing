In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern Pfenex's expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this communication include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Ms. Knudson's expected impact on Pfenex, Pfenex's ability to execute its growth strategy, and Pfenex's ability to deliver significant value for its stockholders. Pfenex's expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of the uncertainties inherent in the clinical drug development process, including, without limitation, Pfenex's ability to successfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its product candidates; the pre-clinical and clinical results for its product candidates, which may not support further development of product candidates or may require Pfenex to conduct additional clinical trials or modify ongoing clinical trials or regulatory pathways; challenges related to commencement, patient enrollment, completion, and analysis of clinical trials; difficulties in achieving and demonstrating biosimilarity in formulations; Pfenex's ability to manage operating expenses; Pfenex's ability to obtain additional funding to support its business activities and establish and maintain strategic business alliances and new business initiatives; Pfenex's dependence on third parties for development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of products; unexpected expenditures; and difficulties in obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for its product candidates. Information on these and additional risks affecting Pfenex's business and operating results are more fully discussed in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in its most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and its other filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements in this communication are based on information available to Pfenex as of the date hereof, and Pfenex disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pfenex-names-susan-a-knudson-as-chief-financial-officer-300577462.html\nSOURCE Pfenex Inc.",
