    "text": "January 15, 2018 / 9:45 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Two killed after explosion destroys buildings in Belgium Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Two people were killed and 14 injured when an explosion in the Belgian city of Antwerp destroyed three buildings. Emergency rescue personnel attend to the scene where a building has collapsed in Antwerp, Belgium January 15, 2018 in this still image taken from a social media video. LANDRY ZOKI/via REUTERS \nPolice said two bodies were found under the debris on Tuesday following the blast on Monday evening. Five people were seriously injured and another was in a critical condition after the explosion in a part of the city where many students live. \nPolice said an investigation was underway into the cause of the blast. They have excluded it being the result of an attack. Belgian media said it was likely to have been a gas explosion. \nBelgium has been on high alert since deadly suicide bombings in 2016 and a wave of Islamist attacks across Europe.
