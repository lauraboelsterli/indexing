The firm completed buying a 90 percent stake in Camperdown in early July.\nIn August, Chinese authorities lifted the suspension of import licence for infant formula from Bellamy’s Camperdown factory in Melbourne. The suspension was enforced in July.\nShares of the Launceston, Tasmania-based firm gained 5.9 percent on the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday to close at A$10.96, their highest in more than a month.
