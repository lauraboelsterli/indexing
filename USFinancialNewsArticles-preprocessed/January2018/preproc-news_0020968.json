FILE PHOTO - Canada's Brad Fritsch warms up on the first tee during final round play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational PGA golf tournament in Orlando, Florida March 24, 2013. REUTERS/Brian Blanco \nThe 40-year-old, who plays on the secondary Buy.com Tour and is eligible to return to competition on Feb. 28, said the banned substance was in a supplement he had been taking to assist weight loss. \n“Mr. Fritsch self-reported this information after discovering that an ingredient in a supplement that he was taking was on the prohibited list,” the Tour said in a statement. \n“He has acknowledged his inadvertent error and accepted his suspension.” \nFritsch, in a Facebook posting, said his heart had “sank” when he realised that one of the supplements he was taking included dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). \n“That ... supplement ended up containing a substance called DHEA,” he wrote. \n“I‘m just so upset with myself that I didn’t think to question what was in the supplements. But I never did. And in the program rules, it stipulates that a self-report is the same as a positive test.” \nFritsch has won once on the Buy.com Tour. \nDHEA is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and its production peaks when someone is in their mid-20s, according to the webmd.com website. In most people, production gradually declines with age. \nFritsch joins a small list of players suspended since the PGA Tour began drug testing in 2008. \nWith the exception of former world number on Vijay Singh, most have been little-known journeymen. \nSingh was suspended for 90 days in 2013 after saying in a magazine interview that he was using deer antler spray. \nThe tour banned Singh for using the spray, which contained an insulin-like growth factor on its banned list. \nThe suspension was lifted after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) concluded that the spray should be removed from its list of banned substances.
