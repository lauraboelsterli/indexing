    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - A stricken Iranian oil tanker drifted into Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesman for Japan’s Coast Guard told Reuters on Friday, as strong winds pushed the burning ship away from the Chinese coast.\nThe ship, which has been burning for almost a week since it collided with another vessel on Saturday night, was about 300 kilometres (186 miles) northwest of Amami Oshima island as of Thursday afternoon, a spokesman from the Coast Guard’s 10th region based in Kagoshima said.\nThe tanker Sanchi was carrying almost 1 million barrels of condensate, an ultra-light, highly flammable crude oil, to South Korea.\nHe said that Chinese authorities turned down an offer from the Japanese Coast Guard to help, saying it would ask for help when needed.
