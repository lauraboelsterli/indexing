A group of centrist Democrats and Republicans huddled Sunday afternoon to see if they could hammer out some kind of compromise. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) were also expected to meet, a senior lawmaker said. \nRepublicans and Democrats over the weekend ramped up their rhetoric blaming each other for the impasse, which is tied to a dispute over the fate of undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children.",
