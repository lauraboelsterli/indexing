    "text": "Published: Jan 30, 2018 9:23 p.m. ET Share \nMark Corallo reportedly quit after handling of Donald Trump Jr. meeting Reuters Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. \nBy Rebecca Ballhaus \nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is seeking an interview with Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for President Donald Trump’s legal team, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, in what would be the first contact between the special counsel and a onetime member of the president’s personal legal team. \nCorallo was hired last spring by Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s longtime personal attorney whom the president had initially tapped to represent him in the Mueller probe. In July, Kasowitz took on a lesser role in the president’s legal team, and Corallo resigned from his post. \nCorallo’s resignation followed the revelation that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, had arranged a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 between a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin and top campaign aides, including senior adviser Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Corallo had privately expressed frustration over the administration’s handling of reports about that meeting, the Journal previously reported. ",
