    "text": "HONG KONG, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong student protest leader Joshua Wong was released on bail on Tuesday, less than a week after he was jailed for a second time for the 2014 pro-democracy protests that blocked the Chinese-ruled city’s major roads for months.\nThe 21-year-old activist, who has become the face of Hong Kong’s movement to push for full democracy and defend its autonomy, is appealing against a three-month jail sentence for disobeying a court order and not leaving a protest zone.\nChief Judge of the High Court Andrew Cheung said it was arguable whether the previous judge had given sufficient consideration to the then 18-year-old Wong’s age.\nAnother young activist leader, Raphael Wong, 29, appealed against his conviction and his sentence of 4.5 months, but his bail application was rejected.\n“I want genuine universal suffrage,” he shouted as he was led out of the courtroom, while Joshua Wong appeared calm.\nThe 2014 protest marked the semi-autonomous city’s largest show of defiance against Beijing’s authority since Britain handed its colony back to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” arrangement.\nJoshua Wong was jailed for the first time last year when the Court of Appeal gave him six months for unlawful assembly, but he was later released on bail pending appeal at the city’s highest court.
