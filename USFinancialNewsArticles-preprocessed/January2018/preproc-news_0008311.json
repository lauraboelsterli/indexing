    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 9:00 PM / a few seconds ago U.S. freezes $125 million funds for Palestinian refugees: report Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has frozen $125 million in funding for a U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, Axios news site reported on Friday, days after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold future aid payments to Palestinians. \nThe funding, a third of the annual U.S. donation to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, was supposed to be delivered by Jan. 1 but was frozen until the U.S. government finishes its review of aid to the Palestinian Authority, Axios reported, citing three unidentified Western diplomats. \nTrump said on Tuesday he would withhold money from the Palestinians, accusing them of being “no longer willing to talk peace” with Israel. \n”We pay HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Trump said on Twitter. \nThe United States is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA’s website.
