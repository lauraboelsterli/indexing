    "text": " 27 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago Turkey's capital markets board approves Enerjisa's 1.7 bln lira IPO Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nISTANBUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Turkey’s Capital Market Board has approved an initial public offering of Sabanci Holding’s Enerjisa joint venture, a 20 percent stake sale valued at up to 1.77 billion lira ($474 million). \nIn an announcement on Thursday, the Capital Markets Board said 212.6 million shares, or 18 percent of the company’s shares, would be offered to the public. An additional 2 percent, or 23.6 million shares, would be offered through an over-allotment. \nThe shares would be valued at between 6.25 and 7.50 lira a share, it said. \nThat would value the IPO at up to 1.77 billion lira ($474 million) giving Enerjisa a market value of nearly $2.4 billion, according to Reuters calculations.
