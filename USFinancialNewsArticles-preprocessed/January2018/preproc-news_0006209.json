In 2015, Miller was promoted to senior vice president of Internal Operations and later named chief administrative officer, head of Aflac Group in 2016. Most recently, he held the position of senior vice president and chief administrative officer of Aflac U.S. Miller served as a U.S. Marine and is a veteran of Operation Desert Storm.

Both Virgil and Jamie have built successful teams with impressive records of strategic and operational accomplishments. Over the last 14 years, Virgil has proven himself to be a trusted leader who will bring to this new role a strong reputation for developing people and inspiring teams. Jamie has established a strong 26-year track record at Aflac of dedication, leadership and results. This makes her exceptionally qualified to champion the outstanding customer service our policyholders deserve and have come to expect. I look forward to both of their contributions.\"\nABOUT AFLAC\nWhen a policyholder gets sick or hurt, Aflac pays cash benefits fast.
