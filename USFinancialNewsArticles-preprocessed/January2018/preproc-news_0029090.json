Slideshow (15 Images) \nUnder Section 702, the NSA is empowered to eavesdrop on vast amounts of digital communications via American companies like Facebook Inc ( FB.O ), Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google. \nBut the program also incidentally scoops up Americans’ communications, including when they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. Intelligence analysts can then search those messages without a warrant. \nThe White House, U.S. intelligence agencies and congressional Republican leaders said the program is indispensable to national security. \nOpponents of the program said it allows the NSA and other intelligence agencies to grab data belonging to Americans in a way that represents an affront to the U.S. Constitution. \nThe bill passed by Congress does add a narrow warrant requirement for cases where the Federal Bureau of Investigation seeks emails related to an existing criminal investigation that has no relevance to national security. Privacy advocates said that essentially gave more protections to criminal suspects than ordinary Americans caught up in the program’s surveillance.
