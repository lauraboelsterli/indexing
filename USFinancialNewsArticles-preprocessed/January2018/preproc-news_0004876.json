Three cars in the convoy, but not the Patriarch’s vehicle, had their windows smashed. Palestinian security forces push away demonstrators from the convoy of Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophilos III, during a protest against his visit, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem January 6, 2018. REUTERS/Mussa Qawasma \nDemonstrator Elyeef Sayegh said: “What happened today is a message to the Palestinian Authority and to Jordan that we will not allow this traitor to stay in the Church.” \nIsraeli media have reported that the controversial deals include properties in East and West Jerusalem, as well as in the port cities of Caesarea and Jaffa. They identified some Jewish and Israeli investors as potential buyers. Slideshow (3 Images) \nChurch officials have said they need to sell land in order to pay back debt that has accumulated over the years. Until now the church has been leasing out the land to residents on long-term contracts. \nSome Israeli lawmakers are trying to block the deals that they fear could lead to large increases in real estate prices. Palestinians oppose the sale of land to Jewish and Israeli groups and consider it an act of treason. \nThe demonstrators were Christians from Bethlehem, Nazareth and other cities inside Israel.
