It’s a massive club and I am proud to sign for Chelsea, and I‘m looking forward to playing.” \nGiroud has made 16 league appearances this season, 15 as a substitute. He joined Arsenal from French side Montpellier in 2012 and his goal tally has hit double figures in each of the last five seasons. \nChelsea were linked with several strikers who could offer an aerial threat, including AS Roma’s Edin Dzeko, Peter Crouch of Stoke City and Tottenham Hotspur’s Fernando Llorente, before landing Giroud following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s arrival at Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund. \nChelsea’s Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi has completed a loan move to Dortmund until the end of the season.
