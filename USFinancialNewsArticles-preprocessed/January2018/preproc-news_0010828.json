    "text": " 22 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Venezuelan teen killed during looting of flour truck on highway Francisco Aguilar 2 Min Read \nBARINAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - A teenager was shot and killed during the looting of a flour truck in Venezuela’s plains, according to a police report seen on Wednesday, the latest food-related casualty in the collapsing economy where millions are unable to eat properly. \nJose Materan, 19, was fatally wounded during a showdown with police officers trying to prevent looting on a highway near a slum in the rural state of Portuguesa on Tuesday evening, the report said. \nAnother man, who was not identified, was wounded and taken to hospital. The police arrested four people with bags of flour, the report added. \nThere has been an increase in looting and scattered protests in the South American OPEC member in the last few weeks, as a fourth straight year of painful recession and the world’s highest inflation leaves millions short of food. \nCritics blame President Nicolas Maduro for Venezuela’s economic mess, saying he has persisted with failed statist policies for too long while turning a blind eye to rampant corruption and suffering. \nHis leftist government says it is the victim of an “economic war” by political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers, intent on bringing down Maduro in a coup to get their hands on Venezuelan oil reserves. \nIn what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food. \nBut the measure has left some supermarkets devoid of many fruits and vegetables, with employees saying they are not sure if the merchandise will be replenished. \nPoor Venezuelans have been forced to survive on cheap starches, cut back on meals, scavenge through garbage, or beg in front of supermarkets and bakeries. \nMalnutrition is on the rise, especially among children, and Maduro’s opponents warn the situation is set to become more dire this year.
