We look forward to leveraging their operational expertise and capital resources, as we continue providing exceptional engineering solutions to our expanding client base. As a firm that maintains a strong client-centric culture, stressing collaboration and efficiency, we could not be more pleased to enter this next stage of growth in partnership with Congruex, its executives and highly compelling national platform.\"\nBrian Cassidy, Partner at Crestview and head of the firm's media investment strategy, said, \"CHC Consulting is an ideal cornerstone acquisition for Congruex. With industry consolidation and robust spending on communication networks and utility infrastructure on the rise, we look forward to being a transformational partner for select engineering and construction companies.\"\nAbout Congruex\nCongruex was formed in mid-2017 by industry executives, Bill Beans and Kevin O'Hara, in partnership with Crestview Partners.
