Crush's targeted apps have among the most advanced chat features of all dating apps on the market.

Together, we can leverage the strengths of each company to scale, grow and provide an exceptional user experience.\"\nJohn Venners, NCAP EVP and Director stated: \"Crush Mobile provides strong management, a robust technology platform and a large community of users, all of which should enable the combined company to build a compelling media, branding and advertising platform in the cannabis space.\"\nAbout Crush Mobile Apps\nCrush Mobile revolutionizes the way millennials connect for long-term dating by uniting them based on demographics.
