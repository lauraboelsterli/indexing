    "text": "SIMI VALLEY, CA , Jan. 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nMonster Digital, Inc. (\"Monster Digital\" or the \"Company\") and Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Innovate\") today announced that they have agreed to extend the outside closing date (the \"Closing\") of their previously announced reverse merger (\"Merger\"). The Company and Innovate have amended the merger agreement to provide that the outside termination date for the Merger will be January 29, 2018.\nAs previously disclosed, following the Closing, Innovate will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Monster Digital, and Monster Digital, as the parent of the surviving company, will be renamed \"Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.\" Innovate stockholders will own the substantial majority of shares of the combined company after the transaction. The common stock shares of the combined company will trade under the symbol INNT.\nAs previously disclosed, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, there will be a spin-off transaction (the \"Spin-Off\"). Previously, all of the business, assets and certain of the liabilities of Monster that are not assumed by Innovate in connection with the Merger were transferred into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, MD Holding Co., Inc. (\"Holdco\"). Further to the Spin-Off, holders of record of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will receive a pro rata distribution of one share of Holdco's private company common stock for each share of Monster common stock held.\nAbout Monster Digital, Inc.\nMonster Digital develops, markets, and distributes Monster-branded products for use in high-performance consumer electronics, mobile products and computing applications. The Company designs and engineers premium action sports cameras and accessories, in addition to advanced data storage and memory products for professionals and consumers.\nMonster Digital is a registered trademark of Monster Products, Inc. in the U.S. and other countries.\nFor more information about the company, please visit http://www.monsterdigital.com\nAbout Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.:\nInnovate is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel autoimmune/inflammation therapeutic drugs.\nInnovate's lead drug candidate, larazotide acetate (INN-202), has successfully met its primary endpoint in an efficacy clinical trial for celiac disease. Larazotide successfully completed the End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA to prepare for expected Phase 3 clinical trials for larazotide in celiac disease in 2018. In clinical studies in more than 800 patients, larazotide demonstrated a favorable safety profile comparable to placebo, due to what Innovate believes is its lack of systemic absorption from the small bowel. Larazotide has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.\nLarazotide, an oral peptide formulated into a capsule, has a mechanism of action that decreases intestinal permeability and regulates tight junctions by reducing antigen trafficking across epithelial cells in the intestines. Innovate believes that larazotide is the only drug in the clinic with this mechanism of action of reducing intestinal permeability. Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as \"leaky gut,\" has been widely recognized in the literature as a gateway to multiple autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several others.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.innovatebiopharma.com\nForward-Looking Statements:\nSome of the statements in this press release are \"forward-looking\" and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
