    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 7:15 AM / Updated an hour ago Dutch agency: attracted 483 jobs from Britain in 2017 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch agency tasked with attracting foreign business to the Netherlands said on Thursday it had won over 18 businesses representing 483 jobs that had decided to leave Britain as a result of the countryâ€™s decision to leave the European Union. \nIn a report on 2017, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency said most companies weighing leaving Britain as a result of Brexit are still waiting to see how things will play out before making a decision. \nThe NFIA numbers did not include around 900 highly-paid jobs expected to move from Britain to the Netherlands as a result of the relocation of the European Medicines Agency.
