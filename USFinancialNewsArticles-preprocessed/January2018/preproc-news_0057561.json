    "text": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As Concordia Care, Inc. (Concordia), a specialty risk-transfer company, has completed its acquisition of iHCFA, LLC , an industry leading clearinghouse specializing in the electronic processing of workers compensation and automobile bills, it is well positioned to support a recently passed NJ law signed this week. NJ State Bill S-2137 requires electronic submission of automobile insurance claims between health care providers and insurance companies or their third-party administrators (TPAs).\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131005302/en/\nUnder this newly enacted legislation, it is mandatory that all automobile insurance carriers, TPAs, and medical management companies who receive auto-related medical bills from health care providers accept and process the bills electronically. Further, it requires all healthcare providers and hospitals that submit over twenty-five (25) auto-related medical bills per month to now provide electronic bills for payment on standardized forms compliant with guidelines.\nJoseph Berardo Jr., CEO, Concordia says, “The new legislation demonstrates the significance of electronic billing in streamlining processes and reducing costs. This continues to reinforce for us why iHCFA is an important acquisition at this time given its advanced tech-enabled capabilities in this space.” Concordia serves insurers, government entities, self-insured plan sponsors and other managed care organizations.\nDr. William J. DeGasperis, president, iHCFA, adds, “As a New Jersey-based company, iHCFA currently has contracts with majority of the major medical management companies in the State, covering most of the automobile policies impacted by this new legislation. This allows us to help clients to quickly comply by seamlessly connecting to all medical billing systems.”\nNJ healthcare providers will benefit from enhanced management of their revenue cycles, with e-billing leading not only to faster payment, but also increased efficiency of direct point-to-point communication between the insurance carrier and the provider billing system.\nBerardo adds, “Implementation of electronic filing of medical bills leads to an overall reduction in administrative costs and results in a more efficient process. Given the mandatory nature of this legislation, Concordia and iHCFA expect to waive any associated implementation fees for its payers and providers.”\nTo ensure compliance with the new law, contact Concordia to get on their implementation schedule.
