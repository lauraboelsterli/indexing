Caen stayed 10th in the table on 27 points. \nVincent Bessat brought down Bouna Sarr in the box and Payet wrongfooted Remy Vercoutre to convert the resulting penalty in the 55th minute. \nThauvin then curled a superb kick from just outside the box into the far corner to double the tally in the 74th minute.
