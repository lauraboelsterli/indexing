    "text": "VIENNA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The German administrator for Austrian airline Niki has not yet decided whether he will withdraw an appeal against a German court ruling that moved Nikiâ€™s insolvency proceedings to Austria, his spokesman said in emailed statement to Reuters.\nLucas Floether is hoping to salvage a deal he brokered to sell Niki to British Airways owner IAG.\nThat deal was called into question by the German court ruling and a subsequent similar one in Austria handing the main proceedings to an Austrian administrator.\nFloether said earlier on Tuesday that he would work closely with his Austrian counterpart.\nReporting by Shadia Nasralla and Kirsti Knolle; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
