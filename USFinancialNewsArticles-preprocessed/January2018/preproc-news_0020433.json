(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:PFLT) (TASE:PFLT) announces certain information relating to the tax character of its monthly distribution of $0.095 per share payable on February 1, 2018. 86% or $0.0817 per share of this distribution has been identified by the Company as an interest-related dividend generally exempt from U.S. withholding tax. This information is expected to be provided monthly going forward and is subject to change.\n“We are pleased to start providing the tax character of distributions to assist our non-U.S. stockholders,” said Arthur H.
