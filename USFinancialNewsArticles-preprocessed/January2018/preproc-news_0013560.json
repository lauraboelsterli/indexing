    "text": "PHOENIX, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alpine 4 Technologies (ALPP) announced today that it is providing the preliminary guidance for its Q4 2017 sales. The company expects to report for the period ending Q4 2017 sales to be roughly $3.1 million dollars, which is growth of approximately 35% over Q3 2017 and by approximately 68% over Q4 2016.\nKent B. Wilson CEO had this to say. \"As we were anticipating, our Q4 2017 certainly shaped up to be a record quarter for Alpine 4. All three subsidiaries grew as a percentage of revenue over Q3 2017 and Q4 2016; however, the largest percentage of growth came with our connected car company ALTIA, and with our energy services company, Venture West Energy Services. We believe Q4 has set the foundation for what will be a remarkable 2018 for Alpine 4, and we attribute this success to the hard and resolute work of our employees and executive leadership team.\"\nAbout Alpine 4 Technologies, Ltd.: Alpine 4 is a publicly traded enterprise with business-related endeavors in Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, Engineering and Software development, and Energy Services.\nFour principles at the core of our business are: Synergy. Innovation. Drive. Excellence. At Alpine 4, we believe synergistic innovation drives excellence. By anchoring these words to our combined experience and capabilities, we are able to aggressively pursue opportunities within and across vertical markets. We deliver solutions that not only drive industry standards, but also increase value for our shareholders.\nContact: Kent B.
