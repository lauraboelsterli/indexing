We operate in a multi-billion-dollar market that is rapidly transitioning to the cloud, and Olivier is an extremely valuable customer advocate as we further accelerate our growth trajectory with particular emphasis on the North American market, while continuing to develop world-class customer success for our growing customer base.”\nGachot said, “As the only truly global platform that addresses requirements for both sales and service teams, NewVoiceMedia has a tremendous opportunity to take a leading position in a multi-billion-dollar market.
