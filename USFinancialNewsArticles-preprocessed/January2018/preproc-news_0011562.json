(FCX), a leading distributor of specialty process flow control products and services based in Columbus, Ohio, for total consideration of approximately $768 million, subject to customary adjustments, and is expected to close within 30 days, upon completion of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and satisfaction of other customary conditions. The transaction will be financed with a new credit facility comprised of a $780 million Term Loan A and $250 million revolver, effective with the transaction closing.\nFCX is the premier distributor of highly engineered valves, instruments, pumps, and lifecycle services to MRO and OEM customers across diverse industrial and process end markets. The company’s comprehensive value-added solutions help customers improve cost productivity, reduce downtime, increase efficiency and effectively meet increasing regulatory compliance standards. FCX operates 68 locations with more than 1,000 team members.\nThe acquisition is anticipated to contribute approximately $550 million in sales and $68 million in EBITDA in the first 12 months of Applied ownership, prior to recognition of one-time transaction expenses and the impact of purchase accounting adjustments.

Schrimsher, President & Chief Executive Officer for Applied. “FCX brings to Applied market leading, value-added specialty flow control expertise with premier brands, high-touch technical service, an extensive footprint, and strong customer relationships.

The term “forward-looking” is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases, and Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"will,\" and similar expressions. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors, including the following: the consummation of the proposed transaction on the proposed terms and schedule; Applied’s financial and operational performance following the completion of the proposed transaction; the ability of Applied and the seller to satisfy closing conditions; Applied's ability to close the transaction, successfully integrate the business, and realize the strategic and other benefits of the acquisition; the timing of when the acquisition will be accretive to earnings; trends in the industrial sector of the economy; and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by Applied or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise.\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures are numerical measures of financial performance that exclude or include amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure that would be presented in accordance with GAAP in Applied’s consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Applied’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information to investors regarding Applied’s current expectations surrounding the pending FCX acquisition. We do not attempt to reconcile these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments identified below, the amounts of which could be material.\nOne non-GAAP measure, estimated EBITDA, represents a current estimate of FCX’s forward 12-month post-acquisition net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as other ",
