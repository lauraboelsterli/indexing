GLOBAL TOP NEWS •China may be mulling Treasuries slowdown, but options limited Chinese officials reviewing the country's vast foreign exchange holdings have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds amid a less attractive market for them and rising U.S.-China trade tensions, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. •Trump, on possibility of North Korea talks, says: 'Who knows where it leads?' U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday after the first intra-Korean talks in over two years that the United States was willing to speak to North Korea \"under the right circumstances,\" although it was far from clear whether this would pay dividends. •Buffett succession gains clarity as Berkshire promotes Abel, Jain Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday promoted two of its top executives, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, adding them to its board and cementing their status as the front runners to succeed Warren Buffett atop the conglomerate. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,622.00, trading down 0.15 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee will likely trade lower against the dollar in early session, as crude oil prices continue to rise, while expectations of weak local shares raised concerns of foreign fund outflows. Indian government bonds are expected to fall amid concerns that rising crude oil prices would cause inflation to accelerate further. The yield on the benchmark 6.79 percent bond maturing in 2027 is likely to trade in a 7.42 percent-7.46 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The three major U.S. stock indexes ended lower on Wednesday after a choppy trading session as investors worried that China would slow U.S. government bond purchases and that U.S. President Donald Trump would end a key trade agreement. • The New Year rally in Asian shares ran out of steam as concerns about the U.S. administration's protectionist stance hit Wall Street while U.S. bonds were dented by speculation China may curtail buying. • The dollar nursed its losses against the yen, having suffered its biggest one-day drop in nearly eight months following a report that China was ready to slow or halt its purchases of U.S. Treasuries. • U.S. Treasury yields jumped to 10-month highs on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese officials have recommended the country slow or halt its purchases of the U.S. bonds. • Oil prices held near three-year highs, supported by a surprise drop in U.S. production and lower crude inventories, although analysts increasingly warned of signs that fuel markets have overheated. •Gold prices edged up after hitting a near four-month high in the previous session, on a weaker dollar and as a rally in equities ran out of steam.
