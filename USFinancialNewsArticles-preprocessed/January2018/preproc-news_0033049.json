A post shared by 해리(Haeri) (@harry916) on Jan 14, 2018 at 11:42am PST \nThe city was founded in 1934 as a mining town. Today it’s a prime spot to see the aurora borealis for travelers who can stand temperatures that get down to 26 degrees Fahrenheit below zero in January . \nThe coldest temperature ever recorded in Yellowknife was minus 60 degrees in 1947. \nWinnipeg residents also battle extreme winter conditions. The capital city of the Canadian province of Manitoba is home to more than 715,000 people. Typical low temperatures in January range between minus 5 and minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit . A post shared by Turf Boss Landscaping (@turfbosslandscaping) on Nov 4, 2017 at 9:15am PDT \nThough sometimes it gets much colder — temperatures dipped to minus 49 F in 1966 and minus 54 F in 1879, making Winnipeg one of the coldest cities in North America. A post shared by Aloy V. (@aloy.villaluz) on Jan 6, 2018 at 4:10pm PST \nIf the cold weather is a draw, then Harbin, China, often called the “ice city,” is a fitting destination to find some likeminded neighbors. \nThe capital of China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province is home to more than 10 million people. The city embraces the extreme winter weather each year by hosting the Harbin International Snow and Ice Festival. A post shared by Jean-Yves Lavoie (@jylavo) on Jan 17, 2018 at 7:11am PST \nTemperatures get down to minus 12 degrees Fahrenheit during a typical January day, but temperatures as low as minus 44 F have been recorded there. A post shared by Khouanetheva (Coco) Pholsena (@cocoph8l) on Jan 17, 2018 at 3:41am PST The Coldest Uninhabited Place on Earth \nThe absolute coldest place on Earth is in Antarctica, where Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center used satellites to measure the lowest recorded temperature ever at minus-133.6 degrees Fahrenheit . \nHumans could survive in those kinds of temperatures, but only for about three minutes . A windchill of just minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit can cause frostbite in about five minutes . \n“Humans really have no place there,” one of the researchers said. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
