    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - An earthquake that rattled Greece on Monday night was felt in the capital Athens, a Reuters reporter said.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said the 4.3-magnitude quake struck 25 km (15 miles) northeast of Athens.\nFire brigade officials said there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.\nThe earthquake at 2024 GMT was felt in central Athens and the suburbs. Witnesses said it set off car alarms.\nGerassimos Papadopoulos, researcher with the Athens Geodynamics institute told state TV ERT the epicentre was near Marathon, in southeastern Attica. The depth, he said, was between five and 10 km.\nThe region has been active in recent days and the latest earthquake seems to be the peak of this activity, Papadopoulos said without ruling out the possibility of another earthquake.\n“Residents should remain calm,” he said. “The data is in our favour.”\nGreece is prone to earthquakes. Most cause no serious damage, but a 5.9-magnitude quake near Athens in 1999 killed 143 people.\nReporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
