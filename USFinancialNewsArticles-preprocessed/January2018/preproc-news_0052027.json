    "text": "January 30, 2018 / 4:21 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Bank of England turning sights to tackling inflation - Carney Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that the central bank was refocusing on bringing down inflation as Britain’s economy recovered from the damage inflicted by the 2007-09 financial crisis. \n“The important thing with policy now ... is that as ... slack in the economy has been taken out, we move into a more conventional area for monetary policy, where the focus is increasingly on returning inflation sustainably to target over an appropriate horizon,” Carney told members of the upper house of parliament. \nThe BoE raised interest rates for the first time since 2007 in November and said it was likely to raise them again over the next three years as it sought to bring inflation down towards its 2 percent target. \nInflation in November hit a nearly six-year high of 3.1 percent, pushed up by the hit to the value of sterling caused by the 2016 Brexit vote. It fell back to 3.0 percent in December. \nData published last week showed Britain’s economy performed better than the BoE expected at the end of last year although it still lagged behind stronger growth in many other rich countries due in large part to the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote.

Carney said at the time that it might even cause a short recession. Reporting by David Milliken and Alistair Smout; Writing by William Schomberg",
