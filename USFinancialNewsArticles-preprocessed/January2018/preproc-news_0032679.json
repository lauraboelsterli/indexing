    "text": "January 20, 2018 / 11:05 AM / Updated an hour ago Hearing on Vivendi's appeal against Italian antitrust ruling postponed Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - An Italian regional court said it would postpone the first hearing of an appeal filed by Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) against an Italian communications authority decision regarding the French group’s stakes in Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) and Mediaset ( MS.MI ). \nAuthority AGCOM said last year that Vivendi’s stake-building at both the telecom firm and the broadcaster was in breach of rules designed to prevent a concentration of power in Italy’s telecoms and media sector. \nIt asked the French group to reduce its stake in one of the two companies. Last years Vivendi appealed against this ruling. \nOn its website the regional court said the appeal hearing would be held on July 4. It was previously set for Feb. 7.
