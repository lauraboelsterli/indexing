    "text": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Many refugees would like to buy low-carbon stoves and lights but poor access in camps and a lack of funding is forcing them to rely on “dirty and expensive” fuels, a report said on Tuesday.\nMillions of refugees worldwide struggle to access energy for cooking, lighting and communication and often pay high costs for fuels like firewood, which are bad for their health.\nYet two-thirds would consider paying for clean cookstoves and more than one-third for solar household products, according to a survey by the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI), a partnership between Britain, the United Nations and charities.\n“Energy providers don’t tend to think of refugees as potential energy consumers, but the opportunities to build a relationship with them are huge,” Mattia Vianello, one of the report’s authors, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\nClean energy for refugees is a global priority for the United Nations refugee agency, which provides free, solar power to thousands of displaced people in camps in Jordan and Kenya.\nCampaigners are seeking to create a market for cleaner, less-polluting stoves and fuels to supply millions of households worldwide that are using inefficient, dangerous methods.\nWhen burned in open fires and traditional stoves, wood, charcoal and other solid fuels emit harmful smoke that claims millions of lives each year, according to the Clean Cooking Working Capital Fund, which supports less polluting stoves.\nIn Uganda, refugees collect wood from surrounding areas, “devastating” the local environment and creating tensions with locals, Raffaela Bellanca, an energy adviser with the charity Mercy Corps, said in emailed comments.\nHumanitarians should work with the private sector to provide more sustainable energy to displaced people, said the report, which surveyed about 500 refugees, business owners and aid workers in Burkina Faso and Kenya.\n“Refugee camps have the potential to become energy innovation hubs with a spillover effect on surrounding host communities,” Bellanca said.\nReporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Katy Migiro.
