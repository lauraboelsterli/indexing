She managed the creation of specifications, compatibility test suites, blueprints and guided implementations of Java in the enterprise. Under her leadership, Glassfish became the industry's most used Java EE compatible application server with over 50 million downloads\n\"Prevalent is 100% focused on Third Party Risk Management and is the only integrated solution that includes vendor assessment and continuous threat monitoring in one platform,\" said Padir. \"I'm excited to help the company drive further product growth and innovative solutions that help global enterprises meet regulatory requirements and mitigate risks posed by working with Third Parties.\"\nAbout Prevalent Inc.\nNamed a Leader in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Vendor Risk Management, Prevalent is helping global organizations manage and monitor the security threats and risks associated with third and fourth-party vendors.
