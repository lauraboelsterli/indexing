In fact, the chipmaker had begun the day in positive territory after preliminary fourth-quarter sales numbers came in above expectations. Dialog's fortunes are dependent on the custom of technology giant Apple , its largest client, who may be developing its own chips.\nOn the other hand, Micro Focus was the worst performing stock on the index, trading nearly 17 percent lower after saying its pretax profit for the first half of its fiscal year was boosted by the acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprises.\nMeanwhile, shares of Mothercare fell over 27 percent after the retailer issued a profit warning.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nMore broadly, positive global sentiment continues to drive European stocks. On Friday, the Dow set a new record for the best start to a year since 2006.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany sounded optimistic about reaching a deal with the Social Democrats and thus avoiding fresh elections.\nIn the corporate world, Hershey and Ferrero are racing to buy Nestle 's U.S. candy business.\nAcross the pond, U.S. stocks fell as investors took a breather from the rally that kicked off in 2018. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 38 points, while the S&P 500 withdrew by 0.1 percent.",
