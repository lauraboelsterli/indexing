    "text": "CHARLESTON, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- City Holding Company (“Company” or “City”) (NASDAQ:CHCO), a $4.1 billion bank holding company headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia, today announced net income of $54.3 million and diluted earnings of $3.48 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. The results for the year ended December 31, 2017 include a charge of $7.1 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, to revalue the Company’s net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nHighlights of the Company’s performance and results for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the following:\nReturn on assets and return on tangible equity of 1.33% and 13.1%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, return on assets and return on tangible equity would have been 1.50% and 14.8%, respectively. Reported net interest income increased $7.2 million (6.0%) from the year ended December 31, 2016, while net interest income exclusive of accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions increased $8.7 million (7.5%) from the year ended December 31, 2016. Realized $4.5 million of investment gains from the sales of pooled trust preferred securities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Total loan growth of $81.2 million (2.7%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. During 2017, the Company sold 441,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $64.48 per share, net of broker fees, pursuant to an at-the-market common stock offering. Asset quality continues to remain strong with nonperforming assets declining from $18.7 million, or 0.61% of total loans and other real estate owned at December 31, 2016 to $14.1 million, or 0.45%, at December 31, 2017.\nHighlights of the Company’s fourth quarter performance include the following:\nReturn on assets and return on tangible equity of 0.94% and 9.0%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, return on assets and return on tangible equity would have been 1.62% and 15.6%, respectively. Reported net interest income increased $0.4 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017, while net interest income exclusive of accretion from fair value adjustments increased $0.1 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Total loan growth of $21.5 million (2.8% annualized) from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company’s net interest income increased from $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $127.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due primarily to higher average balances on commercial loans ($132.0 million) which increased interest income by $5.1 million, and residential real estate loans ($33.5 million) which increased interest income by $1.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased interest yields on residential real estate loans also increased net interest income by $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($86.9 million) increased investment income by $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense on interest bearing deposits ($3.0 million), primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds, and lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions ($1.0 million). The Company’s reported net interest margin decreased from 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from the fair value adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s net interest income increased from $32.0 million during the third quarter of 2017 to $32.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s tax equivalent net interest income increased $0.4 million, or 1.2%, to $32.8 million from $32.4 million during the third quarter of 2017. Higher accretion from fair value adjustments from recent acquisitions increased net interest income $0.2 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. In addition, higher average loan balances ($20.3 million) and higher average investment balances ($20.1 million) increased net interest income by $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense of $0.2 million as a result of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities. The Company’s reported net interest margin increased modestly from 3.45% for the third quarter of 2017 to 3.46% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from the fair value adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 3.39% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.42% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nCredit Quality\nThe Company’s ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned improved from 0.61% at December 31, 2016 to 0.45% at December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets decreased from $18.7 million at December 31, 2016 to $14.1 million at December 31, 2017. Excluded from this ratio are purchased credit-impaired loans in which the Company estimated cash flows and estimated a credit mark. Such loans would be considered nonperforming loans if the loan’s performance deteriorates below the initial expectations. Total past due loans increased from $8.6 million, or 0.28% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2016 to $11.0 million, or 0.35% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the Company’s quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALLL”), the Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.3 million and $4.4 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The provision for loan losses recorded in 2017 reflects revisions to the regulatory rating of a shared national credit (“SNC”) in which the Company is a participant, changes in the quality of the portfolio and general improvement in the Company’s historical loss rates used to compute the allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits. SNCs are credit facilities greater than $20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions and are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The SNC that the Company is a participant is for a local customer that outgrew the lending limit of the Company and involves three local banks. The reserve recorded in 2017 of $1.1 million related to this SNC reflects the loss factors associated with the rating assigned to this SNC as a result of the current year review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Company’s balance outstanding at December 31, 2017 associated with this SNC is $27.7 million, with an additional commitment of $6.2 million related to a line of credit to the borrower. As of December 31, 2017, the SNC is performing in accordance with terms and debt service coverage ratios are acceptable. Changes in the amount of the allowance and related provision are based on the Company’s detailed systematic methodology and are directionally consistent with changes in the composition and quality of the Company’s loan portfolio. The Company believes its methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL adequately provides for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and produces a provision and allowance for loan losses that is directionally consistent with changes in asset quality and loss experience.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income was $63.6 million for 2017 as compared to $58.8 million for 2016. During 2017, the Company realized $4.5 million of investment gains compared to $3.5 million during 2016. These gains represented partial recoveries of impairment charges previously recognized on pools of trust preferred securities. Exclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased from $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.9 million, or 7.0%, in service charges; an increase of $0.9 million, or 26.6%, in bank owned life insurance revenues due to death benefit proceeds; an increase of $0.7 million, or 12.5%, in trust and investment management fee income; and an increase of $0.6 million, or 3.7%, in bankcard revenues.\nNon-interest income was $15.6 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company realized $0.2 million of investment gains. These gains represented partial recoveries of impairment charges previously recognized on pools of trust preferred securities. Exclusive of this gain, non-interest income increased from $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to $15.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was mainly due to an increase of $0.4 million, or 5.1%, in service charges; an increase of $0.3 million, or 30.4%, in bank owned life insurance revenues due to death benefit proceeds; an increase of $0.2 million, or 12.7%, in trust and investment management fee income; and an increase of $0.2 million, or 4.2%, in bankcard revenues from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-interest Expenses\nNon-interest expenses remained stable from 2016 to 2017 at $96.1 million and $96.0 million, respectively. The Company experienced decreases in bankcard expenses of $0.5 million, depreciation expense of $0.4 million, and FDIC insurance expenses of $0.3 million. However, these decreases were essentially offset by increases in occupancy and equipment expenses of $0.3 million, advertising expenses of $0.3 million, salaries and employee benefits of $0.2 million, telecommunication expenses of $0.2 million and repossessed asset losses, net of expenses, of $0.2 million.\nNon-interest expenses increased $0.4 million from $22.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to $22.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to an increase in other expenses of $0.5 million, advertising expenses of $0.3 million, and FDIC insurance expense of $0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $0.3 million due primarily to lower health insurance expenses, depreciation expense of $0.1 million, and occupancy and equipment expenses of $0.1 million.\nBalance Sheet Trends\nFor the year ending December 31, 2017, period end loan balances increased $81.2 million (2.7%) to $3.13 billion. Commercial loans increased $70.9 million (5.0%) and residential real estate loans increased $16.8 million (1.2%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nTotal average depository balances increased $131.6 million, or 4.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company had increases in savings deposits ($60.2 million), time deposits ($38.0 million), interest bearing deposits ($20.0 million) and noninterest deposits ($13.3 million).\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was 60.8% and 40.2%, respectively, compared to 30.2% and 32.5% for the comparable periods in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the TCJA into law. Among other things, the TCJA reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of this decrease in the corporate income tax rate, the Company reassessed its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $7.1 million. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company reduced income tax expense by $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax positions subsequent to the close of the statute of limitations for previous tax years. Exclusive of these items, the Company’s tax rate from operations was 33.4% and 32.7% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to 32.8% and 33.2% for the comparable periods in 2016.\nThe TCJA also revamps the tax code to expand Section 162(m) limits to other proxy officers, reduces the dividends received deduction (“DRD”) from 70% to 50%, eliminates the deduction of entertainment expenses and various other changes. The Company does not anticipate any of these changes will significantly impact its 2018 and subsequent years’ tax provisions. Overall, the Company anticipates that the effects of the TCJA will be favorable in 2018 due to a reduction in the corporation federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nCapitalization and Liquidity\nThe Company’s loan to deposit ratio was 94.3% and the loan to asset ratio was 75.7% at December 31, 2017. The Company maintained investment securities totaling 15.2% of assets as of the same date. The Company’s deposit mix is weighted toward checking and saving accounts that fund 54.0% of assets at December 31, 2017. Time deposits fund 26.2% of assets at December 31, 2017, with time deposits of more than $250,000 funding only 2.8% of assets, reflecting the core retail orientation of the Company.\nThe Company is also strongly capitalized. The Company’s tangible equity ratio increased from 9.3% at December 31, 2016 to 10.5% at December 31, 2017. In 2017, the Company sold 441,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $64.48 per share, net of broker fees, pursuant to an at-the-market common stock offering. At December 31, 2017, City National Bank’s Leverage Ratio was 8.43%, its Common Equity Tier I ratio was 11.93%, its Tier I Capital ratio was 11.93%, and its Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 12.61%. These regulatory capital ratios are significantly above levels required to be considered “well capitalized,” which is the highest possible regulatory designation.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.46 cents per share payable January 31, 2018, to shareholders of record as of January 15, 2018. This increase represented a 4.5% increase from the $0.46 cents per share dividend paid in the third quarter of 2017.\nCity Holding Company is the parent company of City National Bank of West Virginia. City National Bank operates 86 branches across West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements that are included pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
