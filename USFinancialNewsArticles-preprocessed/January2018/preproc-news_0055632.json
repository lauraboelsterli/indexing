    "text": "Jan 30 (Reuters) - The top two civilian officials of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency have resigned in a personnel shakeup stemming from the false ballistic missile alert last month that stirred mass hysteria across the state, the agencyâ€™s military director said on Tuesday.\nThe resignations of agency Administrator Vern Miyagi and his No. 2, executive officer Toby Clairmont, were accompanied by the firing of the warning-system officer who admitted to mistakenly issuing the alert and suspension procedures against a mid-level manager at the agency.
