    "text": "Performance Highlights\nRecord Core Operating Earnings: Core operating net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved by 66.0% to a record $853 thousand or $0.27 per diluted common share, compared to $514 thousand or $0.19 per diluted common share recorded in the comparable 2016 period. The Company recorded a $78 thousand net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 after accounting for the impact of a one-time non-recurring charge to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets by $876 thousand. This adjustment was required as a result of a reduction in the Company’s Federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Company also recorded a one-time non-recurring debt extinguishment charge of $83 thousand ($55,000 after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2017. The cumulative impact of these charges resulted in a loss per diluted common share of ($0.02) in 2017. Balance Sheet Growth: Assets totaled $541.2 million at December 31, 2017, up $39.8 million, or 7.9%, from September 30, 2017 and up $160.3 million, or 42.1%, from December 31, 2016 due to continued strong loan growth. Continued Capital Strength: The Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.99% and its Total Risk-Weighted Capital Ratio was 19.82% at December 31, 2017, each significantly above the regulatory minimums for a well-capitalized institution. Robust Year-over-Year Loan Growth: Total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017, were $474.7 million or 87.7% of total assets, an increase of $52.0 million, or 12.3%, from September 30, 2017 and up $158.2 million or 50.0%, from December 31, 2016 as the Bank continues to successfully leverage its capital into prudent loan originations. Excellent Asset Quality: At December 31, 2017, the Bank’s asset quality remained pristine and class leading among all financial institutions as the loan portfolio, for the twelfth consecutive quarter, possessed no non-performing loans. Net Interest Income Growth: Net interest income grew to a record $4.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.4 million, or 52.1%, from the comparable 2016 quarter. Strong Core Net Interest Margin: The Company’s core net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved to 3.35% from 3.14% in the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 3.05% in the quarter ended December 31, 2016. New Branch Location: The Company has received all required regulatory approvals to open a new branch in Flushing, Queens, N.Y. Management expects the branch to open during the second quarter of 2018.\nMINEOLA, N.Y., Jan. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hanover Bancorp, Inc. (“Hanover” or “the Company”), the holding company for Hanover Community Bank (\"the Bank”) today reported significant performance achievements for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, highlighted by record core operating earnings, continued momentum in year-over-year loan growth, outstanding asset quality, and record net interest income.\nEarnings Summary for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company recorded record core operating net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $853 thousand or $0.27 per diluted common share, versus $514 thousand or $0.19 per diluted common share in the comparable 2016 quarter, which represents an increase of $339 thousand, or 66.0%. A net loss of $78 thousand for GAAP purposes, which included $931 thousand in after-tax, one-time non-recurring charges, was reported for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe significant improvement in core operating earnings achieved in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 resulted principally from a $1.4 million or 52.1% increase in net interest income versus the comparable 2016 period. This improvement resulted from a strong year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets (up $138.8 million or 38.4%) due to robust growth in average total loans of $142.8 million or 45.3%, coupled with a 30 basis point widening of the core net interest margin to 3.35% in the fourth quarter of 2017. An increase in non-interest income of $57 thousand or 15.2%, resulting from growth in gains on the sale of loans and investments held-for-sale, also contributed to the core earnings improvement. Partially offsetting the foregoing improvements were increases in non-interest expenses (up $657 thousand) and the provision for loan losses (up $325 thousand). The increase in non-interest expenses resulted principally from growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment and professional fees in connection with an increase in staff to support ongoing growth and operations, additional branch locations and, to a lesser extent, the Company’s new headquarters building.\nMichael P. Puorro, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the Company’s results, “We are pleased to report that our quarter-end results produced another period of record core earnings and net interest income highlighted by loan growth on both a year over year and annualized linked quarter basis of approximately 50.0%. We continue to prudently manage our loan growth through steadfastly remaining selective in our loan underwriting as evidenced by our industry leading asset quality and for the twelfth consecutive quarter, our loan portfolio possessed no delinquent loans. Our growth outlook remains robust as our current loan pipeline exceeds $80.0 million and we are pleased to report that the Company has received all required regulatory approvals to open our fourth branch in Flushing, Queens, N.Y. We expect to open this branch this upcoming summer.\nMr. Puorro further noted, “Despite the fact that our quarter-end earnings reflect a one-time revaluation of our deferred tax assets of $876 thousand resulting from the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are pleased to note that the reduction in our on-going federal tax rate to 21% will enable us to utilize these tax savings and further invest into the Company’s future through additional talent acquisition, franchising and investment in new technologies.”\nStrong Balance Sheet Growth\nTotal assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by $160.3 million to $541.2 million from the comparable 2016 date as the Bank continued to grow its loan portfolio (up $158.2 million) without sacrificing asset quality. The year-over-year balance sheet growth was funded by increases in total deposits (up $110.5 million), borrowings (up $31.9 million) and shareholders’ equity (up $11.4 million).\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 amounted to $395.3 million, representing growth of $110.5 million, or 38.8% from December 31, 2016, the result of an increase in time certificates of deposit of $123.8 million. Management continues to be pro-active in securing longer-term certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”) borrowings to fund loan growth at prevailing favorable rates in the early stages of a rising rate environment. Management continues to be successful in expanding its FHLB borrowing capacity which is strategically utilized to enhance both the Bank’s liquidity position and its interest rate risk profile by providing the flexibility to borrow from the FHLB for terms of two to four years. When prudent to do so, the Bank will be pro-active in securing longer-term advances from the FHLB at favorable rates as management believes it will better protect and enhance future earnings during the anticipated rising interest rate cycle in the years ahead. This strategy is being used selectively to supplement management’s ongoing effort to build low cost core deposit balances through relationship banking at each of its branch locations. Total FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2017 were $83.8 million with a weighted average rate and term of 1.53% and 30 months, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $25.6 million of additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB.\nShareholders’ equity grew by $11.4 million to $44.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $32.6 million at December 31, 2016 resulting in a $1.16 or 9.4% increase in book value per share over the past twelve months to $13.50 at December 31, 2017. The Company’s executive management team and Board of Directors remain focused on continued enhancement of shareholder value through prudent asset growth, effective expense management and the development of long-term customer relationships in its primary markets. Insiders continue to make significant investments of their own capital into Hanover Bancorp, Inc. Such ownership investments now represent approximately 27% of total shares outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s average cost of funds increased to 1.48% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from 1.33% a year ago and 1.41% on a linked quarter basis. The increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities primarily relates to the Bank obtaining longer term certificates of deposit funding in anticipation of higher rates expected in the future. Competition for medium- and long-term certificates of deposit, fueled by a strong local economy, continues to intensify in the Company’s core geographic market. Offsetting the seven basis point increase in the Company’s average cost of funds from the September 2017 quarter has been a corresponding 27 basis point improvement in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 4.74% during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nStrong Loan Portfolio and Industry Leading Asset Quality\nFor the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, the Bank’s loan portfolio grew by $158.2 million, or 50.0%, with the growth concentrated primarily in adjustable-rate two-to-four family residential loans, multi-family loans, and mixed-use commercial real estate loans. Management continues to employ a strategy of concentrating its loan growth in these products with short durations, which provides the Bank with traditionally safe credit quality at acceptable credit spreads, greater liquidity and an enhanced interest-rate-risk profile. Over the past twelve months, originations of our niche adjustable-rate residential product amounted to $147.3 million with an average loan balance of approximately $517 thousand and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 56%. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s residential loan portfolio amounted to $242.9 million, with an average loan balance of $377 thousand and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 53%. During the same twelve month period, the Bank originated $58.3 million in commercial real estate loans, inclusive of multi-family loans, with an average loan balance of approximately $1.2 million and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 63%. Commercial real estate loans totaled $176.2 million at December 31, 2017, with an average loan balance of $918 thousand and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59%. The Company’s commercial real estate concentration ratio was 275% at December 31, 2017 versus 342% at the comparable 2016 date.\nAs a result of the Bank’s robust asset generation capabilities, the Bank has been able to generate additional income by strategically originating and selling its primary lending products to other financial institutions at premiums, while in certain transactions, also retaining servicing rights. The Bank expects that it will continue to originate loans, for its own portfolio and for sale, which will result in a continued growth in interest income while also realizing gains on sale of loans to others and recording servicing income. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale amounted to $370 thousand versus $316 thousand in the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $198 thousand in the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Bank’s asset quality ratios are pristine and class leading among its peer group of community banks. At December 31, 2017, the loan portfolio, for the twelfth consecutive quarter, had no non-performing loans. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Bank’s provision for loan losses was $550,000 and its allowance for loan losses balance at December 31, 2017 was $5.35 million versus $3.65 million a year ago. The Bank continues to record a quarterly provision for loan losses expense due to the ongoing growth in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.13% at December 31, 2017 versus 1.15% at December 31, 2016.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe Bank’s core net interest margin remained strong for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 at 3.35% versus 3.05% in the comparable 2016 quarter and 3.14% in the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The 30 basis point increase in the Bank’s net interest margin versus 2016 was primarily attributable to a 45 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets to 4.74% from 4.29% a year ago. This improvement was driven by a 22 basis point increase in the average loan yield to 4.96% in 2017. The Company’s average cost of funds rose by 15 basis points to 1.48% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the result of an increased reliance on non-core funding sources, principally time certificates of deposit and FHLB borrowings.\nAbout Hanover Community Bank and Hanover Bancorp, Inc.\nHanover Bancorp, Inc., is a locally owned and operated privately held stock bank holding company for Hanover Community Bank, a community commercial bank focusing on highly personalized and efficient services and products responsive to local needs.
