    "text": "January 2, 2018 / 10:19 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Fugitive Vietnamese tycoon seeks passage to Germany Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - A fugitive Vietnamese businessman who has been detained in Singapore is seeking passage to Germany to avoid being sent back to Vietnam, lawyers representing him in Singapore and Germany said on Tuesday. \nWanted by Vietnam in connection with a corruption crackdown and for revealing state secrets, Phan Van Anh Vu was detained in Singapore on Thursday as he tried to leave for Malaysia. \nRemy Choo, a lawyer engaged by the 42-year-old businessmanâ€™s family, said Vu was seeking to get to Germany. Choo said he had been unable to speak to his client and had filed a court application to compel immigration authorities to give him access. \nVictor Pfaff, a lawyer representing Vu in Frankfurt, confirmed he had written to the German embassy in Singapore about the case on Dec. 31. The German foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by John Geddie in Singapore and Madeline Chambers in Berlin; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",
