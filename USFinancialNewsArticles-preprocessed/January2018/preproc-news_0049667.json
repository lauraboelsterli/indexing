    "text": "January 28, 2018 / 5:37 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago France would intervene if French jihadist faced death penalty in Iraq or Syria - minister Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - France would intervene if a French jihadist were condemned to death in Iraq or Syria, the country’s justice minister Nicole Belloubet said on Sunday. \nThe possibility of such an event has arisen after an Iraqi court this month sentenced to death a German woman of Moroccan origin for membership of Islamic State. \nThe European Union has a long-standing policy against capital punishment and all member nations have abandoned the practice. \nAsked in a television interview on Sunday about how France would react if a French jihadist were condemned to death, Belloubet said: “The French state would intervene, by negotiating with the other state in question.” \nAny such negotiations could involve requests for extradition, though Belloubet emphasised that these situations would be considered case by case. \nFrench public prosecutor Francois Molins said this month that an estimated 676 French nationals, including 295 women, were in the Iraq-Syria region. \nFrance remains on high alert after suffering a wave of attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State militants in 2015 and 2016, which killed more than 200 people.
