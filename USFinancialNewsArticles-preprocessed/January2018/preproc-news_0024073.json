    "text": "ISTANBUL, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A Pegasus Airlines flight skidded off the runway of a Turkish coastal airport and ended up halfway down a steep slope into the Black Sea, but no passengers or crew were hurt, Turkish media reported on Sunday.\nThe incident happened on Saturday night at Trabzon airport in northeast Turkey. Pictures from the site showed the plane’s nose close to the water’s edge.\nPegasus Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-800 aircraft, flying from Ankara to Trabzon, “had a runway excursion incident” as it landed but the 162 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew were unhurt.
