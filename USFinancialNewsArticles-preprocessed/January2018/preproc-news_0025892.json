    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 7:01 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Mexico ex-first lady would end husband's army policy if elected Daina Beth Solomon , Adriana Barrera 3 Min Read \nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican presidential hopeful and former first lady Margarita Zavala pledged to curb violence and crime by pulling soldiers off the streets in a reversal of her husband’s military-led drug strategy that ushered in a sharp increase in violence. \nIf elected this July, Zavala said she would double and strengthen the police force while withdrawing the thousands of troops that her husband, former president Felipe Calderon, began deploying at the end of 2006. \n“I want ... to fortify the police in a national police system ... that allows me to gradually put the police in charge of security and let the armed forces do what they had always been doing,” she said in an interview with Reuters. \nViolence is shaping up to be a key campaign theme after murders last year surged to a record high. Well over 100,000 people have been killed in gang violence in the past decade. \nAs officials grapple to control the bloodshed, President Enrique Pena Nieto last month signed into law a contentious security bill that would formally enshrine the parameters for using the military in crime-fighting. \nA host of human rights groups and international organizations attacked the bill, citing reported cases of abuses by Mexico’s military. \nZavala, 50, said her plan would boost police salaries, offer merit-based promotions and certify officers under a single set of national criteria. Independent pre-candidate for the presidential election 2018, Margarita Zavala, gestures during an interview with Reuters in Mexico City, Mexico January 16, 2018.
