    "text": "Jordan Clarkson scored 16 of his season-high 33 points in the final quarter to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 99-86 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\nClarkson was 14-of-19 shooting and also contributed seven rebounds and seven assists while falling two points shy of his career high. Julius Randle added 14 points and Kyle Kuzma scored 13 as the Lakers won for the fifth time in the past seven games.\nVictor Oladipo scored 25 points and Domantas Sabonis recorded 15 points and 14 rebounds for Indiana. The Pacers are 2-2 on a five-game road trip that concludes Sunday in San Antonio.\nLos Angeles played without point guard Lonzo Ball (knee), forward Brandon Ingram (ankle) and shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (Achilles). The Pacers were without center Myles Turner (elbow).\nThe Lakers led by three before Clarkson converted a four-point play with 4:06 left to start a 12-0 burst. Kumza added a 3-pointer to push the margin to 10 and Clarkson scored the next five to make it 97-82 with 1:31 to play.\nThe Lakers won despite being just 2-of-14 from the free-throw line. Los Angeles shot 55 percent from the field while Indiana shot 38.1 percent, including 2 of 25 from 3-point range.\nThe Pacers trailed by eight points at halftime before scoring 21 points over the first 6:32 of the third quarter, tying the game at 60 on a three-point play by Sabonis.\nLos Angeles answered with a 12-2 burst, and Josh Hart’s layup gave the Lakers a 72-62 lead with 2:39 left. Los Angeles held a 74-66 advantage entering the final quarter.\nOladipo’s dunk pulled Indiana within 82-80 with 5:46 left before Los Angeles stymied the charge and eventually put the game away when Clarkson scored nine points during the decisive 12-0 run.\nClarkson had 15 first-half points to help the Lakers take a 47-39 lead into the break.\nIndiana had a 25-16 lead after Cory Joseph’s basket with 40 seconds left in the first quarter before the Lakers erupted for a 22-4 run. Clarkson ended the spurt with a three-point play to give Los Angeles a nine-point edge with five minutes left in the half.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
