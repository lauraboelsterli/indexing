(“ True Leaf ” or the “ Company ”) (CSE:MJ) (FSE:TLA) (OTCQB:TRLFF), announces that it has conducted an initial closing of its previously announced Regulation A+ offering for gross proceeds in the amount of C$6.18 million for 8,883,590 shares.\nTrue Leaf’s Regulation A+ offering was qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2017, and allows the Company to sell up to 14,285,715 common shares at an offering price of $0.70 CAD per share in the United States.\nBoustead Securities, LLC, working with its affiliate, FlashFunders™ ( www.flashfunders.com ), is the lead managing selling agent and bookrunner for the offering.

The Company launched the True Hemp™ pet supplement line in Canada, the United States, and Europe, becoming one of the first hemp-based pet product lines to be marketed worldwide.
