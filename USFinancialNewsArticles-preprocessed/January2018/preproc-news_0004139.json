    "text": "LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gander Outdoors, formerly known as Gander Mountain, today announced the initial list of retail stores that are scheduled to open in 2018. Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CWH) (“Camping World”), was chosen as the winning bidder at a bankruptcy auction for certain acquired assets of Gander Mountain and the sale was approved in a bankruptcy court hearing in May 2017. Camping World is beginning to reopen many of the Gander Outdoors stores to serve customers who are passionate about hunting, fishing, marine and water sports, camping, and active and shooting sports, and will provide outdoor enthusiasts with regionally and seasonally relevant products and services that are competitively priced.\n“It was important to me to bring Gander Outdoors back to many wonderful communities across the country because the employees are top notch and the stores provide great products and services for the community,” said Marcus Lemonis, Chairman of Camping World Holdings. “Our great team at the headquarters in Bloomington, MN has been working tirelessly over the past 6 months to get the locations prepared and we are extremely excited to begin the rapid opening process and hope to open all locations this spring.”\nLemonis previously stated his intention of operating stores with a clear path to profitability. He also shared the goal of operating seventy or more locations subject to, among other things, the ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms with landlords.
