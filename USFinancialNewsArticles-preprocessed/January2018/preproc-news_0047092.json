The referendum did not accelerate anything but it is not bad news for Genel,” Ikaheimonen said.\nField development plans, carried out by Baker Hughes , will be completed shortly and the company will carry out further test wells this year, it said.\nGenel plans to spend between $25 and $40 million on the project in 2018 out of a total capital spending programme of $95 to $140 million.\nThe search for a partner for the fields is ongoing, Ikaheimonen added.\nLondon-listed Genel said its 2018 production would fall 7 percent to 32,760 barrels of oil and gas equivalent per day (boed) after 2017 output declined by 34 percent.\nAt 0940 GMT, its shares were down 2.2 percent at 132 pence.\nThe company continued receiving regular payments from the KRG throughout 2017.\nGenel’s cash proceeds, however, grew by around 30 percent in 2017 to $263 million due to higher oil prices.\nFree cash flow totalled $140 million last year, while net debt dipped to $135 million following the refinancing of existing bonds in December.
