    "text": "By Kristen Bellstrom 8:20 AM EST \nGood morning, Broadsheet readers! Vice puts two top execs on leave, tech bros are throwing regular sex parties, and a record number of women are expected to run for governor this year. Have a productive Wednesday. EVERYONE'S TALKING \n• The time is now . My colleague Claire Zillman takes a closer look at Time’s Up, the action plan for tacking sexual harassment launched this week by Hollywood A-listers including Reese Witherspoon, Shonda Rhimes, and Eva Longoria. \nWhat’s unique about the initiative, writes Claire, is that despite the boldface names attached, its legal defense fund will help women who are largely without power or prominence. (For a sense of what women in blue-collar jobs too often experience, please check out this NYT story from last week.) Time’s Up “comes at a time when initiatives aimed at bettering the working lives of women have not only lacked universality, but have effectively siloed women into two classes, haves and have-nots, ” she notes. \nThat split can be seen in everything from the concerns raised at last January’s Women’s March to the generous leave policies that apply only to certain employees to the celebrity-driven aspect of the #MeToo movement. There’s no denying that the fight for gender equity too often leaves out women who are not white and middle- or upper-class. So it’s gratifying to see some of Hollywood’s biggest names not only call attention to the plight of their less glamorous sisters, but to actually use their wealth to help them make change. Let’s hope this is a sign of things to come in 2018. Fortune ALSO IN THE HEADLINES \n• Tip jar . The New Yorker’s Dana Goodyear looks at the ways Hollywood is responding to the post-Weinstein/#MeToo world. She describes an industry where—almost overnight—everything has changed so dramatically that no one is quite sure what comes next. (One thing they do know: “No one wants to get caught on the wrong side of history.”) Interestingly, the story also notes that the Hollywood Reporter has created a sexual-misconduct beat and “assigned seven reporters, who are fielding ten to fifteen tips a day.” A related and important reminder to all you Broadsheet readers: My inbox is always open for any tips related to sexual harassment—and anything that comes in via the “send tip” button at the top of this newsletter remains anonymous.
