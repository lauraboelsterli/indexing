U.S. regulators to ensure regulatory compliance,” an airline spokeswoman said in an email. \nThe carriers and airports are Qatar Airways operating out of Doha’s Hamad International Airport, Emirates [EMIRA.UL] operating out of Dubai International Airport, Etihad Airways out of Abu Dhabi International Airport, Saudia operating out of Jeddah’s King Abdul-Aziz International Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport, EgyptAir [EGY.UL] operating out of Cairo International Airport, and Royal Jordanian operating out of Amman’s Queen Alia International Airport. \nAll cargo originating from those airports will have to be screened and secured under Air Cargo Advance Screening protocols. The TSA said most of the requirements were already being voluntarily applied by airlines around the world. Reporting by Alexander Cornwell, editing by Louise Heavens",
