    "text": "January 23, 2018 / 3:25 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago BOJ keeps policy steady, slightly more upbeat on price outlook Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Tuesday and offered a slightly more upbeat view on inflation expectations, underscoring its conviction the economy is making slow but steady progress towards its elusive 2 percent price target. \nIn a widely expected move, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent. \nThe decision on maintaining its interest rate targets was made by an 8-1 vote with board member Goushi Kataoka dissenting on the view additional stimulus was needed to hit the target. \n“Inflation expectations are moving sideways recently,” the BOJ said in a quarterly report, offering a more optimistic view than three months ago when it said they were moving on a weak note. \nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.
