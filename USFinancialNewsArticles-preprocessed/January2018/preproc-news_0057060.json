    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China is currently drawing up details of a new “battle plan” to curb pollution over the 2018-2020 period, an environment ministry official said on Wednesday.\nLiu Youbin, a spokesman at the Ministry of Environmental Protection, told a press briefing that officials are currently drawing up supporting regulations for major industrial regions like Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze river delta. He didn’t say when the detailed plan would be released.\nChina’s previous plan, covering the 2013-2017 period, forced the smog-prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to take action to reduce concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 by more than 25 percent.
