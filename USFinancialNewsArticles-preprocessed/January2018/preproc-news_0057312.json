    "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s private home prices surged to a fresh peak for the 14th straight month in December, bringing the increase for 2017 to 16.7 percent and likely adding to concerns about housing affordability in the city.\nA government monthly index shows home prices rose 1.41 percent in December compared to November, extending a marathon trend of price increase that began in April 2016.\nThe provisional annual index rose 16.7 percent, while the December figure rose 14.8 percent year-on-year.\nRents also shattered records for the 10th month, edging up 0.27 percent and rising 7.89 percent year-on-year. The 2017 figure increased 8.56 percent when compared to 2016.\nAnalysts expect the financial hub’s property prices to lift a further 5 to 20 percent in 2018 partly due to high liquidity and a severe supply-demand imbalance.\nThe Asian financial hub has one of the most expensive property markets in the world, with the average cost per square foot of an apartment about HK$12,100 ($1,547.31), according to property agency Midland Realty. On the prime Hong Kong Island, the average cost is about HK$16,200 per square foot.\nHigh property costs have spurred political discontent in the city and pushed more people into semi-illegal partitioned flats or onto the streets.\nReporting by Venus Wu; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
