This Southeast Asian country scored top marks in the entertainment, health care and healthy lifestyle categories. Rustam Azmi | Getty Images Ecuador \nThis South American nation offers shoreline and mountain vistas â€“ and it received top grades in the benefits and discounts category, as well as climate. John Elk III | Getty Images Panama \nPanama received the highest ratings for \"benefits and discounts\" and \"visas and residence.\" Outside of Panama City, expatriates can live on $1,500 a month or less, saving money on utilities due to the mild climate. LisaStrachan | Getty Images Mexico \nMexico received a 90 out of 100 in the health-care category. The average doctor visit can run about $30 to $43, while a trip to the dentist costs about $28, according to International Living . CampPhoto | Getty Images Costa Rica \nTaking first place as the ideal locale for retirees, Costa Rica scored top marks in health care and healthy lifestyle.
