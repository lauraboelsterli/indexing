(NYSE:AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, diluted earnings per share were $5.50 compared to $2.67 for the same period of 2016, and Economic earnings per share (“Economic EPS”) were $4.68 (which excludes the impact of recent changes in U.S. tax law), compared to $3.80 for the same period of 2016.

For the fourth quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $361.3 million, compared to $289.7 million for the same period of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Aggregate fees (previously referred to as Aggregate revenue; consists of the total asset- and performance-based fees of all Affiliates, as further set forth in Note B) were $1.7 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the same period of 2016. (Economic EPS, Economic net income, and Adjusted EBITDA are defined in the attached tables, along with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings per share were $12.03, compared to $8.57 for 2016, and Economic earnings per share were $14.60, compared to $12.84 for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Net income was $689.5 million, compared to $472.8 million for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Economic net income was $824.4 million, compared to $703.6 million for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, compared to $945.5 million for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Aggregate fees were $5.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion for 2016.\nNet client cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.0 billion, and for the full year were $4.7 billion. AMG’s aggregate assets under management were approximately $836 billion at December 31, 2017.\nToday, AMG announced a first quarter cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, representing an increase of 50% over the prior level, payable February 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2018. In addition, AMG’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization to a total of five million shares. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 718,000 shares, and for the full year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 2.4 million shares.\n“AMG generated excellent results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, including record Economic earnings per share of $4.68 for the quarter and $14.60 for the year,” stated Sean M. Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “In addition to growth in our Economic earnings per share of 23% and 14% over the respective periods of 2016, our assets under management increased 21% year-over-year to a record $836 billion, driven by the long-term investment outperformance of our alpha-generating Affiliates and the strong execution of our growth strategy, including organic growth from net client cash flows and the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives to support and enhance our Affiliates’ new business momentum. Given the strength of our competitive position along with the increased scale and earnings power of our business, we have outstanding prospects for continued earnings growth going forward.”\n“We are pleased with the organic growth we generated in 2017, particularly given our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies, which are optimally positioned for periods of market volatility,” Mr. Healey continued. “Across our diverse active equity and alternative product set, our Affiliates generated positive net client cash flows during both the quarter and the year, notwithstanding continued industry-wide net outflows in actively-managed product areas. Looking ahead, as one of the leading providers of alpha-generating strategies globally, AMG is well-positioned to meet increasing client demand for differentiated return streams.”\nMr. Healey concluded, “We are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong long-term earnings growth through accretive investments in outstanding new Affiliates, while also consistently returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Reflecting this confidence in our forward prospects, our Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in our dividend along with an additional stock repurchase authorization. Given our significant and growing scale, along with the ongoing organic growth of our business and our disciplined commitment to capital allocation, we are well-positioned to create long-term shareholder value.”\nAbout AMG\nAMG is a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms.

Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (B) During the quarter, we renamed our operating measure formerly referred to as Aggregate revenue to Aggregate fees. There was no change in the calculation of this measure. Aggregate fees consists of the total asset- and performance- based fees earned by all of our Affiliates and is an operating measure used by management to evaluate the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate fees is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our GAAP performance measures. (C) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment obligations. We believe that many investors use this measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. (D) Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, we have also excluded from Economic net income (controlling interest) a one-time net benefit from changes in U.S. tax law, as more fully described in Note I. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance measure. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. We are excluding the one-time impact of the changes in U.S. tax law to ensure comparability with prior and future periods. (E) Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures. (F) Other primarily includes the assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in Affiliates. In the second quarter of 2017, Forbes Family Trust was contributed to Wealth Partners Capital Group. (G) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $93.1 expense associated with the impairment of one of our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, which reduced intangible-related deferred taxes by $35.7. (H) For the year ended December 31, 2016, Other economic items includes gains from adjustments to our contingent payment obligations of $2.8. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, Other economic items includes expenses from adjustments to our contingent payment obligations of $5.2 and $6.6, respectively. There were no contingent payment adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items are net of income tax expense of $1.5 and $4.4, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, Other economic items are net of income tax expense of $1.5 and $5.8, respectively. (I) Our consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to the controlling interest, and to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests. On December 22, 2017, changes in U.S. tax law were enacted, which significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings and profits. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, taxes attributable to the controlling interest includes a one- time net benefit of $194.1 from the changes in U.S. tax law, primarily from the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets and convertible securities. The impact of the changes in U.S. tax law on taxes attributable to the controlling interest may be refined as further guidance, interpretations or information become available or from further evaluation of the impact of the changes in U.S. tax law. The following table summarizes our consolidated tax provision:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Taxes attributable to controlling interest $ 73.7 $ (132.1 ) $ 229.2 $ 50.4 Taxes attributable to non-controlling interests 2.3 2.3 6.4 8.0 Total income taxes $ 76.0 $ (129.8 ) $ 235.6 $ 58.4 Income before taxes (controlling interest) $ 223.9 $ 183.3 $ 702.0 $ 739.9 Effective tax rate (controlling interest) 32.9 % -72.1 % 32.6 % 6.8 %\nSource:Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.",
