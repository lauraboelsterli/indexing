(Photo by Taylor Hill/FilmMagic) Taylor Hill FilmMagic By John Patrick Pullen 3:29 PM EST \nAs California prepared to legalize marijuana sales , CNN reporter Randi Kaye ended 2017 on a “high” note, covering New Year’s Eve in Colorado, where recreational cannabis has been legal since 2012. \nGiving the Sunshine State a glimpse of its future, the CNN News fixture handled joints at a “paint and puff” party and even lit a gas mask bong for one reveler. \n“I just want to point out, that this is all legal in Colorado,” host Anderson Cooper told co-host Andy Cohen. \nWhile Kaye did not appear to partake in any drug use herself, Twitter users provided commentary as she rode a pot bus, which took revelers to various pot-related stops, including a marijuana grow house.

A 1971 law barred cigarette advertisements from the small screen, and a 1986 follow-up added smokeless products to the banned ads. Television programming followed suit, with fewer characters sparking their lighters in subsequent years. \nBut this isn’t the first time that CNN and Kaye teamed up on marijuana coverage. Here’s a 2014 clip about a previous Kaye “joint” investigation: \n",
