    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said it will announce on Tuesday whether it will respect an agreement between the country’s previous government and Japan that was aimed at resolving a feud over “comfort women” forced to work in Japan’s wartime brothels.\nForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha will hold a news conference to say what measures the government intends taking to follow up on a public-private panel that concluded last week that the accord had failed to meet the women’s needs, a foreign ministry official told Reuters on Monday.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the deal, under which Japan apologized to victims and provided 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) to a fund to help them, was seriously flawed. Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations.\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin and Joyce Lee; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ",
