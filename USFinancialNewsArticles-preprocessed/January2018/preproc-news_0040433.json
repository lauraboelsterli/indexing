    "text": "By Bloomberg 7:50 AM EST \nStarbucks plans to spend $250 million on new employee benefits, including a pay boost for domestic workers, in the wake of the federal tax overhaul. \nThe coffee chain will increase pay for its 150,000 U.S. hourly and salaried employees in April, following its regular annual raise earlier this month. It’s also taking its paid-sick time benefit national, allowing workers to save up time off to use for themselves or family, Seattle-based Starbucks said on Wednesday. \nRead: Disney Is the Latest Company to Give Cash Bonuses to Employees Following Tax Reform \n“Investing in our partners has long been our strategy,” Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in a memo to employees. “Due to the recent changes in U.S. tax law, we are able to accelerate some significant partner investments.” \nUnlike Wal-Mart (wmt) , Starbucks isn’t touting a new starting wage. The coffee giant says the new level will vary by region, and it already pays more than the minimum wage in all 50 states. \nStarbucks also has been investing in mobile technology to fix congestion at pickup counters in the U.S., where sales have struggled to keep pace with international growth. The company is slated to give investors an update on its progress when it reports earnings on Thursday. \nThe employee changes come after Starbucks hired Aon to compare its benefits with similar companies. The analysis found that the coffee company could improve its sick-time policies. Starbucks also is giving an extra 2018 stock grant to U.S. employees, and will expand parental leave to include non-birth parents. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
