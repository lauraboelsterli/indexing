The 200-year-old company, swamped by debt and pension liabilities and losing cash, went into liquidation, threatening suppliers, merchants and big banks.\nBreakingviews : Carillion collapse is UK outsourcing stress test\nThe world’s largest container shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk is teaming up with IBM to create an industry-wide trading platform it says can speed up trade and save billions of dollars.\nOil\nSurging shale production is poised to push U.S. oil output to more than 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970 and crossing a threshold few could have imagined even a decade ago.\nSaudi Aramco has not invited UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to pitch for senior advisory roles in its stock market listing because they have not lent money to the state oil giant in recent years, according to five finance sources .\nUnited States\nPresident Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon will meet behind closed doors with a U.S. House of Representatives committee that is probing whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\nSixty-four trade groups, foreign governments, Republican candidates and others stayed at or held events at properties linked to Trump during Trump’s first year in office, a political watchdog group said in a report .\nThe 13 California siblings who police say were starved and chained to beds by their parents rarely left their disheveled house and, when they did, they appeared small and pale and acted strangely, neighbors said.\nFour-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles said she was sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team physician Larry Nassar, the latest in a list of female athletes to accuse the doctor of misconduct.\nAna Ashury, a mixed-media artist, stores away her artwork on her rooftop in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, Israel, November 19, 2017.REUTERS/Corinna Kern World\nChina’s economy is expected to cool this year as a government-led crackdown on debt risks and factory pollution drag on overall activity, a Reuters poll showed.\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK issued a false alarm about a North Korean missile launch on Tuesday, just days after a similar gaffe caused panic in Hawaii, but it managed to correct the error within minutes.\nLife began to look up for Gaza’s Palestinians when reconciliation between its Hamas Islamist rulers and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in October brought a drop in crippling prices.
