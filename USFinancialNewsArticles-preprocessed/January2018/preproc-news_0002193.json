    "text": "January 1, 2018 / 5:49 PM / Updated an hour ago Two more head coaches fired as Bears dump Fox, Lions ditch Caldwell Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Two more head coaches were fired from National Football League teams on Monday, bringing the number to four in less than 24 hours since the end of the regular season. \nJohn Fox was sent packing from the Chicago Bears after three seasons, while Jim Caldwell was sacked after four seasons with the Detroit Lions. \nFox departs after a 5-11 season, and a 14-34 overall record. \n“Today is the tough part of our results-oriented business but I wish the Bears organization the best for years to come,” he said in a statement released by the club. \nCaldwell, meanwhile, leaves Detroit after compiling a 36-28 record, the first head coach at the franchise to compile a winning record since the early 1970s. \nThe Lions made the playoffs twice under Caldwell, but have not won a postseason game since 1991, the second longest active drought in the NFL. \nOn Sunday, the Indianapolis Colts dumped head coach Chuck Pagano after six seasons, while the Oakland Raiders dispensed with Jack Del Rio after three seasons. \nThe New York Giants fired Ben McAdoo four weeks ago.
