The use of words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans” and “believes,” among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to: appointment and retirement of personnel, future financial performance, business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends, prospects in the industries in which our businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: risks and uncertainties related to the capital markets, changes in senior management at Presidio, changes in our relationship with our vendor partners, adverse changes in economic conditions, risks resulting from a decreased demand for Presidio’s information technology solutions, risks relating to rapid technological change in Presidio’s industry and risks relating to acquisitions or regulatory changes. Certain of these and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in Presidio’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time. In light of these risks and uncertainties, these forward looking statements may not prove to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of our management as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements.\nSource: Presidio, Inc.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nEd Yuen\n866-232-3762\ninvestors@presidio.com\nMedia Contact:\nDori White\nVice President of Corporate Marketing\n212-324-4301\ndoriwhite@presidio.com\nSource:Presidio, Inc.",
