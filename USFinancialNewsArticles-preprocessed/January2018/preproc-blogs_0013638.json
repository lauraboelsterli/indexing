    "text": "By Natasha Bach 5:47 AM EST \nMore than two in five American employers are providing a paid day off for Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, a significant increase from years past. \nAccording to a survey published by Bloomberg BNA , 43% of employers surveyed will mark Monday as a paid holiday, compared to the previous all-time high of 37% recorded in 2016 and 2017. \nRead: The GOP Tax Bill Repeals Obamacare’s Individual Mandate. Here’s What That Means for You \nThe percentage of employers giving their workers the day off varies considerably from industry to industry. Bloomberg BNA notes that 73% of employees at non-business organizations and 53% of workers in unionized organizations will get the day off, but only 14% manufacturers and a third of non-manufacturing businesses will follow suit. \nApproximately one in four employers will host a commemorative event to mark Dr. King’s life and achievements. However, no manufacturers intended to sponsor an event. \nBloomberg BNA surveyed close to 450 employers and has conducted this nationwide survey each year since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially recognized as a federal holiday.
