The attacker was believed to be among the dead. \nShots rang out about 2:40 a.m. at Ed’s Car Wash in Melcroft, about 53 miles (85 km) southeast of Pittsburgh, police said. \nThe shooting at the coin-operated facility was still under investigation, and the motive was unknown, police said. \nPittsburgh television station WPXI reported the dead as three men and two women, but state police declined to confirm that information. \nFive people were killed, including a man believed to be the shooter, and one was wounded, police said. \n“There is no continued threat to the community,” a police spokesman said.
