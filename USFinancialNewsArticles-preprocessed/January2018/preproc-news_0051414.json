Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.15 (GAAP) and $1.67 (non-GAAP 1 ), compared with $1.30 (GAAP) and $1.38 (non-GAAP 1 ) in the prior year. Operating cash flow was $278 million and free cash flow was $258 million compared with operating cash flow of $252 million and free cash flow of $224 million in the prior year.\n\"We generated solid results in the second quarter driven by the strongest revenue growth we have achieved in more than seven years, including a 26% increase in tactical radio sales,\" said William M. Brown, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “In the first half, revenue and orders were up in all segments, and company book-to-bill was a robust 1.3. As a result of our strong performance and improved revenue outlook despite a lengthened continuing resolution, as well as benefits from tax reform, we have increased EPS guidance for the fiscal year.\"\nSummary Financial Results\n($ millions, except per share data) Second Quarter First Half FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Orders $ 1,390 $ 1,234 13 % $ 3,695 $ 2,973 24 % Revenue $ 1,535 $ 1,449 6 % $ 2,948 $ 2,869 3 % (GAAP comparison) Operating income $ 272 $ 277 (2 )% $ 544 $ 523 4 % Operating margin 17.7 % 19.1 % (140)bps 18.5 % 18.2 % 30bps Earnings per share $ 1.15 $ 1.30 (12 )% $ 2.52 $ 2.45 3 % (Non-GAAP comparison) Operating income* $ 284 $ 290 (2 )% $ 556 $ 553 1 % Operating margin* 18.5 % 20.0 % (150)bps 18.9 % 19.3 % (40)bps Earnings per share* $ 1.67 $ 1.38 21 % $ 3.05 $ 2.66 15 % *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the attached tables. Second quarter revenue increased 6%, with growth in Communication Systems and Electronic Systems partially offset by a slight decline in Space and Intelligence Systems. The decrease in GAAP EPS was primarily due to non-cash charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from a $52 million one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and from an adjustment for deferred compensation, partially offset by the absence of Exelis acquisition-related charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP EPS increased by $.29, which includes $.21 of benefit from tax reform and $.08 from higher volume, operational excellence, higher pension income and a lower share count, partially offset by the absence of a $22 million favorable contract adjustment incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin remained strong at 18.5%. Orders increased 13% to $1.4 billion.\nFirst half revenue increased 3%, with growth across all three segments. GAAP EPS was up 3% due to the absence of Exelis acquisition-related charges incurred in the first half of fiscal 2017, partially offset by the non-cash charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on increased volume, benefit from tax reform, higher pension income, strong program execution and year-over-year integration synergy savings, partially offset by a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 18.9%. Orders grew 24%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3.\nCommunication Systems\n($ millions) Second Quarter First Half FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 489 $ 413 18 % $ 899 $ 843 7 % Operating income $ 144 $ 121 19 % $ 262 $ 239 10 % Operating margin 29.5 % 29.3 % 20bps 29.1 % 28.4 % 70bps The 18% increase in second quarter segment revenue was primarily due to a 56% increase in DoD Tactical revenue driven by readiness demand across all the Services and a 9% increase in International Tactical revenue from strong growth in the Middle East. Operating income grew 19% on increased volume and operational efficiencies.\nDoD Tactical momentum continued in the second quarter, with both ground tactical and airborne awards:\n$765 million ceiling, 5-year, single-award IDIQ contract with the U.S. Navy to provide tactical radios and ancillary devices $71 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for single-channel ground and airborne radio systems (SINCGARS) $60 million order from the U.S. Air Force for Falcon III ® tactical radios $42 million order from the U.S. Army for the Security Force Assistance Brigade for Falcon III ® tactical radios and waveforms\nInternational Tactical received several key orders for modernization programs and ongoing counter-terrorism support:\n$45 million from Iraq for security forces modernization $18 million from Afghanistan to provide sustainment services to its security forces $10 million from the Royal Danish Army for tactical vehicular radio systems\nElectronic Systems\n($ millions) Second Quarter First Half FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 584 $ 570 2 % $ 1,124 $ 1,107 2 % Operating income $ 101 $ 134 (25 )% $ 210 $ 245 (14 )% Operating margin 17.3 % 23.5 % (620)bps 18.7 % 22.1 % (340)bps The 2% increase in second quarter segment revenue reflected higher volume in Avionics, with growth on the F-35 and several other platforms, and in C4ISR from the ramp of the UAE battle management system and U.K. robotics programs, partially offset by contract adjustments in Mission Networks, including the absence of the favorable prior-year adjustment on the ADS-B program. Operating income declined 25% as strong performance on Electronic Warfare (EW) programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics were more than offset by the contract adjustments in Mission Networks, higher R&D expenses and unfavorable mix.\nNew awards continued to strengthen the company's strategic position in Avionics on both domestic and international large platforms. Domestic awards included a $93 million contract for F-35 LRIP 11 release systems and a $48 million, 5-year block buy contract for LRIP 12-14 in support of the F-35 antenna production program. International awards included a $25 million contract for release systems to support Qatar F-15s and a development contract for release systems on the Korean Next Generation Indigenous Fighter with significant follow-on potential.\nSpace and Intelligence Systems\n($ millions) Second Quarter First Half FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 465 $ 468 (1 )% $ 931 $ 921 1 % Operating income $ 81 $ 76 7 % $ 168 $ 155 8 % Operating margin 17.4 % 16.2 % 120bps 18.0 % 16.8 % 120bps Second quarter segment revenue declined slightly as higher revenue from Classified programs was more than offset by lower revenue from environmental programs. Operating income increased 7% to $81 million on productivity and incremental pension income.\nOrder momentum continued in Classified programs as further progress on investments in innovative ground processing capabilities and small satellite technology resulted in additional funding for an award announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and in a multi-million dollar, multi-year award in ground processing for next generation operational software. The segment also received additional funding from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for an IDIQ contract received in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to perform search and retrieval services for geospatial products.\nAdditionally, funding support continued for key environmental programs, including a $25 million award for GOES-R program sustainment and two new awards totaling up to $95 million to monitor weather satellite transmission interference for the U.S. Department of Commerce and to provide satellite ground capabilities for the U.S. Air Force weather satellite recapitalization effort.\nCash and Capital Deployment\n($ millions) Second Quarter First Half FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 278 $ 252 $ 26 $ 373 $ 295 $ 78 Free cash flow* $ 258 $ 224 $ 34 $ 330 $ 246 $ 84 *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the attached tables. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Harris generated free cash flow of $330 million and returned $287 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the period with $422 million of cash.\nGuidance\nAs a result of the company's strong first half performance and benefits from tax reform, Harris updated its guidance for fiscal 2018 to the following:\nRevenue in a range of $6.08 - 6.14 billion, up 3 - 4% from fiscal 2017 (tightened from previous guidance of $6.02 - 6.14 billion, up 2 - 4%) GAAP EPS from continuing operations in a range of $5.78 - $5.98 and non-GAAP EPS 2 from continuing operations in a range of $6.30 - $6.50 (an increase from previous guidance of $5.85 - $6.05 GAAP and non-GAAP) Free cash flow of approximately $900 million (tightened from previous guidance of $850 - 900 million) Share repurchases of $200 million (up $50 million from previous guidance) Tax rate of approximately 28% GAAP; 23% non-GAAP (a decrease from approximately 28.5% previously, including a half-year benefit of 5 percentage points from tax reform)\nConference Call and Webcast\nHarris will host a conference call today, January 30, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris business trends and to understand Harris performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAttachments: Financial statements (8 tables)\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect management's current expectations, assumptions and estimates of future performance and economic conditions.
