    "text": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Wednesday the recent craze over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well.\n\"In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending ,\" the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said.\n\"When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know,\" he added in an interview on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" from Omaha, Nebraska. \"If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth.\"\nshow chapters Warren Buffett: Cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending 4 Hours Ago | 01:28 Also on the show, Buffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, also blasted frothiness in bitcoin — and in venture capital funding.\nEarlier Wednesday, the Omaha-based conglomerate announced the appointment of two new vice chairs. Gregory Abel, 55, will be vice chair of non-insurance businesses. Ajit Jain, 66, will be vice chair of insurance operations.\nBuffett said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.\n\"We don't own any, we're not short any, we'll never have a position in them,\" he said.\nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC \"I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about,\" he added. \"Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about.\"\nExchange operators such as CME Group and Cboe Global Markets have opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading.\nThe price of bitcoin declined 3.69 percent to $13,907 Wednesday, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. The digital currency is up more than 1,500 percent in the past 12 months.\nBuffett's comments came a day after J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon backpedaled his earlier criticisms of cryptocurrencies. In September, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud.\n—Reuters contributed to this report.\nRead more from CNBC's interview with billionaire investor Warren Buffett:\nWarren Buffett: 'I feel terrific,' and moves toward succession are not related to my health\nWarren Buffett says 'huge' corporate tax cut is 'not baked in' stock market\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
