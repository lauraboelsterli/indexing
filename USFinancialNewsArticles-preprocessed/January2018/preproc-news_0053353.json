    "text": " 27 p.m. ET Share \nChinese government may have known about Spectre, Meltdown before being publicly disclosed Reuters An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers didn’t learn of the chip flaws until January. \nBy Robert McMillan Liza Lin \nIn initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved. \nThe decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said. \nWeeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel’s INTC, +10.55% choices about whom would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries. \nThe flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google’s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9 — people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised — but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.",
