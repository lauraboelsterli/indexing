    "text": "January 10, 2018 / 9:57 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Police find getaway car, hunt two after Paris Ritz jewel heist Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - French police on Thursday sought two men after finding the getaway car used by a gang of axe-wielding thieves who snatched jewellery from a store in the upscale Paris Ritz hotel. \nThree hooded thieves carried out the robbery late on Wednesday at the ultra-chic hotel on the city centre’s Place Vendome, next to the Justice Ministry. \nBut the three, all aged about 30, were arrested after being blocked in the building, a source close to the investigation said. \nTwo accomplices waiting outside were thrown some booty and escaped by car and motorbike. The source said that the motorcyclist however dropped one satchel of loot after hitting a pedestrian in a melee fleeing the scene. \nThe getaway car was found about 20 kms (12 miles) north of Paris in an area where the three arrested came from, the source said. \nOfficials were still determining the value of the haul since some jewels and watches had been recovered on those arrested. \nA figure of 4.5 million euros (£4 million), announced earlier, related to the total value of the jewellery in the display cases.

Over the last few years police have kept a permanent presence in the area, but that has not deterred potential robbers. \nIn December, a man was able to substitute two diamonds and two rings worth 5.5 million euros in a jewellery store replacing them with fakes. \nIn October 2016, reality television celebrity Kim Kardashian was the victim of a robbery just 10 minutes walk from the Ritz, in which millions of dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen from her.
