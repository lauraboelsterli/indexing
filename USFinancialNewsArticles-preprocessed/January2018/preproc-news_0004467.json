Early works construction is underway and Equinox is on track to pour gold at Aurizona in late 2018. The operation is expected to produce an average of 136,000 ounces of gold per year.\nFor more information, visit the Equinox website at www.equinoxgold.com and see the press releases dated November 16, 2017 and December 22, 2017.\nSandstorm has a 3% - 5% sliding scale net smelter returns (\"NSR\") royalty on the Aurizona project.

As consideration for the transaction, Sandstorm received a 2% NSR royalty over the Bondoukou, Abengourou and Odienné projects areas and will receive C$400,000 in cash or shares of Awalé on each anniversary of the acquisition until commercial production is achieved.\nThe land package Awalé holds is currently 1,589 km 2 , with application for an additional 2,393 km 2 . In 2018, the planned work at Bondoukou includes geochemistry followed up by 5,000 to 7,500 metres of RC drilling to test targets. A regional survey is expected to commence at Odienné and reconnaissance mapping and sampling is planned at Abengourou.\nPursuant to National Instrument 62-103 - The Early Warning System and Related Take Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues, Sandstorm is announcing the acquisition of an aggregate of 3,137,200 common shares (\"Awalé Shares\") and 500,000 share purchase warrants (\"Awalé Warrants\") of Awalé. Sandstorm acquired 1,000,000 shares and 500,000 warrants pursuant to a private placement conducted by Awalé. The remaining 2,137,200 shares were acquired by Sandstorm upon the conversion of certain debt owed by Awalé to Sandstorm in connection with the Cote d'Ivoire transaction.\nWith the acquisition of Awalé Shares, Sandstorm now holds an approximately 10.9% of the outstanding common shares. If Sandstorm exercises the Awalé Warrants, it would then hold 12.4% of the then issued and outstanding Awalé shares (on a partially diluted basis).\nThe acquisition of the Awalé Shares by Sandstorm was effected for investment purposes.
