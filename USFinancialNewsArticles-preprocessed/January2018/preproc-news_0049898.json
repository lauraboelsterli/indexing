    "text": "Finishes Year with Double-digit Percentage Annual Sales Growth\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graco Inc. (NYSE: GGG) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 29, 2017.\nSummary\n$ in millions except per share amounts\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 29,\n2017\nDec 30,\n2016\n%\nChange\nDec 29,\n2017\nDec 30,\n2016\n%\nChange\nNet Sales $ 374.9 $ 349.1 7 % $ 1,474.7 $ 1,329.3 11 % Operating Earnings 76.2 (106.9 ) 171 % 360.4 113.9 217 % Net Earnings 36.4 (104.2 ) 135 % 252.4 40.7 521 % Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share\n$ 0.21 $ (0.61 ) 134 % $ 1.45 $ 0.24 504 % Adjusted (non-GAAP) (1): Operating Earnings, adjusted $ 88.3 $ 85.1 4 % $ 372.5 $ 305.9 22 % Net Earnings, adjusted 59.4 57.2 4 % 249.4 202.1 23 % Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share, adjusted\n$ 0.34 $ 0.33 3 % $ 1.43 $ 1.18 21 % (1) Excludes impacts of non-recurring income tax adjustments, changes in accounting for stock compensation, and pension restructuring in 2017. Also excludes the effects of impairment charges recorded in 2016. See Financial Results Adjusted for Comparability below for a reconciliation of adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.\nSales for the quarter increased in all segments and regions. There were 14 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 13 weeks in 2017. All segments finished with double-digit percentage growth for the year. Gross margin rates for the quarter and year remained strong. Increases in sales and earnings-based incentives, spending on growth initiatives and the pension settlement loss contributed to higher operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share in 2017 include a benefit of $0.09 for the quarter and $0.21 for the year from a required change in accounting for stock compensation. Non-recurring income tax adjustments reduced diluted earnings per share in 2017 by $0.17 for the quarter and $0.14 for the year. 2016 results included impairment charges that reduced diluted earnings per share for the quarter and year by $0.94.\n“Outstanding execution throughout 2017 by Graco’s employees, suppliers, channel partners and end users drove record quarterly sales in each quarter of 2017 and double-digit growth for the year,” said Patrick J. McHale, Graco’s President and CEO. “Our investments in product development, new markets and geographic expansion are producing nice returns. Contractor segment growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter, which resulted in rebate and growth incentives that pressured gross and operating margins for the segment as well as an unfavorable mix for the overall Company in the quarter. The tiers for these incentives are reset at the beginning of each year based on sales levels achieved in the prior year and have a history of driving growth, so we are happy to pay for these programs.”\nConsolidated Results\nSales for the quarter increased 7 percent, with increases of 5 percent in the Americas, 11 percent in EMEA (4 percent at consistent translation rates) and 11 percent in Asia Pacific (9 percent at consistent translation rates). Sales for the year increased 11 percent, with increases of 9 percent in the Americas, 10 percent in EMEA and 16 percent in Asia Pacific. Changes in currency translation rates increased sales by approximately $7 million (2 percentage points) for the quarter and did not have a significant impact on sales for the year.\nGross profit margin rates improved slightly for both the quarter and the year. Favorable effects from currency translation, higher production volume and realized pricing were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of product mix.\nThe Company restructured its funded U.S. pension plan in 2017. The restructuring resulted in a $12 million pension settlement loss that was included in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter and reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.04. Total operating expenses for 2016 included an impairment charge of $192 million in the fourth quarter.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter increased $25 million (25 percent) compared to the fourth quarter before impairment charges last year. The increase includes the $12 million pension settlement loss, $3 million of increases in sales and earnings-based incentives and $1 million of incremental spending on growth initiatives. Operating expenses for the year increased $30 million (8 percent), with volume and rate-related increases and the pension settlement loss accounting for most of the increase.\nThe effective income tax rate was 51 percent for the quarter and 27 percent for the year. Adoption of a new accounting standard, requiring excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises to be credited to the income tax provision (formerly credited to equity), reduced the tax provision by $16 million for the quarter and $36 million for the year, decreasing the effective tax rate for the quarter and year by 21 and 10 percentage points, respectively. U.S. federal income tax reform legislation passed at the end of 2017 required a revaluation of net deferred tax assets and instituted a toll charge on unrepatriated foreign earnings that increased the tax provision by a total of $36 million, increasing the effective tax rate by 48 percentage points for the quarter and 10 percentage points for the year. Effects of tax planning and other non-recurring tax changes decreased the effective rate by 6 percentage points for the quarter and 3 percentage points for the year.\nSegment Results\nManagement assesses performance of segments by reference to operating earnings excluding unallocated corporate expenses and asset impairments. For a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated operating earnings, refer to the Segment Information table included in the financial statement section of this release. Certain measurements of segment operations are summarized below:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Industrial Process Contractor Industrial Process Contractor Net Sales (in millions) $ 182.3 $ 77.6 $ 115.0 $ 692.0 $ 294.7 $ 488.1 Percentage change from last year Sales 4 % 10 % 11 % 10 % 11 % 13 % Operating earnings 1 % 27 % 3 % 15 % 46 % 24 % Operating earnings as a percentage of sales\n2017\n33 % 17 % 18 % 34 % 18 % 23 % 2016\n34 % 15 % 19 % 33 % 13 % 21 % Components of net sales change by geographic region for the Industrial segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Volume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total Volume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total Americas (1)% 0% 1% 0% 6% 0% 0% 6% EMEA (2)% 0% 8% 6% 6% 1% 1% 8% Asia Pacific 10% 0% 2% 12% 18% 1% (1)% 18% Consolidated 1% 1% 2% 4% 9% 1% 0% 10% Industrial segment sales growth in the fourth quarter was limited by a decline in sales of finishing systems compared to a record quarter for finishing systems in the prior year. Increased spending on product and regional growth initiatives resulted in a 1 percentage point decrease in operating margin compared to last year. For the year, higher sales volume, including strong finishing systems growth, and expense leverage drove a 1 percentage point increase in operating margin rate.\nComponents of net sales change by geographic region for the Process segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Volume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total Volume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total Americas 4% 1% 0% 5% 10% 0% 0% 10% EMEA 14% 1% 5% 20% 9% 0% (2)% 7% Asia Pacific 15% 1% 2% 18% 17% 0% (1)% 16% Consolidated 7% 1% 2% 10% 11% 0% 0% 11% The Process segment had solid sales growth for the quarter in all product applications. For the year, legacy product applications had double-digit percentage growth while Oil and Natural Gas sales were flat for the year. Operating margin rates for this segment increased 2 percentage points for the quarter and 5 percentage points for the year, driven by higher sales volume, favorable expense leverage and a decrease in intangible amortization related to the impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nComponents of net sales change by geographic region for the Contractor segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Volume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total\nVolume\nand Price\nAcquisitions Currency Total Americas 10% 0% 0% 10% 12% 0% 0% 12% EMEA 11% 0% 7% 18% 17% 0% 2% 19% Asia Pacific (2)% 0% 2% 0% 9% 0% 0% 9% Consolidated 9% 0% 2% 11% 12% 0% 1% 13% Contractor segment sales for the quarter and year increased in all channels. Increases in volume-based customer incentives, product launch and promotion costs and changes in product mix drove the operating margin rate for the quarter 1 percentage point lower than last year. Contractor segment operating margin rate for the year increased 2 percentage points compared to last year due to higher sales volume, improved gross margin rate and favorable expense leverage.\nOutlook\n“We are initiating an outlook for the full-year 2018 of mid single-digit growth on an organic, constant currency basis, with growth expected in every region and reportable segment,” said McHale. “Demand levels in the fourth quarter remained solid and provide a foundation for our full-year outlook. While Industrial segment sales growth in the fourth quarter was low, bookings were better than billings and indicative of a capital equipment environment that remains stable-to-improving.”\nFinancial Results Adjusted for Comparability\nThere were multiple events in the last two years that caused significant fluctuations in financial results, including impairment charges recorded in 2016, changes in accounting for tax benefits related to stock compensation, federal income tax reform and pension plan restructuring in 2017. Excluding the impacts of those events presents a more consistent basis for comparison of financial results. A calculation of the non-GAAP measurements of adjusted operating earnings, earnings before income taxes, income taxes, effective income tax rates, net earnings and diluted earnings per share follows (in millions except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 29,\n2017\nDec 30,\n2016 Dec 29,\n2017 Dec 30,\n2016 Operating earnings, as reported $ 76.2 $ (106.9 ) $ 360.4 $ 113.9 Pension settlement loss 12.1 — 12.1 — Impairment — 192.0 — 192.0 Operating earnings, adjusted $ 88.3 $ 85.1 $ 372.5 $ 305.9 Earnings before income taxes $ 73.5 $ (111.0 ) $ 347.1 $ 96.7 Adjustments 12.1 192.0 12.1 192.0 Earnings before income taxes, adjusted $ 85.6 $ 81.0 $ 359.2 $ 288.7 Income taxes, as reported $ 37.1 $ (6.8 ) $ 94.7 $ 56.0 Excess tax benefit from option exercises 15.8 — 36.3 — Income tax reform (35.6 ) — (35.6 ) — Other non-recurring tax changes 4.5 — 10.0 — Tax effects of adjustments 4.4 30.6 4.4 30.6 Income taxes, adjusted $ 26.2 $ 23.8 $ 109.8 $ 86.6 Effective income tax rate As reported 51 % 6 % 27 % 58 % Adjusted 31 % 29 % 31 % 30 % Net Earnings, as reported $ 36.4 $ (104.2 ) $ 252.4 $ 40.7 Impairment, net — 161.4 — 161.4 Pension settlement loss, net 7.7 — 7.7 — Excess tax benefit from option exercises (15.8 ) — (36.3 ) — Income tax reform 35.6 — 35.6 — Other non-recurring tax changes (4.5 ) — (10.0 ) — Net Earnings, adjusted $ 59.4 $ 57.2 $ 249.4 $ 202.1 Weighted Average Diluted Shares 175.7 171.3 174.3 170.9 Diluted Earnings per Share As reported $ 0.21 $ (0.61 ) $ 1.45 $ 0.24 Adjusted $ 0.34 $ 0.33 $ 1.43 $ 1.18 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Company desires to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions regarding forward-looking statements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is filing this Cautionary Statement in order to do so.
