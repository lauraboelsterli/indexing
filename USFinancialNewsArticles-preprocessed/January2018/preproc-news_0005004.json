    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said after talks with South Korean trade officials in Washington on Friday that there is “much work to do” to reach agreement on a revamped trade deal.\n”We have much work to do to reach an agreement that serves the economic interests of the American people,“ Lighthizer said in a statement. ”Our goals are clear: we must achieve fair and reciprocal trade between our two nations. We will move forward as expeditiously as possible to achieve this goal.”\nThe statement said that “both sides agreed to follow-up to discuss timing for the next meeting in the very near term.”\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Mohammad Zargham\n ",
