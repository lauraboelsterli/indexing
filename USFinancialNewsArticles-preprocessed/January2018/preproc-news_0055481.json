    "text": "State of the Union President Trump Urges Cooperation During State of the Union Address US President Donald Trump looks on during a ceremony before delivering a speech during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, eastern Switzerland, on Jan. 26, 2018. Nicholas Kamm—AFP/Getty Images By Reuters 9:43 PM EST \n(WASHINGTON) – President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats to work toward compromises on immigration and infrastructure after a bruising year of partisan battles that centered on Trump’s leadership. \n“Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve,” Trump said in his first State of the Union address, delivered in the chamber of the House of Representatives. \nTrump used the speech to try to demonstrate presidential leadership and overcome doubts about his presidency at a time when he is battling a probe into his campaign’s alleged ties with Russia and suffering low job approval ratings. \nFor more on the State of the Union, watch Fortune’s video: \nTrump took credit for U.S. economic gains and a soaring stock market. \n“Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages,” he said. \nFacing a deadline on an immigration controversy and strong Democratic opposition, Trump was calling for the type of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats that has eluded him during a rocky first year in office.
