    "text": "DALLAS, Jan. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GEX Management, Inc. (OTCQB: GXXM), a visionary management and professional services company, announced the implementation of its 2018 growth strategy to enlarge its corporate footprint, increase liquidity, and ultimately satisfy the requirements necessary to up-list to the NYSE American Stock Exchange.\nThe initial phase of this strategy included a stock dividend. This dividend had a net effect of a 4-for-3 forward split. The process of implementing the forward split included the addition of the letter \"D\" to the Company's stock symbol for approximately 20 trading days. The GEX Management stock ticker has now reverted back to its original trading symbol of \" GXXM .\" \"I believe this forward split will increase the liquidity of our company stock, deliver quantifiable value to our shareholders, and grow our investor base. The recent acquisition of property in Northwest Arkansas is reflective of management's commitment to growth. My aim is to continue accelerating this GEX Management trend with the aspiration of up-listing with a national exchange designed for growing companies,\" stated Carl Dorvil, CEO of GEX Management.\nAbout GEX Management\nGEX Management, Inc. Is a licensed Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and a Professional Services Company providing comprehensive back office services to clients in a variety of industries.
