    "text": "Toronto Washington, D.C. \nThe e-commerce giant received 238 proposals from cities in North America, many with lofty tax incentives and unique offers directed at CEO Jeff Bezos. \n\"Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough â€” all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\" Holly Sullivan, an executive with Amazon Public Policy, said in a statement. \nThe 20 places that are moving on in the selection process will work with Amazon over the coming months to \"evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership,\" the company said. \nAmazon expects to make a final decision this year. \nAn analysis by CNBC determined that the Charlotte/Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina best matched Amazon's criteria. \nAmong the cities that didn't make the cut was Detroit, one of the areas hit hardest by the Great Recession .
