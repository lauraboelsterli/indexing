REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nThe e-commerce giant, which revealed its Prime shipment numbers for the first time, did not give comparable full-year shipment number for 2016. \nAmazon claimed that its Fire TV Stick and voice controlled smart device Echo Dot were the best-selling products among U.S. Prime members from any manufacturer in any category across all of its product offerings. \nAmazon Prime, which offers its users services like free two-day shipping for certain purchases, unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Prime Video, has been attracting more subscribers every year. \nThe company said it shipped over 1 billion items worldwide via Prime during holiday season in 2016. \nAmazon Prime, which entered countries including Mexico, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Singapore last year, now is present in 16 countries around the world. \nShares of the Seattle, Washington based company were up 1.5 percent at $1,187 in afternoon trading.
