These preliminary results were achieved in only 39 days of Crypto Currency operations and consist of (1) cash proceeds from mining operations of $27,500, (2) equipment retail sales of $51,500 and (3) ownership of mined assets (BTC,ETH,LTC), with market value (dated 12/31/2017) of $43,786.\n[Mining Rigs]\nThe total number of installed mining rigs had reached 125. This number is directly related to the availability of the electric power, which is currently at maximum utilization capacity at both locations.\nThe initial number of units purchased was 150, however it was reduced to 125, due to the unexpected price increase by the supplier (Innosillicon), from $1,600 to $3,200.\nThe Company has placed a stand by purchase order for an additional 80 mining rigs (Nemesis 6GPU/8GPU/190-220 MH/S) which will be activated, once an additional mining capacity is secured.\n[Balance Sheet]\nThe Company has entered 2018 with a strong Balance Sheet, including a cash position of $130,000 (unaudited) and without any Convertible Debt obligations.\n[Convertible Debt]\nAs of December 31, 2017, all of the Company's outstanding Convertible Debt has been eliminated. The process has been accomplished as follows:\nTwo outstanding Convertible Debt Notes (#1/dated December 30, 2017 and #2/dated July 7, 2017) with Global Opportunity Fund (\"Lender\") were retired via Share Exchange using Viva Entertainment Group common stock One outstanding Convertible Debt Note (#3/dated March 28, 2017) with the Lender was converted on 01/05/2018 into INTV shares. The Lender had agreed to the 60 day lock-up period with volume limitations One outstanding Convertible Debt Note (#4/dated September 9, 2017) with Private investor was retired via cash payment by the Company, in the amount of $5,635.88 As a part of Share Exchange transaction, the Company will receive a cash payment in the amount of $15,000 from the Lender.\n[Business Development]\nThe Company is in advanced discussions with two groups in regards to (Group 1/IT Company) engagement to complete a blockchain software design & development for CryptoFunder and (Group 2/International Bank) to secure funding capital required to market and fund crypto-collateralized debt instruments powered by the CryptoFunder blockchain.\n[Real Estate]\nThe Company has made an offer and has received a verbal acceptance from property seller (bank) in regards to the purchase of the 9,000 sq ft warehouse facility. This pending real estate purchase is designed to increase the capacity of the mining operations up to 1500 rigs. Estimated time (post purchase) for a complete build out is 60-75 days.
