    "text": "January 1, 2018 / 4:02 AM / Updated 16 hours ago Tennis-Kvitova withdraws from Brisbane with viral illness Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRISBANE, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova withdrew from the Brisbane International with a viral illness on Monday. \nThe 27-year-old Czech was unable to take the court in her first round match against Estonian Anett Kontaveit and was replaced in the draw by lucky loser Heather Watson. \nThe former world number two required four hours of surgery on her left hand in December 2016 after being attacked by a man wielding a knife who had gained access to her apartment by posing as a utility worker. \nKvitova returned to action, after months of rehabilitation, during the French Open in May and went on to win the Aegon Classic in June. \nShe last played at the Tianjin Open in October and was preparing to open her 2018 season in Brisbane.
