The subscription model serves as a physical reminder for customer to change their air filters, something tenants and homeowners frequently forget to do. Research indicates routine replacement of air filters reduces energy consumption by up to 15%, and the EPA recommends homeowners change their air filters at least once every 3 months to avoid expensive maintenance and/or early system failures.\nMedia Kit: www.filtereasy.com/media\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leading-air-filter-subscription-company-filtereasy-acquires-cleanerfilterscom-300576301.html\nSOURCE FilterEasy",
