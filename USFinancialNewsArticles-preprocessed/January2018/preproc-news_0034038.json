It’s not just DACA expiration but also the debt ceiling issue.” \nAt 12:26 p.m. ET (1726 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 67.45 points, or 0.26 percent, at 26,139.17 and the S&P 500 was up 12.39 points, or 0.44 percent, at 2,822.69. \nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 49.96 points, or 0.68 percent, at 7,386.34. \nThe biotech index rose 2.8 percent, as deal activity exploded with French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S.-based Celgene splurging a combined total of more than $20 billion. \nShares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ soared 63 percent after Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion. \nJuno Therapeutics rose about 27 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash. \nIn another big deal, AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings for $5.56 billion, sending the target’s shares surging 45 percent. \nIndustrial stocks were a drag on the indexes, following a near 1 percent drop in General Electric after BofA-Merrill Lynch downgraded its stock. GE fell below $16 for the first time since 2011, extending a losing streak from last week. \nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.4 percent gain in the energy index. \nHalliburton Co rose 4.9 percent after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production. \nShares of Netflix Inc, a major contributor to the recent stock rally, were up 2.5 percent ahead of its quarterly results after market closes. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,662 to 1,177. On the Nasdaq, 1,524 issues rose and 1,351 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",
