The Southern Poverty Law Center liberal advocacy group said it plans to file a legal challenge against the administration.\nKentucky, along with 30 other states, expanded Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level under the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement commonly called Obamacare.\nMore than 400,000 Kentucky residents gained health insurance through the program, the highest growth rate of Medicaid coverage of any state.\nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin has said the program has become financially unsustainable under Obamacare, although the federal government covers the majority of its cost. The waiver is projected to reduce the number of people on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million in the process.\nCMS administrator Seema Verma helped design Kentucky's waiver. She recused herself from the approval process to avoid a conflict of interest. (Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb,; Editing by G Crosse and Alistair Bell)",
