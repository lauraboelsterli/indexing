    "text": "January 11, 2018 / 4:49 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago Rallying - Consistency the key to ending Ogier dominance Jack Tarrant 3 Min Read \nBIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Consistency was the key factor in Sebastien Ogier claiming his fifth consecutive World Rally Championship (WRC) last season and his rivals know they must follow his lead if they are to break the Frenchman’s stranglehold on the sport.

It doesn’t mean it is going to be easy. We have more possibilities in the hand now but we still have to use them and bring the car to another level if possible.” \nOgier’s success was particularly aggravating for Hyundai, who were the fastest team in 2017 and won the most rallies in the season. \nHowever, inconsistencies in driving and car performance meant they finished second, with their top driver Thierry Neuville the runner-up to Ogier. \nNeuville admitted he had been left frustrated by finishing second, despite recording four wins, but stressed the determination at Hyundai to build on their success. \n“We were the best performer during the season, with the fastest times so generally we can’t complain,” the Belgian said. \n”Obviously, we missed the main goal at the end of the year, which was to be champion, even if we were leading at mid-season in the championship ahead of Sebastien. That was a great opportunity and we missed it but there is another great opportunity starting in two weeks.” \nBriton Kris Meeke was another left frustrated by the end of 2017, with five retirements during the season costing him dearly. Meeke finished seventh despite winning the rallies in Mexico and Catalonia. \n“We don’t need to win every one; we have seen Seb Ogier only won two rallies last year and was world champion. So we just need to bring that consistency and a lot more podiums,” said the Citroen driver. \nThe season starts in Monte Carlo on Jan. 25, the first of 13 races.
