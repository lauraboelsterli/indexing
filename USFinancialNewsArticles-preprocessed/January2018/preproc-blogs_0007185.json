I know they had to do some equity and [had] a couple of shortfalls, but I like B&G here.\"\nApollo Commercial Real Estate : \"No, no. We don't even know what they really own, and that's the problem with these things. They're just too dicey for me unless I have a read on what they really own.\"\nKinder Morgan : \"What can I say? It's going to do well just because we're out of pipe. It's not my favorite. I like Magellan Midstream Partners , MMP, which somebody initiated with a sell today. That person ought to come see me.\"\nRoyal Dutch Shell : \"Royal Dutch Shell is not my favorite, but you know what? It's not bad. I mean, I know that sounds like damning or faint praise, but I've just been so impressed with the big-caps [like] Chevron .\"\nXilinx : \"Boy, are you ever lucky. You know why? Because Goldman went from a hold to a buy to a conviction buy in one day. Now, [former CEO] Moshe Gavrielov did retire, but they are getting some really good business in the high-end communication stuff. I think you own it.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Buy B&G Foods on its millennial advantage 21 Hours Ago | 04:45 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Magellan Midstream Partners.\n ",
