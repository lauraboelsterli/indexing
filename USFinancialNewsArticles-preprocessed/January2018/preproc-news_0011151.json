HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Novocure (NASDAQ: NVCR) today reported operating statistics and preliminary, unaudited revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Novocure plans to discuss these results with investors at the 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Novocure is a global oncology company developing a proprietary therapy called Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. Tumor Treating Fields is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth and causing affected cancer cells to die.\nFourth quarter 2017 highlights include:\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n2017 2016 %\nChange\n2017 2016 %\nChange\nNon-financial Active patients at period end (1) 1,834 1,091 68% 1,834 1,091 68% Prescriptions received in period (2) 1,090 706 55% 4,120 2,808 47% Financial, in millions Preliminary net revenues, unaudited (3) $ 53.7 $ 30.2 77% $ 177.0 $ 82.9 114% (1)\nAn “active patient” is a patient who is on Optune under a commercial prescription order as of the measurement date, including patients who may be on a temporary break from treatment and who plan to resume treatment in less than 60 days.\n(2)\nA “prescription received” is a commercial order for Optune that is received from a physician certified to treat patients with Optune for a patient not previously on Optune. Orders to renew or extend treatment are not included in this total.\n(3)\nThe preliminary unaudited revenue results described in this press release are estimates only and are subject to revision until the Company reports its full financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 on February 22, 2018.\n“The fourth quarter 2017 was the twelfth consecutive quarter of active patient and revenue growth since the presentation of our EF-14 data in newly diagnosed GBM,” said William Doyle, Novocure’s Executive Chairman. “We continued to execute on our commercialization strategy, achieving 68 percent active patient growth compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we also received national government reimbursement in Japan for Optune for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma during the fourth quarter 2017, a significant milestone that represents our expanding commercial presence in markets across the globe.”\n“Tumor Treating Fields shows promise for a variety of solid tumors and we remain committed to realizing the full potential value of the platform across multiple solid tumor indications,” continued Mr. Doyle. “We continue to recruit patients for two ongoing phase 3 pivotal trials: our LUNAR trial in non-small cell lung cancer and our METIS trial in brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer. We have also received U.S. Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to initiate our PANOVA 3 phase 3 pivotal trial in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. We look forward to providing a company update and discussing our 2017 financial results on our February conference call.”\nFourth quarter 2017 operating statistics\nThere were 1,834 active patients on Optune at December 31, 2017, an increase of 743 active patients, or 68 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. The proportion of Optune prescriptions written for newly diagnosed GBM was more than 66 percent in the fourth quarter 2017.\nIn the United States, there were 1,320 active patients on Optune at December 31, 2017, an increase of 485 active patients, or 58 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. In Germany and other EMEA markets, there were 512 active patients on Optune at December 31, 2017, an increase of 256 active patients, or 100 percent, compared to December 31, 2016. In Japan, there were 2 active patients on Optune at December 31, 2017. There were no active patients on Optune in Japan during the same period in 2016.\nAdditionally, 1,090 prescriptions were received in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 385 prescriptions, or 55 percent, compared to the same period in 2016.\nIn the United States, 809 prescriptions were received in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 265 prescriptions, or 49 percent, compared to the same period in 2016.
