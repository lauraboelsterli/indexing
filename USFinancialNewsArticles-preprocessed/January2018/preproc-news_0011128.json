The growing company named digital media and technology executive D. Scott Bowen as its new President and Chief Operating Officer.

The company announced a $6.6 million Series A financing, led by a group of top venture investors, in October 2017.\n“The addition of Scott and Laura will be instrumental in ICX Media’s continued growth and development as we lead the evolution of the way marketers, media firms and content owners create and share more engaging and results-driven videos with their audiences,” said Michael Avon, Founder and CEO of ICX Media. “Laura’s deep industry insights and experience in strategically guiding global media brands and marketing agencies in today’s media landscape will greatly benefit ICX Media, the hundreds of thousands of creators we have in our network and the large and small brands we partner with. I am thrilled to have someone with Laura’s stature and experience in both marketing and media join our board as we move into the next phase of growth at ICX Media.”\n“With an impressive breadth of experience in content management, digital marketing and small and large business ventures, I’m certain Scott will help take ICX Media to the next level,” continued Avon. “The need for a true analytics-driven technology partner in this rapidly-changing environment provides us the perfect opportunity to bolster our go-to-market efforts.

ICX Media’s breakthrough technology and diverse creator community expertly bridges that gap, making data-inspired storytelling now possible. I am looking forward to working with the board and company leadership to take the organization’s successes to new heights.”\nBowen is an experienced technology executive and entrepreneur with a track record of building successful businesses and whose domain expertise sits at the intersection of digital media and marketing, data analytics and the cloud.
