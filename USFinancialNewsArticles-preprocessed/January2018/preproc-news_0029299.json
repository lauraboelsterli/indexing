Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can provide no assurance those expectations will be achieved. These risks include, among others, changes in the general economic climate, increased competition in the geographic areas in which the Company operates, changes in government laws and regulations and the ability of the Company to continue to identify, negotiate and acquire properties on terms favorable to the Company. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, Item 1A.
