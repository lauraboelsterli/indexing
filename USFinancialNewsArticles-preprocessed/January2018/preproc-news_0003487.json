    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today, Dr. Harry L. Williams officially begins his tenure as President & CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF). After an extensive executive search of more than 200 candidates led by TM 2 Executive Search, TMCF Board Chairman Jim Clifton and TMCF Founder Dr. N. Joyce Payne announced Dr. Williams as the new leader of TMCF at its 30th Anniversary Awards Gala succeeding Johnny C. Taylor, Jr.\n\"Our Board of Directors selected Dr. Williams because he was the best candidate for the job with a proven track record of raising millions of dollars, bipartisan advocacy, and creating innovative partnerships,\" said Jim Clifton. \"Harry has a unique appreciation and understanding of TMCF and HBCUs, as a member of our Board and former HBCU president, making him ready to hit the ground running day one.\"\nDr. Williams served as the President of Delaware State University (DSU) for eight successful years. Under his leadership, DSU completed its most successful five-year fundraising campaign in its history, raising $20 million. In 2016, he was presented the National TRIO Achiever Award, and in 2017, HBCU Digest named Dr. Williams among the \"Top 10 Influential HBCU Presidents\" in the country. TMCF also presented him with the Education Leadership Award at its 30 th Anniversary Awards Gala.\nBefore DSU, Dr. Williams served at the University of North Carolina General Administration as interim Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and was later elevated to interim Senior Associate Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. Dr. Williams also progressed from Associate Director to Associate Vice Chancellor posts in the areas of academic affairs, enrollment and diversity at Appalachian State University. In between that tenure, he was the interim Director of Admissions for North Carolina A&T State University.\nDr. Williams has a Bachelor of Science in Communication Broadcasting and a Master of Arts in Educational Media, both from Appalachian State University, as well as an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis from East Tennessee State University. He is married to Dr. Robin S. Williams and is the father of two sons.\n\"This is truly a game-changing career opportunity for me, but more importantly it is a unique moment for the entire Black College Community,\" stated Dr. Williams. \"I am ready to work with the entire TMCF team, and I know our future as an organization has never been brighter.\"\nAbout Thurgood Marshall College Fund\nEstablished in 1987, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) is the nation's largest organization exclusively representing the Black College Community.
