I didn’t give up, though and, if you don’t give up, you can win matches. I am proud of myself.” \nThe 26-year-old Romanian set up a Saturday final with second seed Caroline Wozniacki, who defeated surprise Belgian semi-finalist Elise Mertens 6-3 7-6(2). \nWozniacki showed her experience in saving two set points in the second set before winning the tiebreak to secure victory. \nWorld number 49 Kyle Edmund’s remarkable run at Melbourne Park came to an end with a 6-2 7-6(4) 6-2 defeat by Croatian sixth seed Marin Cilic in the semi-finals. \nCilic reached his third grand slam final, where he will face defending champion Roger Federer or South Korea’s Chung Hyeon.

Cilic fired 32 winners, including 11 aces, to seal the victory in two hours and 18 minutes. 0740 HALEP OUTLASTS GUTSY KERBER, REACHES FINAL \nWorld number one Halep saved two match points in the deciding set before outlasting Kerber 6-3 4-6 9-7 to reach the final. Halep, who prevailed in two hours and 20 minutes, takes on Wozniacki in the title clash. \n“I‘m shaking now, I‘m really emotional. I‘m really glad I could resist and win this match,” Halep, who like Wozniacki is targeting her first grand slam title, said. 0454 WOZNIACKI HOLDS NERVE TO MAKE FINAL \nWozniacki staved off a late fightback from Mertens to advance to the final with a 6-3 7-6(2) victory. \n0441 MARACH-PAVIC PAIR INTO MEN‘S DOUBLES FINAL \nAustrian Oliver Marach and Croatia’s Mate Pavic came from behind to beat Japan’s Ben McLachlan and German Jan-Lennard Struff 4-6 7-5 7-6(4) to make the men’s doubles final. 0110 DOUBLES UNDER WAY AT MELBOURNE PARK \nThe temperature was 24 degrees Celsius and forecast to reach a high of 26.
