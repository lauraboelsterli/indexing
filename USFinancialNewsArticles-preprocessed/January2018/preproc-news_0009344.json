However, they think if special counsel Robert Mueller looks into Trump's finances, it could be perilous for the president, Wolff claimed.\n\"People don't think in the White House — don't think that he colluded with Russia. … They do think that if the investigation goes near his finances, he's sunk. Everybody, again, to a man,\" Wolff said in a \"Squawk Box\" interview.\nThe president has repeatedly denied any cooperation with Moscow as an investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election continues. Last year, Trump told The New York Times that a Mueller probe of his finances as part of the investigation would cross a red line.\nshow chapters 'Fire and Fury' author Michael Wolff: I don't know if Trump colluded with Russia 1 Hour Ago | 02:19 Trump's legal team and a White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests to comment.\nWolff's book, released on Friday, sent shockwaves through the Trump administration with fiery Quote: s about the Trump family and numerous claims about the president's intelligence and competence .
