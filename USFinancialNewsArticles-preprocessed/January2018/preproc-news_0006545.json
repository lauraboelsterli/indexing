(NASDAQ:OMED), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel anti-cancer therapeutics, today announced that Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Hastings resigned from OncoMed to pursue new career opportunities, effective January 1st, 2018.\nThe board of directors has retained an executive search firm and has initiated a search for a fulltime successor. In the interim, The Office of the President, comprised of Executive Vice President, Research and Development, John Lewicki, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sunil Patel, will continue to perform the duties of President and CEO. In addition, the Board of Directors has appointed Perry Karsen as Chairman of the Board while Jack Lasersohn, formerly Lead Director, remains a Board Member.\n“After twelve fulfilling and successful years of service, it is time for me to step-down from my responsibilities at OncoMed and move to the next stage of professional opportunities available to me,” said Mr. Hastings. “I look forward to watching the company and its high caliber team continue to grow and evolve into a late-stage development organization serving the needs of patients with cancer.”\n“We are thankful for Paul’s many years of leadership,” said Perry Karsen, Chairman of the Board, “We are grateful for the fundamental role Paul has played in driving forward OncoMed’s differentiated platform technology, and positioning the company to be a leader in discovering and developing the next-generation immuno-oncology and anti-cancer therapeutics. We thank Paul for his leadership and accomplishments during his tenure at OncoMed and wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nMr. Hastings joined OncoMed as Chief Executive Officer in 2006. During his tenure, OncoMed has successfully advanced a broad pipeline of candidates against a diverse array of anti-cancer stem cell and immuno-oncology targets, including wholly-owned GITRL-Fc, and multiple programs partnered with Celgene Corporation. Looking ahead, with numerous clinical trials underway and updates from the navicixizumab and anti-TIGIT programs anticipated in 2018, OncoMed is well positioned to deliver value in 2018 and beyond.\nAbout OncoMed Pharmaceuticals\nOncoMed Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel anti-cancer therapeutics.
