    "text": "College Game Plan The top 10 colleges for financial aid Here are the schools that are doling out the most aid to offset the cost of college, according to The Princeton Review's 2018 ranking. The top 10 are all private, many of which have sky-high tuition prices, but their very generous aid packages tell a different story. 3:01 PM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 | 00:57 \nWhen it comes to college, most families assume public schools are far more affordable. That's only partly true. \nAt public, four-year institutions, costs for the 2017-18 school year hit $20,770, according to the College Board . Tuition plus room and board at four-year private universities was much higher: $47,000, on average, in the current academic year. \nHowever, about two-thirds of all full-time students receive aid, which can bring the sticker price significantly down. Your net price is a college's tuition and fees minus grants, scholarships and education tax benefits, according to the College Board. \nTo that end, The Princeton Review ranked colleges by how much financial aid is awarded and how satisfied students are with their packages. The report is based on data collected from fall 2016 through summer 2017. \nThe schools that fared the best were all private schools, many of which have sky-high prices, but very generous aid packages. show chapters 10:36 AM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 01:10 \n\"We look at sticker price but also academics and financial aid. And that's really where the value comes in,\" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief and author of \"Colleges That Pay You Back.\" \nWhen it comes to offering aid , private schools typically have more money to spend, he added. \"These schools have been very clear about their commitment to making college costs affordable and giving out massive amounts of aid to students and families that need it.\" \nHere are the schools that made The Princeton Review's top 10: 10. Colgate University Colgate University, with Taylor Lake in the foreground, is shown in Hamilton, N.Y. \nLocation: Hamilton, N.Y. Tuition, fees, room and board: $67,500 Average need-based scholarship: $45,724 Out-of-pocket cost: $21,776 \nStudents here have a healthy dose of school spirit, with good reason: Colgate is one of the best liberal arts schools in the country even though it has very high tuition. Still, students receive over $45,000 in grant aid, on average, making it a much more affordable place to matriculate. 9. Yale University Craig Warga | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Sterling Memorial Library on the Yale University campus in New Haven, Connecticut. \nLocation: New Haven, Conn. Tuition, fees, room and board: $66,900 Average need-based scholarship: $47,960 Out-of-pocket cost: $18,940 \nThis Ivy puts its money where its mouth is: Committed to meeting 100 percent of each applicant's demonstrated need, Yale spends more than $100 million on student financial aid each year. As a result, more than 10 percent of the student body will have $0 expected parent contribution in 2018. 8. Vassar College \nTuition, fees, room and board: $68,060 Average need-based scholarship: $45,109 Out-of-pocket cost: $22,951 \nVassar is one of most expensive colleges in the country but also one of the most generous. The average scholarship is just over $45,000, making the total cost less than $23,000 for a top liberal arts school with a stunning campus. 7. Princeton University Students walking to classes at Princeton University, Princeton, NJ \nLocation: Princeton, N.J. Tuition, fees, room and board: $60,090 Average need-based scholarship: $47,497 Out-of-pocket cost: $12,593 \nThis elite Ivy League school makes the top of many college lists, but it's also highly regarded for its war on student debt. Princeton has eliminated all loans for students who qualify for aid. Instead, awards come in the form of grants that do not need to be repaid. 6. Pomona College Ted Soqui | Corbis | Getty Images Pomona College \nTuition, fees, room and board: $67,225 Average need-based scholarship: $41,443 Out-of-pocket cost: $25,782 \nAs a member of the Claremont Colleges, a group of highly regarded schools just outside of Los Angeles, admission to Pomona is tough but also need-blind. The goal is to achieve \"significant socio-economic diversity,\" according to Adam Sapp, Pomona's senior associate dean and director of admissions. 5. Washington University in St. Louis Stephen Ehlers | Getty Images \nTuition, fees, room and board: $67,539 Average need-based scholarship: $40,509 Out-of-pocket cost: $27,030 \nAt first glance, Wash U. is another one of the pricier schools on Princeton Review's list but it is similarly committed to helping defray the cost without relying on loan debt. For starters, all aid to families earning $75,000 or less a year is grant-based, which means it does not have to be paid pack. 4. Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art Source: Cooper Union Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art \nLocation: New York, N.Y. Tuition, fees, room and board: $61,370 Average need-based scholarship: $15,394* Out-of-pocket cost: $45,976 \nIn the heart of New York City is a small school making a big promise to provide an affordable education. Aside from the aid available to help cover housing, food, books and supplies at Cooper Union, all students receive a half-tuition scholarship worth over $20,000 a year*. 3. Vanderbilt University Vanderbilt | Collegiate Images | Getty Images General view of the Benson Science Hall on the campus of the Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville, Tennessee. \nLocation: Nashville, Tenn. Tuition, fees, room and board: $60,572 Average need-based scholarship: $41,331 Out-of-pocket cost: $19,241 \nIn addition to gift assistance, Nashville's Vanderbilt is known for its three signature scholarships which all cover full tuition and offer summer stipends to study abroad, complete service projects or conduct research. And they are renewable for all four years of college. 2. Williams College Chapin Hall at Williams College \nLocation: Williamstown, Mass. Tuition, fees, room and board: $67,700 Average need-based scholarship: $48,885 Out-of-pocket cost: $18,815 \nOne of the nation's very best schools also gets extremely high marks for its ability to finance its students' educations. The school meets 100 percent of demonstrated need for all undergrads for all four years. 1. Bowdoin University Gregory Rec | Portland Press Herald | Getty Images Joshua Chamberlain statue at the entrance to the Bowdoin campus in Brunswick, Maine. \nLocation: Brunswick, Maine Tuition, fees, room and board: $65,980 Average need-based scholarship: $42,206 Out-of-pocket cost: $23,774 \nAt No. 1, this small college on the coast of Maine is a triple threat: highly competitive, picturesque and price sensitive. The school's well-endowed grant budget, coupled with work study and other scholarship and grant opportunities means that more than half, or 52 percent, of enrolled students receive need-based aid. \nMore from College Game Plan:",
