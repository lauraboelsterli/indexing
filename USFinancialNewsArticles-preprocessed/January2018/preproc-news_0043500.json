    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 2:15 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago U.S. State Department creates Cuba Internet Task Force Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nHAVANA (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that it had created a Cuba Internet Task Force to promote “the free and unregulated flow of information” on the Communist-run island, an action denounced by Cuban state media as subversive. \n“The task force will examine the technological challenges and opportunities for expanding internet access and independent media in Cuba,” the agency said in a statement. It said the task force of U.S. government and non-governmental representatives would meet for the first time on Feb. 7. \nCuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said it was “destined to subvert Cuba’s internal order.” \n“In the past, Washington has used phrases like ‘working for freedom of expression’ and ‘expanding access to internet in Cuba’ to cover up destabilising plans,” Granma wrote, adding that some 40 percent of Cubans connected to the internet in 2017, 37 percent more than in 2010. \nCuba has created public Wi-Fi hotspots and hooked up more homes to the internet, but most Cubans cannot get access on cellphones and only a tiny share of homes has broadband access. \nThe $1.50 hourly tariff for using a Wi-Fi hotspot in Cuba represents 5 percent of the average monthly state salary of $30. \nHavana has said it has been slow to develop network infrastructure because of high costs, attributed partly to the U.S. trade embargo. Critics have said the government fears losing control. \nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama made improved internet access a central part of his efforts to normalise relations with Cuba. Telecommunications equipment and services were among the first exemptions to the embargo after Washington and Havana said in 2014 that they would restore diplomatic relations. \nGoogle signed an agreement with Cuba in 2016 granting internet users there quicker access to its branded content. \nCuba has balked at allowing U.S. companies to participate in wiring the country.
