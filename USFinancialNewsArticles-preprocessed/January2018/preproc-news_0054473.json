    "text": "Loan Portfolio up 15.6% Year-over-Year to $7.9 billion\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ: BOFI) (“BofI”), parent company of BofI Federal Bank (the “Bank”), today announced financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income was $31.7 million, a decrease of 2.0% from $32.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net income decreased as a result of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which caused BofI to incur an $8.0 million one-time charge from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Earnings attributable to BofI’s common stockholders were $31.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 2.0% from $32.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the second quarter ended December 31, 2016. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings attributable to common stockholders excluding the deferred tax revaluation were $39.7 million and $39.6 million, respectively, or $0.61 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 22.9% from the second quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary:\nGAAP Non-GAAP 1 Adjusted for Deferred Tax Revaluation\nThree Months Ended December 31 Three Months Ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Q2 Fiscal 2018 Q2 Fiscal 2017 % Change Q2 Fiscal 2018 Q2 Fiscal 2017 % Change Net interest income $ 84,213 $ 76,361 10.3 % $ 84,213 $ 76,361 10.3 % Non-interest income $ 17,099 $ 16,700 2.4 % $ 17,099 $ 16,700 2.4 % Net income $ 31,658 $ 32,300 (2.0 )% $ 39,690 $ 32,300 22.9 % Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 31,580 $ 32,222 (2.0 )% $ 39,612 $ 32,222 22.9 % Diluted EPS $ 0.49 $ 0.50 (2.0 )% $ 0.61 $ 0.50 22.0 % 1 See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\n“Our net loan balances grew by over $360 million, or 19% annualized, in the second quarter as a result of strong originations in single family lending, commercial specialty real estate lending, commercial and multifamily lender finance, and equipment leasing,” stated Greg Garrabrants, President and Chief Executive Officer of BofI. “Our already strong capital and returns will be further boosted by the Tax Act, even after we reinvest a portion of the savings in further growth enabling investments.”\n“This quarter we started redeploying some of our excess capital, buying back approximately $28 million of our common stock at a weighted average price of $28.20 per share,” said Andy Micheletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BofI. “Excluding the one-time deferred tax valuation charge, net income attributable to common stockholders would have been approximately $39.6 million, or $0.61 per share, and considering a full quarter’s weighting impact of our share repurchases, our ROA and ROE would have been 1.87% and 18.54%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. With our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.26% at quarter end, our seasonally highest earnings quarter in March, and the reduced corporate tax rates from the Tax Act, we have ample flexibility to continue delivering shareholder returns through a variety of vehicles.”\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, net income was a record $64.0 million, an increase of 4.6% over net income of $61.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Earnings attributable to BofI’s common stockholders were $63.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 4.3% from $61.0 million or $0.94 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Earnings for the quarter and for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were primarily the result of growth in the Bank’s loan and lease portfolio.\nOther Highlights:\nTotal assets reached $8,916.0 million, up $748.1 million or 9.2% compared to December 31, 2016 Loan and lease portfolio grew by $1,063.0 million or 15.6% compared to December 31, 2016 Loan and lease originations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $2,054.5 million, up 22.2% compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016 Deposits grew by $782.6 million, or 11.8% compared to December 31, 2016 Net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.94% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and was stable at 4.00% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 Asset quality remains strong with total non-performing assets of 0.44% of total assets at December 31, 2017 Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 14.37% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Tangible book value increased to $13.70 per share, up $1.98 per share compared to December 31, 2016\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Income Statement Summary\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, BofI earned $31.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $32.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest income increased $7.9 million or 10.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016, due to the $788.2 million growth in average-earning assets.\nThe loan and lease loss provision was $4.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the provision is primarily the result of a lower level of net charge-offs and a change in the mix of loans and leases, partially offset by loan growth during the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income was $17.1 million compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase year over year was the result of increased banking service fees and other income of $1.7 million, primarily due to increased fees related to seasonal H&R Block-branded products and service fee income, a $0.9 million reduction in unrealized loss on securities, a $0.5 million increase in prepayment penalty fee income, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in realized gain on securities and a $0.8 million decrease in mortgage banking income.\nNon-interest expense or operating costs increased $7.5 million to $40.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $33.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly a result of an increase in salaries and related expense of $4.4 million as a result of staffing increases to support growth in lending and information technology infrastructure development. Other operating expense increases include an increase in advertising and promotional of $1.8 million, an increase of $1.0 million in data processing and internet and an increase of $0.5 million in depreciation and amortization. The increases in the other operating costs are primarily to support loan and deposit growth, as well as data processing, software and marketing initiatives.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nBofI’s total assets increased $414.3 million, or 4.9%, to $8,916.0 million, as of December 31, 2017, up from $8,501.7 million at June 30, 2017. The loan portfolio increased $499.9 million on a net basis, primarily from portfolio loan originations of $2,328.7 million less principal repayments and other adjustments of $1,828.8 million. Investment securities decreased $81.1 million primarily due to sales and principal repayments. Total liabilities increased by $374.9 million, or 4.9%, to $8,042.3 million at December 31, 2017, up from $7,667.4 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in total liabilities resulted primarily from growth in deposits of $493.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in FHLB borrowings of $97.0 million. Stockholders’ equity increased by $39.4 million, or 4.7%, to $873.7 million at December 31, 2017 from $834.2 million at June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of $64.0 million in net income, $3.9 million of vesting and issuance of RSUs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by $28.3 million in stock repurchases and $0.2 million of dividends declared on preferred stock.\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 core capital to adjusted average assets ratio was 10.26% at December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nA conference call and webcast will be held on Tuesday, January 30, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern / 2:00 PM Pacific.

For more information on BofI Federal Bank, please visit bofifederalbank.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes non-GAAP financial measures that adjust our net income, net income attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations for the one-time charge from the revaluation of BofI’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which we believe provides useful information about the Company’s operating performance. We previously reported a non-GAAP financial measure titled \"adjusted earnings\" that excluded realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with our securities portfolio, net of tax. The adjusted earnings financial measure was removed this period because it no longer provided useful information for management and did not enhance investors' understanding of the business and its performance due to the insignificant nature of the adjustments in recent history. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious as to their use of such measures. Although we believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors’ understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. Below is a reconciliation of GAAP net income, net income attributable to common stockholders and diluted EPS to the non-GAAP calculations adjusted for the deferred tax revaluation:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) GAAP Deferred Tax\nAdjustment\nNon-GAAP Adjusted\nfor Deferred Tax\nRevaluation\nNet income $ 31,658 $ 8,032 $ 39,690 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 31,580 $ 8,032 $ 39,612 Diluted EPS $ 0.49 $ 0.12 $ 0.61 For the non-GAAP financial measures of ROA and ROE used in Mr. Micheletti’s Quote: above, the statutory federal tax rate used was 21.0%, which is the Company’s tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Based on the changes in the Tax Act, our federal corporate statutory tax rate will be 28.1% for the quarters ending March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, and 21.0% for the year ending June 30, 2019.\nForward-Looking Safe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains that involve risks and uncertainties, including without limitation statements relating to BofI’s financial prospects and other projections of its performance and asset quality, BofI’s ability to grow and increase its business, diversify its lending, the outcome and effects of pending class action litigation filed against the Company, and the anticipated timing and financial performance of offerings, initiatives or acquisitions.
