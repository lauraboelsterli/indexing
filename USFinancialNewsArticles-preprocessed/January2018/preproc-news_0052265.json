Butler guard Paul Jorgensen made 3-of-6 3-pointers for 13 points.\nSophomore guard Kamar Baldwin contributed 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists for the Bulldogs (15-7, 5-4). Butler senior forward Tyler Wideman had a career-high 11 rebounds as Butler held a 42-32 edge on the glass.\nThe Red Storm shot just 29.1 percent while the Bulldogs hit 40 percent. Butler made 14 of 19 free throws while St. Johns was 8-of-14.\nTariq Owens was the only player to score in double figures for the Red Storm (10-12, 0-10) with 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting. The 45 points were a season low. St. John’s previous low was 46 in a 46-43 victory over University of Central Florida.\nRed Storm guard Shamorie Ponds, who was averaging a team-high 20 points per game, scored just two points, missing all 12 shots from the field.\nWith Butler leading 45-18, St. John’s went on a 9-1 run to trim the deficit to 46-27. The Bulldogs followed with a 14-3 stretch to expand the lead to a game-high of 30 at 60-30 with 7:47 to go.\nButler sank 8 of 17 3-point shots to take a 37-15 halftime lead. St. John’s made just 5 of 27 shots (18.2 percent) in the opening half. Butler hit 13 of 30 shots (43.3 percent) in the opening half.\nThe Bulldogs, who scored the first five points, hit five of their first six 3-point shots to roll to a 19-2 lead with 12:33 remaining in the first half\nThe Red Storm were forced to play with just seven scholarship players since junior reserve forward Kassoum Yakwe was sidelined with an ankle injury. St.John’s guard Marcus LoVett started the first seven games before suffering a season-ending knee injury.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
