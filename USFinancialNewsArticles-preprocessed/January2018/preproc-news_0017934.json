    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - The stricken Iranian oil tanker Sanchi keeps exploding, hampering efforts to extinguish the fire and rescue survivors, state media Xinhua said on Friday, citing the Ministry of Transport, as the blaze raged and worries grew the ship may break up and sink.\nThe week-long rescue effort following the tankerâ€™s collision with a freight ship on Saturday night has been roiled by poor weather, including 3-metre (10 feet) high waves and strong winds, and toxic fumes from the burning oil.\nDozens of the rescue boats were forced to retreat from dousing the tanker with foam on Wednesday due to an explosion.\nReporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
