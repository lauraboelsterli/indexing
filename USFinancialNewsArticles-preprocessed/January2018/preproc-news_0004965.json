    "text": "FAIRFIELD, N.J., Jan. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading Pharma, LLC, a privately-owned generic pharmaceutical company that manufactures, markets, and distributes products to drug chains, wholesalers, and other channels, announced today that on December 28, 2017 it completed a financing transaction for $40 million of growth capital. The transaction was led by Signet Healthcare Partners in addition to Crestline Investors with other investors comprised of Cane Investment Partners and existing Leading Pharma members. Concurrently, Nikhil Puri, Managing Director at Signet Healthcare Partners, and Chris Semple, Managing Director at Crestline Investors, will join the board of directors of Leading Pharma's parent company. The growth capital will be used to support Leading Pharma's research and development (R&D) investments in expanding the company's diverse pipeline of generic products and to repay existing indebtedness.\nRonald Gold, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Leading Pharma, stated, \"This investment allows us to accelerate the development of our robust pipeline to build a more comprehensive product portfolio. We are excited to partner with prudent investors who have experience in the pharmaceutical industry and believe in our business model as well as our ability to develop and market new generic drugs.\"\nSince the acquisition of Excellium Pharmaceutical, Inc. in 2014, Leading Pharma has evolved from exclusively outsourcing product development work into a vertically-integrated generic pharmaceutical company with internal R&D capabilities. The company operates a 53,000 square foot manufacturing plant dedicated to oral solid pharmaceuticals.\n\"I believe Leading Pharma has the necessary building blocks in place, and is well positioned to capitalize on the vast opportunity that the generic pharma sector presents,\" said Nikhil Puri, Managing Director at Signet Healthcare Partners. \"Signet is very pleased to be partnering with the company at this important juncture, and we look forward to close collaboration with the leadership team at Leading Pharma.\"\n\"Under the leadership of industry veterans Ron Gold and Rasik Gondalia, Leading Pharma is well-positioned to capitalize on its development strategy as the company has built an attractive pipeline of diverse, difficult-to-formulate products,\" said Chris Semple, Managing Director at Crestline Investors. \"We look forward to continued growth at the company under Ron and Rasik, who have both successfully founded and exited generic pharmaceutical companies in prior ventures.\"\nKramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP acted as legal counsel for Leading Pharma and Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP acted as legal counsel for Crestline and Signet.
