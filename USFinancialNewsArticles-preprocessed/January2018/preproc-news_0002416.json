    "text": "-- Fiscal 2017 Marked by Actions to Advance Drug Pipeline; First New Drug Application (NDA) on Track for Submission in First Half of 2018; Three Additional NDAs Expected to be Filed: Two in 2019 and One in 2020 --\nCompany to Host Investor Conference Call on Friday, January 5, 2018, 8 AM Eastern Time\nMIAMI, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veru Inc. (NASDAQ:VERU) today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year ended September 30, 2017.\n“Our fiscal 2017 financial results reflect the risk and volatility associated with being a single product company and, more importantly, validate the strategic rationale for the acquisition completed late last year, which brought a pipeline of multiple high-value, low-risk product candidates,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Veru. “While revenues from FC2 were disappointing due in part to the sales cycle and dependence on a few global public-sector customers, the past year was marked by a number of critical accomplishments and actions, including the excellent progress we made advancing the development of our pipeline toward commercialization. These efforts included meeting with the FDA to streamline and clarify the regulatory pathway for approval of almost all of our drug candidates.\n“Following is a summary of our progress for products added as a result of the acquisition: Tamsulosin DRS, a novel formulation of a widely prescribed drug for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), completed the first and second stages of a bioequivalence clinical trial; VERU-944, for hot flashes in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, completed the necessary steps required to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in early 2018; and VERU-111, a New Chemical Entity (NCE) for advanced prostate and other cancers, completed a significant portion of the required preclinical work as well as established the process to manufacture the drug in preparation of commencing human clinical trials in 2018.\n“More recently, we monetized a portion of outstanding accounts receivable and completed the acquisition of two exciting new drug candidates, which not only address large patient populations but also further expand our portfolio of products for the urology and oncology markets. Importantly, the FDA has agreed that for each product a single bioequivalence study would be acceptable for a 505(b)(2) NDA filing. We also are encouraged by positive preclinical data that showed additional efficacy of our VERU-111 product for a number of different cancer types. The new data will be presented at national scientific meetings in 2018.\n“Looking ahead, we expect to file with the FDA the Company’s first New Drug Application (NDA) for Tamsulosin DRS in the first half of 2018. Moreover, we plan to submit three additional NDAs: two in 2019 and another NDA in 2020. Regarding sales of our commercial products, we are seeing traction following the implementation of several initiatives to grow our US revenue for FC2 and we are optimistic about potential near-term orders for FC2 from two large international public-sector customers.”\nFiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nFor the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, net revenues increased to $3.7 million from $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

(Veru) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on urology and oncology. Veru utilizes FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway to develop and commercialize drug candidates. FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway is designed to allow for potentially expedited, lower cost and lower risk regulatory approval based on a previously established safety and efficacy profile of the product. Veru is developing products under the 505(b)(1) pathway as well, which is the traditional new drug application (NDA) pathway. The company is currently developing drug product candidates: Tamsulosin DRS, slow release granules, and Tamsulosin XR capsules for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (NDA planned 2018), Solifenacin DRG, slow release granules, for overactive bladder (urge incontinence, urgency and frequency of urination) (NDA planned 2019), Tadalafil/finasteride combination capsule for restricted urination because of an enlarged prostate (NDA planned 2019), VERU-944 (cis-clomiphene citrate) for hot flashes in men associated with prostate ca",
