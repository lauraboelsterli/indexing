(NYSE: RYB): (1) pursuant to and/or traceable to the Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with its initial public offering on or about September 27, 2017 (the \"Offering\"); and/or (2) on the open market from September 27, 2017 through November 22, 2017, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").

UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.\nAccording to the lawsuit, defendants during the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) RYB Education failed to establish safety policies to prevent sexual abuse from occurring at its schools; (2) RYB Education's failure to remedy problems within its system exposed children to harm and unreasonable risk of harm while in its care; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, RYB securities traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 26, 2018. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
