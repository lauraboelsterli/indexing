    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it had completed its probe into whether imports of certain steel products threatened U.S. national security and sent its conclusions to President Donald Trump.\nIn a statement that offered no indication of the investigation’s findings, the Commerce Department said Trump now has 90 days to decide “on any potential action.”\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a brief statement that Trump would announce his decision “at the appropriate time.” (Reporting by Eric Walsh and Steve Holland; Writing by Tim Ahmann)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
