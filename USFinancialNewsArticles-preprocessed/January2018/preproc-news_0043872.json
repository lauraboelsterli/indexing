    "text": "By Nicolas Rapp and Brian O'Keefe 9:00 AM EST \nExtreme weather is becoming more common, and the economic impact is soaring. Last year there were 16 weather events in the U.S. that caused at least $1 billion each in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The cumulative cost was $306 billion—easily surpassing the previous one-year record of $215 billion set in 2005. In September a report from the nonprofit Universal Ecological Fund, “ The Economic Case for Climate Action in the United States ,” estimated that total climate-related economic losses and health costs in the U.S. averaged $240 billion a year over the past decade. The authors project the annual cost will rise to $360 billion over the next 10 years. \nA version of this article appears in the Feb. 1, 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline “Storm Warnings.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
