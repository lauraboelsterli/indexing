This acquisition enables REV to meaningfully enter the rapidly growing over $10 billion towables segment of the RV market by adding Lance Campers’ premium portfolio of truck campers, towable campers and toy haulers to REV’s existing suite of motorized offerings.\nFounded in 1965, Lance Camper designs, engineers and manufactures its lineup of innovative, high quality, and customer-centric products from its state-of-the-art campus in Lancaster, CA. Throughout its over 50-year history, the Company has built a tremendous reputation as a leader in the towable RV industry. Lance Camper has the number one selling truck camper in the U.S. and has won the National RV Dealer Association’s prestigious Quality Circle Award 16 years running. The Company employs over 550 associates and generates approximately $100 million in annual revenue.\nAfter the acquisition, Lance Camper will continue to be led by its innovative founders, Jack Cole and Jeff Souleles. “We’re thrilled to be joining REV’s iconic family of brands,” said Jack Cole, President of Lance Camper, “We look forward to leveraging REV’s scale and footprint in the RV industry to rapidly expand our distribution and further accelerate our growth.

Lance Camper adds one of the highest quality towable lines in the U.S. and provides a significant new avenue of growth in our RV segment.”\nThe acquisition of Lance Camper was closed on January 12, 2018.\nAbout Rev Group\nREV (NYSE: REVG) is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services.
