    "text": "EditorsNote: revises ninth graf\nColin Miller scored a goal and supplied two assists as the Vegas Golden Knights completed a solid road trip with their best performance, striking early in a 5-1 victory against the Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday night at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C.\nPierre-Edouard Bellemare, Jonathan Marchessault, James Neal and Brendan Leipsic also scored for Vegas, which was denied reaching the six-goal mark -- something it has done only twice previously this season.\nThe Golden Knights wrapped up a four-game road trip with five of a possible eight team points.\nVegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 27 shots, including all 18 across the final two periods.\nThe Hurricanes replaced goalie Scott Darling after the third goal came just 12:59 into the game.\nDefenseman Jaccob Slavin cut the Hurricanes’ deficit to 3-1 with 45 seconds left in the first period with a power-play goal.\nCarolina was coming off a five-day layoff when it won Saturday night at Detroit, but it was unable to duplicate that kind of performance.\nThe Golden Knights had scored only 45 first-period goals this season, the fewest in any period, so the three-goal burst to begin the game was an unexpected boost.\nBellemare opened the scoring at 2:55. Miller’s power-play goal at 12:20 was followed 39 seconds later by Marchessault finding the net.\nDarling stopped only five of eight shots before Cam Ward, who played a night earlier, was summoned to the ice. Darling’s record dropped to 9-13-6, adding to a disappointing recent stretch for the player who was supposed to claim the No. 1 goaltending role.\nWard allowed two goals on 25 shots in his relief effort.\nVegas has posted more shots than its opponent in seven consecutive games.\nSince mid-December, the Hurricanes also have taken 8-1 and 7-1 losses, but those results were on the road.\nThe Hurricanes have lost four consecutive home games, going 0-3-1 on home ice this month.\nThis was the only home game for the Hurricanes between their five-day break and the upcoming All-Star weekend.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
