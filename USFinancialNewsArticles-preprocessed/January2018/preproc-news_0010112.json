    "text": "Yankuba Sima’s putback layup with six seconds to play lifted Oklahoma State to a 65-64 come-from-behind victory over Texas on Saturday in a wild Big 12 Conference game at Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\nTavarius Shine’s jumper with 3:12 to play capped a 13-0 run for the Cowboys and pushed Oklahoma State to a 63-62 lead.\nDylan Osetkowski answered for the Longhorns with a runner with 1:50 left to allow Texas to leapfrog back in front at 64-63 and Mohamed Bamba’s block of a layup by Sima with 48 seconds left allowed Texas to stay in the lead.\nThe Longhorns’ Matt Coleman was then whistled for a charge with 23 seconds remaining, giving the Cowboys a chance to shoot for the win.\nShine drove into the lane from the left baseline after Bamba tripped in the paint, but was too strong on his jumper. The rebound was corralled by Sima, who tipped in the winning basket.\nJeffrey Carroll scored 17 points to lead the Cowboys (12-5, 2-3 Big 12). Brandon Averette added 11 points and Lindy Waters II scored 10 for Oklahoma State.\nEric Davis Jr. led the Longhorns with 18 points, while Osetkowski added 12 points and Bamba added 11 points (all in the second half) and grabbed 10 rebounds for Texas (11-6, 2-3).\nBoth teams slogged through a defensive first half with the Longhorns owning a 32-25 lead at intermission.\nTexas outshot the Cowboys 41.4 percent to 35.7 in the first half and made five of its 11 3-pointers while Oklahoma State hit just 2 of 8 from beyond the arc. Davis Jr. led all scorers with 15 points in the first half while Waters III paced Oklahoma State with six points.\nDavis didn’t score in the second half until the 6:34 mark, but that basket helped the Longhorns quell an Oklahoma State mini-rally that had pulled the Cowboys to within 58-50.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
