    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The Northern District of California, case no. 5:18-cv-00130, on behalf of shareholders of Yume, Inc, (\"Yume\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: YUME) who held YuMe securities and have been harmed by YuMe and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations Sections 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the sale of Company to RhythmOne, PLC.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Purchaser will acquire all issued and outstanding shares of YuMe common stock, with each share of YuMe common stock exchange for the right to receive: (i) $1.70 in cash; and (ii) 7.325 ordinary shares Â£0.10 each in the capital of RhythmOne, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of RhythmOne Stock, in each case, without interest (the \"Merger Consideration\"). As a result, each share of YuMe common stock has an implied value of $5.20 per share. The complaint alleges that on December 26, 2017, in order to convince YuMe stockholders to tender their shares, the Board authorized the filing of a materially incomplete and misleading Form F-4 Registration Statement with the SEC. In particular, the F-4 contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) financial projections for RhythmOne; and (ii) the valuation analyses performed by the Company's financial advisor, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (\"Deutsche Bank\"), in support of their fairness opinion; and (iii) the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today.
