    "text": "MEQUON, Wis., Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Activist investor Global Value Investment Corp. (GVIC) has sent an open letter to the StealthGas Inc. (NasdaqGS: GASS) Board of Directors pressing for reforms due to persistent underperformance of the company's common stock. This letter and an accompanying investor presentation can be viewed by visiting GVIC's website: https://www.gvi-corp.com/category/holdings-news/ .\nGVIC urged the board to immediately initiate a cash dividend, hire a permanent CFO, retain an independent investor relations firm and establish criteria to hold the current entrenched management team accountable for the company's poor performance.\n\"GASS trades for approximately 25% of its book value of about $14.00 per share,\" according to GVIC analyst Mr. Samuel Schaefer. \"This management team has failed to create value for shareholders, with the company's net worth declining over the past five years.\" GVIC has invested in the company's common stock for its clients since 2007 and currently holds less than 5% of the common stock outstanding.\nGVIC President and CEO, Mr. Jeffrey Geygan, stated that his firm will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the interests of shareholders are served. \"We have patiently communicated with the company for several years with little noticeable change.\" Geygan believes that most investors share his frustration and support GVIC's recommended changes. He indicated there are numerous options available to GVIC, up to and including a proxy contest to replace current directors.\nAbout Global Value Investment Corp.\nGlobal Value Investment Corp. is a value-oriented investment research and advisory firm focused on investing in the equity and debt of publicly traded companies around the world.
