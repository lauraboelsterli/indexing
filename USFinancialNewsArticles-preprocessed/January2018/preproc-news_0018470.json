The round was led by Lumia Capital, a firm focused on helping technology market leaders expand globally.\nDeutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP), Telstra and Sozo Ventures also participated in the round along with returning investors GV, General Catalyst, IVP and Paladin Capital Group. The investment will allow Anomali to accelerate its growth in the US and globally and continue development of innovative cybersecurity solutions. The company also announced the appointment of Drew Hamer as Chief Financial Officer and Christopher Smith as Chief Revenue Officer.\n“We were immediately impressed by Hugh, his leadership and vision, and the remarkable company accomplishments in this rapidly emerging area of cybersecurity,” said Martin Gedalin, Partner at Lumia Capital. “We believe there is a massive global need for enterprise threat intelligence solutions and we look forward to helping Anomali achieve its full potential.”\n“Anomali delivers critical threat detection and response capabilities, working with premier organizations across all major industry verticals,” said Eric Ver Ploeg, Managing Director at DTCP in Silicon Valley. “Their strong customer base and threat exchange partnerships are clear indications of the need and value of the company’s cybersecurity, threat detection and sharing solutions.”\n“We seek disruptive companies with great leaders and great solutions to address pressing cybersecurity challenges,” said Mark Sherman, Managing Director at Telstra Ventures. “Anomali adds critical attack detection and threat sharing capabilities to our portfolio, helping Telstra deliver a more complete suite of security offerings to our customers.”\nThis latest round of funding builds upon the significant momentum of 2017.

The company also:\nlaunched a 48-bank threat sharing community in the United Arab Emirates , testified before the Homeland Security Committee regarding the importance of threat sharing, partnered with the Bank of England to collect, integrate, hunt and investigate cyber security intelligence data, and published a series of Cybersecurity Country Profiles, including Russia, China and Iran .\n“2017 was another remarkable year for Anomali, in which we saw record customer growth and product innovation. We are thrilled to add Lumia Capital, DTCP, Telstra and Sozo Ventures to the Anomali family and are already preparing major initiatives with our newest partners,” said Hugh Njemanze, chief executive officer, Anomali. “Our latest investors ideally position us for growth in Europe, Japan and Australia.”\nAnomali continues to build on this growth in 2018, welcoming new executive hires with deep experience and industry knowledge. Hamer, who will function as the new CFO, brings over 25 years of executive financial experience, most recently from ON24 and Keynote Systems, where he developed an expertise with high growth SaaS businesses. Smith, the new CRO, joins Anomali following a long career in cybersecurity sales leadership roles at ArcSight, Invincea and Instart Logic.\nThis announcement marks a total of $96 million total investment raised by Anomali over four rounds of funding.\nThe company will host its third annual threat intelligence conference, Detect ’18 , in Washington, DC September 19-21, 2018.\nAbout Anomali\nAnomali delivers critical threat intelligence capabilities, allowing organizations to detect, investigate and respond to serious external threats.
