    "text": "VANCOUVER, Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Amerigo Resources Ltd. (\"Amerigo\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: ARG) announced today production results for the year 2017 and Q4-2017 from Minera Valle Central (\"MVC\"), the Company's 100% owned operation located near Rancagua, Chile.\nOperational Highlights:\nIn 2017, MVC produced record quantities of copper and molybdenum. MVC produced 62.5 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.64 per pound, pursuant to a tolling agreement with Codelco's Division El Teniente. Annual molybdenum production was 1.6 million pounds.\nThe Company's robust performance met its 2017 guidance of production of 60 to 65 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.60 to $1.75 per pound, and exceeded guidance of production of 1.5 million pounds of molybdenum.\nIn Q4-2017, MVC produced 15.6 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.66 per pound, and 0.4 million pounds of molybdenum.\nConstruction of MVC's Cauquenes Phase Two expansion is on track for completion in Q3-2018, with full production expected in Q4-2018. The project will increase MVC's production to 85 to 90 million pounds per year, at an estimated cash cost of $1.45 to $1.60 per pound.\nIn 2018, Amerigo expects to produce 65 to 70 million pounds of copper and 1.8 million pounds of molybdenum, at a cash cost of $1.45 to $1.60 per pound.\nRob Henderson, Amerigo's President and CEO, stated \"MVC performed strongly again in 2017. The completion of the Cauquenes expansion in the second half of the year will increase production and lower unit costs, enabling Amerigo to further benefit from improved copper prices expected in 2018.\"\nSummary of 2017 Production Results:\n2017\nQ4-2017\nQ3-2017\nQ2-2017\nQ1-2017\nFresh tailings\nTonnes processed\n43,718,332\n11,290,794\n11,152,930\n10,708,437\n10,566,171\nCopper grade\n0.118%\n0.123%\n0.117%\n0.110%\n0.120%\nCopper recovery\n19.2%\n19.7%\n19.8%\n20.8%\n16.7%\nCopper produced (millions of pounds)\n21.784\n6.030\n5.700\n5.404\n4.651\nHistoric tailings\nTonnes processed\n22,658,605\n5,650,522\n5,716,546\n5,522,301\n5,769,236\nCopper grade\n0.249%\n0.247%\n0.240%\n0.253%\n0.255%\nCopper recovery\n31.6%\n31.2%\n32.4%\n33.4%\n29.6%\nCopper produced (millions of pounds)\n39.265\n9.596\n9.786\n10.290\n9.594\nMaricunga toll processing\nCopper produced (millions of pounds)\n1.466\n-\n-\n0.570\n0.896\nTotal copper produced (millions of pounds)\n62.515\n15.625\n15.487\n16.262\n15.141\nTotal copper delivered (millions of pounds)\n62.593\n15.970\n15.251\n16.197\n15.175\nCash cost ($/pound copper)\n1.64\n1.66\n1.69\n1.53\n1.71\nRelease of 2017 Annual Financial Results:\nThe Company will release 2017 annual financial results at market open on Wednesday February 21, 2018, followed by an investor conference call on Thursday February 22, 2018 at 11:00 am Pacific Standard Time/2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.\nCall Participation:\nTo participate in the call, please dial 1-866-225-0198 (Toll-Free North America) and let the operator know you wish to participate in the Amerigo Resources conference call.
