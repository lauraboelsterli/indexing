    "text": "BROOKFIELD, Wis., Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Connecture, Inc. (OTCQX:CNXR), a provider of web-based information systems used to create health insurance marketplaces, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by entities affiliated with the global private equity firm, Francisco Partners.\nThe transaction has been approved unanimously by Connecture’s Board of Directors upon the recommendation of a Special Committee of independent, outside directors. Under the terms of the agreement, entities affiliated with Francisco Partners have agreed to pay $0.35 per share for each share of Connecture common stock not held by Connecture’s existing preferred investors, Francisco Partners and Chrysalis Ventures, and their affiliates. Upon completion of the transaction, Connecture will become a privately-held company owned by Francisco Partners, Chrysalis Ventures and their affiliates, which have all agreed to roll their existing equity into the acquiring company. The agreement includes a 45 day “go shop” period, although there can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. Francisco Partners and Chrysalis Ventures, which together own approximately 70% of the combined voting power of Connecture’s outstanding voting shares, have signed a voting and support agreement to support the transaction and any potential superior proposal.\n“This transaction comes after a transformational year for our company and we look forward to the next phase,” remarked Jeff Surges, President and CEO of Connecture.\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote by a majority of the outstanding shares of Connecture’s capital stock voting together as a single class at a to-be-scheduled special meeting of stockholders. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2018.\nThe Special Committee that negotiated and recommended the transaction has retained Houlihan Lokey and Raymond James as its financial advisors and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP as its legal advisor. DLA Piper LLP (US) is serving as legal advisor to Connecture. Francisco Partners’ legal advisor is Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\nAbout Connecture\nConnecture (OTCQX:CNXR) is a leading web-based consumer shopping, enrollment and retention platform for health insurance distribution. Connecture offers a personalized health insurance shopping experience that recommends the best fit insurance plan based on an individual’s preferences, health status, preferred providers, medications and expected out-of-pocket costs.

Connecture’s solutions automate key functions in the health insurance distribution process, allowing its customers to price and present plan options accurately to consumers and efficiently enroll, renew and manage plan members.\nAbout Francisco Partners\nFrancisco Partners is a leading global private equity firm, which specializes in investments in technology and technology-enabled services businesses.

(the “Company”) intends to file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, the Company will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the merger.
