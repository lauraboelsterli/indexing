( bit.ly/2n8QwnI ) \nHowever, Commerzbank Chief Executive Martin Zielke wanted to sell the EMC division - which also includes equity derivatives and other market making businesses - as a single unit, according to the report. Slideshow (2 Images) \nBarclays declined to comment on the report. Goldman Sachs, Commerzbank and Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. \nThe German bank, which is reducing its staff to 36,000 by 2020 from 43,000 at the end of 2015, has been focusing on expanding its retail customer base. \nCommerzbank was hit hard by the financial crisis and received an 18 billion-euro (£15.8 billion) state bailout. \nThe lender had reported a 472 million-euro net profit in the third quarter, saying it was expecting a “slightly positive” net profit for full-year 2017.
