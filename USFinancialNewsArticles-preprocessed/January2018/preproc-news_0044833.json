    "text": "Jan 25 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc beat estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Thursday as revenues surged 35 percent compared to a year earlier on the back of strong global demand for its construction and mining equipment. The company also said it took a $2.4 billion charge related to recent U.S. tax changes, widening its net loss before adjustments to $1.30 billion, or $2.18 per share, from $1.17 billion, or $2.00 per share, a year earlier.
