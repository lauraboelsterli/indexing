    "text": " 22 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Judge tosses GM settlement on ignition switch   \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday said a settlement agreement that would require General Motors Co ( GM.N ) to pay $1 billion in stock to car owners suing the company over faulty ignition switches was not enforceable. \nJudge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York said the agreement that car owners had reached with a trust that holds many GM liabilities from before its 2009 bankruptcy was not valid without signatures.
