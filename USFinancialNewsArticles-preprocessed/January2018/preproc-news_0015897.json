    "text": "January 13, 2018 / 12:08 PM / in 8 minutes UPDATE 1-Iraq nears oil output capacity of 5 mln bpd, committed to OPEC cuts Reuters Staff \n(Adds quote, details, background) \nBy Rania El Gamal, Maha El Dahan and Stanley Carvalho \nABU DHABI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday that the OPEC member’s oil output capacity is nearing 5 million barrels per day, but the country will remain in full compliance with its output target under a global pact to cut supplies. \nLuaibi said the supply cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers should continue despite a rise in oil prices. \n“The market now is not 100 percent stable,” he said at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi, adding that current oil prices could be sustained, but there might be some fluctuations. \nFor the week, Brent crude rose 3.3 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped 4.7 percent, having hit its hit its strongest since late 2014 at $64.77 on Thursday. \nThe deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to cut 1.8 million barrels per day of crude, which started in January 2017, is due to last until the end of 2018. \nLuaibi said current Iraq’s oil production is about 4.3 million barrels per day. \nDespite the increase in oil production from the United States, “so far there is a balance” in the oil market, Luaibi said. \n“We are watching the market and the market is okay in terms of supply and demand balance. There’s still a gap, inventories are still high. The inventory level will decrease gradually and we will see how things will go,” he told reporters. \nLuaibi also said that his ministry plans to conclude three contracts with international gas companies by mid-2018 to utilize gas from Basra, Maysan and Nassiriyah southern provinces. \nHe said that by 2021, the country plans to “reach zero gas flaring”. \nIraq is forced to flare some of the gas produced alongside crude oil as it lacks the facilities needed to capture and process it into usable fuel. \nThe country has just one gas processing company, the Basrah Gas Company, a joint venture between Iraq’s state-run South Gas Co., Shell and Mitsubishi. \nOPEC’s second-largest crude producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq is seeking to increase its oil and gas income, which account for nearly all its public budget.
