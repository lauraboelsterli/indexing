    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s transport ministry confirmed a media report on Monday that the KBA automotive watchdog detected illicit emission-control software in Audi’s ( NSUG.DE ) latest Euro-6 diesel models and ordered a recall of the vehicles.\nSome 127,000 vehicles from Audi, a unit of Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), are affected worldwide including 77,600 vehicles are registered in Germany, a spokeswoman for the German transport ministry said during a regular news conference.\nNewspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that road transport authority KBA had told Audi to respond by Feb. 2 on how it plans to update vehicle software controlling emissions, making sure the cars are unable to illegally manipulate emission controls.\nAudi said in a statement on Sunday that the models had been included in a voluntary recall of 850,000 diesel vehicles with V6 and V8 TDI engines announced in July.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber,; Editing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
