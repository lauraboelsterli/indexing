Sydney Cricket Ground - Capacity: 44,002 Situated in Moore Park in the city's east, the SCG has been the venue for tests since 1882, making it the world's third oldest test ground after the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Oval in London. A facility that allows spectators to get up close to the action, the SCG has also been used to host a whole range of sports including soccer, rugby union, rugby league and Australian Rules football. Although the SCG has always had a reputation for being the most spin-friendly of Australia's test tracks, particularly on the last couple of days, it has helped the seamers as well. Australia have won 26 of the 55 Ashes tests played at the SCG while England have won 22. It was at the SCG on the first day of the fifth test in the 1998-99 series when England pacer Darren Gough wrote his name into Ashes history by picking up a hat-trick. England went on to lose the series 3-1. Steve Waugh scored a potentially career-saving century at his home ground in the fifth test of the 2003 series after averaging just over 30 across 11 tests in the previous year. Australia won the series 4-1. WHEN? Jan. 4-8.
