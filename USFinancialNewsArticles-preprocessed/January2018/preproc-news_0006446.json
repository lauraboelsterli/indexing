    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Yukon Partners (\"Yukon\"), a provider of mezzanine capital for middle market private equity transactions, is pleased to announce its support of Upstream Rehabilitation (“Upstream” or the “Company”), a portfolio company of Revelstoke Capital Partners (“Revelstoke”), in its acquisition of Drayer Physical Therapy Institute, LLC (“DPTI”). Certain DPTI shareholders, including Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, rolled over a portion of their proceeds in exchange for a minority ownership stake in Upstream.\nUpstream, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a provider of outpatient rehabilitation services, providing care through free-standing physical therapy clinics, outpatient rehabilitation management services, and a member network of rehabilitation service providers. With the DPTI transaction, Upstream is the fourth-largest outpatient physical therapy provider in the U.S. with over 550 clinics across 27 states. The Company is a current portfolio company of Yukon and is led by Revelstoke, a Denver-based private equity firm.\nDPTI, headquartered in Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, is an outpatient physical therapy platform with over 160 locations across 15 states. The acquisition of DPTI provides Upstream with an opportunity to create an industry-leading physical therapy platform with significant density and scale across its markets.\n“Upstream and DPTI share similar cultures and a strong commitment to clinical excellence and compliance. We see a tremendous opportunity to combine the strengths and capabilities of both companies, while maintaining the portfolio of brands from each, to continue to grow and be the provider and employer of choice in the industry,” said David Van Name, CEO and founder of Upstream.\n“Since we invested in Upstream in December 2015, the company has nearly tripled in size driven by above-market same-clinic growth, approximately 100 de novo clinic openings and 12 add-on acquisitions. We have enjoyed a strong partnership with the Upstream management team and look forward to working with them on this transformative acquisition,” said Simon Bachleda, Managing Partner at Revelstoke.\n“Yukon’s extensive healthcare experience and knowledge of the outpatient rehab industry is evidence of their value-add approach as a mezzanine capital partner. We were pleased that Yukon stepped up to play a leading role on this transaction,” added Andrew Welch, Managing Director at Revelstoke.\n“Yukon is excited to support Revelstoke and Upstream management as they continue to grow the Company,” said Michael Hall, Managing Partner of Yukon. “The addition of DPTI provides increased scale and density, and enables the Company to better serve its core markets.”\nAbout Upstream Rehabilitation\nUpstream Rehabilitation is a leading national provider of outpatient rehabilitation services, providing care through free-standing physical therapy clinics, outpatient rehabilitation management services, and a member network of rehabilitation service providers.
