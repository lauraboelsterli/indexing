The pending acquisition of Bank Mutual will further enhance our Wisconsin and Minnesota network and we look forward to welcoming Bank Mutual's customers to Associated on February 1,\" said President and CEO Philip B. Flynn. \"Our 2017 financial results reflect strong underlying credit quality, growing fee-based revenue, and the ongoing benefits of our technology and efficiency initiatives. For 2018, we expect to fund over $1 billion in new loans, to improve our net interest margin modestly, and to further reduce our efficiency ratio, driving increasing returns on capital for our shareholders.\"\n1 The following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures which exclude expenses related to the Tax Act, to GAAP financial measures.\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n4Q 2017\n4Q 2017\nper share data\nFY 2017\nFY 2017\nper share data\nGAAP earnings and EPS\n$\n48\n$\n0.31\n$\n220\n$\n1.42\nRequired partial write-off of deferred tax asset\n12\n0.08\n12\n$\n0.08\nRequired acceleration of low income housing tax credit amortization\n1\n<0.01\n1\n<0.01\nPreviously disclosed compensation actions\n1\n<0.01\n1\n<0.01\nOther accelerated write-offs\n1\n<0.01\n1\n<0.01\nTotal expenses related to the Tax Act\n$\n15\n$\n0.10\n$\n15\n$\n0.10\nEarnings and EPS, excluding expenses related to the Tax Act\n$\n63\n$\n0.41\n$\n235\n$\n1.52\nFor notes on non-GAAP measures see page 7.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS (all comparisons to the year ago)\nAverage loans of $20.6 billion were up 5%, or $942 million Average deposits of $21.9 billion were up 4%, or $918 million Income before income taxes was up 18%, or $51 million Total dividends paid per common share were $0.50, up 11%\n2017 FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS\nLoans\nFull year 2017 average loans of $20.6 billion were up 5%, or $942 million from 2016.\nWith respect to full year 2017 average balances by loan category as compared to 2016:\nConsumer lending increased $854 million, or 11% to $8.4 billion driven by the Company's on balance sheet mortgage retention strategy.

Net income and earnings per share excluding these related expenses are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures are meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share and provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods. All items are tax effected.\nInvestor Contact:\nJessica Vanden Heuvel, Vice President, Director of Investor Relations\n920-491-7059\nMedia Contact:\nJennifer Kaminski, Vice President, Public Relations Senior Manager\n920-491-7576\n releases/associated-banc-corp-reports-full-year-2017-earnings-of-142-per-common-share-or-152-per-common-share-excluding-expenses-related-to-the-tax-act1-300588425.html\nSOURCE Associated Banc-Corp",
