REUTERS/Mandel Ngan/Pool \nPence will also visit Alaska and Japan as part of the trip. Pence will review ICBM defence systems in Alaska and reaffirm to the leaders of Japan and South Korea that the United States is fully committed to stability in the region, the official said. \nThe Pyeongchang Olympics, which start on Feb. 9, coincide with high tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to North Korean nuclear tests and contentious exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nNorth Korea will also send high-ranking officials, athletes, and a cheering squad to the Olympics, a senior South Korean official said on Tuesday. \nThe U.S. State Department said in a briefing on Tuesday that there are not any current plans for the American delegation to meet with the North Korean delegation. \nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham has said he opposed inviting the North Korean delegation to the Games. \n“I don’t mind talks with North Korea but I do have serious concerns about legitimising the most barbaric leader on the planet,” Graham wrote in a post on Twitter on Tuesday.
