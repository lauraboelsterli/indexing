    "text": "January 24, 2018 / 3:12 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago Google, Tencent, Sequoia China join $15 mln funding for pharma startup XtalPi Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Sequoia Capital China have joined a $15 million B series funding round for Boston- and Shenzhen-based artificial intelligence (AI) pharmaceutical firm XtalPi Inc. \nSequoia led the round, which brings the startup’s total funding amount to $20 million, XtalPi and Google said in statements on Wednesday. \nXtalPi uses AI, cloud computing and quantum physics to improve drug design processes. \nThe deal is the first co-investment by Google and Tencent since the two companies revealed this month that they have signed a patent sharing agreement, paving the way for cooperation between the two firms. \nGoogle has recently ramped up investment in the Chinese market where its search engine remains blocked. Last month it announced it had launched a dedicated AI lab in the country. (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar)",
