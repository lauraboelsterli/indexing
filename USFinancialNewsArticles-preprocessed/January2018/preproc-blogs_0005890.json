The most-active contract peaked at $4.41-1/2, its highest since Nov. 22. \nCBOT March soft red winter wheat futures were 2 cents higher at $4.35-1/2 a bushel. \nThe U.S. Agriculture Department said on Tuesday afternoon that winter wheat in Kansas, the top production state for the grain, was rated 37 percent good to excellent, down from 51 percent at the end of November. A year ago, the state's winter wheat crop was rated 44 percent good to excellent. \nCBOT March corn futures were down 1/4 cent at $3.53 a bushel. Prices firmed early but weakened after failing to break through the 50-day moving average. \nCBOT March soybean futures were 2-1/2 cents higher at $9.67-1/4 a bushel. \nArgentina's bread-basket province of Buenos Aires will remain mostly dry in the days ahead, meteorologists said on Tuesday, after reporting scant rain over the weekend.
