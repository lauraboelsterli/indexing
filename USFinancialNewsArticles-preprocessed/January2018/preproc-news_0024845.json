    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus ( AIR.PA ) is three years away from recovering leadership of the commercial aircraft market by outproducing U.S. rival Boeing ( BA.N ), its top planemaker predicted on Monday.\nSpeaking to journalists after posting higher orders and deliveries in 2017, Chief Operating Officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said he was prepared to bet that Airbus would deliver more airplanes than Boeing in 2020 - a feat it last achieved in 2011 - because of a record order backlog.\nFor 2018, he predicted deliveries would accelerate to reach close to 800 aircraft, up around 11 percent compared with annual gains of 8 percent and 4 percent in 2017 and 2016 respectively.\nAirbus delivered 718 jets in 2017, compared with 763 delivered by Boeing.\nBregier also expressed confidence in the ability of engine maker Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) to keep up with aircraft production plans after overcoming a series of delays.\nReporting by Tim Hepher, Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
