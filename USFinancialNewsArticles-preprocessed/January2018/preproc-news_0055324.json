    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Limited (Nasdaq:AVGO), a leading semiconductor device supplier to the wired, wireless, enterprise storage, and industrial end markets, today narrowed the range for its revenue outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, ending February 4, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which is a 14-week quarter, the Company expects non-GAAP net revenue in the range of $5,300 million to $5,350 million. In addition, the Company expects non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share to be approximately $5.10 per share.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, which is a typical 13-week quarter, the Company expects non-GAAP net revenue in the range of $5,000 million, plus or minus $75 million.\n“Our first quarter results are tracking towards the higher end of our expectations as we continue to execute on our business model,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Limited. “Looking ahead to our second fiscal quarter, strong data center demand for our wired and enterprise storage products and a seasonal pick up in broadband is expected to offset a greater than seasonal decline in wireless. As a result, we currently forecast on a normalized 13-week quarter basis, that second quarter revenue will be roughly flat to the previous quarter.”\nActual results may vary from these estimates. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise these estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses non-GAAP measures for, among other things, purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company. Broadcom believes these measures also provide investors with a consistent basis of comparison and helps them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The projected non-GAAP net revenue ranges provided above include de minimis amounts of expected licensing revenue that is not included in GAAP revenue due to the effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions. The Company is unable to reconcile the above projected earnings-per-share to GAAP as the amount of the reconciling items cannot be determined at this time.\nAbout Broadcom Limited\nBroadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions. Broadcom Limited’s extensive product portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other. Applications for our products in these end markets include: data center networking, home connectivity, set-top box, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning Broadcom.
