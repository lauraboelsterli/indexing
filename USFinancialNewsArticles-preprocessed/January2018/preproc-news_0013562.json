    "text": "9:27 AM EST \nThis article originally ran in Term Sheet, Fortune’s newsletter about deals and dealmakers. Sign up here. \nBefore he was a partner at Venrock , David Pakman spent 12 years as an Internet entrepreneur. He was co-founder of Apple Music Group, co-founder of MyPlay (creator of the digital music locker), CEO of eMusic (a digital retailer of independent music), and vice president at N2K Entertainment (one of the first online music companies). \n“I model myself as a VC the way I wanted my VCs and board members to be,” he says. “I wanted someone who could straddle the line between coach, mentor, and a shoulder to cry on.” \nIn his nearly 10 years at Venrock, Pakman has led investments in companies including Dollar Shave Club, Nest, and Misty Robotics. Right now, the biggest trends he’s paying attention to are artificial intelligence, robots, and crypto. “ There’s no question that these are the most interesting innovations in front of us right now,” he says. \nThis was one of my favorite conversations so far about cryptocurrency, ICOs, and the impending doom of humans vs. robots. \nTERM SHEET: What do you look for in a company or founder before investing? \nPAKMAN: It’s a combination of two things: we’re looking for founders with extraordinary ambition. The likelihood that things won’t go your way and that you will encounter multiple points of failure is high, so it’s only people with an extraordinary sense of ambition who will run through those walls and figure it out. The second thing we look for is for someone with non-consensus thinking. When you come across an entrepreneur with a great idea that everyone recognizes is a great idea, then the investment is not going to be super unique and there’s probably lots of other people who can think of it too. But when you come across entrepreneurs who have a differentiated point of view that most people think is wrong or likely to fail, then that’s another thing we think is great. \nYou invested in Misty Robotics . How do you see humans’ relationships with robots and machines evolving when it comes to business, friendship, and even intimacy? \nPAKMAN: I think the best way to think about this topic is to look at children and their interactions with technology. There’s a video of a 1-year-old playing with an iPad, and it was just completely natural. The child barely understands English, but they figured it out. \nWhen I saw that video, I said, “OK, you can build products that are adopted by the young who have no preconceptions of whether this is weird or not.” I think about how children interact with technology as a good roadmap for what the future will look like. I have a prototype of the Misty at my house, and my 10-year-old already has an attachment to this android. \nI think robots will be adopted into the family in ways that are more personal and pet-like than we think. We tend to anthropomorphize technology that moves. I think we’ll see all sorts of companion-oriented robots at mostly two ends of the age scale — young and very old. \nI’ve been thinking about this in terms of voice. Alexa, for example, can be helpful for very young kids or for much older people who need assistance in the home. \nPAKMAN: I remember a weak moment as a parent when my daughter said, “I can’t fall asleep tonight. Will you stay here?” And I said, “Ask Alexa to read you a bedtime story.” And of course, Alexa did. I was like “OK, that was a bad parenting move, but wasn’t that amazing?!” \nMany workers wonder whether they will lose their job to a robot. What do you think the future looks like as machines begin to displace humans? \nPAKMAN: The economic anxiety we see in the United States is only just starting because the amount of economic dislocation that will happen over the next 10 to 20 years is so much greater than what’s happened already. I read the Rise of the Robots, which references this Oxford study that shows 47% of jobs are vulnerable to automation in the next 10 to 20 years. We’re talking about 60 million jobs. The entire tech industry has created maybe 3 to 5 million jobs directly, yet automation may displace 60 million jobs. We’re not going to make enough new ones in the same time period, so the amount of economic pain that’s going to be felt will be huge. \nWhat kind of skills will human workers need to survive this AI revolution? \nPAKMAN: As a society, we shifted from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. That change happens over the course of a generation, and the biggest problem is that the older end of the workforce doesn’t really have a chance to adapt to the new opportunities. So this idea that we’ll create self-driving trucks and displace the 3.5 million truck drivers and that they’re all going to work at Google as data scientists is just not going to happen. \nAmazon is a good example. Each subsequent version of their warehouses has considerably more and more automation, which is causing their workforce to jump up the skill ladder where they’re training robots or doing more sophisticated labor. \nThat should create a significant amount of productivity gains, which will then allows us to move on to more complex problems. I am a bull on this ultimately creating more opportunity, but it’s the time frame that’s messed up. \nWhat are your thoughts around crypto and the blockchain as it relates to venture capital? \nPAKMAN: There’s no question that crypto will disrupt the business of venture capital. And I hope it does. The democratization of everything is what has excited me about technology from the beginning. It’s better for everyone if there are fewer gatekeepers. I hate gatekeepers. I hate them in the music business, I hate them in the entertainment business, and I hate them in VC. Why should I decide if your idea is going to succeed or not? Every idea should get a chance to succeed & the ones that do, do. I’d like to see us reach a point where VCs are not gatekeepers. \nWhat VCs should be is evaluators. The purpose we primarily serve is we take our LPs’ money, we help pick projects that we think are most likely to result in really big outcomes, and then we help those projects result in really big outcomes. By broadening the investment landscape and letting more and more people back technology entrepreneurs, then more and more projects get a chance at success. That’s a very good thing. \nBut won’t that put VCs out of a job? \nPAKMAN: I don’t think it will cause me to be out of a job if I’m good at my job. If you speak with most entrepreneurs, I think they’ll tell you that what was more helpful from VCs was their help, not their money. \nOne of the challenges with current models of ICOs is that they’re easy access to capital, but they don’t provide access to advice, mentorship, board members. I think a hybrid model of finding experts that can help you succeed and have access to capital is a great model for the future. \nSpeaking of ICOs, many of them have been labeled as scams. Do you think they’re a good way for companies to raise capital? \nPAKMAN: Most of them are scams, but I’m old enough to remember the beginnings of the Internet where every business put “dot com” on the end of their name and tried to go public. And many did. Most folks don’t remember that in the run up of the March 2000 cra",
