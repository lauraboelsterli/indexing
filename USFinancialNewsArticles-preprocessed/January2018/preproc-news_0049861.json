Sales in the region were boosted by higher demand for its McPick 2 $5 combo offer and cheap beverages.\nMcDonald's global sales at stores open at least 13 months rose a healthy 5.5 percent, as it served more customers in regions including Canada, UK and China.\nThat topped the 5 percent analysts had expected, according to Consensus Metrix.\nNet income fell to $698.7 million or 87 cents per share, from $1.19 billion or $1.44 per share, a year earlier, mainly due to a $700 million net charge related to recent changes in U.S. tax law.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.71 per share beating the average analyst estimate of $1.59, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue fell 11.4 percent to $5.3 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, as it stepped up sales of restaurants to franchisees and strategic partners, the company said.\nMcDonald's shares were down 0.8 percent at $176.34 premarket. The stock rose 45 percent in the 12 months to Monday's close. (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bangalore and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernard Orr and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
