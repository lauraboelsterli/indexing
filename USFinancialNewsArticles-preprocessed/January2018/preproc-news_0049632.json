    "text": "January 27, 2018 / 5:40 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Honduran president sworn in amid protests after election chaos Gustavo Palencia 3 Min Read \nTEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez called for unity on Saturday after a bitterly disputed election last year as he was sworn in for a second term, even as police skirmished with protesters in the streets. \nHernandez, a conservative supported by the United States, appeared set to lose the Nov. 26 election until an abrupt halt in the vote count and a shift in the results took victory away from his centre-left rival, Salvador Nasralla. \nAllegations of fraud sparked deadly protests that killed more than 30 people in the impoverished Central American country, which has been plagued by battles between security forces, local gangs and drug traffickers. \nAs Hernandez spoke at a stadium at his swearing-in, supporters and troops chanted “unity” and waved the blue and white Honduran flag. \n“If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand,” he said, quoting the New Testament. “I promise to carry out a process of reconciliation among all Hondurans.” \nOn Saturday, thousands of demonstrators clashed with troops and police, who fired tear gas to disperse the crowd that had gathered a couple of miles from the stadium where Hernandez took office. \nNasralla, a sportscaster and game show host, and his ally Manuel Zelaya, a former leftist president who was overthrown in a 2009 coup, led demonstrators on Saturday.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido \nAntonio Tejada, a 33-year-old laborer at the protests, said Hernandez “had stolen the presidency against the will of the people.” \n“We will keep fighting until he is out of power,” he said. \nInternational observers said last year’s election was marred by irregularities and the Organization of American States called for a new vote.
