    "text": "IOC says North Korea to have 22 athletes in 5 Olympic sports Both Korean teams will march together in the opening ceremony next month The North Koreans will compete in five sports, including a unified women's hockey team Published 7 Hours Ago SHARES Getty Images People walk in front of mascots of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games Soohorang (L) and Bandabi (R) on January 5, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea. \nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says 22 North Korean athletes will compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics next month and both Korean teams will march together in the opening ceremony. \nIOC President Thomas Bach says the North Koreans will compete in five sports disciplines, including a unified women's hockey team. \nThe others are figure skating, short track speed skating, Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing. \nThe North Korean delegation will include 24 coaches and officials at the Feb. 9-25 Winter Games. \nBach offers \"sincere thanks to the governments of North and South Korea.\" \nThe agreement became possible after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said three weeks ago that a team could cross the border to compete. \nBach did not take questions and was flanked by Olympic and government officials from both countries at a brief news conference.",
