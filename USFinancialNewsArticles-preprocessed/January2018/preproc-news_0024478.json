    "text": "January 12, 2018 / 8:21 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago China Dec total social financing falls to 1.14 trln yuan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIJING, Jan 12 (Reuters) - China’s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, fell to 1.14 trillion yuan ($176.15 billion) in December from 1.60 trillion yuan in November, data from the central bank showed on Friday. \nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. \nThe economic barometer has become a gauge of fundraising trends and can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector. Chinese authorities have been trying to clamp down on risky forms of lending as part of a broader campaign to contain systemic financial risks.
