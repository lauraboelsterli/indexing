    "text": "Dennis Schroder scored 20 points and Taurean Prince added 17 points as the Atlanta Hawks pulled away from the Utah Jazz in the second half of a 104-90 win Monday at Philips Arena.\nAtlanta missed 36 3-pointers in a 113-97 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Saturday, but came out hot from beyond arc against the Jazz. Eight different Hawks hit 3-pointers, including three from Kent Bazemore. Atlanta hit 12 threes as a team, but was unable to distance itself from Utah until late in the third quarter.\nJazz rookie Donovan Mitchell hit a pull-up jumper that trimmed the Atlanta lead to 61-60 with three minutes left in the third quarter. The Hawks took over from that point.\nAtlanta closed out the third quarter with a 13-3 run and took a 74-63 lead into the fourth quarter. Dewayne Dedmon ignited the spurt with a 3-pointer, and Schroder scored a pair of buckets in the final two minutes of the third.\nAtlanta poured it on in the fourth quarter. Bazemore drained two 3-pointers from the same corner, and the Hawks scored the first 13 points of the period to pull away from the Jazz.\nBazemore and Marco Belinelli each finished with 11 points for the Hawks.\nJohn Collins threw down a one-handed dunk off a pretty pass from Prince that pushed the Atlanta lead to 88-66 with 8:17 to play.\nAlec Burks scored 17 points off the bench and Mitchell finished with 13 points for the Jazz, who were without second-leading scorer Rodney Hood.\nThe Hawks led for the majority of the first half and took a 42-41 lead into intermission.\nAtlanta made 12 of 12 from the foul line.\nThe Hawks are now 3-2 on their current six-game home stand, which comes to an end against Toronto on Wednesday.\nThe Jazz head to Detroit on Wednesday, before wrapping up their three-game road trip at Toronto on Friday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
