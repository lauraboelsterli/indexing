The net blow of the bill to the bank will include about a $1.4 billion net discrete tax provision, mainly due to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, the company said in a filing. \nIt would be offset by $160 million in other positive effects, Morgan Stanley added.( bit.ly/2m0QVsB ) Reporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur",
