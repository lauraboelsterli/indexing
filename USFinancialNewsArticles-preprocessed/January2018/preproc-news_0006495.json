    "text": "KCNA | Reuters North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un speaks during a New Year's Day speech in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on January 1, 2018. President Donald Trump says he's open to talking with the North Korean leader he's called \"Rocket Man\" and is hoping some good can come from upcoming talks between the Koreans.\nTrump tells reporters at Camp David that he \"always believes in talking.\"\nNorth and South Korea have agreed to discuss cooperation on the upcoming Olympics in South Korea, as well as other issues, in rare talks set to begin Tuesday.\nTrump calls that \"a big start.\" He says if \"something can come out of those talks that would be a great thing for all of humanity.\"\nHe says North Korea's Kim Jong Un — who's threatened the U.S. with a nuclear attack — \"knows I'm not messing around, not even a little bit, not even 1 percent.\"",
