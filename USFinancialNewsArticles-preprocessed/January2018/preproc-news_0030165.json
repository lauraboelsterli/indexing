Volumes grew by 2.5 percent.\nAnalysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a 2.0 percent gain. The month-on-month jump was the biggest since the 3.4 percent advance in March 2015.\nSales of transportation equipment increased by 9.1 percent, largely reflecting increased shipments of motor vehicles and parts after assembly plants came back on stream after shutdowns in October. Higher prices pushed up the value of petroleum and coal products by 6.1 percent.\nWeakness in the aerospace products and parts sector hit both new orders, which fell by 1.8 percent, and unfilled ones, which were down 0.9 percent.\n($1=$1.25 Canadian)\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ",
