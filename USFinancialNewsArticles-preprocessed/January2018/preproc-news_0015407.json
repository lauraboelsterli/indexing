General Dynamics, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin , they are all for me. I think you've got a good one. Let's wait. It's about to have another move. That's how it trades: in fits and starts.\"\nIrhythm Technologies Inc. : \"We have to get them on when we're out in San Francisco. They do heart palpitations. They do a lot of stuff that I was hoping that my watch one day would do, because that's how you stop heart attacks, the most preventable form of death in this country. I like it.\"\nSouthwest Airlines Co. : \"I sold it for the charitable trust, and I've got to tell you, I thought I was so smart making the 10-15 percent, [but] this one goes still higher. Somebody downgraded it yesterday. It was shameful.\"\nFrontier Communications Corp. : \"I just don't like the balance sheet. I'm not going to get in there and say, 'Listen, the chart's getting a little better.' I would scale out on any strength. The greatest thing about some stocks is that they do stop at zero. But I do think that Frontier is in trouble. Very troubled company.\"\nSouthwestern Energy Company : \"Southern is a sell, sell, sell. They have too much natural gas, not enough oil. I say stay away.\"\nToyota Motor Corp. : \"Toyota Motor is a beast. I would still buy it, even up here. That's how good that company is.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Wait for General Dynamicsâ€”it's about to move higher 17 Hours Ago | 04:07 ",
