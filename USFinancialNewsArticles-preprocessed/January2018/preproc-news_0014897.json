    "text": "January 15, 2018 / 8:32 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Toymaker Lego teams up with Chinese internet giant Tencent Pei Li , Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen 3 Min Read \nBEIJING/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish toymaker Lego is teaming up with Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ) to jointly develop online games and potentially a social network aimed at Chinese children. Sets of Lego bricks are seen at a toy store in Bonn, Germany, September 5, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay \nPrivately-owned Lego has seen a slowdown in sales growth in recent years, but the Chinese market has been a bright spot with sales growing 25-30 percent in 2016. \nIt is competing with Barbie maker Mattel Inc ( MAT.O ) and Hasbro ( HAS.O ), the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the $31 billion toys and games market in China. \nLego said on Monday the partnership with Tencent, China’s biggest social network and gaming company, aimed to create a safe online environment covering content, platforms, and experiences tailored for Chinese children. \n“What we are looking for now with Tencent is just to find more creative ways... (of) reaching children, and creating bespoke content with Tencent, in this case, video games,” Jacob Kragh, head of Lego in China, told Reuters on Monday at joint event with Tencent in Beijing. \nThe partnership includes developing a Lego video zone for children on the Tencent video platform, as well as developing and operating Lego branded licensed games, the toymaker said. \nIt also includes LEGO BOOST - a building and coding set that lets children turn their brick creations into moving objects - and will explore developing a joint social network for children in China. \nTencent is Asia’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $537 billion. \nLast year, Mattel struck deals with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ) and online content developer BabyTree to sell interactive learning products based on its Fisher-Price toys. \nLego has about a 3 percent market share in China, followed by Mattel and Hasbro with around 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, according to Euromonitor International. \nIn November 2016, Lego opened a factory in Jiaxing, China, which it expects to produce 70-80 percent of all Lego products sold in Asia.
