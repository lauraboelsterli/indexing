Forward-looking statements are based on FTSI’s current expectations and assumptions regarding capital market conditions, FTSI’s business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, FTSI’s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions, including risks regarding when FTSI can complete the offering, FTSI’s competitive environment and other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in the registration statement on Form S-1. Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. FTSI undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180123005833/en/\nFTS International, Inc.\nLance Turner, 817-862-2000\nChief Financial Officer\ninvestors@ftsi.com\nSource: FTS International, Inc.",
