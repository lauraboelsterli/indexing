    "text": " 42 PM / Updated 29 minutes ago Two hundred migrants reach Spain after storming fence Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBARCELONA (Reuters) - More than 300 people stormed the heavily fortified border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave Melilla in what authorities on Sunday called a mass “violent crossing”. \nSome 209 migrants succeeded in reaching Spain in Saturday’s incident. \nSpain’s two North African enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, are a common target for entry into the European Union by migrants who try to climb the border fences or enter the territories by sea. \nOne Civil Guard police officer was injured in an attack by a migrant, the Spanish government said. \nFour of the migrants who reached Spain received treatment for injuries sustained during the crossing.
