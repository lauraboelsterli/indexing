    "text": " 14 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Trump says to address trade, immigration in State of the Union speech Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he will address his proposed immigration overhaul in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday and will seek Democratic support for it. \nSpeaking to reporters after a swearing-in ceremony for new Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Trump said his immigration overhaul will have to be bipartisan “because the Republicans don’t really have the votes to get it done in any other way.” \nTrump also said his speech will cover his efforts to lower trade barriers around the world for American exports. “We have to have reciprocal trade. It’s not a one-way deal anymore,” he said. Reporting By Steve HollandEditing by Chizu Nomiyama",
