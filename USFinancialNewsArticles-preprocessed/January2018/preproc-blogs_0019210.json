    "text": "Erich Spangenberg has always been good at spotting opportunities for arbitrage, places in the market where there is a pricing spread that a savvy buyer can exploit for profit. He started in high-yield bonds and went on during the internet boom to turn a million dollars in patent acquisitions into a portfolio of software intellectual property worth $150 million.\nErich Spangenberg Erich Spangenberg, founder of IPwe, made a fortune amassing tech patents during the software boom. Attacked by some as a patent troll for the $150 million he made, he now wants to bring the entire patent world into the 21st century, using AI and the blockchain. By his own account, he didn't make his IP fortune by not being aggressive. But Spangenberg describes his latest, and what he thinks will be the biggest and longest-lasting investing idea he has ever had, as something he stumbled into as a result of a friend convincing him to buy bitcoin.\n\"When I stumbled into it, I didn't know it was enabled by the blockchain,\" he recalled. \"I made a lot in finance and what I recognized was how incredible inefficiencies create arbitrage opportunities. I realized blockchain was significant, and the more I thought about it, the more it seemed so. I jumped all over it.\"\nSpangenberg — who over the years has been on the receiving end of \"troll\" criticism for his patent fortune — recently pursued a more interesting path involving use of his patent knowledge to target what many of the populist-minded would judge to be an unfair stranglehold over pricing.\nHe teamed with hedge fund manager Kyle Bass to challenge the patents of pharmaceutical companies with high drug prices while shorting their stocks. But Spangenberg says he knew when he started with Bass that the drug patent effort wouldn't hold his interest for the rest of his life. Spangenberg was also going through a divorce at the time. \"I had time to think about a lot of things,\" he said. Including exactly where he had made his millions and just how inefficient the patent world itself had become in allowing a few specialist niches to receive most of the riches.\n\"I started thinking about the space I had been screwing around in, the patents,\" Spangenberg said. \"There are roughly 200 national patent offices globally, and for 99.9 percent — even when we know who owns the patents — it is so hard to figure out anything. There's not a whole lot of people positioned to say, 'Here is where it's screwed up.' I played in arbitrage and the troll business, and inefficiency permitted me to make a fortune. We should eliminate that and now make money another way.\"\nHis new firm, IPwe , is attacking two issues critical to what is really innovation's own infrastructure: the intellectual property space. IPwe is creating a blockchain -based registry to tackle the lack of access to good information on patent transactions. And it is using machine-learning algorithms to better evaluate patent validity and worth. Specialized investments in the patent asset class exist today, but the end goal of IPwe is to turn the opaque and fragmented world of patents and patent transactions into a broad asset class that can attract much more interest from the world's top institutional investors, as an example, insurance companies looking for pools of non-traditional investments that can generate significant returns.\nNear $200 billion traded in patents many fear but few understand In recent years the value of patents that have been monetized through acquisitions or licensing has neared $200 billion, and yet that represents a tiny portion of all patent grants. The World Intellectual Property Organization has estimated $180 billion in annual patent value derived from 2 percent of all patents. That's an arbitrage opportunity that Spangenberg thinks will disrupt the intermediaries who today benefit the most from the opaque way the patent economy is run: primarily, patent lawyers. The end goal is to turn what has been a limited asset class, where a vast majority of profits go to a narrow group of specialists, into a major asset class receiving allocations from a broad set of investors.\nMark Schankerman, a professor at the London School of Economics, who first met Spangenberg after he donated some of his patent fortune to fund work in entrepreneurship at the London school, said patent trolls and their lawyers play a role in limiting the patent economy, especially in cases where they are demanding too much for IP — \"the \"holdups,\" as he called them. But patent quality is also a huge issue.\n\"That's the other big elephant in the room. ... The vast majority of patents applied for are low quality,\" Schankerman said. \"A lot just should have never been patented, and no one wants the damn stuff.\"\nHis research on U.S. patent litigation estimates that as much as 75 percent to 80 percent of patents are junk. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, meanwhile, is able to screen out, at best, one-third of the patent applications that shouldn't get through. He said survey work on patent value, while less pessimistic than his own research, still shows as much as 40 percent of patents as being overvalued.\n\"Illusive patent quality will improve as a result of inventors, R&D and patent examiners having better tools. We will make more if there are more quality patents. We are capitalists at the end of the day — just creative on how we get there.\" -Eric Spangenberg, co-founder of IPwe Even if 90 percent of patents are worthless, that leaves 10 percent to transact, already five times the current level that is in play, based on the World Intellectual Property data. He doesn't think the math will be linear, but for the sake of an example, that's $900 billion — 5 x $180 billion. \"Even 2x would still be significant. Our bet is that this number is closer to 20 percent,\" Spangenberg said.\nHe believes the critical problem is not on the large pool of overvalued patents on the output side — patent offices issue patents on what is applied for, but on the input side. \"Over time the illusive patent quality will improve as a result of inventors, R&D and patent examiners having better tools. We will make more if there are more quality patents. We are capitalists at the end of the day — just creative on how we get there.\"\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can identify what is left in the world of intellectual property worth patenting. \"We can tell you that, and that will make patents better,\" Spangenberg said.\nIPwe is working with the computer science team at the University of Minnesota, led by Professor George Karypis, which has previously provided patent evaluation technology to clients of IP Navigation Group, a previous company founded by Spangenberg.\n\"Erich has a grand vision,\" Karypis said. \"He always has one. We have the system in place to cover a large chunk of IP, both in terms of scale and analysis ... on all U.S. and European patents and a good chunk of Chinese IP.\"\nMany A.I. start-ups see a patent world ripe for reevaluation The fundamental problems that algorithms can solve in the IP space relate to prior art search — how to know if a patent application is already covered by existing patents — and where \"white space\" exists in the patent system — how much room is left to patent an idea based on what has already been covered by exis",
