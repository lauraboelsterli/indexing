For the rest of the year, China only reported North Korean coal imports in August and September.COA-KPCN-IMP\nIn 2016, China brought in more than 20 million tonnes of North Korean coal, making it Beijing’s fourth-largest supplier after Australia, Indonesia and Mongolia.\n“The majority of market share left by North Korea was grabbed by Russia, as mining costs in Russia are cheaper than in China’s northeastern region,” said Cheng Gong, an analyst at the China National Coal Association.\nIn 2017, Australia was China’s largest coal supplier for a sixth year in a row, bolstered by increasing demand for high-grade supplies due to Beijing’s crackdown on air pollution.\nCoal imports from Australia COA-AUCN-IMP rose 13.4 percent from 2016 to 79.91 million tonnes. In December, China bought 8.07 million tonnes of Australian coal, up 19.4 percent from a year ago.\nAustralian coal, with lower pollutants such as sulphides and ash and a higher energy value, is considered a high-grade fuel compared to Mongolian and Indian supply.\nArrivals from Indonesia COA-IDCN-IMP in 2017 fell 9.7 percent from 2016 to 35.28 million tonnes. December imports of 1.71 million tonnes were down 63.1 percent from the same period in 2016.\nIn late November, Beijing eased some restrictions on coal imports to ensure stable coal supplies during the peak winter heating season.\nData released earlier this month showed China’s total December coal imports rose 3 percent from November to 22.74 million tonnes.\nVessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts suggest China in January will import around 20.9 million tonnes of seaborne coal, both thermal and coking, up from 17.2 million in December and 19.1 million in November.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
