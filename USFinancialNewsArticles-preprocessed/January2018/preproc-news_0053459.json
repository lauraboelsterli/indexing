    "text": "KFAR SAVA, Israel, Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Silicom Ltd. (NASDAQ: SILC), a leading provider of high-performance networking and data infrastructure solutions, today reported all-time record revenues and net profit for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results\nFourth Quarter: Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 totalled $37.8 million, Silicom's highest-ever revenues for a quarterly period. This is up 33% compared with $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and up 17% compared sequentially with Q3 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter totalled $10.3 million, or $1.34 per diluted share ($1.37 per basic share), compared with $4.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share ($0.61 per basic share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis (as described and reconciled below), net income for the quarter totalled $6.9 million, or $0.89 per diluted share ($0.91 per basic share), up 39% compared with $4.9 million, or $0.66 per diluted share ($0.67 per basic share), for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year: For the full year 2017, Silicom's revenues totalled a record $125.7 million, up 25% compared with $100.3 million in 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the year totalled $21.7 million, or $2.86 per diluted share ($2.91 per basic share), compared with $13.1 million, or $1.77 per diluted share ($1.79 per basic share), in 2016. On a non-GAAP basis (as described and reconciled below), net income for the year totalled $21.7 million, or $2.85 per diluted share ($2.91 per basic share), up 31% compared with $16.6 million, or $2.24 per diluted share ($2.26 per basic share), for 2016.\nComments of Management\n\"The fourth quarter was an exceptionally strong end to our best year yet,\" commented Mr. Shaike Orbach, Silicom's President & CEO. \"Our business is being driven by today's massive infrastructure transition. Cloud & Web 2.0 companies, telcos, service providers and end-users are all scrambling to keep up with the data-avalanche, and recognize that our products can give them a significant performance and functionality edge.\n\"For example, we are proud to have been chosen by one of the Cloud industry's leading innovators to design and supply its next-generation Switch-Fabric-on-a-NIC product, a revolutionary concept that could, once it reaches a steady state, give us revenues of up to $75 million per year. In parallel, we continue to secure important new design wins for our cyber security, SD-WAN, NFV, fintech and other Cloud solutions, from both new and existing customers.\"\nMr. Orbach concluded, \"With so many of these trends at an early stage, we feel exceptionally well positioned and are very excited about our growth prospects. Our strategy is straightforward: we will continue expanding our penetration into the Cloud, move deeper into SD-WAN and NFV markets, grow our business with existing customers and sell to a widening circle of new customers. Building up from the best year in our history, and with market trends in our favor, the future has never been brighter for Silicom.\"\nConference Call Details\nSilicom's Management will host an interactive conference today, January 29 th , at 9am Eastern Time (6am Pacific Time, 4pm Israel Time) to review and discuss the results.
