    "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan. 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Magyar Bancorp (NASDAQ: MGYR) (\"Company\"), parent company of Magyar Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company reported net income of $329,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $347,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nPre-tax earnings increased 52% to $893,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $587,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net income declined year-over-year due to higher income tax expense from the Company's write-down of its deferred tax asset resulting from the lower corporate tax rate imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were $0.06 for both the three months ended December 31, 2017 and the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n\"We are pleased to start our new fiscal year off with strong results,\" stated John Fitzgerald, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Total non-performing assets declined 10% on a linked quarter basis, and our net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 3.44% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 3.30% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Smart loan growth combined with the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in 2017 resulted in a significant increase in our pre-tax earnings for this quarter. As we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year, we expect the combination of prudent loan growth, further improvement in our balance sheet and the lower corporate tax rate to continue our positive earnings momentum.\nAbout Magyar Bancorp\nMagyar Bancorp is the parent company of Magyar Bank, a community bank headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
