REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton \nModi has invited the leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations to join him for India’s Republic Day celebrations on Friday in the biggest ever gathering of foreign leaders at the parade, which showcases the country’s military might and cultural diversity. \nThe leaders attending the summit in New Delhi include Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Slideshow (5 Images) \nNew Delhi’s push to expand economic ties with southeast Asia still trail those of China, whose trade with ASEAN was more than six times greater than India’s in 2016-17 at $470 million. \nChina has in recent years also built ports and power plants in countries around India’s periphery, expanding its presence in South Asia and pushing New Delhi to seek new allies. \nModi said he would work towards strengthening relations with ASEAN countries, saying trade had already grown “25 times in 25 years”. \n“Investments are robust and growing. We will further enhance trade ties and work towards greater interaction among our business communities,” Modi said. Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Gareth Jones",
