COSCO Shipping has also previously sailed vessels through the Arctic’s northeast passage. \nChina’s increasing prominence in the region has prompted concerns from Arctic states over its long-term strategic objectives, including possible military deployment. \n“Some people may have misgivings over our participation in the development of the Arctic, worried we may have other intentions, or that we may plunder resources or damage the environment,” Vice-Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said at a briefing. \n“I believe these kinds of concerns are absolutely unnecessary.” ",
