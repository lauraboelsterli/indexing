    "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regional Management Corp. (NYSE:RM), a diversified consumer finance company, today announced the appointments of Maria Contreras-Sweet and Jonathan D. Brown to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Ms. Contreras-Sweet was formerly the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) from April 2014 until January 2017. Mr. Brown is a senior analyst with Basswood Capital Management, LLC, an alternative asset manager with over $1.4 billion of assets under management.\nMs. Contreras-Sweet’s and Mr. Brown’s appointments expand the size of Regional Management’s Board of Directors from six directors to eight directors. Ms. Contreras-Sweet brings to the Board extensive experience in finance, entrepreneurship, and innovation in both the public and private sectors and, equally important, a genuine passion for the market that Regional Management serves. Mr. Brown brings to the Board significant insight and expertise related to the financial services sector.\n“After conducting a comprehensive search, we are excited to have Maria and Jon join our Board of Directors,” said Roel C. Campos, Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Regional Management’s Board of Directors. “Maria’s addition allows us to tap into her vast wealth of knowledge gained from over 35 years of public and private sector service, as well as her deep financial, banking, and entrepreneurial expertise, while Jon brings to bear his substantial financial experience and the long-term support of our largest shareholder. Their appointments further strengthen and complement the Board’s deep experience. We believe that Maria’s insight and expansive professional and business network and Jon’s comprehensive analyst experience and familiarity with the broader financial services industry will provide considerable value to the Board and Regional as we continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy.”\nPrior to heading the SBA, Ms. Contreras-Sweet was a founder of ProAmerica Bank, which funds small and medium-sized businesses in Southern California, and served as Executive Chairwoman from 2006 to 2014. Before helping to establish ProAmerica Bank, she was Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Fortius Holdings from 2003 to 2006. Prior to that, she served as Secretary of California’s Business, Transportation and Housing Agency from 1999 to 2003. While in that role, she was also appointed chair to the finance committee of CA-ISO (California Independent System Operator) to help solve the state’s 2000-2001 energy crisis. Ms. Contreras-Sweet also previously held various executive positions at Westinghouse Electric Company’s 7-Up/RC Bottling Company. She is a current member of the board of directors of Sempra Energy, serving on its Audit Committee.\n“I am pleased to be joining the Board of Regional Management at such a pivotal time in the Company’s history,” stated Ms. Contreras-Sweet. “This is a lender whose mission I value and whose market has always had great meaning for me.”\nPrior to joining Basswood in 2009, Mr. Brown worked at Sandelman Partners and Goldman Sachs. Mr. Brown graduated from Emory University’s Goizueta School of Business with a B.B.A., holding dual concentrations in Finance and Strategy & Management Consulting, as well as a minor in History.\n“I am thrilled to join Regional Management’s outstanding Board,” said Mr. Brown. “Regional has made great strides over the past few years thanks to its Board, management, and entire team, and I believe, thanks to its current strategic direction, that its best days remain ahead.”\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain various “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which represent Regional Management Corp.’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events.
