REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo \nBDI President Dieter Kempf said, according to the text of a speech he was due to give, that the main risks for Europe’s largest economy emanated from abroad. \nThese included Britain’s looming departure from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax reform - which slashes the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Kempf said that would “massively” increase tax competition. Reporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Madeline Chambers",
