    "text": " 17 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago Energy group Total to strengthen Gulf of Mexico presence with Samson deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - French oil and gas company Total has agreed to buy Samson Offshore Anchor LLC, in a deal which Total said would strengthen its presence in the Gulf of Mexico region. \nSamson Offshore Anchor LLC holds a 12.5 percent interest in four blocks covering the Anchor discovery, one of the most significant recent discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), USA. \nTotal said the deal also includes a 12.5 percent interest in the nearby exploration block Green Canyon 761, where Total already has a 25 percent interest. \n“The entry in the Anchor discovery further increases Total’s footprint in deepwater Gulf of Mexico,” said Arnaud Breuillac, President Exploration & Production at Total, in a statement. \nThe Anchor site is operated by Chevron, which has a 55 percent stake, and Cobalt and Venari which have respective stakes of 20 percent and 12.5 percent.
