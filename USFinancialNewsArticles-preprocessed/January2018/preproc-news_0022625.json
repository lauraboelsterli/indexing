    "text": "Reuters Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told lawmakers Trump used ‘tough language’ in immigration meeting \nThe White House said Tuesday that the current immigration system poses security risks to the U.S., as lawmakers returned to Washington to restart negotiations on immigration and government spending following the holiday weekend. \nA possible government shutdown looms at week’s end, when the current spending resolution runs out. Several Democrats have said they would withhold support for any funding deal that doesn’t also protect from deportation young immigrants dubbed Dreamers. \nCongressional aides say they are expecting another short-term deal, which would fund the government for a few weeks at current levels, to come to the table, but they caution that is by no means guaranteed. Aides said the prospects for any immigration deal had diminished after senators last week said President Donald Trump told lawmakers in a meeting that he wanted to stop immigration from “shithole countries.” \nTrump has denied having said that. Under questioning from several Senate Democrats at a hearing on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she didn’t hear the president use that term in the meeting, saying only that he used “tough language.”",
