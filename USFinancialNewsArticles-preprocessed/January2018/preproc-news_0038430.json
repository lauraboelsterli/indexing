    "text": "CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Power management company Eaton has been named among America’s best employers for diversity by Forbes magazine.\n“We are very pleased to be recognized for the progress we’ve made on our inclusion and diversity journey and we’re committed to getting better every day,” said Cathy Medeiros, vice president, Global Inclusion and Diversity, Eaton. “It’s important to our organization that all employees experience a culture of inclusion where everyone’s uniqueness is appreciated and there is a sense of belonging that allows everyone to contribute their best.”\nThe ranking was compiled by asking a sampling of 30,000 U.S. employees to evaluate their employers on issues of diversity in the workplace. Participation in the survey was voluntary, and respondents were recruited from thousands of sources to maximize reach and representation of the U.S. workforce. A company’s score is determined by three parts, direct employee recommendations, a public perception score and an index of objective and publicly available diversity key performance indicators.\nEaton is a power management company with 2016 sales of $19.7 billion. We provide energy-efficient solutions that help our customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more efficiently, safely and sustainably. Eaton is dedicated to improving the quality of life and the environment through the use of power management technologies and services. Eaton has approximately 96,000 employees and sells products to customers in more than 175 countries.
