    "text": "NASA’s plan to routinely ferry astronauts into orbit using private spacecraft—initially slated to start last year—has now slipped until at least the spring of 2019, and unresolved hazards threaten further delays.\n\nNew questions about the high-profile program, known as commercial crew transportation, emerged Thursday, with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s top outside safety panel flagging persistent dangers. Under the program, NASA would rely on capsules developed and operated on a commercial basis by Boeing... RELATED VIDEO Tackling Space Junk With a High-Tech Harpoon and Net Space has a junk problem. ​Roughly 100 million pieces of debris larger than a millimeter -- ranging from defunct satellites to astronauts' gloves -- are orbiting the Earth. But the U.K.’s Surrey Space Centre is sending into space RemoveDebris, a device which will test what it hopes is a cost-effective solution for the removal of space junk. WSJ’s Dipti Kapadia reports.
