Organic sales in emerging markets grew 5.9 percent while in mature markets they were roughly unchanged.\nExecutives warned analysts on a conference call that Essity expects significantly higher raw material costs again in the first quarter, and that although it anticipates pushing through price hikes this year, the effects will show only gradually from the second quarter.\nThe group proposed a 2017 dividend of 5.75 crowns per share, broadly meeting expectations.\n$1 = 7.9024 Swedish crowns Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; Editing by Niklas Pollard and Mark Potter\n ",
