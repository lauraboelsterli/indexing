Liquidity is also very strong and is equally driving markets,” said Anita Gandhi, whole-time director at Arihant Capital Markets.\nThe data on Friday has given comfort that industrial production is improving substantially, she said.\nThe broader NSE index, which breached the 10,700 level for the first time ever, was up 0.86 percent at 10,773.45 as of 0541 GMT. The benchmark BSE index was 1 percent higher at 34,937.15.\nBoth the indexes were on track to post their third session of gains.\nThe Nifty private bank index rose as much as 1.3 percent to hit an all-time high.\nICICI Bank Ltd climbed as much as 4.1 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the stock.\n“Structurally, we like Indian financials, primarily private lenders, given growth outlook,” said Morgan Stanley analysts in note.\nOther private lenders also rose, with HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd gaining more than 1 percent each.\nNon-bank lender Capital First Ltd surged as much as 7.7 percent to its highest since Feb 2008 after IDFC Bank said it would buy the company in a share swap deal valued at about $1.5 billion.\nReporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ",
