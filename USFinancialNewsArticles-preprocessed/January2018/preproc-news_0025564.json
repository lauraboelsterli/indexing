    "text": "MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is considering a secondary share offering in Detsky Mir retailer, RDIFâ€™s president, Kirill Dmitriev, said on Tuesday.\nThe Sistema conglomerate has put up two of its assets, toy retailer Detsky Mir and the Bashkirian Power Grid Company, as collateral against a RDIF loan.\nDmitriev said there has been no talks about taking Detsky Mir under its control, as various sources said last week.
