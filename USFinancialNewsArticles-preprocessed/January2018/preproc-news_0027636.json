    "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) today reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $614 million. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.77 for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 16.1 percent annualized from $0.74 last quarter.\nExcluding pre-tax merger-related and restructuring charges of $22 million ($14 million after-tax) and adjustments related to tax reform that resulted in a net after-tax expense of $43 million, net income available to common shareholders was a record $671 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, up 30.5 percent annualized from $0.78 last quarter.\nNet income available to common shareholders was $597 million ($0.74 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2017 and $592 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year, net income available to common shareholders was $2.2 billion, or $2.74 per diluted share.

King. \"Taxable-equivalent revenues were $2.9 billion, up 7.4 percent annualized compared to last quarter. We expect to have strong revenue growth in 2018.\n\"Total expenses for the quarter were $1.9 billion and our GAAP efficiency was 64.7 percent, primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with the passage of tax reform,\" King said. \"Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 57.2 percent reflects significant progress in our optimization efforts.\n\"While average total loans were essentially flat compared with last quarter, core loans increased an annualized 3.9 percent, which excludes prime auto, residential mortgage and PCI loans that decreased as planned,\" said King. \"Our credit quality is very strong, as nonperforming assets improved and loans 90 days or more past due and net charge-offs were relatively stable at very low levels.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Performance Highlights\nTaxable-equivalent revenues were a record $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up $53 million from the third quarter of 2017 Net interest margin was 3.43 percent, down five basis points Noninterest income was up $59 million driven by higher insurance and other income Fee income ratio was 42.7 percent, compared to 41.4 percent for the prior quarter Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, up $110 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 Noninterest expense was essentially flat excluding tax reform investments and merger-related and restructuring charges GAAP efficiency ratio was 64.7 percent, compared to 62.0 percent for the prior quarter Adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.2 percent, compared to 58.3 percent for the prior quarter Tax reform and related actions resulted in a net after-tax expense of $43 million or $0.05 per share Revaluation of deferred taxes and investments in affordable housing projects resulted in a net tax benefit of $43 million One-time bonus paid to associates who do not generally receive incentives or commissions of $36 million ($23 million after-tax) Contribution to BB&T's philanthropic fund of $100 million ($63 million after-tax) Increased the minimum hourly pay rate from $12 to $15 per hour, effective January 1, 2018 Average loans and leases held for investment were $142.7 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2017 Average commercial and industrial loans increased $267 million, or 1.8 percent annualized Average CRE loans increased $222 million, or 4.2 percent annualized Average lease financing increased $119 million, or 27.3 percent annualized Average residential mortgage loans decreased $365 million, or 5.0 percent annualized Average indirect loans decreased $252 million, or 5.7 percent annualized Average deposits were $158.0 billion compared to $157.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017 Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $799 million, or 5.9 percent annualized Deposit mix strengthened, with average noninterest-bearing deposits representing 34.4 percent of total deposits, compared to 34.0 percent in the prior quarter Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $254 million and costs were 0.40 percent, up five basis points compared to the prior quarter Asset quality continues to improve from the prior quarter Nonperforming loans were 0.40 percent of loans held for investment, down two basis points Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing were 0.38 percent of loans held for investment, compared to 0.35 percent in the prior quarter The allowance for loan loss coverage ratio was 2.62 times nonperforming loans held for investment, versus 2.44 times in the prior quarter The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.04 percent of loans held for investment, unchanged Capital levels remained strong across the board Common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets was 10.0 percent Tier 1 risk-based capital was 11.8 percent Total capital was 13.8 percent Leverage capital was 9.7 percent\nEARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nChange 4Q17 vs.\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n3Q17\n4Q16\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n614\n$\n597\n$\n592\n$\n17\n$\n22\nDiluted earnings per common share\n0.77\n0.74\n0.72\n0.03\n0.05\nNet interest income -
