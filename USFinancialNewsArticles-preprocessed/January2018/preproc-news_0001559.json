FILE PHOTO: An Air Berlin sign is seen at an Air Berlin storage hall in Berlin, Germany, August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt \nThomas Cook said the acquisition would give its airline Condor further options for growth, consistent with its plans to grow capacity in the German market to meet increased demand experienced in recent months. \nNeither company said how much Thomas Cook was paying, but a person familiar with the deal said the purchase price was a medium single-digit million euro amount. \nAir Berlin, which filed for insolvency in August, has already sold major parts of its assets to German flagship carrier Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and Britainâ€™s easyJet ( EZJ.L ).
