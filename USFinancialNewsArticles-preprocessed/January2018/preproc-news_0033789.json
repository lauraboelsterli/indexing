He added that he had spoken with his Turkish counterpart on Sunday morning.\nTurkish ground forces pushed into northern Syria’s Afrin province on Sunday, the army said, after Turkey launched artillery and air strikes on a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia it aims to sweep from its border.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
