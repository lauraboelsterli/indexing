    "text": "January 1, 2018 / 9:33 AM / Updated an hour ago Zaha says to stay at Palace despite Man City, Chelsea links Reuters Staff 1   Crystal Palace striker Wilfried Zaha has said he has no intention of leaving the London club in the January transfer window, dampening the hopes of potential suitors in the Premier League. Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Manchester City - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - December 31, 2017 Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha REUTERS/David Klein \nZaha has had a productive season with 17th-placed Palace, scoring four league goals and providing an assist while adding energy and dynamism to their attack. \nAccording to British media reports, the Ivory Coast international, who had an unsuccessful spell at Manchester United, has come under the radar of Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal. \nAsked if he is staying at Crystal Palace following their goalless draw with league leaders City, Zaha told BBC Sport: “Yep, I am.” \nPalace boss Roy Hodgson said last week he could not guarantee that Zaha would stay beyond the January transfer window but British media reports said the manager has been assured by the owners and chairman Steve Parish that no deal would take place.
