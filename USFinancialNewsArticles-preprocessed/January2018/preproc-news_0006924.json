    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pareteum Corporation (NYSE American: TEUM), the rapidly growing Cloud Communications Platform company, today announced that the Company expects to report revenues that will exceed consensus analyst expectations of $3.75 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue represents sequential quarterly growth of at least 10% over the $3.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. The Company's fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings results and conference call are expected to be held on or before March 30, 2018.\nDuring the second half of 2017, the Company's 36-month Contractual Revenue Backlog increased from $60,000,000 at the end of the second quarter to $147,000,000 at the end of the fourth quarter. This contractual backlog is generated by each of the Company's Managed Services and Global Cloud customers who have entered into multi-year Software-as-a-Service agreements with Pareteum. These customer agreements consist of guaranteed minimum monthly recurring fees, as well as contractually scheduled subscriber and connections expansion, with their resulting monthly recurring revenue.\n\"Our TEUM ended the 2017 year with a very strong fourth quarter as demonstrated by the acceleration in our 36-month Contractual Revenue Backlog. This key performance indicator is directly correlated to our financial and operating results and reflects the traction our services and solutions are gaining in the marketplace. We continue to solve customer problems by presenting solutions that yield significant operational efficiencies and expense savings, creating faster revenue, while opening new sources of revenue, such as Blockchain and mobile payment solutions, that would have previously required multiple vendors and complex system integrations,\" stated Hal Turner, Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer of Pareteum.\nAbout Pareteum Corporation\nThe mission of Pareteum Corporation (NYSE American: TEUM) is to connect \"every person and everything\".

The Pareteum multi-year Software-as-a-Service agreements include service establishment and implementation fees, guaranteed minimum monthly recurring fees, as well as contractually scheduled subscribers, in some cases including subscriber usage, during the term of the agreement, and, their resulting monthly recurring revenue. There can be no assurances that we reach the total revenue backlog. The revenue backlog assumes timing of revenue recognition that may vary from actual results.\nPareteum Investor Relations Contact:\nTed O'Donnell\nChief Financial Officer\n(212) 984-1096\nInvestorRelations@pareteum.com\nHayden IR\n917-658-7878\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pareteum-expects-q4-2017-revenue-to-exceed-expectations-300578772.html\nSOURCE Pareteum Corporation",
