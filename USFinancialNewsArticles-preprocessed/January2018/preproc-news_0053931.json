    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s specialist Hawks police unit opened a case to investigate Steinhoff in December and has sought the help of Interpol in investigating the troubled company, its spokesman said on Wednesday.\nPolice were yet to question any of Steinhoff’s staff, or visit the company’s offices to carry out investigations, Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi told Reuters.\n“We have written to Interpol seeking assistance in investigating Steinhoff’s activities abroad,” Maulaudzi said.\nSteinhoff said earlier that it had reported its former chief executive Markus Jooste to the Hawks unit over suspected corruption.\nReporting by James Macharia.
