    "text": "BOSTON, Jan. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The three John Hancock closed-end funds listed below declared their monthly distributions today as follows:\nDeclaration Date:\nJanuary 2, 2018\nEx Date:\nJanuary 11, 2018\nRecord Date:\nJanuary 12, 2018\nPayment Date:\nJanuary 31, 2018\nTicker\nFund Name\nDistribution\nPer Share\nChange From\nPrevious\nDistribution\nMarket Price as\nof 12/29/2017\nAnnualized Current\nDistribution Rate at\nMarket\nHPI\nPreferred Income Fund\n$0.1400\n-\n$21.42\n7.84%\nHPF\nPreferred Income Fund II\n$0.1400\n-\n$21.49\n7.82%\nHPS\nPreferred Income Fund III\n$0.1222\n-\n$18.75\n7.82%\nA portion of a Fund's current distribution may include sources other than net investment income, including a return of capital. Investors should understand that a return of capital is not a distribution from income or gains of a Fund. As required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice with the estimated components of the distribution will be sent to shareholders at the time of payment if it does not consist solely of net investment income. Such notice will also be posted to the Funds' website at www.jhinvestments.com . The notice should not be used to prepare tax returns as the estimates indicated in the notice may differ from the ultimate federal income tax characterization of distributions. After the end of each calendar year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV informing them how to report distributions received during that year for federal income tax purposes.\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Fund's control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nAn investor should consider a Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.\nAbout John Hancock Investments\nJohn Hancock Investments provides asset management services to individuals and institutions through a unique manager-of-managers approach.
