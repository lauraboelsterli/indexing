    "text": "President Donald Trump is tweeting about missing text messages involving an FBI agent reassigned from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. But he's overstating the number of missing texts.\nTrump on Tuesday called news the FBI was missing five months' worth of texts from the agent, Peter Strzok, \"one of the biggest stories in a long time.\" Strzok was removed from Mueller's team following the discovery of anti-Trump text messages exchanged with an FBI lawyer.\nTrump suggested incorrectly the number of missing messages was \"perhaps 50,000.\" The Justice Department says that's the overall number of messages found on FBI servers.\nTrump tweet\nThe FBI says a technical system glitch caused messages between December 2016 and May 2017 to not have been properly stored.\nThe Justice Department is seeking to recover the messages.",
