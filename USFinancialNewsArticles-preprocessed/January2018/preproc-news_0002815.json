    "text": "One of North Korea's test ballistic missiles last year crashed in a city not far from Pyongyang, according to new findings by online news magazine The Diplomat. \nIn April, Pyongyang launched a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile that failed shortly after launch and ended up hitting the city of Tokchon, roughly two hours from the capital, The Diplomat reported on Wednesday.\nThe missile's failure was widely reported at the time but it was not previously known that the Hwasong-12 crashed in a populated area.\nFrom a location near North Korea's Pukchang Airfield, the missile flew approximately 39 kilometers (24 miles) to the northeast where it struck a complex of industrial or agricultural facilities in Tokchon, The Diplomat said, citing satellite imagery. That complex, located near residential and commercial buildings, likely experienced a large explosion but The Diplomat said it was impossible to determine whether there were casualties.\nThe prospect of nuclear war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula dominated global headlines for the last year, but many analysts believe the risk of a nuclear accident could be an even greater threat amid Pyongyang's lax safety regulations.\nRead The Diplomat's story for more details about the crash. \nWATCH: Bitcoin mining — a new way for North Korea to make money show chapters Bitcoin mining — a new way for North Korea to make money      9:37 AM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 | 03:43",
