    "text": "Jan 29 (Reuters) - Italian eyewear group Safilo said its 2017 adjusted core profit was set to halve from a year earlier after fourth-quarter sales dropped more than expected as the loss of its license for the Gucci brand continued to bite.\nFrench luxury goods group Kering <PRTP.PA, which owns Gucci, has turned a 350 million-euro Gucci license with Safilo into a four-year production deal as it set up its own eyewear business to better control distribution and pocket rich profit margins.\nThe owner of the Carrera and Polaroid brands reported net sales in the fourth quarter of 249 million euros, down 16.9 percent from a year earlier at constant currencies.\nSafilo sees full year adjusted earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and depreciation (EBITDA) in the range of 38-40 million euros, down from 88.8 million euros last year.\nFull year sales totalled 1.05 billion euros, a fall of 15.5 percent from 2016, as the Gucci’s loss was compounded by an IT-related disruption in deliveries at Safilo’s main distribution centre in Padua, Italy, and hurricanes in the United States.\nWhen factoring in currency swings full-year sales were down 16.4 percent.\nAnalysts in a Thomson Reuters Poll had forecast on average full-year revenues of 1.08 billion euros.
