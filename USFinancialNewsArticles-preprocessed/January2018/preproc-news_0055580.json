    "text": "South Korea says it uncovered about $600 million in cryptocurrency crimes Asia's fourth-largest economy says it detected cryptocurrency crimes worth a total of $594.35 million Published 11 Hours Ago Reuters Dan Kitwood | Getty Images \nSouth Korea has uncovered cryptocurrency crimes worth 637.5 billion won ($594.35 million), which includes illegal foreign exchange trading, a statement released by the country's customs service said on Wednesday. \nThe statement said domestic investors bought 1.7 billion won worth of cryptocurrencies, which they sent to overseas partner companies through virtual wallets. The transfers were then converted back into fiat currencies, which amount to unrecorded capital outflows. \nThe customs office added that it would continue to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies in cases like illegal currency trading or money laundering.",
