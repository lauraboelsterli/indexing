Excludes custom smelting at Copper India and Zinc India operations\n2. Exceptional Items Gross of Tax\n3. In view of clarification issued by Ind AS Transition Facilitation Group, the Group has revised the accounting for dividend distribution tax (DDT) on profits of subsidiaries. DDT on profits of subsidiaries which is to be utilized against the equity dividend declared by the Company is recognised in statement of changes in equity as against the previous policy of recognizing the same in the statement of profit and loss. The financial results for the previous periods/year have been restated to give effect of the same\n4. Previous period figures have been regrouped or re-arranged wherever necessary to conform to the current period's presentation\nRevenues\nRevenue for Q3 FY2018 was up 19% y-o-y, on account of ramp-up at Aluminium business, higher volumes at Zinc International, record plant availability at TSPL and higher commodity prices, partially offset by currency appreciation and lower sales at Iron Ore and Copper India.\nRevenues were up 13% sequentially, on account of ramp up at Aluminium business, resumption of operations post-monsoon at Iron Ore, record plant availability at TSPL, higher volumes at Zinc India and Zinc International, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by lower sales at Copper India.\nEBITDA and EBITDA Margins\nEBITDA for Q3 at Rs 6,780 crore, was up 13% y-o-y, on account of higher commodity prices, ramp-up at Aluminium business, record plant availability at TSPL and higher volumes at Zinc International. This was partially offset by higher costs due to input commodity inflation, currency appreciation, one-off costs on account of power import and pot outage earlier in the year at Aluminium business, and lower sales at Iron ore and Copper India.\nOn a sequential basis, EBITDA was up 17% on account of higher volumes at Zinc India, Zinc International, ramp up at Aluminium business, resumption of operations post-monsoon at Iron Ore, record plant availability at TSPL, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs due to input commodity inflation.\nEBITDA margin [1] remained robust at 35% for the quarter.\nDepreciation & Amortization\nDepreciation at Rs. 1,549 crore was lower on a y-o-y basis by Rs. 32 crore, driven by lower depreciation at Oil & Gas business. This was due to the change in method of calculation of Unit of production (UOP) charge to \"Proved and Developed Oil and Gas Reserves\" (1P) in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities, which was effective April 1, 2017, compared to the earlier approach of \"Proved and Probable Reserves\" (2P). This was partially offset by capitalization of pots at Aluminium business.\nDepreciation was higher by Rs. 123 crore q-o-q due to higher production at Zinc India and Iron Ore, and capitalization of new infill wells at Mangala in the O&G business.\nFinance Cost and Other Income\nFinance cost during the quarter was Rs. 1,306 crore, lower by Rs. 202 crore on a y-o-y basis, on account of de-leveraging during the financial year and lower interest rates, partially offset by dividends on preference shares issued to the shareholders of Cairn India pursuant to the merger with the Company in April, and capitalization of pots at Aluminium business. On a sequential basis, finance cost was lower by Rs. 121 Crore on account of deleveraging in Q2 FY 18.\nOther Income was at Rs. 573 crore, lower on a q-o-q basis by Rs. 346 crore, mainly on account of lower investment corpus at Zinc India and lower return on investments due to sharp rise in G-Sec yields resulting in mark-to-market losses on investments.\nOn a y-o-y basis, Other Income was lower by Rs. 441 crores mainly on account of lower investment corpus due to special dividend pay-out by Zinc India of Rs. 13,985 crores (including DDT) in March-April 2017, deleveraging, and mark-to-market losses on investments due to a sharp rise in G-Sec yields.\nExceptional Items\nExceptional Items comprises a one-time charge of Rs. 158 crore in Q3 FY 2018 relating to arbitration of a historical vendor claim in the aluminium business and acquisition related cost of ASI.\nTaxes\nTax expense (before exceptional items) was at Rs. 1,402 crore during the quarter, resulting in a tax rate of 31%. This was higher q-o-q mainly on account of change in profit mix.\nTax rate during the quarter is higher y-o-y on account of phasing out of investment allowance claims allowed till FY 17 and change in profit mix.\nAttributable Profit After Tax and Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nAttributable Profit After Tax (PAT) before exceptional items for the quarter was Rs. 2,173 crore. Minority interest was at 29%.\nEPS for the quarter before exceptional items was at Rs. 5.86 per share.\nBalance Sheet\nOur financial position remains strong with cash and liquid investments of Rs. 38,923 crore. The Company follows a Board-approved investment policy and invests in high quality debt instruments with mutual funds, bonds and fixed deposits with banks. The portfolio is rated by CRISIL, which has assigned a rating of \"Very Good\" (implying Highest Safety) to our portfolio. Further, the Company has undrawn committed facilities of Rs.3,800 crores as on December 31, 2017.\nGross debt was at Rs. 55,218 crore on December 31, 2017, including Preference shares of Rs 3,010 crore issued pursuant to the Cairn merger and Rs. 946 crore pursuant to acquisition of AvanStrate Inc. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, gross debt reduced by Rs. 11,450 Crores (excluding repayment of Rs. 7,908 crores temporary borrowing by Zinc India and preference shares issued pursuant to the Cairn merger).\nNet debt was at Rs. 16,295 crore on 31 st December, higher q-o-q on account of acquisition of AvanStrate Inc., partially offset by strong free cash flow generation during the quarter.\nKey Recognitions\nVedanta has been consistently recognized through the receipt of various awards and accolades.

In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"should\" or \"will.\" Forward–looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, uncertainties arise from the behaviour of financial and metals markets including the London Metal Exchange, fluctuations in interest and or exchange rates and metal prices; from future integration of acquired businesses; and from numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive or regulatory nature.
