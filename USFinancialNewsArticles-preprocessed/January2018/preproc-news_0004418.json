Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Manchester City - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - December 31, 2017 Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus goes off injured REUTERS/David Klein \nCity said on their website that Jesus had “suffered a medial collateral ligament injury” and will have further examinations this week to establish the extent of his lay-off. \nCity manager Pep Guardiola said immediately after the match that Jesus would “be out for a little bit more than one month.” \nThe 20-year-old forward left the Selhurst Park pitch in tears after landing awkwardly during the first half and had to be consoled by his club’s medical staff. \n“Today I went through an image exam on my left knee that diagnosed a small medial collateral ligament injury,” Jesus wrote on Instagram on Monday. \n“Thank God it is not very bad and I won’t have to go through any surgery procedure. Promise to be back as soon as possible.” \nCity are 12 points clear at the top of the table before facing mid-table Watford at home on Tuesday. Writing by Ken Ferris; Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
