Slideshow (10 Images) \nThe Seine’s overflowing waters have already engulfed riverside walkways in Paris and led the Louvre museum to close a basement display of Islamic art. \nIt has also resulted in the famous “Bateaux Mouches” tourist boats being shut down due to the high waters, swans swimming in places where there are usually pavements, and even rats being forced onto the streets of Paris due to the flood. \nFlooding caused destruction in Paris in 1910 when the Seine rose by 8.65 meters.
