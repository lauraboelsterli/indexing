That vision hasn’t changed, and I am thrilled to be able to help High Road continue to evolve and succeed.”\nOther team member announcements include:\nOwens Corning and Danaher senior finance leader Joel Johnson as Director of Finance and Controller.

This value equation, along with other mindset shifts, creates an interesting dynamic for the food industry and beyond.”\n“For us, it means remaining true to our core values and culinary approach,” remarked Keith. “We place a strong emphasis on quality by making everything from scratch and will without a doubt continue to do so. At the same time, our scale and increasingly mature manufacturing processes allow us to deliver quality products at a fair price. We’re adding new sales channels, new product lines, and most excitingly, new team members. We are excited about 2018 and what’s to come.”\nAbout High Road Craft Ice Cream, Inc.:\nFounded in 2010, High Road Craft Ice Cream is America’s fastest growing independent ice cream manufacturer.
