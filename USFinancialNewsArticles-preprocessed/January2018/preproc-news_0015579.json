    "text": "NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The CBOE/CBOT 10-year U.S. Treasury note volatility index rose to its highest level in almost a month on Wednesday, as a Bloomberg report that China might pare or stop its purchases of U.S. government debt knocked 10-year T-note futures to their lowest levels in more than nine months.\nThe index, which measures the expected 30-day volatility of CBOT 10-year Treasury futures, reached 4.11 earlier Wednesday, which was the highest level since Dec. 13. At 9:53 a.m. (1453 GMT), it was 3.94, up 4 percent from Tuesdayâ€™s close. (Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
