    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ForgeRock®, the leading platform provider of digital identity management solutions, today announced the appointment of Peter Barker as chief product officer. Barker joins ForgeRock from Oracle, where he served as senior vice president and general manager of the Identity Management and Security business. Barker is based in Austin, Texas and will report to John Fernandez, ForgeRock’s interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer.\nForgeRock's New Chief Product Officer\nAs chief product officer, Barker will be responsible for driving ForgeRock’s global product vision, design and development, and he will lead product management and all of engineering. At Oracle, Barker was responsible for the Identity Management and Security software business and transformed the products and organization to a cloud model, which was key to accelerating growth in the business.\n“This is a really important executive hire for ForgeRock. With Peter shepherding our strategy and providing additional leadership to the great product and engineering teams we already have - I am even more excited for the road ahead,” said John Fernandez. “Chief product officer is a new position for our company, and we could not have found a better person.”\nBarker joins ForgeRock at a time of substantial growth.

I’m passionate about this space, and thrilled to join the team.”\nIdentity Live and UnSummit Events Rock on in 2018\nForgeRock is pleased to continue its highly popular Identity Live and technical UnSummit series, with events in 2018 planned for Austin, Texas; Berlin; Sydney; Singapore; London and Paris.
