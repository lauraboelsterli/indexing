    "text": "GRAINS-Soybeans extend losses into third session as ample supplies weigh Published 8 Mins Ago Reuters SHARES \nSYDNEY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. soybeans edged lower on Wednesday to extend losses into a third straight session as ample global supplies weighed on prices. \nFUNDAMENTALS \n* The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were down 0.1 percent at $9.62-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.3 percent on Wednesday. \n* The most active wheat futures were unchanged at $4.32-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 1 percent on Tuesday. \n* The most active corn futures were unchanged at $3.49 a bushel, having gained 0.5 percent in the previous session. \n* Soybeans were under pressure from abundant global supplies, although the market is concerned about the impact of adverse weather in Argentina. \n* The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday is expected to show smaller U.S. winter wheat seedings, in the agency's first forecast for 2018. \n* The state grain buying agency for top global wheat importer Egypt said it purchased 115,000 tonnes of Russian wheat in a tender. The agency initially received no offers, and then offers for wheat at prices higher than Egypt's last wheat tender in December. \n* Warmer temperatures this week in the U.S. Plains alleviated some concerns that dormant winter wheat plants could be damaged. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar edged up in early Asian trade on Wednesday, bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields but still constrained against the yen after the Bank of Japan's move to trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds triggered tapering fears. \n* Oil prices hit their highest levels since 2014 on Wednesday due to ongoing production cuts led by OPEC as well as healthy demand, although analysts cautioned that markets may be overheating. \n* Wall Street's major indexes extended the New Year rally to close at record levels on Tuesday on investor optimism ahead of quarterly earnings reports and hopes for easing tensions with North Korea. \nDATA/EVENTS (GMT) \n1330 U.S. Import, Export Prices Dec \nGrains prices at 0151 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 432.25 0.00 +0.00% +1.05% 426.45 58 CBOT corn 349.00 0.00 +0.00% +0.50% 351.13 47 CBOT soy 962.50 -1.25 -0.13% -0.44% 981.65 43 CBOT rice 11.90 -$0.05 -0.42% +0.04% $12.15 51 WTI crude 63.49 $0.53 +0.84% +2.85% $58.84 83 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.194 $0.001 +0.05% -0.20% USD/AUD 0.7817 -0.001 -0.08% -0.29% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
