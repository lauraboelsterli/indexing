However, a significant building and enterprise requirement is a managed fiber offering to enable the communication services throughout the building.

My goal will be to leverage my extensive experience to serve our customer base - including building owners, carriers, and enterprise clients - in the best possible manner while delivering the most innovative, timely, cost-effective and pragmatic in-building communication solution for them.\"\nPrior to joining ExteNet Systems in January 2018, Mr. Spraetz was the EVP of Sales and Marketing for Conterra Broadband, a regional fiber and microwave solutions provider serving wireless, government, enterprise, and wholesale customers.
