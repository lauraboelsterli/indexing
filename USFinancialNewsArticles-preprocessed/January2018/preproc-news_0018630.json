    "text": " 39 PM / in 8 minutes MoneyGram opens office in Brussels   The U.S. money-transfer company MoneyGram International Inc ( MGI.O ) confirmed on Friday that it had opened an office in Brussels and National Bank of Belgium had granted it license as a payment provider. \nThe uncertainty regarding Britain’s decision to leave the European Union led MoneyGram, whose European headquarters is in London, to look at different options to ensure its business was not disrupted, MoneyGram said. \nMoneyGram also said it would remain registered with UK’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and continue operations in Britain. \nThe Telegraph reported on Thursday that MoneyGram was moving its European headquarters out of London to Brussels. bit.ly/2r0S2gL Reporting by Bhanu Pratap in Bengaluru, editing by Larry King",
