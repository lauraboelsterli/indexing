Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net\nWANTED: “HEALTHY PULLBACK” (0630 GMT)\nJust spotted an interesting Quote: in Chuck Mikolajczak’s Wall Street report which highlights the fact that the continuous rise of markets is actually making some investors so nervous that a slight correction would be greeted with relief.\n“The trend is higher and it is so universally, and with such conviction believed that any meaningful pullback is going to be aborted because investors simply don’t want to miss out,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.\n“So we are not seeing that healthy pullback that most investors would actually welcome.”\n(Julien Ponthus)",
