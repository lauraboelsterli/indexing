With the dollar at around 110.80 yen, I don’t think it is a big deal,” Aso said, when asked about impact of dollar depreciation on Japan and the rest of the world.\n“The biggest problem would be sudden up and down movements in currencies. I don’t see problems as long as currency moves are steady,” he added.\nThe dollar hit a four-month low of 110.58 yen on Monday after Kuroda’s upbeat economic view raised expectations the BOJ could dial back stimulus earlier than expected - a view that heightened after a slight cut in its debt purchases last week.\nDespite speculation about normalisation of monetary policy, Aso urged the central bank to continue its monetary stimulus.\n“The Bank of Japan has been continuing its efforts to defeat deflation and patiently trying to achieve the price stability target under Governor Kuroda, so we appreciate it.”\nEconomy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi stuck to government’s standard line that foreign exchange rates are decided by the market based on various factors, when asked about the recent rise in the yen and whether the Bank of Japan triggered it.\n“I want to closely monitor the impact that moves in foreign exchange and other financial markets have on Japan’s underlying economy,” he said.
