    "text": "NEW YORK, Stribling & Associates is pleased to announce that Jared Seligman, one of New York City's leading real estate professionals, has joined the company. With a vast global network of diverse clientele and profound experience in townhouse, co-op, and condo resales as well as new development marketing, Seligman has handled more than $1 billion in sales on behalf of his clients.\n\"I am grateful to have worked with many wonderful friends, colleagues and mentors throughout my career. I am now thrilled to continue serving my clients through Stribling Private Brokerage and working alongside Elizabeth Stribling, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan and their incredible team, for whom I have the utmost respect,\" said Seligman. \"This strategic move will allow my clients to benefit from the resources and personalized attention offered through a privately-owned brokerage where discretion and unwavering ethics are at the heart of every transaction.
