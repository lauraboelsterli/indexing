FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - Chelsea vs Newcastle United - Stamford Bridge, London, Britain - December 2, 2017 Chelsea's Andreas Christensen in action with Newcastle United's Dwight Gayle REUTERS/David Klein \nThe 21-year-old Denmark international has made 22 appearances for the English champions this term having cemented his place at the heart of Antonio Conte’s three-man defence. \nChristensen returned to Chelsea in the close season after two years on loan at Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Bundesliga. \n“It feels really good to sign a new contract and I’m just happy to be committed to Chelsea for the future. I’ve played a lot of games, I’m enjoying it at the club and everything is working well,” he said on the club website (www.chelseafc.com). \nChristensen helped Denmark qualify for this year’s World Cup by scoring in their 5-1 playoff win over Ireland in November.
