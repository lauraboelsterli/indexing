Hispanic, Asian and African American audiences represent 95 percent of the growth in population and consumer spending,” said Claritas CEO Mike Nazzaro. “Marketers must find ways to connect with these high-growth consumers in relevant ways. The acquisition of Geoscape will deepen Claritas’ consumer insights to help clients gain wider access to multicultural consumer groups.”\nClaritas provides marketers with a comprehensive view into the buying behaviors and media choices of consumers and businesses through proprietary segmentation analysis, powered by unique data sources and direct consumer research.

Paired with Claritas’ PRIZM ® , Nazzaro said, “Claritas will offer the industry’s most comprehensive view of today’s consumers to help marketers maximize ROI.”\nClaritas and Geoscape work with some of the nation’s largest consumer brands, including Wendy’s, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Kroger, Farmers Insurance, Goya, Zions Bank, Bank of the West, Univision, MoneyGram, Nestle, Verizon, Time Warner, AT&T, Valpak, MediaCom and MetroPCS.\n“When I founded Geoscape, I always envisioned creating the industry’s most comprehensive marketing intelligence on international and multicultural audiences,” said Melgoza. “Now, with the combination of Claritas’ incredible customer segmentation depth and capabilities and Geoscape’s multicultural targeting, that vision will become a reality while helping further position clients for growth.”\nClients will realize the benefits of the breadth of both organization’s insights in 2018, Nazzaro said, with future enhancements forthcoming as the two companies integrate.\nTo learn how you can sell smarter and win bigger, visit www.claritas.com .\nAbout Claritas\nFounded in 1971, Claritas provides best-in-class consumer segmentation analysis for improved marketing efficiencies.
