    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 11:02 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Tennis-Cilic tames Edmund to reach first Australian Open final Ian Ransom 1 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A business-like Marin Cilic defused the firepower of Kyle Edmund before crushing the ailing Briton 6-2 7-6(4) 6-2 to reach his first Australian Open final on Thursday. \nThe sixth-seeded Croatian was relentless under the lights at Rod Laver Arena, unleashing a barrage of 32 winners to end the world number 49â€™s dream run with a stinging defeat in two hours and 18 minutes. \nAn agitated Edmund took a medical time-out after losing the first set and hobbled through the latter part of the match before surrendering meekly after a massive serve from the rangy Cilic. \nFormer U.S. Open champion Cilic will meet the winner of Roger Federer and Chung Hyeon for the title.
