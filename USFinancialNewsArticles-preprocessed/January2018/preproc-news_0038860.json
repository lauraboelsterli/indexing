    "text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Neptune Flood, a revolutionary flood insurance provider, announced today that it has secured over $2 Million in seed round funding. The investment was led by Trevor Burgess, the founder and former CEO of C1 Bank, with participation from existing investor and Neptune CEO, Jim Albert. The investment will help the company aggressively expand its sales and marketing efforts nationwide and accelerate the next generation of its data driven, private flood insurance technology. Trevor Burgess and Jonathan Carlon will join Neptune Flood's Board of Directors.\nThe financing builds on a tremendous year for Neptune Flood (Neptune) which saw a rapidly growing roster of distribution partners eager to integrate the newly launched, innovative technology.

Neptune is so easy to Quote: and bind, provides superior coverage, and can often save money for consumers.\"\n\"We are just starting our journey to change the way people think about and buy flood insurance - our data driven approach can help more families protect their homes during a flood event. The financial support and entrepreneurial spirit that Trevor Burgess and his team bring to the table will help us execute our vision in a first-class way,\" said CEO Jim Albert.\nAbout Neptune Flood Inc.\nNeptune Flood utilizes advanced mapping technologies and aerial remote sensing to create sophisticated algorithms for the risk of flooding.
