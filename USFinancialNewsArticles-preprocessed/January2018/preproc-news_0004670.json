(USOTC:DNAD) announces today that its UK Subsidiary, DNA Interactive Games Limited, has closed on their recently announced Bitcoin ATM Patent acquisition as referenced in the OTC Markets supplemental filing available from http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/DNAD/filings\nSuch is the value of the patent, the contract called for a substantial initial down payment and further payments for up to a period of five years, with an option to complete the full transfer of title earlier for a discounted figure.

DNA has begun contacting bitcoin ATM manufacturers and operators and working with them to license the use of the patented technology for ongoing royalty payments.\nCEO Carl Grant summarizes as follows: \"Management has begun exploring strategies to begin creating revenue from our Bitcoin ATM Patent. We plan to explore potential acquisitions of already established ATM distribution companies as part of this strategy. I look forward to keeping our growing shareholder base informed on progress made regarding licensing, royalty revenue and potential acquisitions in the Bitcoin payment processing space in due course.\"\nAbout DNA Dynamics, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Grandville, Michigan, and with operations in the UK, DNA Dynamics' business focuses building a sustainable and stable Crypto-currency ecosystem.\nFor more information please email info@dnadynamicsinc.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including information about management's view of DNA Dynamics, Inc.'s future expectations, plans and prospects.
