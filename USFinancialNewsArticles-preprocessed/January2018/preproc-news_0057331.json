    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A10 Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ATEN) (the \" Company \"), a Secure Application Services™ company, today announced that it is postponing its 2017 fourth quarter and full year earnings announcement and conference call, originally scheduled for Feb. 8, 2018.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that a mid-level employee within its finance department had violated the Company's Insider Trading Policy and Code of Conduct. As a result, the Company, with the assistance of outside counsel, conducted an email review and additional procedures to ensure the accuracy of its reporting of financial information for 2017. Such review and procedures did not identify matters that required material adjustments to be made. Nonetheless, the Company's Audit Committee determined that further review and procedures relating to certain accounting and internal control matters should be undertaken. The Audit Committee's investigation, which is being conducted with the assistance of outside counsel, is principally focused on certain revenue recognition matters from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017 inclusive.\nThe investigation is in its early stages. The Company is not able to provide a date as to when it will be completed, nor provide any assurance that the Company will not determine that material adjustments to its past financial statements are appropriate.\nAt the conclusion of the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company will announce the scheduling of a conference call to discuss full financial results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
