A Peugeot car is seen in the car park of the Vauxhall car plant in Ellesmere Port, Britain, January 10, 2018. REUTERS/Phil Nobl \nPeugeot acquired Vauxhall last year when it bought General Motors’ loss-making European arm and has been pursuing a restructuring plan to return it to profitability, reducing the workforce at its Ellesmere Port plant by a third, sparking fears over the site’s future. \nNorman joined PSA Group in May 2014 as Chief Marketing Officer and was appointed Senior Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer in 2016. \nHe will take on his new role as managing director at Vauxhall in Britain and Opel in Ireland from Feb. 1, succeeding current boss Rory Harvey.
