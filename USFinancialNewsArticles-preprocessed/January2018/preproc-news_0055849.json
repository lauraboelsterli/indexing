Most recently, he was CEO of Autotask Corporation, which has since merged with Datto, a global leader in pure-cloud based solutions for technology service providers. At Autotask, Cattini was responsible for leading the company's dramatic growth and expansion of its global IT business management solutions. Earlier in his career, Cattini was president and CEO of MapInfo Corporation, a publicly traded company and provider of location-based intelligence solutions, integrating software, data and services around the world.

I could not be more excited and fortunate to join ClickSoftware and to have the opportunity to join the field service market leader.\"\nThe appointment of Cattini by ClickSoftware comes at a time when the company is seeing extremely strong market acceptance for Field Service Edge , its cloud-based comprehensive service management solution.\nAbout ClickSoftware\nClickSoftware is a leading provider of field service management software.
