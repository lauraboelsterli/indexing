    "text": "VIENNA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International promoted the markets and investment banking chief of its Polish unit IPO-RBP.WA, Lukasz Januszewski, to lead its overall markets division, its supervisory board said on Monday.\nThe 39-year-old joined Raiffeisen in Poland twenty years ago. “RBI has a leading role in the capital markets business in Austria and (central and Eastern Europe). I would like to further develop this position,” Januszweski said in a statement.\nIn November, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that BNP Paribas has approached RBI to express interest in buying Raiffeisen Bank Polska. Raiffeisen plans to either float of sell a majority stake in its Polish unit. (Reporting by Shadia Nasralla, editing by Louise Heavens)\n ",
