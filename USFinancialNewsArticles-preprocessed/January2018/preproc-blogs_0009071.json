    "text": "AT&T Says It Will Launch 5G in a Dozen Cities This Year Author   \nAT&T t aims to be the first U.S. carrier to provide fifth-generation, or 5G mobile service to phone customers this year, pitting the wireless giant against Verizon Communications vz and T-Mobile US tmus in a costly network upgrade race to spur revenue growth. \nUnlike current trials using 5G technology to beam signals between stationary antennas, AT&T said in a statement it will introduce a commercial mobile service in more than a dozen U.S. cities later this year. The company didn’t offer specifics. \nThe faster connections will help carriers sell advanced services like virtual reality, 4K video and enable self-driving cars. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint Corp. are also planning to offer mobile 5G services but haven’t elaborated on their plans. \nWhile 5G technology offers a path for a slowing industry to revive growth, challenges abound. Mobile-phone companies, chipmakers, device manufacturers and software developers will need to spend about $200 billion a year in research and capital expenses to get there. And engineers will have to find ways to get the technology to work around interference from trees and rain and provide a strong enough signal to handle the anticipated demand. \nFor more on 5G, watch Fortune’s video: \n(Your browser doesn&#8217;t support iframe) \nAT&T says it has laid the groundwork for 5G through network upgrades in 23 cities and fixed wireless trials in Kalamazoo, Michigan; South Bend, Indiana; Waco and Austin Texas. The company has not disclosed where it plans to launch mobile 5G initially or what airwaves or network equipment it plans to use. This article was written by Bloomberg from FORTUNE  ",
