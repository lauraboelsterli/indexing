    "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Jan. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Green Spirit Industries Inc. (OTC Pink:GSRX) (“Green Spirit” or, the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Project 1493, LLC, has completed an acquisition of a pre-qualified medicinal cannabis dispensary in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Company plans to open the dispensary in early 2018, pending a satisfactory inspection by the Puerto Rico Department of Health and issuance of the requisite operating permit. This is Green Spirit’s fifth pre-qualified medical cannabis dispensary in Puerto Rico.\n“Despite the delays imposed by Hurricanes Maria and Irma, Green Spirit continues to be fully committed to providing medicinal cannabis in a wide variety of delivery systems to patients in Puerto Rico, and we have, therefore, increased our investment on the island with this new acquisition,” said Les Ball, CEO of Green Spirit Industries Inc. “Our goal is to make medicinal cannabis available throughout the island via locations that are accessible to all, and professionally managed and operated. We are working hard to have our first location open for business within the next few weeks.”\nGreen Spirit’s newest dispensary is located on Calle César González in San Juan‘s Baldrich neighborhood, which includes a mix of both residential and commercial properties and is notable for its large concentration of doctors’ offices and medical practices. As part of the acquisition, Green Spirit has assumed the dispensary’s building lease.\nAs previously reported, the Company has an additional four pre-qualified dispensaries that are in various stages of development and are located in Fajardo, Carolina, Dorado and the Puerto Nuevo neighborhood of San Juan. The Company’s goal is to acquire and open an additional fifteen (15) dispensaries over the next 12-18 months.\nAbout Green Spirit Industries Inc.\nGreen Spirit Industries Inc. (OTC Pink:GSRX), together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Project 1493, LLC, is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating medical cannabis dispensaries.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
