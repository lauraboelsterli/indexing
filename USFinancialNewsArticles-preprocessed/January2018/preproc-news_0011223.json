    "text": "VANCOUVER, Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Pure Industrial Real Estate Trust (TSX: AAR.UN) (\"PIRET\" or the \"Trust\") announced today that it has entered into an arrangement agreement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\") with an affiliate of Blackstone Property Partners (\"Blackstone\"), pursuant to which Blackstone will acquire all of the outstanding trust units of PIRET (each, a \"Unit\") for $8.10 per Unit in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.8 billion including debt (the \"Transaction\").\nThe Transaction price of $8.10 per Unit represents a 21% premium to the closing price of PIRET Units on the TSX on January 8, 2018, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Transaction, a 22% premium to PIRET's 30-day volume-weighted average Unit price on the TSX for the period ending January 8, 2018 and a 27% premium to the current research consensus Net Asset Value estimate of $6.40 per Unit.\nCommenting on the Transaction, Rick Turner, Chairman of PIRET's Board of Trustees (the \"Board of Trustees\") and Chairman of the Special Committee of independent Trustees (the \"Special Committee\") formed to supervise the negotiation of the Transaction said: \"The Trust has accomplished tremendous growth in the ten years since the initial public offering in August 2007. Since inception, we have generated a total return in excess of 345% and we have built a platform that has made us a leader in the Canadian industrial REIT space. The Board of Trustees believes that the all-cash Transaction provides significant value for our Unitholders and unanimously recommends that they vote in favour of the Transaction.\"\n\"I am extremely proud of my team's accomplishments over the past several years,\" added Kevan Gorrie President and CEO of the Trust. \"Blackstone is a highly reputable and strategic owner and one of the world's most active investors in logistics real estate. We look forward to further building out our platform.\"\n\"We are excited to be acquiring PIRET, one of the premier Canadian industrial REITs, as a continuation of our global strategy to acquire high-quality logistics assets in key urban markets. The management team has done an excellent job building the portfolio and we look forward to working together going forward,\" said Tyler Henritze, Head of North America Acquisitions for Blackstone Real Estate.\nBlackstone will be making this investment through Blackstone Property Partners (\"BPP\"), its Core+ real estate investment unit. BPP targets substantially stabilized office, industrial, multifamily and retail assets.\nThe Transaction has the unanimous support of the Special Committee, as well as the full Board of Trustees of PIRET. The Board of Trustees, after receiving the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee and in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has unanimously determined that the Transaction is in the best interests of PIRET and fair to Unitholders and is unanimously recommending that Unitholders vote in favour of the Transaction.\nTRANSACTION DETAILS\nThe Transaction is structured as a statutory plan of arrangement under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. Completion of the Transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of this year, is subject to customary conditions, including approval of at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Unitholders at a special meeting of Unitholders, court approval and regulatory approvals (Canadian Competition Act and Investment Canada Act).\nThe Trust will continue to pay its normal monthly distributions in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice through closing of the Transaction.\nThe Arrangement Agreement provides for, among other things, customary representations, warranties and covenants, including customary non-solicitation covenants from PIRET and a \"fiduciary out\" that allows the Board of Trustees to accept a superior proposal in certain circumstances, subject to a \"right to match\" in favour of Blackstone and payment of a $77 million termination fee to Blackstone. In certain circumstances, Blackstone is required to pay a $220 million break fee to PIRET upon the termination of the Arrangement Agreement.\nThe foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Arrangement Agreement, a copy of which will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . The Trust will mail a management information circular and certain related documents to Unitholders in connection with the meeting to consider and vote on the Transaction, copies of which will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . All references to $ above are to Canadian dollars.\nAdvisors\nBMO Capital Markets is acting as financial advisor to PIRET and has provided the Special Committee and the Board of Trustees with a fairness opinion in respect of the Transaction.
