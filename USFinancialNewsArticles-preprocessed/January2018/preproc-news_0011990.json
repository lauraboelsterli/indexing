    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Harvest Partners, LP (“Harvest”), a New York-based private equity firm, announced today that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell FCX Performance, Inc. (“FCX Performance”, “FCX” or the “Company”) to Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) (“Applied Industrial Technologies” or “AIT”), a leading value-added industrial distributor of bearings, power transmission products, fluid power components and other industrial supplies. The sale is expected to close within 30 days. After the closing, Tom Cox, FCX’s Chief Executive Officer, and the rest of the management team will continue to lead the business and the Company will remain headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.\nFCX Performance is a leading distributor of mission-critical products and value-added services to end users, OEMs and contractors across the industrial process, oil and gas, power, life sciences, municipal and commercial markets.

Since the Company’s acquisition by Harvest in 2012, FCX has completed 13 strategic acquisitions to expand its product and service capabilities as well as broaden the Company’s geographic footprint.\nTom Cox said: “Harvest was instrumental in our growth over the years as we have expanded to become the leading technical flow control platform, and we are extremely excited for our team members, customers and suppliers to partner with AIT to build upon our combined success.”\nMichael DeFlorio, Partner of Harvest Partners, said: “It has been a pleasure working with Tom and his team to nearly triple revenue and significantly expand capabilities to best serve FCX customers.” Stephen Carlson, Partner of Harvest Partners, added: “AIT is combining market leaders in fluid power and flow control and we are excited to track the future progress of the combined organization.”\nRobert W. Baird & Co. and Stephens Inc. acted as financial advisors and White & Case LLP acted as legal advisor to FCX.
