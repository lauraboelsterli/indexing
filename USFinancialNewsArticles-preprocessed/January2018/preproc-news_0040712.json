Dr Friesen will lead the Company's scientific, research and technology activities and become a member of the Executive Committee.

Dr Friesen joins Ablynx from ProQR Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company, where he is currently Senior Vice President, heading the Science and Early Development division.
