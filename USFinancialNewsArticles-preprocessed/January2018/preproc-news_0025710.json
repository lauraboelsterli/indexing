This has been long expected but there was more formality in the minutes around how the bank will manage the forward guidance process as they exit unconventional policy,” Schamotta said.\n“There was quite a bit of money sitting on the sidelines looking for this hint.”\nThe euro was up 0.9 percent to $1.2053, on pace for its biggest single-day percentage gain against the greenback in about two months.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was down 0.57 percent at 91.808, after falling to a nearly one-week low 91.808.\nThe greenback extended losses after data showed U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December amid declining costs for services.\nWeak inflation at the producer level could add to concerns that the factors restraining inflation could become more persistent and result in the Federal Reserve being more cautious about raising interest rates this year.\nThe U.S. central bank’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, has undershot its target since May 2012.\nThe Canadian dollar steadied against the greenback after hitting a nearly two-week low as investors weighed chances of a Bank of Canada interest rate hike next week and worried about the possibility of a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA.\nBitcoin was 4.8 percent lower at $14,168.95 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange after South Korea’s government said it plans to ban cryptocurrency trading.
