    "text": "CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Riot Blockchain, Inc. (Nasdaq: RIOT) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has appointed Christopher Ensey as its Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Ensey comes to Riot from Dunbar Security Solutions, where he served as Dunbar's Chief Operating Officer managing over 150 security professionals across physical and digital operations while capturing over 100 mid to large enterprise clients.\n\"Chris brings a strong wealth of corporate experience in cyber security and a passion for blockchain technology to Riot,\" commented John O'Rourke, Chairman and CEO of the Company. \"He has long-standing enterprise relationships from his experience at IBM and Dunbar, and a technical depth in blockchain technology from his active involvement in the space over the past five years.\"\nOver the last 20 years, Chris Ensey has established himself as a cybersecurity expert and strategic executive. In 2012, he joined Dunbar Armored to launch their cybersecurity services practice. As Chief Operating Officer, he led a team of security professionals delivering industry leading capabilities to detect and remediate cyber-attacks across the globe. Prior to Dunbar, he served as Director of Government Solutions at SafeNet, where he was responsible for business development and marketing for their extensive suite of encryption and authentication products. At IBM, Mr. Ensey served as Principal Security Strategist for their federal division. He architected cybersecurity solutions for large scale enterprise environments leveraging IBM's extensive technology and services portfolio. Ensey has also held technical roles at SAIC and BEA Systems. He serves as an advisor to numerous cybersecurity and blockchain companies and has a BS in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. He has been actively using crypto based currencies since the earliest days of bitcoin. His most recent blockchain work has centered on applying distributed ledger technologies to solve complex information security and privacy challenges.\nThe blockchain is a decentralized and encrypted ledger that offers a secure, efficient, verifiable and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. These protocols are the backbone of numerous digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Blockchain protocols have a wide range of use, including processing transactions, accounting, verification and proof of ownership across a far-reaching spectrum of applications.\nAbout Riot Blockchain\nRiot Blockchain, Inc. is leveraging its expertise and a network of professional advisors to build and support blockchain technologies. It is establishing an Advisory Board with technical experience intending to become a leading authority and supporter of blockchain, while providing investment exposure to the rapidly growing Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystems.
