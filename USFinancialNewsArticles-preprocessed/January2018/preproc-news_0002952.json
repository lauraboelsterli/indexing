    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish police are investigating whether the fatal stabbing of a Japanese man in a series of apparently random and unprovoked attacks in the northeastern town of Dundalk on Wednesday is related to terrorism.\nPolice arrested an 18-year-old Egyptian man on suspicion of the murder of the 24-year-old Japanese man who had been living in Ireland for the past year. Two other men were injured in the attacks that took place shortly before 0900 GMT, police said.\n“A terror attack is a line of enquiry - it is certainly a line that we would look at,” Chief Superintendent Christy Mangan told a news conference, adding police would be aiming to check the suspect’s background and why he was in Ireland.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
