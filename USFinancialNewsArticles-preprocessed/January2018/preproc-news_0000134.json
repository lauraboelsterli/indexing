Combining Barracuda's AI-driven protection against phishing and spear phishing with PhishLine's platform gives customers comprehensive defense against email-borne targeted attacks and social engineering.\nEmail remains the most targeted threat vector and one that requires both security technology and the human layer of defense. PhishLine offers data analytics and reporting to allow customers to measure and report on risks at macro and micro levels across the human and process layers. With this transaction, Barracuda combines gateway security, data protection, AI-based targeted threat protection, and user awareness training to deliver comprehensive protection against email-borne threats.\n\"Security awareness training is an important and quickly evolving area, particularly with increasingly targeted attacks making the human element a critical link in the security value chain,\" said BJ Jenkins, president and CEO at Barracuda. \"PhishLine has a culture of developing innovative email protection solutions, including social engineering and data analysis offerings. Combining the power of the Barracuda security technologies with PhishLine's capabilities gives us the opportunity to deliver integrated, adaptive security training aimed at preventing email security threats.\"\n\"An effective security strategy demands a collaborative effort between the employees using the network and the security technology designed to protect it,\" said Mark T. Chapman, president and CEO at PhishLine. \"Barracuda's innovations around targeted attacks, AI, archiving, and data protection complement PhishLine's solutions well. Our combined strengths offer a comprehensive, data-driven approach to help customers fight smarter, mitigate risks, eliminate threats, and gain greater peace of mind.\"\nEmail threats continue to become more targeted, making a multi-layered approach critical in successfully protecting targeted employees, applications, and data.
