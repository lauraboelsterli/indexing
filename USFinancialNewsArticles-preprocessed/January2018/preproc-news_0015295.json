Magna fell 3.2 percent to C$71.44.\n* Nine of the index’s 10 main sectors ended lower, with gains for gold miners helping boost the materials group, which also includes base metals miners and fertilizer companies.\n* Gold hit its highest in nearly four months as the U.S. dollar swooned after a report that Chinese officials had recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.\n* Media company Corus Entertainment Inc slumped 16.9 percent to C$9.17 after disappointing quarterly results that led an analyst at RBC Capital Markets to make a “major recalibration” of his forecast for Corus’ television revenue.\n* Miner Klondex Mines Ltd lost 11.5 percent to C$2.62 after announcing it would pull back on operations at its True North project in Manitoba.\n* The energy group retreated 0.1 percent, although Crescent Point Energy Corp rose 4.5 percent to C$10.94 as analysts at two banks increased their price targets on the stock following the release of the company’s 2018 budget.\n* Oil prices hit fresh multi-year highs as OPEC-led production cuts and healthy demand helped balance the market, but analysts warned of possible overheating.
