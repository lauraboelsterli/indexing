Morgan Healthcare Conference. \nChief Executive Omar Ishrak said the company was confident about mid-single digit revenue growth in the short term. \nMedtronic said in November it expected revenue growth to be in the range of 4-5 percent in fiscal 2018, and adjusted earnings to increase 9 to 10 percent. \nEvercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said investors had been skeptical about the forecast, given industry trends in the first half of the year.
