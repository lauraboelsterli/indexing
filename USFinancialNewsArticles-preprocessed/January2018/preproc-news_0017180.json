    "text": "(Reuters) - Britainâ€™s Agriculture Ministry said on Friday it had found the H5N6 strain of bird flu in 17 wild birds in South Dorset for the first time in the country this winter.\nThe risk to public health and domestic poultry remains low, the ministry said. ( bit.ly/2myY1Fb )\nThe ministry said the current strain is different to that which affected people in China last year.
