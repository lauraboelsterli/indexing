He said Turkey had informed the actors involved in Syria about the developments in the Afrin region, adding that Ankara expected its allies to not side with terrorist organisations. \nIn a phone interview with broadcaster NTV, Cavusoglu also said Turkey had also sent a written statement to the Syrian government.
