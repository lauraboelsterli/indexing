    "text": "Company Also Announces First Significant Data Center Project Win\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) today announced that it has repurchased all of the remaining outstanding shares of its Class A Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”) for approximately $9.974 million, including accrued dividends associated with the partial repurchase. The Preferred Stock, which was issued on July 20, 2016 in connection with the Company’s business combination, paid an 8% preferred dividend, increasing to 12% over the six-year term of the preferred, and was convertible (at the holder’s election) into 2.00 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of Preferred Stock held (as may be adjusted for any stock splits, reverse stock splits or similar transactions), representing a conversion price of $12.50 per share.\nSignificant New Win: Large Scale Data Center Project\nLimbach is pleased to announce the award of the Company’s first large-scale data center project. The Company has noted in prior presentations that it has identified the “Mission Critical” industry, which includes structures such as data centers, as a high-growth opportunity. Due to the size, scale and fast track schedule of the project, Limbach will be executing the contract under a joint venture with another significant regional mechanical contracting company. Limbach will be providing preconstruction and construction services on the project.\nCharlie Bacon, CEO of Limbach commented, “This is a significant win for Limbach. We are pleased to be working once again with Turner Construction on this large, complex project, along with another large, well-regarded mechanical contractor, with whom we have joint ventured with on other significant projects in the past. While we have always been engaged on smaller data centers, this is our first large-scale data center project. The win strategically opens the door to a projected major growth sector (large-scale data centers). This win also reinforces our drive to be 1st Choice in our customers’ minds. Turner is a long-standing customer and Limbach provides services to them in all of Limbach’s locations. We are excited to see our relationship expanding into this new Limbach sector.”\nMr. Bacon continued, “We are also gratified that we have been able to continue the process of reducing the Company's cost of capital while also simplifying our capital structure. Today’s repurchase of the remaining preferred stock is an accretive transaction for our existing shareholders and removes a dilutive overhang. Following this transaction our balance sheet remains flexible, allowing us the ability to pursue strategic M&A opportunities and fund long-term growth initiatives.”\nPreferred Repurchase Terms\nThe Company repurchased the remaining 280,000 outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for $9.1 million, plus an accrued dividend of $874,000, using the proceeds of a $10 million new term loan under the Company’s current credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, which was amended pursuant to a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver that is described more fully in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The loan carries a current annual interest rate of approximately 6.7% and matures on April 12, 2019. Management expects the repurchase to be accretive to net income.\nAbout Limbach\nLimbach Holdings, Inc. is an integrated building systems provider, managing all components of mechanical, electrical, plumbing and control systems, from system design and construction through performance and maintenance.
