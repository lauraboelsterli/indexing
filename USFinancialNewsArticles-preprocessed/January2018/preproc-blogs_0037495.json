    "text": "When it comes to the dangers of high-interest credit card debt, Americans are savvier than ever. That hasn't stopped them from putting more on plastic than ever before.\nThe average American has a credit card balance of $6,375, up nearly 3 percent from last year, according to Experian's annual study on the state of credit and debt in America . Total credit card debt has reached its highest point ever, surpassing $1 trillion in 2017, according to a separate report by the Federal Reserve.\nNevertheless, the average VantageScore, which was developed by Experian and the other major national credit reporting companies Equifax and TransUnion, is now 675 â€” the highest in the decade since the Great Recession. (Scores range from 301 to 850, the higher the better.)\nAs economic satisfaction increases , \"consumers are more comfortable spending and confident they can manage any new debt,\" said Rod Griffin, Experian's director of public education.\nGood credit card management boils down to making payments on time and not buying things you otherwise can't afford, he said. (See more strategies in the infographic below.)\n\"Ride the wave, don't fall off the surfboard, that's the trick,\" Griffin said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWallet versus waistline: Here's what consumers packed on this holiday season\nIf you have debt, avoid this big mistake many borrowers make\nBefore you pick a new credit card, check to see if it has this fine print",
