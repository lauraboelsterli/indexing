Slideshow (2 Images) \n“It’s not something that happens often and it’s very frustrating,” she told reporters. “I guess we will have to work on that.” \nRussians Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin finished nearly six points behind their French rivals after an energetic performance on home ice. \nItalians Anna Cappellini and Luca Lanotte finished third with 74.76 points. \nOn the men’s side, Spain’s Javier Fernandez will look to secure his sixth consecutive European title when he competes in the free skate later on Friday.
