    "text": "Reuters TV United States January 5, 2018 / 2:19 PM / Updated an hour ago Barclays names Kunal Gandhi as head of corporate broking Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Barclays ( BARC.L ) has appointed Kunal Gandhi as head of corporate broking and Rob Mayhew as his deputy, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Friday. FILE PHOTO: A Barclays sign is seen on the exterior of the Barclays U.S. Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nGandhi helped build Barclaysâ€™ corporate broking business by advising clients including insurer Legal & General ( LGEN.L ) and the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), the memo said. \nCorporate broking is a banking business common in Britain but little seen elsewhere and involves lenders providing long-term strategic advice to corporate customers. \nA spokesman for Barclays confirmed the contents of the memo.
