The working name of the company is NewTV.\n\"I'm very excited to bring my experience to a company that I believe will transform an industry and I am thrilled to be employee #1,\" Whitman said in a statement.\nIt will be a dramatic change from Whitman's role leading an enterprise technology conglomerate. The company aims to build a video creation platform for \"mobile, in bite-sized formats of 10 minutes or less.\" Whitman had been considered for the top job at Uber before the ride-hailing company hired Dara Khosrowshahi from Expedia.\nWhitman and Katzenberg are both former Disney executives, and Whitman was also on the board of DreamWorks Animation, which Katzenberg co-founded.\nWhitman is set to complete the handover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise on Feb. 1.",
