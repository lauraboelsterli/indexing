    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Republic First Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRBK), the holding company for Republic Bank, today announced its financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nTwelve Months Ended ($ in millions, except per share data) 12/31/17 12/31/16 % Change Assets $ 2,322.3 $ 1,923.9 21 % Loans 1,162.3 965.0 20 % Deposits 2,063.3 1,677.7 23 % Total Revenue $ 90.9 $ 69.5 31 % Net Income 8.9 4.9 80 % Net Income per Diluted Share $ 0.15 $ 0.12 25 % Vernon W. Hill, II, Chairman of Republic First Bancorp said:\n“2017 was another tremendous year for ‘The Power of Red is Back’ growth campaign. Deposits and loans continued to grow at exceptional rates. Our store network expanded to twenty-three convenient locations and we solidified our position as one of the top residential mortgage lenders in our market through the successful integration of the Oak Mortgage team. I am excited over the opportunities we see in 2018 and beyond to build on the success achieved to this point. We are clearly giving customers a reason to Love Their Bank Again.”\nHarry D. Madonna, President and Chief Executive Officer of Republic First Bancorp added:\n“The momentum of our expansion strategy continues to build as we attract new FANS throughout our footprint. We believe we’ve put ourselves in perfect position to capitalize on opportunities that arise as our competition continues to alienate customers with declining levels of service, higher fees and fewer locations. In addition, the reduction in the corporate tax rate included in Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will result in a significant benefit for us in the years to come. We intend on utilizing the savings generated by this Act to invest in our growth and expansion which will result in the creation of new jobs, improvements in technology and the ability to further contribute to the communities which we serve.”\nHighlights for the Period Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income increased by 80% to $8.9 million, or $0.15 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.9 million, or $0.12 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The Company continues to open new stores and increase net income despite the additional costs associated with the expansion strategy.\nNet Income was $2.7 million, or $0.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.3 million, or $0.04 per share, in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million, or $0.03 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by two significant and infrequent events, as described below.\nThe Company reversed its deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in an increase in net income of $2.9 million, or $0.05 per share, during the period. This entry factors in the impact of the new corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nEarnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were also impacted by a $2.2 million write-down related to the Company’s largest non-performing asset included in OREO. Management’s decision to aggressively pursue a resolution for this asset resulted in the execution of an agreement of sale a required reduction in the carrying value.\nTotal deposits increased by $386 million, or 23%, to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2016.\nThe fastest growing segment of the Company’s deposit base is non-interest bearing demand deposits. These balances grew by 35% to $439 million during 2017.\nNew stores opened since the beginning of the “Power of Red is Back” expansion campaign are currently growing deposits at an average rate of $27 million per year. The average deposit growth for all stores over the last twelve months was approximately $20 million per store.\nA new store was recently opened in Fairless Hills, PA launching our expansion into Bucks County. Four new stores have been opened over the last twelve months, increasing the total store count to twenty-three locations. Six additional store openings are planned for 2018.\nTotal assets increased by $398 million, or 21%, to $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal loans grew $197 million, or 20%, to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 compared to $965 million at December 31, 2016.\nAsset quality continues to improve. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.94% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.51% as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company’s residential mortgage division, Oak Mortgage, is serving the home financing needs of customers throughout its footprint. Oak originated over $378 million in loans during 2017.\nMeeting the needs of small business customers continued to be an important part of the Company’s lending strategy. More than $51 million in new SBA loans were originated during 2017.\nThe Company’s Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 16.70% and Tier I Leverage Ratio was 10.64% at December 31, 2017.\nBook value per common share increased to $3.97 as of December 31, 2017 compared to $3.79 as of December 31, 2016.\nIncome Statement\nThe major components of the income statement are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/17 12/31/16 %\nChange 12/31/17 12/31/16 %\nChange Total Revenue $ 24,421 $ 19,363 26 % $ 90,946 $ 69,539 31 % Provision for Loan Losses 400 - 100 % 900 1,557 (42 %) Non-interest Expense 21,622 15,970 35 % 75,276 56,293 34 % Income (Loss) Before Taxes (143 ) 1,447 (110 %) 5,986 4,826 24 % Provision (Benefit) for Taxes (2,881 ) (50 ) n/m (2,919 ) (119 ) n/m Net Income 2,738 1,497 83 % 8,905 4,945 80 % Net Income per Diluted Share $ 0.05 $ 0.03 67 % $ 0.15 $ 0.12 25 % The Company reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 was $8.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by two significant and infrequent events described in the following paragraphs.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the change in the tax rate, the value of the Company’s existing deferred tax assets will permanently decrease by $7.7 million. A charge for this impairment was recorded during the fourth quarter. However, the Company has carried a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets for the last several years. During the fourth quarter, management determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required and recorded an entry to reverse the $10.6 million valuation allowance. The combination of these two entries resulted in the recognition of a net tax benefit and increase in earnings in the amount of $2.9 million during the fourth quarter.\nEarnings in the fourth quarter were also impacted by a writedown of $2.2 million against the Company’s largest non-performing asset. Management’s decision to aggressively pursue a resolution for a property held in the other real estate owned portfolio resulted in the execution of an agreement of sale and a required reduction in the carrying value. Closing on the sale is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal revenue increased by $5.1 million, or 26%, to $24.4 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.4 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income as a result of the strong growth in interest-earning assets over the last twelve months driven by the Company’s “Power of Red is Back” expansion program.\nNon-interest income increased to $5.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.7 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest expenses increased by $5.7 million, or 35%, to $21.6 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the addition of expenses related to the “Power of Red is Back” growth and expansion strategy. Salary and employee benefit costs were higher at the Bank as a result of annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy. Three new stores were opened during 2017. The Company now has twenty-three store locations. Occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the growth strategy also contributed to the increase in non-interest expenses. In addition, the writedown of $2.2 million related to an OREO property described earlier also contributed to the increase in non-interest expenses.\nBalance Sheet\nThe major components of the balance sheet are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDescription\n12/31/17\n12/31/16 %\nChange\n09/30/17 %\nChange Total assets $ 2,322,347 $ 1,923,931 21 % $ 2,141,563 8 % Total loans (net) 1,153,679 955,817 21 % 1,087,147 6 % Total deposits 2,063,295 1,677,670 23 % 1,885,405 9 % Total core deposits 2,043,816 1,677,403 22 % 1,876,840 9 % Total assets increased by $398 million, or 21%, as of December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016.
