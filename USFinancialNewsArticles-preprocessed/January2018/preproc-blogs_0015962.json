    "text": "Taxes Trump said 'pretty Korean' analyst should negotiate with North Korea based on her ethnicity: NBC President Donald Trump suggested in the Oval Office that a \"pretty Korean\" analyst's ethnicity should qualify her for negotiating with North Korea on behalf of the United States , NBC News reported Friday. The woman, an intelligence analyst who had visited the White House to brief Trump on an impending hostage situation in Pakistan, was asked where \"your people\" were from by the president after multiple attempts to learn her ethnicity, sources told NBC. The story comes amid accounts that the president referred to some developing nations as \"s---hole countries\" in an immigration meeting.",
