    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday that it had completed an investigation of parts that were supplied by Kobe Steel Ltd with falsified data, and found that they had caused no problems to its vehicles’ quality or performance.\nKobe Steel admitted in October that it had falsified data on product quality and specifications, rocking supply chains around the world in a fresh blow to Japan’s reputation as a high-quality manufacturer.\nToyota in November provided a partial result of its review of Kobe materials and had said it would provide a full update at a later date.
