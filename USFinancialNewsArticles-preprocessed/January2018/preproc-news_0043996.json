    "text": "North Korea sends rare announcement to all Koreans, calling for unification Published 8 Hours Ago SHARES Toru Hanai | Reuters People walk past a street monitor showing news of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile test in Tokyo, Japan, July 4, 2017. \nNorth Korea sent a rare announcement addressed to \"all Koreans at home and abroad\" on Thursday, saying they should make a \"breakthrough\" for unification without the help of other countries, its state media said. \nIt said all Koreans should \"promote contact, travel, cooperation between North and South Korea \" while adding Pyongyang will \"smash\" all challenges against reunification of the Korean Peninsula. \nThe announcement, issued after a joint meeting of government and political parties, added Koreans should wage an energetic drive to defuse the acute military tension and create a peaceful climate on the Korean Peninsula. \nMilitary tension on the Korean Peninsula was a \"fundamental obstacle\" for the improvement of inter-Korean relations and unification, the North's official news agency said. \nIt added joint military drills with \"outside forces\" has shown to be unhelpful for the development of relations between North and South Korea. \nNorth Korea did not provide details why the meeting had been held but the statement said it was aimed to support leader Kim Jong Un's remarks regarding unification from his New Year's address. It said this year is meaningful for both North and South Korea as it is the 70th anniversary of the founding of North Korea while South Korea will be hosting the Winter Olympics next month.",
