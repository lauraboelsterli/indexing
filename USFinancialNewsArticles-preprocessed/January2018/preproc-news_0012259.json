    "text": "ATLANTA, Jan. 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gray Television, Inc. (\"Gray,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") (NYSE: GTN and GTN.A) announced today its appointment of veteran broadcaster Chris Fedele as the General Manager of WTVG-TV (ABC) in Toledo, Ohio. He brings over 25 years of broadcast experience to Gray Television.\nMr. Fedele, a native of Northeast Indiana, returns to the region after serving as the Director of Sales and Marketing for WLEX-TV (NBC) in Lexington, Kentucky for the past ten years. Prior to that, he spent five years as the President and General Manager of WPTA-TV (ABC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Mr. Fedele spent fourteen years at WPTA-TV, serving at various times as the General Sales Manager, Local Sales Manager, and National Sales Manager. He began his broadcasting career at Blair Television in New York after graduating from Ball State University in 1991.\nFor the past several years, Pete Veto has served as the General Manager of WTVG as well as WJRT (ABC) in Flint, Michigan. After too many years of sacrificing personal time to maintaining the market-leading positions of both stations, Mr. Veto will now focus exclusively on his hometown station, WJRT.\nAbout Gray:\nGray owns and/or operates over 100 television stations across 57 television markets that collectively broadcast over 200 program streams including over 100 channels affiliated with the CBS Network, the NBC Network, the ABC Network and the FOX Network. Our portfolio includes the number-one and/or number-two ranked television station operations in essentially all of our markets, which collectively cover approximately 10.4 percent of total United States television households.
