Football Soccer- Boca Juniors v Nacional - Copa Libertadores- Alberto J. Armando stadium, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19/5/16. Boca Juniors' Carlos Tevez celebrates at the end of the match. REUTERS/Enrique Marcarian Picture Supplied by Action Images \nTevez, who will turn 34 next month, met with coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto and immediately began pre-season training at the Los Cardales complex. \n“Tevez has come home!” the club said. “Today he joined up with Guillermo’s squad at Cardales and he is training with his team mates.” \nThe club did not give details of his contract or disclose if the Chinese club had been paid a transfer fee. \nThe moves marks Tevez’s third stint at the Buenos Aires club where he first made his name between 2001 and 2004. \nAfter winning the Libertadores Cup and Intercontinental Cup titles, Tevez enjoyed spells at Brazilian side Corinthians and West Ham before a successful period in Manchester, where he won Premier League titles with both United and City. \nHe also won two Scudettos with Juventus in Italy in 2014 and 2015 before briefly returning to Boca. \nHe joined Shanghai Shenhua in January 2017 and although he won the Chinese FA Cup last year, he never looked settled in Asia and failed to add to his 76 international caps.
