British businesses able to do good trade into China.\" \nAsked about President Xi Jinping's flagship Belt and Road Initiative — a trillion-dollar infrastructure-led push to build a modern silk road — May said it had huge potential, but cautioned that the project had to be carried out in the proper way. \n\"What I would like to see is ensuring that we have transparency and international standards being adhered to, and I will be discussing that with my Chinese interlocutors,\" she said. \nMay also said she would raise the future of Hong Kong in her meetings with Xi, underlining Britain's commitment to the \"one country, two systems\" rule in the former British colony. \nBritain's last governor in Hong Kong before it was handed back to the Chinese, Chris Patten, had written to May on Monday urging her to raise concerns over the \"increasing threats to the basic freedoms, human rights and autonomy\" in the territory. \n\"We believe that the future of Hong Kong, that one country, two systems future is important. We are committed to that,\" May said. \n\"I've raised this in the past with President Xi, and he's shown commitment to that but I will continue to raise it with him.\" ",
