    "text": "PACOIMA, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mogharebi Group , (“ TMG ”) has completed the sale of Loma Vista Apartments , a 60-unit community that is located on Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima, CA. The property sold with multiple offers for a sales price of $10.75 million . The buyer was a private investment group based in West Los Angeles.\n“As a result of the desirable infill location and rental upside due to rent control, the buyer pool was large,” says Otto Ozen , Executive Vice President of TMG . “To maximize the value of this community, we aggressively marketed it to our list of high net worth private clients who are currently looking for exchange up-legs, this strategy generated multiple offers and closed at 95% of list price.” Mr. Ozen concluded, “The property represented a true value-add opportunity that required a special buyer to realize its full potential.”\nAlex Mogharebi and Otto Ozen of TMG represented the seller, a San Gabriel Valley based private investor, and the West Los Angeles based buyer.\nBuilt on a 2.43-acre site in 1957, the property is located at 12544 Van Nuys Boulevard in Pacoima.
