The service will work only on 5G capable mobile devices.\n“Any implementation we do here will start off very controlled,” Andre Fuetsch, president of AT&T Labs and chief technology officer, said in an interview. He said that AT&T will launch the mobile service using information it is already collecting in trials for a new 5G broadband service, where the last leg of Internet connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using wireless spectrum known as millimeter wave.\nThe company has said it expects deployment of that service as early as late 2018. Verizon Communications Inc is launching a similar service in three to five markets in 2018.\nIndustry analysts consider 5G mobile service to be a bigger revenue opportunity for wireless carriers than broadband. T-Mobile US Inc has also said it is targeting nationwide 5G coverage by 2020. (Additional reporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Susan Thomas)\n ",
