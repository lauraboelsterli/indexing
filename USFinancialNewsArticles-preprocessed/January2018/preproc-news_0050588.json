    "text": "January 29, 2018 / 5:39 AM / in 12 hours Rosenstein approved surveillance extension of former Trump adviser: NYT Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved to extend surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page shortly after assuming office last spring, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with a secret Republican memo. \nThe extension shows the Department of Justice, under President Donald Trump, saw reason to believe that Page was acting as a Russian agent, the paper reported on Sunday. \nThe memo paints the investigation into Russiaâ€™s alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election as tainted from the start, the paper said. FILE PHOTO - One-time advisor of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump Carter Page addresses the audience during a presentation in Moscow, Russia, December 12, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nThe Times report did not reveal the evidence Rosenstein relied on to authorize extension of the surveillance. \nRosenstein, also a Republican, took office in April after being nominated by Trump. \nThe Republican Party and the Democratic Party were not immediately available to comment late on Sunday. Reuters could not contact Carter Page for comment. Reporting by Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
