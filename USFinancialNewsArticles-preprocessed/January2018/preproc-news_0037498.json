    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices fell as much as 2.1 percent in early trade to a six-week low on Wednesday, tracking a sharp decline in London on Tuesday after London Metal Exchange refined copper inventories surged. FUNDAMENTALS * The most-traded March copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 1.7 percent to 52,750 yuan ($8,251.73) a tonne, as of 0214 GMT. Earlier in the session, it hit 52,520 yuan a tonne, the lowest since Dec. 14, 2017. * Three-month copper on the LME gained 0.4 percent to $6,947.50 a tonne, partly recovering from a 2.1 percent drop to a one-month low in the previous session. * LME stocks: On-warrant copper stocks - metal not earmarked for delivery from warehouses and available for investors - in facilities certified by the LME MCUSTX-TOTAL jumped by 28 percent on Tuesday, data showed. * USD: The dollar index edged down 0.1 percent to a three-year low. A weak greenback makes dollar-denominated metals cheaper for holders of other currencies and lends support to prices. * LEAD: ShFE lead continued its recent rally amid tight lead stocks and output curbs in China on environmental grounds, climbing 0.8 percent to 19,735 yuan a tonne. * CHILE: Chile's conservative President-elect Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday named a former finance minister in the top copper exporter, Felipe Larrain, to fill the same spot again in his new cabinet. * SCRAP: China's imports of scrap copper fell 19.8 percent in December from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday, as the country continues a clampdown on taking foreign waste. * BRAZIL: Anglo American PLC said on Tuesday it expects to receive long-awaited licenses on Friday which will pave the way for the mining company to boost its Brazilian iron ore production capacity by about 56 percent.
