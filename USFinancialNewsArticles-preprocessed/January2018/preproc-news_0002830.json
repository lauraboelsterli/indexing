Following an initial public offering, the company was listed on the INC. 100 of Fastest-Growing Small Public Companies for two consecutive years and was among the top trading equities on the American Stock Exchange. He also served as Chairman and CEO of two spun-off subsidiaries that he led through public offerings.\nMr. Witham also founded and served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Aquacell Technologies, Inc., a water treatment company that went public on the American Stock Exchange and grew through a series of acquisitions.\nMr. Witham is a recipient of the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor, joining US Presidents, captains of industry, sports and entertainment leaders and other influential Americans.

She currently provides consulting services through Put It Together LLC.\nAfter obtaining a degree in education from the State University of New York at Farmingdale, Ms. Laustsen left the classroom for a business career, and following a series of promotions became Executive Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors of US Alcohol Testing of America, Inc. and its publicly traded subsidiary US Drug Testing. Ms. Laustsen led operations and assembled a team of researchers, which in partnership with the Naval Research Laboratories, successfully received six FDA approvals for its drugs-of-abuse testing assays.\nHaving served as President, Chief Operating Officer and member of the Board of Directors of three additional publicly traded companies, Ms. Laustsen has honed her skills in acquisition due diligence, investor relations, corporate governance and regulatory compliance.\nAs a recipient of the gift of sight through corneal transplants, Ms. Laustsen established OneMoreDonor.com to raise awareness of the need for eye, organ and tissue donation.\nAbout Airborne Wireless Network\nThe Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital information superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage and connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.\nCurrently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground-based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company's airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void. Once the network is developed and fully implemented, it may have a wide variety of applications. The Company's network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.\nNotice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\nThis release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United",
