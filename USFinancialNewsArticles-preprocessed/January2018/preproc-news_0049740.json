The Kremlin has warned that additional U.S. measures against Russia would worsen relations already strained by Russia’s interventions in Ukraine since 2014 and alleged interference in the U.S. presidential election. \nBy Samuel Rubenfeld James Marson \nThe U.S. Treasury Department late Monday released an unclassified list of Russian senior political figures and oligarchs, provoking ire in Moscow even as its consequences were unclear. \nThe list totaled more than 200 names of top officials, heads of state-controlled companies and wealthy businessmen, including Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary; Igor Sechin, chief executive of oil giant PAO Rosneft; and Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. \nRead: House panel votes to release secret Republican memo on Russia probe \nIt was delivered just before midnight, the deadline Congress had set for its release under a provision of a sanctions law passed last year. \nThe Treasury Department said repeatedly in its late-night statement that the report doesn’t constitute a sanctions list and inclusion on the list doesn’t confer sanctions on those named. However, the statement also said the Treasury reserved the right to use “all available sources of information,” including classified versions of the report, when making decisions about additional sanctions. \nSpeculation about who would make the U.S. list was the source of significant anxiety among the Russian elite ahead of its release. In its report, the Treasury said it deemed an oligarch to be an individual with a net worth of more than $1 billion, and it applied definitions set by Congress to identify senior political figures, such as members of the presidential administration and cabinet officials.",
