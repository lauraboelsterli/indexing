    "text": "CHARLIE MUNGER, VICE-CHAIRMAN OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY, ALSO JOINS THE CONVERSATION AT 8:45AM ET\nWHEN: Today, Tuesday, January 10, 2018\nWHERE: CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"\nFollowing is the full unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with Berkshire Hathaway Chairman & CEO Warren Buffett and CNBC's Becky Quick on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" (M-F, 6AM-9AM ET) today, Tuesday, January 10, stemming from the company's announcement this morning that Buffett has appointed Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain as vice chairman for non-insurance and insurance operations respectively. Vice-Chairman Of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger joined the conversation at 8:45am ET. Berkshire Hathaway also announced that Buffett and Munger will continue their respective roles, although Buffett notes this is \"part of a movement to succession over time.\" Video of the full interview is available on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/01/10/warren-buffett-may-be-slowly-passing-the-baton-at-berkshire-hathaway.html .\nAll references must be sourced the CNBC.\nJOE KERNEN: BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY MAKING SOME BIG CHANGES TO ITS BOARD. LET'S GET TO BECKY QUICK IN OMAHA. SHE JOINS US NOW WITH A VERY SPECIAL GUEST. YIELDS, WARREN, I'M SURE WE'LL WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. I THINK INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO INVEST A BUNCH OF STUFF, DON'T THEY, BECKY? I MEAN, IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO GET –\nQUICK: THEY DO.\nKERNEN: IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO GET A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.\nBECKY QUICK: THEY DO. AND LOW YIELDS HAVE BEEN VERY PAINFUL FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, FOR THE PENSION COMPANIES, AND, YEAH, I'M GUESSING THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD NEWS.\nKERNEN: IS HE REALLY THERE WITH YOU, HONEST TO GOD?\nQUICK: YEP. YOU WANT TO SEE? YOU WANT TO SEE? TAKE A SHOT.\nKERNEN: I'LL BE DARNED. I'LL BE DARNED.\nQUICK: TAKE A SHOT OF WARREN. HE'S HERE.\nKERNEN: AND THAT'S NOT TOM CRUZ WITH ONE OF THOSE MASKS ON LIKE – THAT'S REALLY –\nQUICK: NOPE. NOT LIKE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\nKERNEN: HI, WARREN. THANKS FOR JOINING US. DON'T SEND ME A BRICK.\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK, JOE. YOU'LL GET TWO OF THEM. WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL THIS WEEK.\nQUICK: HE WAS WATCHING EARLIER THIS MORNING, JOE, HE HAS ALREADY MENTIONED.\nKERNEN: OH, HE DID? HE'S SMILING. HE'S STILL SMILING.\nQUICK: HE DID. YEAH HE WAS WATCHING. HE HEARD EVERYTHING. FOLKS, THAT'S RIGHT. WARREN BUFFETT, THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY IS WITH US THIS MORNING, AND THIS IS ON A MORNING THAT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY HAS SOME BIG NEWS. TWO NEW APPOINTMENTS TO THE BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BOARD. GREG ABEL WHO RUNS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY AND AJIT JAIN WHO RUNS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY RE-INSURANCE. THEY WILL NOW BE RESPONSIBLE – THEY WILL BOTH BE PROMOTED TO VICE CHAIRMAN, BE NAMED TO THE BOARD, AND WILL EACH HAVE THEIR OWN PORTFOLIO TO RUN IN THE COMPANY. GREG ABEL, YOU SEE THERE WHO IS 55 YEARS OLD, IS GOING TO BE RUNNING ALL THE NONINSURANCE PARTS OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. AND AJIT JAIN, PICTURED HERE WHO IS 66 YEARS OLD, IS GOING TO BE RUNNING ALL THE INSURANCE PARTS OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. AND WARREN, WE MADE A COMMENT ABOUT THIS EARLIER TODAY THIS IS THE CLOSEST THAT WE'VE EVER HEARD TO A SUCCESSION PLAN AT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. IS THAT HOW WE SHOULD BE READING THIS?\nWARREN BUFFETT: WELL, YEAH. IT'S PART OF A MOVEMENT TOWARDS SUCCESSION OVER TIME, AND THEY ARE THE TWO KEY FIGURES AT BERKSHIRE. THIS WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE FIVE YEARS AGO, TOO. THEY BOTH HAVE BERKSHIRE IN THEIR BLOOD. THEY LOVE THE COMPANY. THEY KNOW THEIR OPERATIONS LIKE THE BACK OF THEIR HAND. SO, IT'S REALLY, IT'S VERY GOOD FOR BERKSHIRE, AND IT'S EVEN BETTER FOR ME.\nQUICK: YOU MENTIONED YOURSELF THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO.\nBUFFETT: OH, SURE.\nQUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PUSHING YOU TO MAKE PUBLIC YOUR SUCCESSION PLANS FOR QUITE A BIT LONGER THAN THAT. WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY NOW?\nBUFFETT: WELL, LIKE YOU SAY, IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A FEW YEARS AGO, BUT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING FINE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S SOME VALUE IN HAVING BOTH OF THEM IN THOSE POSITIONS AND GETTING MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE ONES THEY HAVEN'T BEEN – THE OPERATIONS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BEFORE. AND I'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND I CAN TELL THEM THE STRONG POINTS AND THE WEAK POINTS AND THIS AND THAT OF THE VARIOUS OPERATORS. IT'S JUST A TRANSITION PERIOD THAT MAY LAST A LONG TIME OR IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME, IT COULD HAPPEN VERY SOON. THERE'S NOTHING MAGIC ABOUT THE TIME. IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING, ACTUALLY, I TALKED TO THE DIRECTORS ONE AT A TIME BEFORE WE HAD THIS MEETING LAST NIGHT AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY JUMPED AT THE SUGGESTION WAS A LITTLE ALARMING.\nQUICK: WANTING YOU TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE –\nBUFFETT: OH YEAH. THERE WAS NO PERSUASION NEEDED.\nQUICK: YOU JUST SAID THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, IT COULD LAST A LONG TIME, OR IT COULD HAPPEN MORE IMMEDIATELY. SHOULD PEOPLE BE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH?\nBUFFETT: NO. I AM REMARKABLY IN GOOD HEALTH, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE LIFE I'VE LED. EVERYTHING PHYSICAL GETS A LITTLE – YOUR BALANCE ISN'T AS GOOD, AND YOUR ENDURANCE MAY NOT BE QUITE AS GOOD AND ALL OF THAT. SO, I HAVE SLIPPED IN ALL THESE VARIOUS WAYS, BUT I WASN'T MUCH TO START WITH. SO THE AMOUNT OF SLIPPAGE IS FAIRLY MINOR JUST BECAUSE I STARTED FROM A LOW BASE. NO, I FEEL TERRIFIC. I LOVE WHAT I DO. I CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO THE OFFICE IN THE MORNING, AND, NO, THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN THAT. AND INCIDENTALLY, IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ABOUT MY HEALTH, AND THIS HAS BEEN TRUE SINCE I TOOK OVER, I WOULD TELL THE SHAREHOLDERS IMMEDIATELY. I'M NOT WRONG TO TALK ABOUT MY HEALTH. IN FACT, I THINK YOU HAVE A DUTY TO DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE CEO.\nQUICK: SO HOW WILL THIS CHANGE OPERATIONS AT BERKSHIRE? YOU WILL NOW HAVE THREE VICE CHAIRMAN. CHARLIE MUNGER, AJIT JAIN AND GREG ABEL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nBUFFETT: WELL, IT MEANS NOTHING IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL CHANGE. AJIT LIVES IN NEW YORK, WORKS IN CONNECTICUT, AND ALSO IN NEW YORK CITY. GREG LIVES IN DES MOINES. THEY WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. THERE'S NO CHANGE IN OUR OFFICE. CFO IS IN OMAHA. THERE WONT BE A CHANGE IN ONE PERSON IN OMAHA OR REALLY ANY PLACE ELSE EXCEPT SOMEBODY WILL MOVE UP TO THE HEAD OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY ENERGY.\nQUICK: I GUESS THE QUESTION BECOMES, IF THIS IS THE SUCCESSION PLANNING KIND OF OPENED UP, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THEY WOULD BOTH BE RUNNING BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AT SOME POINT? SORT OF THE WAY YOU HAVE YOUR INVESTMENT POTENTIAL SET UP WITH TODD AND TED. TODD COMBS AND TED WESCHLER EACH RUNNING TWO THINGS AND KIND OF OPERATING TOGETHER. IS THAT HOW WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE SUCCESSION PLANNING AT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY FOR THE CEO JOB?\nBUFFETT: NO. WHEN I'M NOT CEO, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CEO. THERE WILL BE A CEO. AND HOW THAT CEO WILL ORGANIZE THINGS WILL BE UP TO HIM IN THIS CASE. AND HE WILL FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. AND IT WON'T CHANGE VERY MUCH. IT WILL CHANGE A LITTLE, BUT IT WON'T CHANGE VERY MUCH.\nQUICK: DO YOU KNOW WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD BE CEO IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT?\nBUFFETT: WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW, BUT OUR DIRECTORS KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO TOMORROW MORNING IF IT HAPPENED, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, SAY IF IT HAPPENED THEN.\nQUICK: I GUESS THAT RAISES THE QUESTION, DOES THIS RAISE A LITTLE BIT OF A HORSE JOCKEYING COMPETITION?\nBUFFETT: THERE'S NO HORSE RACE AT ALL IN THESE TWO FELLOWS. THEY KNOW EACH O",
