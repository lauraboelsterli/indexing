    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average tracked a rise in global equities and advanced on Monday, although the dollar’s weakening against the yen capped gains.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.26 percent higher at 23,714.88 for its first session of gains in four days.\nIndex heavyweight SoftBank Group Corp rose as much as 5.8 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that the telecoms conglomerate plans to list its mobile-phone business this year in an initial public offering.\nWhile SoftBank gained, exporters including Tokyo Electron , Komatsu and Suzuki Motor Corp dipped amid the dollar’s depreciation.\nOf Tokyo’s 33 subindexes, 23 were in positive territory, led by securities and real estate.\nThe broader Topix added 0.4 percent to 1,883.90.
