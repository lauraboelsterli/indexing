Numerous existing investors, such as Konica Minolta and Bright Success Capital, plus over 5,000 new investors participated in the latest funding activities. Knightscope raised approximately $20 million through the Reg A+ offering and was oversubscribed by over $5 million due to significant investor demand. The company was able to accommodate the oversubscriptions in private placement transactions.\nThese financings add to the over $14 million closed in the company’s previous three rounds, bringing the total capital raised since inception in 2013 to $39+ million.\nKnightscope’s Reg A+ offering is also the most successful campaign in SeedInvest’s history. SeedInvest, a leading equity crowdfunding platform based in New York City, was the exclusive broker-dealer for the company’s landmark preferred stock offering via Reg A+.\n“Knightscope’s raise represents a major milestone for the entire equity crowdfunding industry,” said Ryan Feit, CEO & Co-Founder of SeedInvest. “Now that the $20 million mark has been surpassed, we are already seeing additional companies looking to utilize online fundraising to raise growth capital.”\nClients using Knightscope’s autonomous security robots to fight crime began yielding tangible, positive results early in 2017.
