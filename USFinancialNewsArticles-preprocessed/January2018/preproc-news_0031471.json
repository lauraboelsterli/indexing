    "text": "HAMBURG, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness Cargill plans to expand its starches and sweeteners factory in Krefeld, Germany, and switch to using wheat as a raw material, it said on Friday.\nThe Krefeld plant currently produces starches and sweeteners from corn for products including jams, sweets, chewing gum and custard powder.\n“We are in the planning process. Work will be completed in 2020,” a Cargill spokeswoman said without providing figures on production capacity or tonnage of wheat involved.\nThe plant’s expansion will add products including vegetable wheat protein, specialised industrial wheat starches and advanced biofuels.
