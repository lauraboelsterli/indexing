    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose by 5.7 percent in November from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday, underlining a steady pickup in capital expenditure. The rise in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, compared with a 1.4 percent drop expected in a Reuters poll of economists. It followed 5.0 percent growth in October. Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, grew 4.1 percent in November.
