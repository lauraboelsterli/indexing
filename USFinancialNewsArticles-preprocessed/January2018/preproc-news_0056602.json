    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (the “ Issuer ”) today announces the pricing of its public offering of $350 million of cash-settled equity linked notes linked to the common stock of Voya Financial, Inc. (“ Voya ”) due May 1, 2023 (the “ Notes ”). JPMorgan Chase & Co. will fully and unconditionally guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.\nThe Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning November 1, 2018 and will mature on May 1, 2023 unless earlier converted (for cash) at the option of the holder. The Notes will be cash-settled only at maturity or upon early conversion. The amount of cash payable at maturity or upon early conversion will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the common stock of Voya.\nThe threshold price (the “ Threshold Price ”) of the Notes will be set at a 32.5% premium to the initial reference price (the “ Initial Reference Price ”) of the Notes, which will equal the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average prices of one share of Voya common stock over the five consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, January 31, 2018. The Threshold Price and Initial Reference Price are expected to be announced after the end of the five trading day period.\nThe Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof at an issue price of 100% of the principal amount. Settlement and delivery of the Notes is expected to take place on February 2, 2018.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as Sole book runner.\nAbout JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.
