    "text": "Anthony Davis scored a game-high 30 points before being sidelined by an injured ankle in the third quarter and the New Orleans Pelicans held on to defeat the Detroit Pistons, 112-109, on Monday night in the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.\nDavis made 12 of 14 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds in 27 minutes before being injured. There was no immediate prognosis. The Pelicans (20-19) play at Memphis on Wednesday. The Pistons (21-18) visit Brooklyn on Wednesday\nE-Twaun Moore scored 23 points for the Pelicans and DeMarcus Cousins scored 15 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and finished with 10 rebounds. Jrue Holiday scored 14 points and Rajon Rondo had 12 points and 15 assists.\nTobias Harris led Detroit with 25 points, Avery Bradley scored 24, Andre Drummond had 16 points and 14 rebounds, Ish Smith scored 16 and Reggie Bullock and Dwight Buycks scored 10 each.\nHarris scored the first five points of the fourth quarter to give the Pistons an 89-86 lead before Cousins took over.\nCousins made a free throw and a 3-pointer, then scored on a drive to the basket. After Buycks made two free throws, Holiday made a layup and Cousins converted a three-point play and scored on another drive to give New Orleans a 99-91 lead.\nBradley scored six straight points and Detroit pulled even at 105 on Bullock’s drive with 2:02 left.\nCousins’ put-back and Rondo’s driving layup gave the Pelicans a 109-105 lead.\nDrummond sandwiched two dunks around a Rondo layup, leaving New Orleans with a 111-109 lead.\nHoliday made one of two free throws for a three-point lead with five seconds left and Bradley missed a potential tying 3-pointer just before the buzzer.\nNew Orleans led by three early in the third quarter before Moore scored seven consecutive points to give the Pelicans a 70-60 lead.\nBradley’s basket ended the run and he scored 10 more points as Detroit got within 81-80.\nDarius Miller’s jumper helped New Orleans maintain an 86-84 lead after three quarters.\nRondo tied a Pelicans record for assists in a quarter with nine as New Orleans took a 37-34 lead after one quarter. The teams played an even second quarter, leaving the Pelicans with a 59-56 halftime lead.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
