    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Jan. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company” or “Obalon”) (NASDAQ:OBLN) today announced the termination of the underwriting agreement and cancellation of its previously announced public offering (the “Offering”) of 5,454,545 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $5.50 per share.\nUBS Investment Bank, Canaccord Genuity and Stifel were acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. BTIG was acting as a co-manager. The offering was being made pursuant to a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-221264) previously filed with and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Offering was scheduled to close on January 23, 2018. However, a purported whistleblower contacted KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent auditors, to make certain allegations relating to allegedly improper revenue recognition during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 (“Q4 2017”). These allegations were reported to Obalon late in the day on January 22, 2018, making it infeasible for the Company to complete an investigation of the allegations prior to the intended closing of the public offering.\nObalon’s Audit Committee will oversee an internal investigation of these allegations (the “Investigation”). The Company is currently unable to predict the timing or outcome of the Investigation. Based on information known at this time, management does not currently believe material adjustments to the preliminary, unaudited revenue for Q4 2017 and full year 2017 previously reported by the Company will be required as a result of these allegations. The Company intends to make a further announcement regarding the outcome of the Investigation as soon as practicable.\nAbout Obalon Therapeutics, Inc.\nObalon Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:OBLN) is a San Diego-based company focused on developing and commercializing novel technologies for weight loss. The Obalon management team has over 150 combined years of experience in developing and commercializing novel medical technologies with a track record of financial and clinical excellence.
