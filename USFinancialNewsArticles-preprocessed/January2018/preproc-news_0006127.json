    "text": "January 5, 2018 / 3:03 PM / in 12 minutes UPDATE 1-Neiman Marcus names Ralph Lauren exec to succeed CEO Karen Katz Reuters Staff \n(Adds details on CEO compensation, background) \nBy Siddharth Cavale \nJan 5 (Reuters) - Struggling luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group Ltd on Friday named Ralph Lauren Corp executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck to succeed Karen Katz as its new chief executive next month. \nKatz, a Neiman lifer who has served as CEO since 2010, will retain her board seat after stepping down on Feb. 12, the company said. \nVan Raemdonck joins Neiman from luxury apparel manufacturer Ralph Lauren, where he was group president for Europe, Middle East and Africa and head of travel retail. \nHis resume also includes time spent at French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton from 2008 to 2013 and Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands Inc. \nThe move to replace Katz comes as the up-market chain continues to struggle with a nearly $5 billion debt load mainly due to its leveraged buyout in 2013, when Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB acquired it from other private equity firms. \nLike other retail chains, Neiman Marcus is struggling to reinvent itself as customers increasingly prefer online shopping to brick-and-mortar retail. \nSame-store sales rose for the first time in two years in its latest quarter, as efforts by Katz to invest heavily in its online business paid off. \nKatz will be eligible to receive nearly $2.5 million as a lump sum following her retirement as CEO and another $1 million before March 14, 2019, Neiman Marcus said in a regulatory filing. \nVan Raemdonck’s annual base salary will not be less than $1 million, the company said.
