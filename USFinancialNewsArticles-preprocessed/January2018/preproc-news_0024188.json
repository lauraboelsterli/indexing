    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average tracked a rise in global equities and advanced on Monday, although the dollar’s weakening against the yen capped gains.\nAt 0145 GMT, the Nikkei was up 0.3 percent at 23,728.69, on track to have its first session of gains in four days.\nSoftBank Group Corp rose as much as 5.8 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that the telecoms conglomerate plans to list its mobile-phone business this year in an initial public offering.\nOf Tokyo’s 33 subindexes, 26 were in positive territory, led by mining and securities.\nThe broader Topix added 0.55 percent to 1,886.45.\nReporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
