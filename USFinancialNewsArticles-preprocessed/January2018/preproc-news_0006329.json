Among the considerations are Breitbart’s contractual relationships with other entities, including Sirius XM radio SIRI, +1.92% , that involve Bannon. \nStaffers at Breitbart, which Bannon has described as his “killing machine,” described a “chaotic” day at the company, with writers—many personally recruited by Bannon—wondering whether he would last the day.",
