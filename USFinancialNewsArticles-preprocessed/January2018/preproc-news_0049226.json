    "text": "January 29, 2018 / 12:54 PM / Updated an hour ago West Ham's Masuaku gets six-match ban for spitting Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - West Ham United defender Arthur Masuaku has been handed a six-match ban following his red card for spitting at an opponent during their FA Cup defeat at Wigan Athletic, the Football Association said on Monday. \nThe 24-year-old Masuaku was sent off soon after halftime as third-tier side Wigan pulled off the big shock of the fourth round in a famous 2-0 victory on Saturday. \nMasuaku will miss West Ham’s home league games against Crystal Palace, Watford and Burnley and away fixtures at Brighton and Hove Albion, Liverpool and Swansea City. \nHe issued an apology for his actions on Sunday, saying his actions were “unacceptable and out of character”. \nWest Ham boss David Moyes, who is already without a number of players because of injury, described the incident as “despicable”.
