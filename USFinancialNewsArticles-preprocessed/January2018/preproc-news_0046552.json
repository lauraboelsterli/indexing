    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 10:20 PM / in 21 hours E*Trade to acquire 1 million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - E*Trade Financial Corp will acquire 1 million retail brokerage accounts with around $18 billion of clients’ assets from Capital One Financial, it said on Thursday. \nThe discount brokerage will pay $170 million for the brokerage accounts, which will add roughly $1.7 billion in cash and $115 million in margin loans to E*Trade’s balance sheet, executives said on a conference call with analysts. \n“Opportunities like this, in which we can efficiently add a large number of customers to our highly scalable platform, do not come along often,” Karl Roessner, E*Trade’s chief executive, said on the call. \nCapital One declined to comment and referred questions to E*Trade. \nClients in these new accounts trade less frequently than E*Trade’s typical client base. \nHowever, the acquisition price, broken down by accounts, was lower than E*Trade’s usual client acquisition cost, Roessner said. \n“The price was right, and we went after scale,” Roessner said. \nThe deal is expected to close by the third quarter this year, subject to regulatory approvals, and will have a neutral impact on 2018 earnings, executives said. Funding will come from existing corporate cash. \nThe discount brokerage also reported a 13 percent fall in fourth-quarter net income to $129 million, as the company recognized a $58 million tax expense due to the new U.S. tax law.
