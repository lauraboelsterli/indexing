    "text": "  Olympics - Burke, Brodeur now calling the shots not stopping pucks Steve Keating 4 Min Read \nTORONTO (Reuters) - In Martin Brodeur and Sean Burke the Canadian men’s ice hockey team heads to the Pyeongchang Winter Games with one of the greatest goaltending combinations ever seen at the Olympics. \nWith over a combined 1,000 National Hockey League career wins the thought of Brodeur or Burke manning the crease would inspire confidence among hockey crazed Canadians that a third consecutive gold medal was an almost certainty. \nAfter all, statistically Brodeur is the best to ever play the position and a certain first ballot Hall of Famer. \nHe played 22 years in the NHL racking up more wins (691) and shutouts (125) and more games as a goaltender (1,266) than anyone else. \nHe also won three Stanley Cups with the New Jersey Devils and participated in four Winter Games winning gold in 2002 and 2010. \nBurke’s resume may not match Brodeur’s but is impressive by every other standard having played 820 games (13th on the NHL all-time list) and amassed 324 wins. He also played in two Olympics winning silver in 1992. \nBut for these Olympics Brodeur and Burke will be standing behind the bench where their job is not stopping pucks but finding the players who can. \nWith the NHL refusing to release players for the tournament, Brodeur and Burke have had to look hard for netminders to play at Pyeongchang. \nJustin Peters (83 NHL games and 25 wins spread over seven seasons with three teams), Kevin Poulin (50 games, 18 wins in five seasons) and Ben Scrivens (144 games and 47 wins over five seasons) do not inspire the same confidence as their vaunted coaches, but Brodeur believes they have found the right men.
