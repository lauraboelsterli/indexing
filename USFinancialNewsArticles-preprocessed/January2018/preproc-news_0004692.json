    "text": "January 4, 2018 / 4:04 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX near flat as financials rise, marijuana producers pull back Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds details throughout on stocks and sectors; updates prices) \nTORONTO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was little changed on Thursday as the financial and industrial groups climbed, while shares of energy and marijuana producers pared some recent gains. \n* At 10:46 a.m. EST (1546 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 0.1 of a point to 16,371.65. It touched an all-time intraday high of 16,404.12. \n* The heavyweight financials group rose 0.5 percent as bond yields climbed after data showing a stronger-than-expected gain in U.S. private employment. Manulife Financial Corp advanced 1.5 percent to C$26.56. \n* Higher yields reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase net interest margins of banks. \n* Industrials firmed 0.3 percent, with Waste Connections Inc up 1.2 percent at C$87.86 after two analysts raised their price target on the stock. \n* The biggest gainer on the index was Prometic Life Sciences Inc , which rose 8.5 percent to C$1.53. \n* Six of the index’s 10 main groups were lower. \n* The energy group, which had rallied as much as 11.9 percent since mid-December, fell 0.7 percent. Encana Corp was down 2.3 percent at C$16.91. \n* U.S. crude prices were little changed at $61.66 a barrel. \n* The largest decliner on the TSX was Aphria Inc, down 10.3 percent at C$19.25. Another marijuana producer, Canopy Growth Co, fell 9.9 percent to $32.34. \n* The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday will rescind an earlier marijuana policy under former Democratic President Barack Obama that eased enforcement of federal laws amid a growing number of local legalization efforts, according to a source familiar with the change.
