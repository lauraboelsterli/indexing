    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CSC Holdings, LLC (the “Issuer”) announces the pricing of an offering (the “Offering”) of $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Guaranteed Notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.375% and will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2018. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The Offering is expected to close on or about January 29, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The Issuer is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice USA, Inc. (“Altice USA”).\nThe proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with proceeds from a new U.S. dollar-denominated tranche of term loans made available to the Issuer, borrowings under the Issuer’s revolving credit facility and cash on balance sheet, to (i) refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Issuer and Cablevision Systems Corporation (“Cablevision”), the direct parent of the Issuer, and (ii) fund a dividend of $1,500.0 million to Altice USA (through Cablevision). Altice USA is expected to use such proceeds to fund a dividend to its stockholders immediately prior to and in connection with the separation of Altice USA from its controlling stockholder, Altice N.V.\nThe Notes are being sold in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), subject to prevailing market and other conditions. There is no assurance that the Offering will be completed or, if completed, as to the terms on which they are completed. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or unless pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security, including the Notes. No offer, solicitation, or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.\nAbout Altice USA\nAltice USA (NYSE: ATUS), the U.S. business of Altice N.V.
