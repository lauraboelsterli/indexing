By midday Monday, the share price of Gem Diamond had risen more than 15 percent. \nClifford Elphick, Gem Diamonds’ chief executive officer, said in a press release Monday that the discovery was a “landmark recovery for all of Gem Diamonds’ stakeholders.” \nThe largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered is the 3106-carat Cullinan diamond that was discovered in South Africa’s Premier Mine in 1905. It was cut into 105 diamonds including the 530-carat Great Star of Africa. \nThe largest cut diamond in the world is the Golden Jubilee Diamond, which weighs 545.67 carats. It was also hewn from a rough diamond found in the Premier Mine in 1985. ",
