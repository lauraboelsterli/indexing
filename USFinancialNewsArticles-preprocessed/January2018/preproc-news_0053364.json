    "text": "Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchangeâ€™s main sea freight index inched lower on Monday, ending a five-day winning streak, as rates for panamax and smaller vessels eased.\n* The overall index, which factors in rates for capesize, panamax, supramax and handysize shipping vessels that ferry dry bulk commodities, shed 5 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,214 points.\n* The panamax index was down 7 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,485 points, after rising to over 5-week highs in the previous session.\n* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, declined $59 to $11,899.\n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index shed 5 points to 895 points, and the handysize index lost 4 points to 573 points.\n* The capesize index was up 12 points, or 0.68 percent, at 1,784 points.\n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, rose $8 to $14,065.
