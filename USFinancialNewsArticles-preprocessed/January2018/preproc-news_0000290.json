    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE:HT) (“Hersha” or the “Company”), owner of high quality upscale hotels in urban gateway markets and coastal destinations, today announced that its Board of Trustees authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $100 million of the Company’s outstanding common shares. This new program will commence immediately and the Company expects to complete the new repurchase program prior to December 31, 2018, unless extended by the Board of Trustees.\n“In 2017, the Company repurchased approximately two million common shares totaling $35.1 million, at a volume-weighted average price of $17.65, representing 4.5% of common shares outstanding. Since 2014, we have accretively repurchased $230.3 million of our common shares, representing 21.6% of our outstanding float. We believe opportunistic share buybacks are an attractive use of available capital and a driver of share value when the stock price is trading at a material discount to our net asset value. We intend to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares throughout the year to take advantage of capital market dislocations, remaining steadfast to our sustained and unique value creation philosophy and commitment to driving total shareholder returns,” stated Mr. Jay H. Shah, Hersha’s Chief Executive Officer.\nThe shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common shares and general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the terms of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness and the availability of capital for repurchases.\nHersha Hospitality Trust (HT) is a self-advised real estate investment trust in the hospitality sector, which owns and operates high quality upscale hotels in urban gateway markets and coastal destinations. The Company's 50 hotels totaling 7,724 rooms are located in New York, Washington, DC, Boston, Philadelphia, South Florida and select markets on the West Coast. The Company's common shares are traded on The New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “HT”.
