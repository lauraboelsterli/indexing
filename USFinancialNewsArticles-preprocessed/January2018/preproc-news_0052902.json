Blackstone would own 55 percent in the new company and Thomson Reuters would retain a stake of 45 percent. \nThomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters News, said late on Monday it was “in advanced discussions with Blackstone regarding a potential partnership in its F&R business”. Reuters News supplies news to the Financial and Risk unit’s desktop product, Eikon. Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia; Editing by Pravin Char",
