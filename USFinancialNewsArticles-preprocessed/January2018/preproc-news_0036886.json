There is a rising need for new applications or products in a fast-growing market for a secure device or platform that can simplify the use of cryptocurrency across multiple applications. As a growing number of consumers are demanding those devices and applications to become mainstream, companies are racing to develop innovative solutions that allow the user to seamlessly convert between different currencies across different mobile devices and platforms. Experts are forecasting strong growth for the mobile payment industry moving forward and as the numbers continue to rise steadily, the infusion of blockchain technologies will only become more frequent as the demand for robust and secure applications grows quickly. Active in blockchain market today includes: Social Play USA, Inc. (OTC: SPLY), Glance Technologies (OTC: GLNNF) (CSE: GET), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), Global Blockchain Technologies Corporation (TSX-V: BLOC.V) (OTC: BLKCF), Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO).\nSocial Play USA, Inc. (OTC: SPLY), announces that it is finalizing negotiations to acquire Spot And Pay Inc. ( http://www.spotandpay.com ) and its Spot&Pay Mobile Payment Platform. Details of the agreement, which is subject to approval by the board of directors of each company, will be announced in the coming weeks.\nSocialPlay identified Spot&Pay as an acquisition target due to its unique mobile payment application that is used in connection with third party QR codes that have been generated for specific uses; i.e. individual consumer products, specific services or group of services offered to the general public, B2B product and service offerings, monetary donations to charitable organizations, and quick and easy bill payments on recurring monthly accounts. Read this and more news for Social Play USA, Inc. at: http://www.marketnewsupdates.com/news/sply.html\nThe Company's software development plan has evolved to include a substantially more robust proprietary platform wallet feature that will allow users to create their own wallet so that they may buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly from the Spot&Pay platform. It also provides seamless abilities to transfer money within the Spot&Pay user network instantly from one account to another without any processing delays.\nAs part of its strategy going forward, SocialPlay will focus significant development efforts on the integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies into its product offerings. The Company believes that the future of financial transactions will be in the mobile space, and the security of these types of financial transactions will rely on blockchain verification and its unique, decentralized ledger. Distributed blockchain ledgers provide a highly secure identity verification and authentication methodology of user data, resulting in the most secure platform for users to initiate and complete financial transactions. In addition to developing its own proprietary blockchain technology, the Company will also seek to acquire existing, complementary blockchain technologies.\nIn other industry developments and stock performance of note in the markets:\nGlance Technologies Inc.

The alliance will also work to create a roadmap powered by the IoT ecosystem.\nDISCLAIMER: MarketNewsUpdates.com (MNU) is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.
