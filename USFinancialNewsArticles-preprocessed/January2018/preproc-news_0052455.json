Performance fees increased $69.0 million (155.8%) to $113.3 million in 2017 from $44.3 million in 2016, primarily related to the performance fee generated in the third quarter by Invesco's Mortgage Recovery Fund.\nOperating expenses increased $325.2 million (9.1%) to $3,883.2 million in 2017, from $3,558.0 million in 2016, primarily due to increased employee compensation and third-party distribution, service and advisory costs.

Business optimization charges increased to $58.0 million in 2017, compared to $49.9 million in 2016. As of the end of 2017, this initiative has produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $43.8 million.

We believe the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into our ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to our competitors. These measures also assist management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS.\nThe following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tax effect of the reconciling items is based on the tax jurisdiction attributable to the transactions. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Refer to these public filings for additional information about the company's non-GAAP performance measures.\nReconciliation of Operating revenue to Net revenues:\nQuarter\nYear\nin millions\nQ4-17\nQ3-17\nQ4-16\n2017\n2016\nOperating revenues, U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n1,375.6\n$\n1,337.7\n$\n1,194.7\n$\n5,160.3\n$\n4,734.4\nProportional share of revenues, net of third-party\ndistribution, service and advisory expenses, from\njoint venture investments\n13.5\n13.1\n12.6\n48.7\n43.7\nThird party distribution, service and advisory expenses\n(390.9)\n(380.4)\n(349.5)\n(1,486.5)\n(1,407.2)\nCIP\n6.7\n6.2\n6.0\n32.4\n22.3\nNet revenues\n$\n1,004.9\n$\n976.6\n$\n863.8\n$\n3,754.9\n$\n3,393.2\nReconciliation of Operating income to Adjusted operating income:\nQuarter\nYear\nin millions\nQ4-17\nQ3-17\nQ4-16\n2017\n2016\nOperating income, U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n344.3\n$\n355.3\n$\n294.2\n$\n1,277.1\n$\n1,176.4\nProportional share of net operating income from joint\nventure investments\n6.0\n5.8\n5.4\n18.4\n15.9\nCIP\n12.0\n10.4\n17.6\n42.9\n51.0\nBusiness combinations\n21.7\n8.6\n3.8\n43.8\n22.3\nCompensation expense related to market valuation changes\nin deferred compensation plans\n6.2\n5.0\n2.4\n20.3\n8.1\nBusiness optimization expenses\n9.0\n12.3\n21.0\n58.0\n49.9\nSenior executive retirement and related costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n19.7\nâ€”\nVacated property lease credit\nâ€”\nâ€”\n0.2\nâ€”\n(3.2)\nEmployee benefit plan termination\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(8.6)\nâ€”\n(8.6)\nRegulatory-related charges\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n1.0\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n399.2\n$\n397.4\n$\n336.0\n$\n1,480.2\n$\n1,312.8\nOperating margin (1)\n25.0\n%\n26.6\n%\n24.6\n%\n24.7\n%\n24.8\n%\nAdjusted operating margin (2)\n39.7\n%\n40.7\n%\n38.9\n%\n39.4\n%\n38.7\n%\nReconciliation of Net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. to Adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.:\nQuarter\nYear\nin millions\nQ4-17\nQ3-17\nQ4-16\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to Invesco Ltd., U.S. GAAP basis\n$\n408.2\n$\n267.5\n$\n226.5\n$\n1,127.3\n$\n854.2\nCIP\n(0.8)\n1.3\n(0.2)\n(2.3)\n(3.0)\nBusiness combinations:\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration\n(7.5)\n1.6\n1.1\n(19.7)\n7.4\nForeign exchange gain related to currency held for business\nacquisition\nâ€”\n(12.1)\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nOther-than-temporary impairment\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n17.8\nOther business combination-related adjustments\n21.7\n8.6\n3.8\n43.8\n22.3\nDeferred compensation plan market valuation changes and\ndividend income less compensation expense\n0.2\n(1.3)\n0.1\n(7.3)\n(4.0)\nBusiness optimization expenses\n9.0\n12.3\n21.0\n58.0\n49.9\nSenior executive retirement and related costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n19.7\nâ€”\nVacated property lease credit\nâ€”\nâ€”\n0.2\nâ€”\n(3.2)\nEmployee benefit plan termination\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(8.6)\nâ€”\n(8.6)\nRegulatory-related charges\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n1.0\nForeign exchange hedge\n(0.9)\n0.5\n(6.6)\n20.6\n(14.2)\nTaxation:\nRevaluation of deferred taxes resulting from 2017 Tax Act\n(130.7)\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(130.7)\nâ€”\nTaxation on business combinations\n2.8\n4.6\n4.0\n15.2\n12.0\nTaxation on deferred compensation plan market valuation\nchanges and dividend income less compensation expense\n(0.1)\n0.6\nâ€”\n2.7\n1.5\nTaxation on business optimization charges\n(3.1)\n(3.8)\n(7.0)\n(19.9)\n(16.2)\nTaxation on senior executive retirement and related costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(5.9)\nâ€”\nTaxation on vacated property lease credit\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n0.7\nTaxation on employee benefit plan termination\nâ€”\nâ€”\n3.3\nâ€”\n3.3\nTaxation on regulatory-related charges\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n(1.8)\nTaxation on foreign exchange hedge\n0.3\n(0.2)\n2.5\n(7.8)\n5.0\nRetroactive state tax adjustment\nâ€”\n12.2\nâ€”\n12.2\nâ€”\nAdjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd.
