Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They represent our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Consequently, the future results of JBG SMITH Properties (“JBG SMITH” or the “Company”) may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as “approximate”, “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “intends”, “plans”, “would”, “may” or similar expressions in this press release. We also note the following forward-looking statements: our expected annualized dividend per share and dividend yield, in the case of our construction and near-term development assets, the estimated square feet and units; and in the case of our future development assets, estimated potential development density. Many of the factors that will determine the outcome of these and our other forward-looking statements are beyond our ability to control or predict. These factors include, among others: adverse economic conditions in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the timing of and costs associated with development and property improvements, financing commitments, and general competitive factors. For further discussion of factors that could materially affect the outcome of our forward looking statements and other risks and uncertainties, see “Risk Factors” and the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements in JBG SMITH’s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and declared effective on June 26, 2017 as well as the final Information Statement (the “Information Statement”) filed with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 27, 2017. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements after the date hereof.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180118005983/en/\nJBG SMITH\nJaime Marcus\nSVP, Investor Relations\n240-333-3643\njmarcus@jbgsmith.com\nSource: JBG SMITH",
