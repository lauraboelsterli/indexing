    "text": " 30 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Ford swings to quarterly profit   \nDETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) on Wednesday reported a quarterly net profit, versus a loss in the same period in 2016 caused by pension liabilities, but said its pre-tax profit was hit by commodity costs and unfavourable currency exchange rates. \nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker reported quarterly net income of $2.41 billion or 60 cents per share, versus a loss of $781 million or 20 cents per share a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, Ford reported earnings per share of 39 cents. On that basis, analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 42 cents.
