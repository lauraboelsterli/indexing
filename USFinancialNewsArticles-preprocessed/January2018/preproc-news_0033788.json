    "text": "TOKYO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices were little changed across the board on Monday, with results of a liquidity-enhancing auction highlighting firm underlying investor demand for debt.\nThe benchmark 10-year yield was unchanged at 0.075 percent.\nThe 20-year yield dipped half a basis point to 0.585 percent.\nThe finance ministry sold 550 billion yen ($4.96 billion) of off-the-run JGBs on Monday with the auction drawing ample investor demand. The ministry regularly conducts these auctions in an attempt to enhance market liquidity.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of investor demand at auctions, rose to 3.34 from the previous saleâ€™s 3.13.\nThe auction results helped offset negative pressures from U.S. Treasuries, which saw its 10-year yield edge up to a 3-1/2-year high amid the U.S. government shutdown.\n$1 = 110.7800 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
