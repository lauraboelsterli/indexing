    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - North Korea’s nuclear program has made some strides in recent months, but the country has not yet demonstrated all the components of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), including a survivable re-entry vehicle, the vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Tuesday.\n“What he has not demonstrated yet are the fusing and targeting technologies and survivable re-entry vehicle,” U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n“It is possible he has them, so we have to place the bet that he might have them, but he hasn’t demonstrated them,” Selva, the second highest-ranking U.S. military official, added.
