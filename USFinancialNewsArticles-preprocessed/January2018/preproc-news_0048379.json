    "text": "AXIS agrees Reinsurance to Close of 2015 and prior years for legacy Novae’s Syndicate 2007\nPEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (\"AXIS Capital\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:AXS) today announced that AXIS Managing Agency Ltd (\"AXIS Managing Agency\"), a subsidiary of AXIS Capital and the managing agent of Syndicate 2007 has entered into an agreement for the Reinsurance to Close (\"RITC\") of the 2015 and prior years of account of Syndicate 2007. This RITC transaction covers the net reserve for losses and loss expenses associated with all business underwritten by Novae Group plc (“Novae”) in the 2015 and prior years.\nThe transaction resulted in a positive financial impact, which has been reflected in the fair values of Novae's assets acquired and liabilities assumed on October 2, 2017, the acquisition date.\nThe agreement has been entered into with Syndicate 2008, which is managed by StarStone Underwriting Limited (\"StarStone\"), a subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited, and is effective as of January 1, 2018. Both parties will work closely together to ensure a smooth transition.\nAlbert Benchimol, President and CEO of AXIS, commented: \"This transaction provides AXIS Capital with finality on legacy Novae business underwritten in 2015 and prior years and positions the Company to focus on advancing leadership positions in our targeted specialty risk markets.”\nA RITC transaction is a reinsurance agreement that closes one or more years of account of a syndicate by transferring the responsibility for discharging all of the liabilities that attach to the closing year(s) of account, net of the right to any income and recoveries due to the closing year(s) of account in return for a premium.\nIn conjunction with this announcement, the Company has furnished a Current Report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission containing Novae balance sheet information including details of fair value adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, the Company has furnished supplemental financial information presenting unaudited historical financial information for Novae for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and the quarterly periods therein. The balance sheet information and supplemental financial information is available in the Investor Information section of our website.\nBackground on Novae Group plc\nOn October 2, 2017, AXIS Capital acquired Novae Group plc (“Novae”), a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Novae is a diversified property and casualty (re)insurance business operating through Syndicate 2007 at Lloyd’s of London. Novae is based in London and was listed on the London Stock Exchange from 1998 until the date of acquisition. Novae’s corporate structure included Syndicate 2007, a Lloyd’s syndicate whose sole member is Novae Corporate Underwriting Limited (“NCUL”), a subsidiary of Novae whose principal activity is to act as a corporate member of Lloyd’s, underwriting insurance business on Syndicate 2007 and Novae Syndicates Limited (“NSL”) the approved managing agent for Syndicate 2007.\nOn January 8, 2018 AXIS Capital announced that it had received authorization from Lloyd’s for AXIS Managing Agency to commence management and oversight of Syndicate 2007 and *SPA 6129. The authorization became effective January 1, 2018, and creates a single managing agent structure for AXIS’ operations at Lloyd’s. Syndicate 2007 and SPA 6129 will operate alongside AXIS Syndicate 1686, which AXIS Managing Agency currently manages. AXIS has initiated plans to consolidate its Lloyd’s business into AXIS Syndicate 1686, under management of AXIS Managing Agency, and anticipates completing that process from January 1, 2019.\n* SPA 6129 is a Lloyd’s special purpose arrangement that underwrites U.S. facilities business. It launched in January 2016 as a collaboration between Novae and Securis Investment Partners LLP, an insurance linked securities fund manager.\nAbout AXIS Capital\nAXIS Capital is a Bermuda-based global provider of specialty lines insurance and treaty reinsurance with shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2017 of $5.5 billion and locations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe, Singapore, Middle East, Canada and Latin America.
