    "text": "(Reuters) - Global miner BHP on Thursday reported a 3 percent rise in second-quarter iron ore production year over year and said it expects to meet its full-year target as prices for the steelmaking ingredient outperform forecasts.\nBHP’s iron ore output climbed to 72 million tonnes for the three months ended Dec. 31 versus 70 million tonnes a year ago.\nUBS had forecast a figure of 69 million tonnes on a 100 percent basis that includes ore mined on behalf of joint venture partners.\nBHP maintained internal guidance that it would mine 275 million-280 million tonnes of iron ore in the fiscal year to June 30.\n“A strong operating performance in the first half allowed us\nto capture the benefit of higher prices,” BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said in the group’s quarterly operations review.\nEarlier this week, rival Rio Tinto reported shipping a record 90 million tonnes last quarter. The iron ore price stands at around $75 per tonne. However, uncertainty over Chinese demand has led to forecasts for prices to fall to between $51 and $64 a tonne as the year progresses.\nSpot iron ore last traded below $52 in June 2017.\nIn other commodities, BHP’s copper output jumped 20 percent to 429,000 tonnes in the quarter helped by a rise in production from its Escondida copper mine in Chile. Petroleum production slipped by 6 percent to 48 million barrels of oil.\nIn the closely watched U.S. onshore shale division, the company said it continued to assess alternatives to exit its onshore U.S. assets and that it would also continue to explore a demerger or an initial public offering.\nLast month, BHP appointed four investment bankers to help it sell or a spin off the division, which has proved a disastrous investment for the company.\nReporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ",
