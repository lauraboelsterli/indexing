I‘m trying to work hard and stay focussed on each match, to show my best tennis and challenge myself to go even higher and better,” she said. \nFormer champion Kaia Kanepi, a winner in 2012, dominated her match against Lesia Tsurenko to seal a 6-4, 6-3 victory and a meeting against second seed Karolina Pliskova who dumped out American CiCi Bellis 6-1 6-1. \nMeanwhile, Aliaksandra Sasnovich sealed a comeback win over Kanepi’s Estonian compatriot Anett Kontaveit. The qualifier from Belarus, who swept aside Kristina Mladenovic in the first round, prevailed 1-6 7-6(2) 6-3 and faces Alize Cornet next.
