    "text": "Sales increase 69% year-over-year (9% organically)\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE: COL) today reported sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of $2.011 billion, a 69% increase from the same period in fiscal year 2017, or 9% organic growth excluding $716 million of revenue from the acquisition of B/E Aerospace. First quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings per share was $1.69 compared to $1.10 in the prior year's first quarter. Earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 included a 37 cent discrete income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $1.59 compared to $1.22 in the prior year's first quarter (see the supplemental schedule in this press release for a reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share).\n\"I'm proud of our execution this quarter, as we achieved 9% organic revenue growth, highlighted by strong sales performance in our Commercial Systems and Government Systems businesses. Our fiscal year 2018 is off to a great start,\" said Rockwell Collins Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg. \"In addition, Rockwell Collins' shareowners overwhelmingly approved the acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies Corporation. This milestone brings us one step closer to combining our capabilities to offer more integrated and innovative solutions to our customers.\"\nFollowing is a discussion of fiscal year 2018 first quarter sales and earnings for each business segment.\nCommercial Systems\nCommercial Systems, which provides aviation electronics systems, products and services to air transport, business and regional aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide, achieved 2018 first quarter results as summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q1 FY 18 Q1 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Commercial Systems sales Original equipment $ 339 $ 318 7 %\nAftermarket 265 225 18 %\nWide-body in-flight entertainment 4 6 (33)% Total Commercial Systems sales $ 608 $ 549 11 %\nOperating earnings $ 139 $ 125 11 %\nOperating margin rate 22.9 % 22.8 % 10 bps Original equipment sales increased due to higher Airbus A350 and Boeing 737 production rates, as well as higher business jet equipment deliveries, partially offset by lower customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased due to higher used aircraft equipment sales, higher regulatory mandate upgrade activity, higher spares provisioning, and higher service and support activity. Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $14 million and operating margin increased 10 basis points over the prior year due to increased earnings from higher sales volume and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher company-funded R&D expense, higher pre-production engineering amortization, and higher employee incentive compensation costs.\nInterior Systems\nOur Interior Systems segment was created with the acquisition of B/E Aerospace on April 13, 2017. Interior Systems supplies a comprehensive portfolio of cabin interior products and services to aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide. Beginning in 2018, thermal and electronic systems product lines previously included in Interior products and services within the Interior Systems segment are now being reported in the Government Systems segment. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for revised fiscal year 2017 quarterly sales that conform to the current presentation. Results from the first quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q1 FY 18 Interior Systems sales Interior products and services $ 356 Aircraft seating 300 Total Interior Systems sales $ 656 Operating earnings $ 94 Operating margin rate 14.3 % Interior Systems contributed $656 million of sales and $94 million of operating earnings to the first quarter of 2018. Interior Systems operating earnings for the first quarter of 2018 includes $58 million of intangible asset amortization expense partially offset by $30 million of income from the amortization of acquired contract liabilities.\nOn a pro-forma basis, excluding the product lines now reported in Government Systems referenced above, sales for Interior Systems decreased 4% in the first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in pro-forma sales was primarily attributable to the timing of retrofit seating sales and the decline in super first class seating sales, partially offset by higher original equipment deliveries for Boeing 737 advanced lavatories, higher linefit seating sales, and higher oxygen system deliveries across multiple platforms.\nGovernment Systems\nGovernment Systems provides a broad range of electronic products, systems and services to customers including the U.S. Department of Defense, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and ministries of defense around the world. Beginning in 2018, the product lines referenced above previously included in the Interior Systems segment are now being reported in Communication and navigation within the Government Systems segment. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for revised fiscal year 2017 quarterly sales that conform to the current presentation. Results from the first quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q1 FY 18 Q1 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Government Systems sales Avionics $ 333 $ 319 4% Communication and navigation 240 156 54% Total Government Systems sales $ 573 $ 475 21% Operating earnings $ 109 $ 96 14% Operating margin rate 19.0 % 20.2 % (120) bps Avionics sales increased due to higher fixed wing development program sales, as well as higher deliveries for various fighter platforms, partially offset by lower simulation and training sales. Communication and navigation sales increased $60 million due to the B/E Aerospace acquisition mentioned above. In addition, communication and navigation sales increased 15% organically due to higher test and training range and legacy communication sales. Operating earnings increased $13 million and operating margin declined 120 basis points over the prior year as increased earnings from higher sales volume were tempered by unfavorable sales mix, higher employee compensation costs, and higher pre-production engineering amortization.\nInformation Management Services\nInformation Management Services (IMS) provides communication services, systems integration and security solutions across the aviation, airport, rail and nuclear security markets. Results from the first quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q1 FY 18 Q1 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Information Management Services sales $ 174 $ 169 3 %\nOperating earnings $ 29 $ 30 (3)% Operating margin rate 16.7 % 17.8 % (110) bps IMS sales increased due to 8% growth in aviation related revenues driven by increased usage of connectivity services, partially offset by a decline of non-aviation revenues of 10% due to timing of equipment deliveries on nuclear security mandate programs. IMS operating earnings and operating margin declined due to asset disposition and customer bankruptcy costs in the current year, partially offset by increased earnings from higher sales volume.\nCorporate and Financial Highlights\nIncome Taxes\nThe company's effective income tax rate on GAAP earnings was (8.9%) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to a rate of 28.6% for the same period last year. The lower current year effective income tax rate was primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation favorably impacted the company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 due to a $102 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities and a lower US federal statutory tax rate, partially offset by a $40 million tax obligation related to unremitted foreign earnings.\nThe company's effective income tax rate on adjusted earnings was 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 28.8% in the same period in the prior year. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for a reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings.\nCash Flow\nCash used for operating activities was $259 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to a use of cash of $101 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The increase in cash used for operating activities was due primarily to higher payments for production inventory and other operating costs, as well as higher employee incentive payments, partially offset by higher cash receipts from customers.\nThe Company paid a dividend on its common stock of 33 cents per share, or $54 million, in the first quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nIn light of the pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\"), the Company will not hold a conference call for its quarterly results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company plans to file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter with the SEC on or about January 26, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nSee the supplemental schedule included in this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted income from continuing operations, and effective income tax rate on adjusted earnings.\nBusiness Highlights\nAzerbaijan Airlines gets connected from the cockpit to cabin with help from Rockwell Collins\nAzerbaijan Airlines selected Rockwell Collins to provide its global, high-speed broadband in-flight connectivity, overhead in-flight entertainment and a full suite of advanced avionics for 10 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\nEmirates’ 777X fleet to feature dual HGS™ from Rockwell Collins\nRockwell Collins’ Head-up Guidance System was selected by Emirates for the airline's 150 777X aircraft on order.\nU.S. Air Force to advance its F-16 communications capabilities with next-generation radio from Rockwell Collins\nA U.S. Air Force F-16 will be the first to be equipped with Rockwell Collins’ next-generation ARC-210 RT-2036(C) networked communications airborne radio, the first ever to include Mobile User Objective System and support Soldier Radio Waveform capabilities.\nRockwell Collins selected by U.S. Navy for new E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Tactics Trainer\nRockwell Collins was selected by the U.S. Navy to provide a new E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Tactics Trainer in support of the E-2D Hawkeye Integrated Training Systems III program.\nRockwell Collins selected to support avionics for U.S. Special Operations Command\nRockwell Collins was awarded a five-year, $30.7 million contract by the Technology Application Contracting Office to provide avionics repair and logistics, field service support and spares management for Rockwell Collins’ Common Avionics Architecture System.\nU.S. Air Force to preserve KC-10 avionics upgrade investment through sustainment contract with Rockwell Collins\nThe U.S. Air Force Lifecycle Management Center awarded Rockwell Collins a contract to provide maintenance and sustainment of KC-10 avionics systems and engineering services over the next nine years.\nU.S. Army to enhance AVCATT collective training system with upgraded Rockwell Collins helmet mounted display\nThe U.S. Army selected a new version of Rockwell Collins’ SimEye™ Helmet Mounted Display to be used within Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer systems.\nRockwell Collins to supply next generation of forward observer training for Australian Defence\nRockwell Collins will supply and install eight customized domes and 11 desktop trainer simulation solutions for the Australian Army and Air Force Joint Terminal Attack Controllers and Joint Forward Observer communities.\nRockwell Collins named one of America’s Most JUST Companies in 2017 by Forbes and JUST Capital\nRockwell Collins was named America’s Most JUST Company in the Aerospace & Defense industry, according to Forbes and JUST Capital, a nonprofit that ranks the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States on the issues Americans care about most.\nMaldives’ main airports deploy Rockwell Collins’ passenger processing platform to streamline the passenger experience\nVelana International Airport and Gan International Airport selected Rockwell Collins’ ARINC vMUSE™ Common Use Passenger Processing System to improve airport processes while expediting the check-in process for passengers.\nAbout Rockwell Collins\nRockwell Collins (NYSE: COL) is a leader in aviation and high-integrity solutions for commercial and military customers around the world.
