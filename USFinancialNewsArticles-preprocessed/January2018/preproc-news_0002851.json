    "text": "January 4th, 2018 South America \nMexico is failing to root out money laundering because it uses a reactive case-by-case investigation approach and law enforcement agencies suffer from corruption, according to a report on Wednesday by an international body that fights illicit cash. \nMoney laundering “is not investigated and prosecuted in a proactive and systematic fashion…. Consequently, the number of prosecutions and convictions for money laundering are very low. Significant shortcomings were found in the way in which money-laundering cases are investigated,” said the report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). \nThe group is an inter-governmental organization established in 1989. \n  reuters.com",
