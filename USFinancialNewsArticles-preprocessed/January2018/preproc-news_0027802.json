    "text": "Taylor Hall scored 34 seconds into overtime and the New Jersey Devils regrouped after blowing a two-goal lead to claim a 4-3 win over the Washington Capitals on Thursday night in Newark.\nHall, named to the NHL All-Star Game, continues to hold a hot stick. He’s riding a six-game point streak in which he’s netted five goals and six assists. The Devils have now won two straight games to maintain their hold on second place in the Metropolitan Division, trailing the Capitals by five points.\nHall netted the winner in dynamic fashion, first chipping the puck past a defender for a breakaway and then lifting a top-corner shot past Washington goaltender Braden Holtby.\nDevils goalie Keith Kinkaid made 16 saves to collect the win at the Prudential Center.\nThe Devils controlled play for much of the night, while Washington looked very much like a team that was playing the first game after its bye week and wasn’t able to practice after regrouping because of weather issues. The Capitals, one of the most potent teams in the NHL, struggled to find their form, going nearly 26 minutes with only one shot on goal from early in the first period until near midway in the second period.\nDrew Stafford and Miles Wood both scored breakaway goals for the Devils, who used their speed to their advantage. Andy Greene also tallied a goal in the win. Defenseman Sami Vatanen collected three assists to make his 300th NHL game even more memorable.\nBrett Connolly netted a pair of goals - including the game-tying marker with less than four minutes remaining in regulation - for the Capitals. Dmitry Orlov also scored for Washington, which has a 12-0-2 record in its last 14 games against the Devils.\nHoltby stopped 28 shots for the Capitals, who had won six of seven games before their break.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
