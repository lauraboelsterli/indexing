    "text": "(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett said on Wednesday he will never invest in cryptocurrencies.\n“I can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,” Buffett told CNBC in an interview.\nBuffett’s comments come a day after JPMorgan & Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said he regrets calling bitcoin a fraud, referring to comments he made at a banking conference in September.\nBitcoin has taken the investing world by storm, surging to a high of more than $19,000 and created a divide on Wall Street about whether it is a legitimate financial instrument.\nBitcoin was down around 3 percent at $13,981.53.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
