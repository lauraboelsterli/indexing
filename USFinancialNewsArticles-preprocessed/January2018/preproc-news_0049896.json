    "text": "ELKHART, Ind., Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Patrick Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: PATK) (\"Patrick\" or the \"Company\") announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company's common stock over the next 24 months (the \"2018 Repurchase Plan\"). Share repurchases will be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.\n\"We continue to evaluate share repurchases in alignment with our focused capital allocation strategy and this authorization reflects the confidence that our Board of Directors and management team have in Patrick's outlook and our commitment to driving shareholder value,\" said Todd M. Cleveland, Chief Executive Officer.\nThe timing and amount of purchases under the program are discretionary and will be determined by management and the Board of Directors based upon market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. The repurchase of any shares under the new stock repurchase program will be subject to restrictions under insider trading laws and the Company's self-imposed blackout periods, as well as the timing of the release of the Company's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for subsequent fiscal periods. All or part of the repurchases may be implemented under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which would allow repurchases under pre-set terms at times when the Company might otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed blackout periods.\nThe Company's previous stock repurchase program, which was originally announced in January 2016 (the \"2016 Repurchase Plan\") and authorized repurchases of up to $50 million over a 24-month period, expired in January 2018. The Company repurchased in the aggregate 75,153 shares under the 2016 Repurchase Plan at an average price of $31.25 per share for a total cost of approximately $2.35 million.\nAbout Patrick Industries\nPatrick Industries, Inc. is a major manufacturer of component products and distributor of building products serving the recreational vehicle, manufactured housing, marine, kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, fixtures and commercial furnishings, and other industrial markets and operates coast-to-coast through locations in 20 states and in China.
