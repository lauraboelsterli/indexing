Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, among others, statements about TSYS’ belief that the acquisition of Cayan will drive revenue, Cayan’s growth trajectory and the belief that there is still untapped market opportunity. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS’ management and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including our ability to achieve expected synergies and successfully complete the integration of Cayan, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in TSYS’ filings with the SEC, including its 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise except as required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180111005626/en/\nTSYS\nCorporate Communications:\nEmily J.
