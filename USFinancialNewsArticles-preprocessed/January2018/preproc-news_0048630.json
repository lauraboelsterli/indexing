We offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who were killed and wish for the speedy recovery of those wounded,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. \nGlenn Selig, a spokesman for Trump campaign adviser Rick Gates, was among the Americans who were killed, according to a statement from Selig’s company, Selig Multimedia. \nSelig represented Gates, who has been charged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with President Donald Trump’s campaign. \n“Glenn was in Kabul on a potential success story involving Afghanistan and its steps to battle extremism. The focus was highlighting the country’s new president and constructing a democracy forum event for Afghani women,” Selig Multimedia said. \nAt least 20 people were killed when five gunman dressed in Afghan army uniforms stormed the Kabul hotel on Saturday night. Seven Ukrainians and one German were among the dead. [nL4N1PH41P] \nThe Taliban, which attacked the same hotel in 2011, claimed responsibility for the attack, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.
