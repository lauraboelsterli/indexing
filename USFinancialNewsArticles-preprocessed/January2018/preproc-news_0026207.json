    "text": "January 17, 2018 / 12:07 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago Bitcoin slumps to $10,000 after losing half its value Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid to $10,000 on Wednesday for the first time since Dec. 1, leaving the cryptocurrency down by close to half from its peak hit last month. \nBitcoin, the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency, fell more than 11 percent to hit $10,000 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, amid worries about a regulatory clampdown. \nThe cryptocurrency touched a peak of almost $20,000 in December - and indeed crossed over that threshold on some exchanges - but has since been roiled by several large sell-offs.
