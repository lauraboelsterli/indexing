They closed down 3.4 percent on Wednesday. \nSecurity     that uses chips from Intel,   \nIntel said it has started   the security issues, which it claimed would not have any financial or market-share impact. \nThe chipmaker said the issue was not a design flaw, but it would   system. \n“We believe the impact to Intel’s financials and long-term market share is minimal,” Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a note. \nEvercore analysts agreed with Shah and said they do not expect a material impact as Intel has previously has provided patches for several bugs without causing financial repercussions. \nMorgan Stanley analysts said the concerns over the decline in performance of its chips due to the flaws were overblown. \n“We see this as primarily a public relations issue, rather than a business issue,” the analysts wrote in a note.
