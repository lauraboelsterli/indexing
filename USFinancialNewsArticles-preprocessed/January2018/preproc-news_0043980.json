    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 4:07 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Maxwell back in Australia ODI squad as cover for Finch Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Batsman Glenn Maxwell has been recalled to the Australian squad as cover for Aaron Finch, who was ruled out of Fridayâ€™s fourth one-day international against England in Adelaide with a hamstring injury. \nMaxwell, who has played 80 ODIs for his country and can be one of the most destructive batsmen in world cricket on his day, was surprisingly left out when the squad was announced earlier this month. \nCaptain Steve Smith and chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns had said at the time he needed to be more consistent at the international level to get back into the team. \nThe 29-year-old last played for the one-day side on the tour of India last September. \nFinch will be assessed ahead of the fifth ODI in Perth on Sunday. England have an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru",
