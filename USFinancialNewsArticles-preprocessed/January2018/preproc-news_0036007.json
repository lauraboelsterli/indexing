Since the election, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained more than 42 percent as of Monday's close; the S&P 500 has gained more than 32 percent; the Nasdaq is up more than 42 percent.\nTrump has repeatedly taken credit for the U.S. stock market's record run.\n@realDonald Trump: Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!\nSchwarzman had Trump's ear as chairman of the president's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of influential American CEOs that was set up to periodically to give Trump advice.\nThe group disbanded last summer as CEOs revolted against Trump's equivocal comments about white supremacist violence at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nTrump is expected to speak at Davos later this week, touting his \"America First\" message.\nSchwarzman, co-founder of private equity giant Blackstone, said he'd been told the president's speech is \"pretty good\" adding whatever Trump says will be heavily \"considered.\"\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
