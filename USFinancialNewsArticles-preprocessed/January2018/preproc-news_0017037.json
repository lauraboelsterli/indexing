    "text": "SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (IFR) - Newly priced bonds were firmer on Thursday, lending support to a hectic issuance schedule in the Asian primary markets.\nAt least seven Asian deals were launched today despite concerns raised over reports that China was scaling back purchases of US Treasuries, which sent Treasury yields up.\nBut sentiment improved later in the day, opening up a window for a couple of late deal launches.\n“People on the ground are now looking for clearer cues from the upcoming release on CPI and production data from the US,” said one trader.\nAmong the new bonds priced yesterday, BOSC’s 3.125% 2021s were tighter at 123bp/122bp over Treasuries from a reoffer spread at 127bp over 2-year Treasuries.\nLai Fung’s 5.265% 2023s were indicated at bids of around reoffer at par, while ICTSI’s 5.875% perps callable in 2022 were firmer at 100.5/100.3 after pricing yesterday at par.\nSovereign bonds, particularly from China and South Korea, continued to enjoy a strong bid.\nChina’s 2022s were heard at a wide range of 4bp/1bp, having rallied since December when Quote: s were above 15bp, while the 2027s were at 17bp/14bp, tightening from the levels of around 30bp seen last month.\nAsia credit spreads narrowed with the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan IG index Quote: d at 60bp/61bp, 2bp tighter from yesterday.\nReporting by Kit Yin Boey; Editing by Vincent Baby\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
