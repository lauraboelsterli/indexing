    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC), a mobile technology research and development company, today announced the upcoming retirement of three of its executives, as well as the appointment of Timothy J. Berghuis as Chief Licensing Officer.\nThe following executives have notified the company of their plans to retire in April of 2018:\nLawrence F. Shay, Senior Executive Vice President, Future Wireless, and Chief Intellectual Property Counsel – Larry Shay joined InterDigital in 2001 as Chief Legal Officer, and has served the company in progressive roles related to intellectual property and licensing, most recently as head of InterDigital’s Future Wireless business, which encompasses all cellular wireless technology research and development under InterDigital Labs as well as the company’s related licensing activities. During Mr. Shay’s tenure, InterDigital’s licensing program has become one of the premier programs in the wireless industry.\nScott A McQuilkin, Senior Executive Vice President, Innovation – Scott McQuilkin joined InterDigital as Chief Financial Officer in 2007, and in 2012 transitioned to a more senior role in leadership of external investments, technology incubation, and innovation. In that role, he has pioneered InterDigital’s external incubation strategy, diversified the company’s sources of innovation, and overseen venture investment efforts.\nDr. Byung K. Yi, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer – B.K. Yi joined InterDigital in 2014. As InterDigital’s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Yi has advised on the company’s technology direction as well as overseen the company’s Innovation Partners group and managed InterDigital’s Technical Advisory Council.\nThe company was also pleased to announce that licensing team member Tim Berghuis, currently Vice President, Patent Licensing and Strategy, has been elevated to the role of Chief Licensing Officer, in which he will assume responsibility for all of the company’s licensing activities. Mr. Berghuis joined InterDigital in 2001 from Motorola, and has occupied positions of increasing responsibility in the company’s licensing team. He holds a Bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from Marquette University, a Master’s in mechanical engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago, and an MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\nMr. McQuilkin’s responsibilities will be transitioned to other executives within InterDigital, and the company has begun the search for a new CTO. All three retiring executives will remain with InterDigital through at least April 1, 2018, to help ensure an orderly and successful transition of responsibilities.\n“Larry, Scott and B.K. have each made tremendous contributions to the success of InterDigital, and their guidance and leadership has been invaluable in navigating the business and technology challenges of our fast-changing industry. We’re grateful for their service, and happy that they’ve agreed to help in ensuring a smooth transition,” said William J. Merritt, President and CEO of InterDigital. “We’re also very pleased to recognize the contributions of Tim Berghuis in licensing, and welcome him to his new role leading what’s rightly considered one of the top licensing programs in the industry.”\nAbout InterDigital ®\nInterDigital develops mobile technologies that are at the core of devices, networks, and services worldwide.
