    "text": "HONG KONG, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Indian infrastructure firm IL&FS Transportation Networks has completed its sale of a 900 million yuan ($138.23 million) three-year dim sum bond priced at 8 percent, marking the first high-yield dim sum deal in more than a year.\nOrder books for the bond amounted to more than 2 billion yuan from 52 accounts. Asian investors accounted for 97 percent and European investors took up 3 percent.\nFund and asset managers accounted for 92 percent, followed by commercial banks at 5 percent and private banks at 3 percent.\nThe offshore yuan bond market lost momentum over the past few years as the yuan’s increased volatility and depreciation expectation dampened investors’ appetite to hold yuan assets.
