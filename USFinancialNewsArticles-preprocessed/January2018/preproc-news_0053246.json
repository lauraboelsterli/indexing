    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance ministry has named the official in charge of preparing Britain’s annual budget, Clare Lombardelli, to act as its chief economic advisor.\nLombardelli replaces Dave Ramsden who became a Bank of England deputy governor in September. She joined the finance ministry in 2005 after starting her career as an economist at the British central bank.\nLombardelli, who currently is director of strategy, planning and budget, will advise finance minister Philip Hammond on issues including Britain’s departure from the European Union.\nShe will also help to select a successor to BoE Governor Mark Carney, who is due to step down next year.\nBetween 2012 and 2015 Lombardelli was principal private secretary to then finance minister George Osborne. She also served as an economic advisor to former Prime Minister David Cameron and was seconded to the International Monetary Fund at the time of the euro zone debt crisis.\nHer appointment is effective from April 3.\nReporting by David Milliken; Editing by William Schomberg\n ",
