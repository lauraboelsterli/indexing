    "text": "Petrobras agrees to pay $2.95B to settle case in the US Published 53 Mins Ago The Associated Press SHARES \nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) â€” Brazil's state-run oil giant Petrobras has agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle lawsuits in the United States over the sprawling corruption scandal that has ensnared dozens of officials and business executives across Latin America. \nThe company said in a statement on Wednesday that the deal ends a legal battle with investors who allegedly suffered losses after a corruption probe exposed mushrooming corruption in the company. \nPetrobras also says it was a victim of the corruption scheme and that the \"the agreement does not constitute any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct\" by the company. \nThe decision still needs to be approved by an U.S. judge. \nThe Brazilian company says it proposes to pay for the settlement in three installments.",
