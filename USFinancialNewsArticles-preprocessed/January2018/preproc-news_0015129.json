(OTC Pink: FSRL) (\"First Reliance\" or the \"Company\") today announced that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions have granted the regulatory approvals necessary for the pending mergers of Independence Bancshares, Inc. (\"Independence\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Independence National Bank, with and into First Reliance and its subsidiary, First Reliance Bank. The merger is expected to close on January 19, 2018, with full conversion of the banks' operating systems scheduled for March 5, 2018. Additionally, First Reliance and Independence announces that the merger received the necessary approval from the shareholders of Independence at a special meeting on January 9, 2018.
