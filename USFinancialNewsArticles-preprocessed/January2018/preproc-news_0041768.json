    "text": "Net earnings were $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.16 per share. Full year net earnings were $104.4 million, or $0.95 per share, for the year ended 2017. Income tax expense included a one-time charge of $13.2 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding the tax effect of the $13.2 million, earnings were $31.1 million, for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.28 per share, and were $117.6 million, or $1.07 per share, for the year ended 2017.\nONTARIO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CVB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:CVBF) and its subsidiary, Citizens Business Bank (“the Company”), announced earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nCVB Financial Corp. reported net income of $17.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared with $29.7 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $27.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $0.16 for the fourth quarter, compared to $0.27 for the prior quarter and $0.25 for the same period last year. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time charge of $13.2 million due to the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”). Excluding the impact of the $13.2 million DTA revaluation, net income totaled $31.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.28 per share. Net earnings grew by $1.4 million over the prior quarter and $4.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, when the impact of the DTA revaluation is excluded.\nChris Myers, President and CEO of Citizens Business Bank, commented, “Excluding the nonrecurring charge to tax expense, fourth quarter net income was $31.1 million and year-end earnings were $117.6 million, both all-time highs for the Bank. 2017 was truly an outstanding year.”\nNet income of $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 produced an annualized return on beginning equity of 6.58%, an annualized return on average equity (“ROAE”) of 6.48%, and an annualized return on average assets (“ROAA”) of 0.85%. Excluding the impact of the $13.2 million DTA revaluation resulting from the Tax Reform Act, ROAE and ROAA were 11.28% and 1.48%, respectively. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 produced an annualized return on average equity of 10.60% and an annualized return on average assets of 1.33%. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 41.81%, compared to 42.44% for the third quarter of 2017 and 47.30% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income totaled $104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, our highest in company history. This represented a $3.0 million increase, or 2.94%, from the prior year. When the DTA revaluation is excluded, net income increased by $16.2 million, or 15.96% over 2016. Earnings for 2017 included $8.5 million in loan loss provision recapture, compared to $6.4 million in loan loss recapture in 2016. 2017 also included a $2.9 million net gain from an eminent domain condemnation of one of our business financial center buildings, a $906,000 net gain on the sale of a branch acquired from Valley Business Bank (“VBB”), and a $542,000 net gain on the sale of our operations and technology center. This was offset by $13.2 million in nonrecurring income tax expense resulting from the DTA revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.95 for 2017, compared to $0.94 for 2016. Excluding the impact of the $13.2 million DTA revaluation, net income totaled $117.6 million, or $1.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 produced an annualized return on beginning equity of 10.54%, a ROAE of 9.84% and a ROAA of 1.26%. Excluding the impact of the DTA revaluation, ROAE and ROAA were 11.08% and 1.42%, respectively, for the year ended 2017. The efficiency ratio for 2017 was 43.84%, compared to 46.73% for 2016.\nNet interest income before recapture of loan loss provision was $71.3 million for the quarter, which was a $464,000 decrease, or 0.65%, over the third quarter of 2017, and a $5.8 million increase, or 8.91%, over the fourth quarter of 2016. Total interest income and fees on loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $55.9 million decreased $125,000, or 0.22%, from the third quarter of 2017 but increased $6.7 million, or 13.54%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Total investment income of $16.9 million decreased $532,000, or 3.05%, from $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and grew by $83,000, or 0.49%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense decreased $87,000, or 4.08%, from the third quarter of 2017 and grew by $121,000 in comparison with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income before recapture of loan loss provision was $278.9 million for 2017, a $21.9 million increase, or 8.50%, over 2016. Total interest income and fees on loans grew by $21.1 million, or 10.95%, over 2016 to $214.1 million. Total investment income increased by $2.9 million, or 4.22%, to $70.8 million from 2016. Interest expense increased by $320,000, or 4.01%, in 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, $1.5 million of loan loss provision was recaptured, compared to $1.5 million recaptured for the prior quarter, and $4.4 million recaptured for the same period last year. Recapture of provision for loan losses totaled $8.5 million for 2017, compared to $6.4 million for 2016.\nNoninterest income was $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $10.0 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $2.6 million increase when compared to the third quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of a $2.9 million net gain due to an eminent domain condemnation and a $906,000 net gain on sale of a branch, as previously described. The third quarter of 2017 included a $542,000 net gain on sale of our operations and technology center which was classified as an asset held-for-sale at December 31, 2016. Excluding these net gains from sales and eminent domain condemnation, noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $714,000 quarter-over-quarter and increased by $370,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income was $42.1 million, compared to $35.6 million for 2016. Excluding net gains from sales in both 2017 and 2016, as well as the net gain from the eminent domain condemnation in 2017, noninterest income grew by $3.6 million, or 10.52%.\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $35.1 million, compared to $34.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $34.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $351,000 quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily the result of a $658,000 increase in professional service and legal expense and a $300,000 increase in marketing and promotion expense. This was partially offset by a decrease of $290,000 in occupancy costs and a $175,000 decrease in acquisition expense. The third quarter of 2017 included $405,000 in legal expense recoveries. The $125,000 increase in noninterest expense over the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $422,000 increase in professional service expense, and a $417,000 increase in occupancy and equipment costs. This was partially offset by $4.1 million in nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulting from a fair value adjustment of $2.6 million for our operations and technology center and a $1.5 million accrual for the settlement of a wage-hour class action lawsuit. As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.67%, compared to 1.65% for the third quarter of 2017 and 1.72% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNoninterest expense of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.0 million higher than the prior year. The $4.4 million, or 5.37%, increase in compensation and benefit expense includes additional staff from the acquisition of VBB and normal year-over-year escalation in wages. The $1.1 million year-over-year increase in occupancy and equipment expense included both temporary and permanent expenses related to the acquisition of VBB and the build-out and relocation to our new operations and technology building. Acquisition related expenses were $2.3 million, up $354,000 from the prior year. As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.70% for both 2017 and 2016.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, before provision for loan losses, was $71.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $71.7 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $65.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our net interest margin (tax equivalent) was 3.68% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.70% for the third quarter of 2017 and 3.47% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total average earning asset yields (tax equivalent) were 3.79% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.81% for the third quarter of 2017 and 3.57% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total cost of funds was 0.11% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.12% for the third quarter of 2017 and 0.11% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin over the third quarter of 2017 was the result of a decrease in earning asset yield that primarily resulted from a five basis point decrease in loan yields. While overall loan yields were positively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 by $762,000 in additional discount accretion as a result of the payoff of a purchase credit impaired loan, third quarter loan yields were impacted more by $1.0 million in interest recovery from a troubled debt restructured (“TDR”) that paid in full. Excluding these two items that impacted both third and fourth quarter net interest income, the adjusted net interest margin would be 3.64% and 3.65% for the fourth and third quarter of 2017, respectively. The tax equivalent yield on investments remained unchanged quarter-over-quarter. The 21 basis point increase in the net interest margin over the fourth quarter of 2016 was due in part to a 13 basis point increase in loan yields. The remaining eight basis point increase can be attributed mostly to a change in the mix of earning assets, as average loans increased by $441.9 million and represented 60.9% of earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 56.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses, totaled $278.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $257.1 million for 2016. Our net interest margin (tax equivalent) was 3.63% for 2017, compared to 3.46% for 2016. Total average earning asset yields (tax equivalent) was 3.74%, compared to 3.57% for 2016. The increase in the net interest margin over 2016 was the result of an increase in our earning asset yield that resulted from a combination of a three basis point increase in loan yields and the change in mix of earning assets represented by an increase in loans as a percentage of earning assets growing from 55.3% in 2016 to 59.3% in 2017. The non-tax equivalent yield on investments increased seven basis points year-over-year.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduces the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limits certain tax deductions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time charge against earnings of $13.2 million as a result of the tax rate reduction and re-measurement of its net deferred tax assets.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was 64.51% and 44.70%, respectively, compared with 37.50% for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the DTA revaluation adjustment, our effective tax rate was 38.25% and 37.70% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by the tax effects related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits of approximately $1.6 million in our provision for income taxes, rather than as an adjustment of paid-in capital. Our estimated annual effective tax rate also varies depending upon the level of tax-advantaged income as well as available tax credits.\nAssets\nThe Company reported total assets of $8.27 billion at December 31, 2017. This represented a decrease of $33.4 million, or 0.40%, from total assets of $8.30 billion at September 30, 2017. Interest-earning assets of $7.80 billion at December 31, 2017 decreased $13.6 million, or 0.17%, when compared with $7.82 billion at September 30, 2017. The decrease in interest-earning assets was primarily due to a $113.2 million decrease in investment securities. This was partially offset by an $84.2 million increase in total loans and a $17.9 million increase in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve.\nTotal assets of $8.27 billion at December 31, 2017 increased $196.9 million, or 2.44%, from total assets of $8.07 billion at December 31, 2016. Interest-earning assets totaled $7.80 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $156.8 million, or 2.05%, when compared with earning assets of $7.64 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily due to a $435.6 million increase in total loans, which was partially offset by a $271.3 million decrease in investment securities.\nInvestment Securities\nTotal investment securities were $2.91 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $113.2 million, or 3.74%, from $3.02 billion at September 30, 2017 and a decrease of $271.3 million, or 8.52%, from $3.18 billion at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, investment securities held-to-maturity (“HTM”) totaled $829.9 million, an $18.5 million decrease, or 2.18%, from September 30, 2017 and an $81.8 million decrease, or 8.97%, from December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, investment securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) totaled $2.08 billion, inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized gain of $2.9 million. AFS securities declined by $94.7 million, or 4.35%, from September 30, 2017, and declined by $189.5 million, or 8.35%, from December 31, 2016.\nCombined, the AFS and HTM investments in mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) totaled $2.43 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.52 billion at September 30, 2017 and $2.62 billion at December 31, 2016. Virtually all of our MBS and CMOs are issued or guaranteed by government or government sponsored enterprises, which have the implied guarantee of the U.S. Government.\nOur combined AFS and HTM municipal securities totaled $324.2 million as of December 31, 2017. These securities are located in 29 states. Our largest concentrations of holdings are located in Minnesota at 21.84%, Texas at 10.05%, Massachusetts at 9.97%, and Connecticut at 5.47%.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we purchased $43.8 million of MBS/CMO securities with an average yield of approximately 2.41%.\nLoans\nTotal loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, of $4.83 billion at December 31, 2017 increased by $84.2 million, or 1.77%, from September 30, 2017. The increase in total loans was principally due to growth of $77.2 million in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans and $37.8 million in commercial real estate loans. The overall increase in loans and leases were partially offset by decreases of $15.4 million in commercial and industrial loans, $8.5 million in single-family residential (“SFR”) mortgage loans, and $6.6 million in consumer and other loans. The majority of growth in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans is seasonal.\nTotal loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, of $4.83 billion at December 31, 2017 increased by $435.6 million, or 9.91%, from December 31, 2016. The increase in total loans included $309.7 million of loans acquired from VBB in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the acquired VBB loans, the $125.9 million, or 2.86%, increase in total loans was principally due to growth of $182.8 million in commercial real estate loans and $12.8 million in Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. This growth was partially offset by decreases of $21.4 million in consumer and other loans, $17.2 million in commercial and industrial loans, $16.3 million in construction loans, and $14.7 million in SFR loans.\nDeposits & Customer Repurchase Agreements\nDeposits of $6.55 billion and customer repurchase agreements of $553.8 million totaled $7.10 billion at December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $37.5 million, or 0.53%, when compared with total deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $7.06 billion at September 30, 2017. Deposits and customer repurchase agreements increased by $187.9 million, or 2.72%, when compared with total deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $6.91 billion at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits were $3.85 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $62.4 million, or 1.60%, when compared to September 30, 2017, and an increase of $172.9 million, or 4.71%, when compared to $3.67 billion at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing deposits were 58.75% of total deposits, compared to 59.15% at September 30, 2017 and 58.22% at December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in total deposits from the end of 2016 included $172.5 million of noninterest-bearing deposits and $361.8 million of total deposits acquired from VBB during the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold a branch acquired from VBB, which included approximately $27 million in total deposits.\nOur average cost of total deposits was 0.09% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, unchanged from both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Our cost of total deposits including customer repurchase agreements was 0.10% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nFHLB Advance, Other Borrowings and Debentures\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no short-term borrowings, compared to $63.0 million at September 30, 2017 and $53.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $25.8 million of junior subordinated debentures, unchanged from September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These debentures bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.38% and mature in 2036.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $59.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $60.6 million at September 30, 2017 and $61.5 million at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 was increased by net recoveries on loans of $454,000 and was reduced by a $1.5 million loan loss provision recapture. The allowance for loan losses was 1.23%, 1.28%, 1.28%, 1.28%, and 1.40% of total loans and leases outstanding, at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The ratio as of the most recent four quarters was reduced by the $309.7 million loans acquired from VBB that are recorded at fair market value, without a corresponding loan loss allowance.\nNonperforming loans, defined as nonaccrual loans plus nonperforming TDR loans, were $10.7 million at December 31, 2017, or 0.22% of total loans, and included $3.7 million of loans acquired from VBB. This compares to nonperforming loans of $11.6 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2017, and $7.2 million, or 0.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. The $10.7 million in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 are summarized as follows: $6.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $1.3 million in SFR mortgage loans, $906,000 in SBA loans, $829,000 in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, $552,000 in consumer and other loans, and $250,000 in commercial and industrial loans. The $857,000 decrease in nonperforming loans quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to a $705,000 decrease in nonperforming SBA loans and a $191,000 decrease in nonperforming consumer and other loans. This was partially offset by a $114,000 increase in nonperforming commercial real estate loans.\nWe had $4.5 million in Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had one OREO property, unchanged from September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. There were no additions or sales of OREO for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had loans delinquent 30 to 89 days of $1.2 million. This compares to $271,000 at September 30, 2017, and $436,000 at December 31, 2016. As a percentage of total loans, delinquencies, excluding nonaccruals, were 0.02% at December 31, 2017, 0.01% at September 30, 2017, and 0.01% at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had $4.8 million in performing TDR loans, compared to $5.7 million in performing TDR loans at September 30, 2017, and $19.2 million in performing TDR loans at December 31, 2016. In terms of the number of loans, we had 16 performing TDR loans at December 31, 2017, compared to 21 performing TDR loans at September 30, 2017, and 26 performing TDR loans at December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming assets, defined as nonaccrual loans plus OREO, totaled $15.2 million at December 31, 2017, $16.1 million at September 30, 2017, and $11.7 million at December 31, 2016. As a percentage of total assets, nonperforming assets were 0.18% at December 31, 2017, 0.19% at September 30, 2017, and 0.14% at December 31, 2016.\nClassified loans are loans that are graded “substandard” or worse. At December 31, 2017, classified loans totaled $57.3 million, compared to $75.1 million at September 30, 2017, and $108.3 million at December 31, 2016. Total classified loans at December 31, 2017 included $5.6 million of classified loans acquired from VBB in the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to an $11.6 million decrease in classified commercial real estate loans, a $2.8 million decrease in classified commercial and industrial loans, and a $2.3 million decrease in SBA loans.\nCitizensTrust\nAs of December 31, 2017, CitizensTrust had approximately $2.88 billion in assets under management and administration, including $2.15 billion in assets under management. Revenues were $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.8 million for 2017, compared to $2.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, for the same period of 2016.
