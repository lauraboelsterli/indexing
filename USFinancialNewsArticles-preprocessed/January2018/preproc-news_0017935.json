    "text": "BEIJING, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have banned collective asset management plans from investing in entrusted loans or other credit assets, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.\nThe Asset Management Association of China has halted registration services for the type of investment pools that China calls collective asset management plans, they said.\nExisting plans cannot be extended or increased, they added.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission and the asset management association did not respond immediately to requests for comment on restrictions on investment pools.\nThe move comes as financial regulators are increasing scrutiny and tightening regulation on the entrusted loan market, a rapidly growing segment of China’s shadow banking sector.\nLast week, China’s banking regulator issued rules to increase regulation on commercial banks’ entrusted loans.\nEntrusted loans are a form of inter-company financing in which one firm serves as the ultimate lender and records the loan assets on its balance sheet while banks act as intermediaries, for a fee.\nReporting by Xiaochong Zhang and Ryan Woo; Writing by Shu Zhang; Editing by Richard Borsuk\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
