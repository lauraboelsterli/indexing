If you held shares in \"street name\" during 2017, the IRS form provided by your bank, brokerage firm or nominee may report only the gross distributions paid to you. Therefore, you may need the information included in this press release to properly complete your federal tax return.\nThere are many important considerations associated with the taxability of the company’s distributions in 2017. This information has been prepared using the best available information to date. FCPT’s federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2017 has not yet been filed. Please note that federal tax laws affect taxpayers differently, and we cannot advise you on how distributions should be reported on your federal income tax return. Also note that state and local taxation of REIT distributions vary and may not be the same as the taxation under the federal rules. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors as to their specific tax treatment related to FCPT common stock dividends.\nAbout FCPT:\nFCPT, headquartered in Mill Valley, CA, is a real estate investment trust primarily engaged in the acquisition and leasing of restaurant properties. The Company will seek to grow its portfolio by acquiring additional real estate to lease, on a net basis, for use in the restaurant and related food services industry.
