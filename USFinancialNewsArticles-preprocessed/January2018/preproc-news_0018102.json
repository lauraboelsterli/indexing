    "text": " 47 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Viacom, CBS not in active discussions: sources   Viacom Inc ( VIAB.O ) and CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) are not in active merger discussions, although controlling shareholder Shari Redstone has had exploratory conversations with CBS directors about recombining the companies, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday. \nCBS and Viacom are both controlled by ailing Sumner Redstone, 94, and his daughter Shari, through their privately owned movie theater company, National Amusements Inc. \nSumner Redstone split Viacom and CBS into separate companies a decade ago. He and his daughter attempted to merge the two in 2016, but the effort failed. \nNational Amusements, CBS and Viacom declined to comment. Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Jonathan Oatis",
