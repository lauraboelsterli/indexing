The index was down 0.59 percent at 91.313, after slipping to a four-month low of 91.243.\nThe index pared losses slightly after data showed underlying U.S. consumer prices recorded their largest increase in 11 months in December amid strong gains in the cost of rental accommodation and healthcare, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year.\n\"Everyone is waiting for some type of inflation number to materialise,\" said Trang.\n\"But, it may be a bit premature to jump on the inflation bandwagon. I would want to see at least a quarter or two of some solid numbers,\" he said.\nSterling rocketed to its highest level against the dollar since the vote to leave the European Union in mid-2016, after a report that the Netherlands and Spain were open to a softer Brexit deal for Britain.\nSterling was up 0.98 percent to $1.3668.\nBitcoin was 4.8 percent higher at $13,875 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange a day after it skidded over 11 percent after the government of South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, said it was considering a plan to ban cryptocurrency trading.
