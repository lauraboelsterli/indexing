    "text": "Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images Christie's employees take bids for Leonardo da Vincis 'Salvator Mundi' at Christie's New York November 15, 2017. News that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman bought the $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting came as a shock to the Western world.\nBut to those who have followed the Prince, it's just the latest in a series of jaw-dropping purchases.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Prince Mohammed was the mystery buyer of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Salvatore Mundi,\" which was auctioned off at Christie's last month for $450 million – the highest price ever paid for a work of art.\nInitially, the New York Times reported that the buyer was Prince Bander, a friend of Prince Mohammed's. But the Wall Street Journal reports that Prince Bander bought it as a \"proxy\" for Prince Mohammed.\nThe news is sure to send ripples through the Middle East – not just because the leader of a Muslim nation bought a portrait of Christ. But also because Prince Mohammed is leading a crackdown on corruption and imposing new austerity measures in Saudi Arabia .\nYet the 32-year-old Crown Prince's purchase is just the latest of his nine-figure shopping sprees. Two years ago, he was vacationing in the South of France and admired a 440-foot yacht in the distance, owned by Russian vodka magnate Yuri Shefler. The Prince sent an aide to buy the ship for over $500 million. Shefler sold it, moved off and turned the ship over to the Prince the same day.\nHe is also building a giant resort near Jidda, with seven palaces for the family – all built around a giant artificial lake in the shape of a flower.\nIt's unclear where the da Vinci will hang. But at least for a while, it will go to the Louvre Abu Dhabi.\nThe Saudis have not yet responded to CNBC's request for comment. \nWATCH: Da Vinci painting sells for $450 million show chapters Da Vinci painting sells for $450 million, buyer unknown      8:02 AM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 | 03:49",
