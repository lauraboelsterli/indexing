    "text": "TORONTO, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- dynaCERT Inc. (TSX-V:DYA) (OTCQB:DYFSF) (DAX:DMJ) (\" dynaCERT \" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the appointment of Colonel Yalon Farhi to its Board of Directors. Colonel Farhi is a colonel in the Israeli Defense Forces (reserves), serving since 1998. Colonel Farhi has been a member of the MicroVision, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVIS) board of directors since September 2016 and is also a director at DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ:DRIO). Colonel Farhi received a degree in Education Studies and holds a Teaching Certificate from the Moreshet Yaacov College in Jerusalem. Colonel Farhi serves as a private security consultant to several security companies in Israel.\nMr. Wayne Hoffman, Chairman of dynaCERT, said, “Colonel Farhi will bring new perspectives and insights to the dynaCERT board based on his broad, international experience. We look forward to having his voice and market counsel as we progress dynaCERT ’s Carbon Emission Reduction Technology and look to apply dynaCERT ’s HydraGEN™ products to emerging global environmental markets such as diesel-powered military equipment and related transportation vehicles.”\n“I am pleased to be joining the dynaCERT board at this pivotal time in the company’s history. The Company’s technology, the breadth of its patent portfolio and its potential to enable multiple applications is impressive,” said Colonel Farhi. “I look forward to sharing my experience with management and my fellow board members to assist the Company with the execution of its business plan.”\nNew Strategic Dealer for Israel and Brazil\ndynaCERT is pleased to announce the appointment of Farhi Holdings Corporation of London, Ontario (“Farhi”) as a strategic dealer for the countries of Israel and Brazil. Farhi is introducing the use of dynaCERT ’s HydraGEN™ Technology onto many different diesel-powered vehicles and machinery as are used across numerous industries, including peacekeeping purposes.\nInvitation to accompany the Prime Minister to India\ndynaCERT has received an invitation to accompany Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his upcoming trade mission to India in February 2018. The Company will use this opportunity to further discussions with many of the All India Motor Transport Congress executives met during dynaCERT ’s 2017 India Congress held in Toronto in November 2017. During the multi-city tour with the PM, it is expected that additional business introductions will be made that are expected to result in furthering the understanding and economic advantages of our Carbon Emission Reduction Technology.\nEquity Financing and Note Redemption\ndynaCERT is pleased to announce the offering of up to 7,142,857 units (each a \"Unit\") at a price of $0.42 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $3,000,000 (the \"Financing\"). Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of dynaCERT (a \"Common Share\") and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant (a “Warrant”) will entitle the holder to acquire one additional Common Share at a price of $0.50 for a period of twelve months, provided however that in the event that the Company's Common Shares trade at a price above $1.00 per Common Share on the TSX Venture Exchange for twenty (20) consecutive trading days, dynaCERT shall have the right to give notice to holders that the Warrants shall expire within thirty (30) days of such notice.\nThe Company has received subscriptions for an aggregate of $1,210,000.00 of Units to date, with $210,000.00 being received from a director of the Company. The Financing is expected to be completed in multiple tranches, with the first closing expected to be completed promptly following receipt of TSX Venture Exchange approval.\nIn addition, the Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into agreements with the holders of its convertible notes (aggregate principal amount of $1,260,000) that were issued in November 2017, whereby the holders of the convertible notes have agreed to the redemption thereof, with all amounts thereunder being repaid in full via the issuance of Units on identical terms as those that are to be issued under the Financing. Accordingly, the Notes are expected to be redeemed for an aggregate amount of $1,281,288.12 (representing the principal amount owing, together with all interest amounts accrued thereunder), with the redemption amount being settled via the issuance of an aggregate of 3,050,686 Units to the holders of the notes.\nThe foregoing transactions are subject to the review and approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. All of the Common Shares and Warrants that are to be issued in connection with the Financing and the redemption of notes will be subject to statutory four-month hold periods.\nJim Payne, CEO of dynaCERT, states: “ dynaCERT is optimistic that 2018 will be the year where dynaCERT begins to expand sales into new diesel engine markets as more governments worldwide continue to recognize the need for direct Carbon Emission Reduction Technologies. With the retirement of all long-term debt, this financial strength will permit us to continue our planned global growth strategy into target markets not yet served by our HydraGEN™ products.”\nOptions\ndynaCERT Inc. also announces that a total of 4,475,000 options were granted today to its directors, officers and consultants. Of this number, 2,925,000 stock options were granted to Directors and Officers to acquire common shares in the capital of dynaCERT (each, an “Option\") and 50,000 were granted to a consultant in respect of investor relations activities (with such options vesting quarterly over a period of one year). All options (other than IR options) vest immediately and all entitle the holder to purchase one common share of the Corporation at a price of $ 0.50, each being exercisable on or before January 31, 2023.\nAbout dynaCERT Inc.\ndynaCERT Inc. manufactures, distributes, and installs Carbon Emission Reduction Technology for use with internal combustion engines. As part of the growing global hydrogen economy, our patent-pending technology creates hydrogen and oxygen on-demand through electrolysis and supplies these through the air intake to enhance combustion, resulting in lower carbon emissions and greater fuel efficiency.
