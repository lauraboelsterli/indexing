In his role, he will be responsible for overseeing global operations for Fluent’s extensive Performance Media portfolio, including audience acquisition and insights, client strategy, new product development and international expansion.\n“Matt’s expanded role within our leadership team highlights a distinct and important evolution of our growth strategy,” said Schulke. “Our Performance Marketing suite is becoming more robust and distinguished than ever, with heavy demand from top-tier clientele. A high double-digit percentage of this revenue is operating on unlimited budgets due to the consistent and reliable ROI generated from these programs. We believe that under Matt’s leadership we will be able to expand our offerings dramatically to deliver more results to these partners and many other category leaders.”\nSince joining Fluent in 2011, Mr. Koncz has held a number of key management roles within the Company. Most recently, he was the Executive Vice President, Media & Distribution where he oversaw a media buying budget in excess of $100 million on audience acquisition in 2017. Prior to that role, he headed up Publisher Development with a focus on partnering with media owners to utilize Fluent’s flagship advertising products to realize greater monetization of their inventory. Prior to Fluent, Mr. Koncz was a Director at Clash Media.\n“Since inception, I have been incredibly energized by Fluent’s ability to create massive efficiencies for advertisers. Our ability to acquire media cost effectively, on a performance basis, while simultaneously delivering scale through smart partnerships with publishers and the world’s leading media platforms is unmatched,” said Koncz. “I am anxious to spearhead some of our newest and most exciting business initiatives as we continue to advance our roadmap domestically and internationally.”\nOn February 6-7, 2018, Fluent will be the Networking App Sponsor at the Affiliate Summit Europe 2018 in London, which will take place at the InterContinental.
