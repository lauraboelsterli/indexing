    "text": "SHARES Zhang Peng | LightRocket via Getty Images \nUber rival Didi reportedly missed its December ride targets by 26 percentage points, according to a report by The Information. \nThe Chinese ride-sharing company is in the middle of a concerted global push, reportedly buying major Brazilian player 99 and raising $4 billion to expand into Mexico and Taiwan . \nDidi was aiming for 70 percent growth in rides during the crucial holiday month, The Information reports citing a source familiar with the company, but only saw 44 percent growth. \nThat still amounts to 25 million average daily rides for December â€” a hard number to ignore in the ride-sharing wars.",
