    "text": " 22 PM / Updated an hour ago Philippines' president made call on China's sea research: spokesman   \nMANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte personally made a decision to let China conduct scientific research off the Philippines’ Pacific coast, his spokesman said on Monday, despite concern among critics about threats to maritime sovereignty. Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte Rodrigo Duterte gestures during a news conference on the sidelines of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Pasay, metro Manila, Philippines, November 14, 2017. REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao/Files \nPresidential spokesman Harry Roque said that as chief architect of foreign policy, Duterte allowed China to work with the University of the Philippines in Benham Rise, an area roughly the size of Greece and believed by some scientists to be rich in biodiversity and tuna. \nThe United Nations declared Benham Rise, off the Pacific coast, part of the continental shelf of the Philippines in 2012. Manila last year renamed it the “Philippine Rise”. \nThough China does not lay claim to the area, the lingering presence of its vessels for several months in late 2016 triggered concern about its intentions. \nThe Philippines granting of the permission to China was not announced and was revealed a few days ago by a lawmaker who has been fiercely critical of Duterte’s close ties with Beijing. \nThe Philippines and China have a long history of maritime squabbles over sovereignty in the South China Sea, but there has been no disagreement about waters off Manila’s Pacific coast. \nRoque said anyone opposed to the joint research project should go to Congress and raise the issue there. \n“If this is not a wise move of the president, then a law could be enacted to prohibit it,” he said. \nThe Philippines would grant permission to any other country that might show interest in conducting maritime research at Benham Rise, he added.
