    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 9:23 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Facebook revenue jumps 47 percent on soaring mobile ad sales Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) reported a 47 percent jump in quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as the social media company’s mobile ad business got a boost from its focus on videos and improved targeting. \nTotal advertising revenue was $12.78 billion (9.02 billion pounds) in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with analysts’ estimate of $12.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nMobile ad revenue accounted for 89 percent of the total ad sales, up from 84 percent a year earlier. \nFacebook said about 2.13 billion people were using its service monthly as of Dec. 31, up 14 percent from a year earlier. \nThe results come at a time when Facebook has warned about a likely hit to user engagement in the near term from attempts to tweak its flagship News Feed feature. \nNet income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose to $4.27 billion, or $1.44 per share, from $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. \nTotal quarterly revenue rose 47 percent to $12.97 billion, while full-year revenue was also up 47 percent at $40.65 billion.
