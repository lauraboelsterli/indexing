    "text": "CNBC.com Leah Millis | Reuters President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 30, 2018. \nThe 'American Dream,\" Rep. Joseph Kennedy III's damp rebuttal and Rep. Nancy Pelosi 's sour demeanor were top Twitter topics on the night President Donald Trump gave a State of the Union speech that broke Twitter records. \nTwitter users also teed off on Trump's claims that unemployment among African-Americans had hit new lows during his administration, about the president's call for immigration reform. \nTwitter on Tuesday night, after Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress concluded, said that there were 4.5 million tweets using the hashtags #SOTU or #JointSession, \"surpassing last year's record of 3 million tweets.\" \nListen First Media , a social analytics firm, said that there were 2.69 million tweets mentioning Trump during the State of the Union address, \"generating 36.8 billion potential impressions\" among users of the Twitter messaging platform. \n\"Those tweeting about the State of the Union were predominantly white males — 82 percent white and 54 percent male,\" Listen First said. And 65 percent were members of the millennial generation or primarily young adults. \nThe firm said Trump's line in the speech about the American Dream — \"There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream\" — was a popular theme on Twitter, albeit one that divided users. Tweet \n\"Viewers also have polarizing views on Joe Kennedy's Democratic response to the SOTU,\" Listen First said. \n\"His looks came into play, with many commenting on 'the Blistex issue,\" the firm said. That was in reference to the fact that the Massachusetts Democrat appeared to be either sweating around his lips or to have applied too much lip gloss.",
