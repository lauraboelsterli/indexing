FILE PHOTO: Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa looks on after delivering the State of the Nation Address (SONA) in Harare, Zimbabwe, December 20, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo \n“Currently there is no need,” Mnangagwa said about the possibility of forming a coalition with Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change. \nMnangagwa came to power in November last year following a de facto military coup after which veteran leader Robert Mugabe stepped down after 37 years in power.
