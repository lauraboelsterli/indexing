    "text": "January 25, 2018 / 1:50 PM / in 27 minutes ECB monetary stimulus still needed to push up inflation -Draghi Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFRANKFURT, Jan 25 (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that pumping money into the euro zone economy was still necessary in order to boost inflation. \nWith the bloc’s economy growing faster than expected, investors have been speculating that the ECB could abruptly stop its asset purchases in September, as advocated by Estonia’s central bank governor Ardo Hansson. \nBut Draghi, in a news conference, was clear that stimulus remains needed, with inflation being subdued and only seen gradually rising over the medium term. \n“An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflationary pressures to continue to build up,” he said. \nThe stimulus would come from asset purchases, asset holding, reinvestment and forward guidance that interest rates will remain low, Draghi said.
