It is the top trading partner of many countries in the region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina. \nStill, Wang played down the idea of a race for influence. \n\"It has nothing to do with geopolitical competition. It follows the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration,\" Wang said in his remarks. \"It is nothing like a zero sum game.\" \nIn recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying into sectors such as auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even technology businesses such as car-hailing services. \n\"Our relations with China are very broad, this (CELAC) is one more pathway for Brazil to work with China. Together we identified more areas of cooperation,\" said Brazil's Vice Foreign Minister Marcos Galvao.",
