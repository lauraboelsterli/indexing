(Reuters) - Englishman Paul Casey has withdrawn from the Players Championship due to a back injury, the PGA Tour announced on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: May 6, 2018; Charlotte, NC, USA; Paul Casey pitches out of the bunker on 15th hole during the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship golf tournament at Quail Hollow Club. Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\nAmerican Kevin Mitchell is Caseyâ€™s replacement in the 144-man field at TPC Sawgrass, where the tournament gets underway on Thursday.\nWorld number 12 Casey has been in excellent form this year.\nThe 40-year-old won the Valspar Championship in Florida in March, holding off Tiger Woods and Masters champion Patrick Reed by one stroke.\nCasey also threatened the course record of 63 in the final round at the U.S. Masters in April, before finishing with two straight bogeys for a 65.\nHe tied for fifth last Sunday at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte.
