    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - An Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona in March failed to identify the pedestrian or brake, raising serious questions about the performance of the vehicle, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report released Thursday.\nThe report said the vehicle’s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but “the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle.” At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined emergency braking was needed, but Uber said emergency braking maneuvers were not enabled while the vehicle is under computer control to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.
