    "text": "ADDISON, Texas, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daseke, Inc. (NASDAQ:DSKE) (NASDAQ:DSKEW), the largest owner of flatbed and specialized transportation and logistics solutions in North America, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter\nRevenue increased 104% to $327.6 million. Flatbed Solutions revenue up 78% to $145.0 million; Specialized Solutions revenue up 129% to $184.9 million 1 . Net loss improved significantly to $(0.8) million, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a net loss of $(7.7) million, or $(0.32) per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased 100% to $35.2 million.\nManagement Commentary\n“The first quarter of 2018 marks our one-year anniversary of being public,” said Don Daseke, chairman and CEO. “Since becoming public, we have more than doubled our revenue, doubled our Adjusted EBITDA and acquired seven companies of scale. These results follow our clear strategy of building the premier flatbed and specialized logistics provider.\n“We began 2018 on a strong note with 10% revenue growth in both our specialized and flatbed segments on an Acquisition Adjusted 2 basis. This was driven by favorable year-over-year rate increases in each segment, along with 11% growth in Specialized revenue per truck due to increased revenue synergies in several key markets.\n“We expect to carry this momentum throughout 2018 by executing on our well-defined strategic priorities. This begins with a focus on organic growth via appropriate operations consolidation and an emphasis on increasing rates while controlling costs. We also remain committed to a focused M&A strategy and our pipeline remains robust. Our recent agreement to acquire Aveda Transportation and Energy Services, a fast-growing, value-additive business in a niche market, is a testament to the quality of our pipeline and our scalable platform.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 104% to $327.6 million compared to $160.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by the acquisition of seven operating companies of scale during 2017. Excluding the acquisitions, revenues increased 10% largely due to an improvement in rates in both the Flatbed and Specialized segments.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 improved significantly to $(0.8) million, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a net loss of $(7.7) million, or $(0.32) per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and compared to Acquisition Adjusted net loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $(3.1) million.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP term defined below) increased 100% to $35.2 million compared to $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and compared to Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 of $31.4 million. Both the significant improvements in net loss and Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the aforementioned acquisitions.\nSegment Results\nFlatbed Solutions - Flatbed Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 78% to $145.0 million 1 compared to $81.3 million in the year-ago quarter. This was driven by the acquisition of TSH & Co. on December 1, 2017, as well as a 6% increase in flatbed rate per mile and 3% growth in revenue per truck. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, rates were up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating income was $7.0 million, up 80% from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nSpecialized Solutions - Specialized Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 129% to $184.9 million 1 compared to $80.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by six specialized acquisitions of scale since the first quarter of 2017, as well as a 5% increase in specialized rate per mile and 10% growth in revenue per truck. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rates were up 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating income was $5.1 million, up 411% from $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nOn Daseke’s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call, it introduced its 2018 outlook, expecting to grow revenue to approximately $1.35 billion compared to $846.3 million in 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA to approximately $150 million compared to $91.6 million in 2017. Replacement capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be approximately $65 million with $20-$40 million in growth capital expenditures. While the Company reported a strong first quarter, Daseke plans to update its full-year outlook on the second quarter call, which will reflect the anticipated June closing of Aveda.\nConference Call\nDaseke will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime: 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (10:00 a.m. Central time)\nToll-free dial-in number: (855) 242-9918\nInternational dial-in number: (414) 238-9803\nConference ID: 4094276\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

For more information, please visit www.daseke.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis news release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted, revenue, net loss and EBITDA (Acquisition Adjusted Measures). Other companies in Daseke’s industry may define these non-GAAP measures differently than Daseke does, and as a result, it may be difficult to use these non-GAAP measures to compare the performance of those companies to Daseke’s performance. Daseke’s management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and instead relies primarily on Daseke’s GAAP results and uses non-GAAP measures supplementally.\nDaseke defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, including other fees and charges associated with indebtedness, net of interest income, (iii) income taxes, (iv) acquisition-related transaction expenses (including due diligence costs, legal, accounting and other advisory fees and costs, retention and severance payments and financing fees and expenses), (v) stock-based compensation, (vi) non-cash impairments, and (vii) expenses related to the business combination that was consummated in February 2017 and related transactions. Daseke defines Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA plus tractor operating lease charges, and free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less net capital expenditures (capital expenditures less proceeds from equipment sales). Daseke defines Acquisition Adjusted as (a) our actual revenue, net loss or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for the applicable measurement period and (b)the actual revenue, net loss or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, of each company acquired in 2017 for the period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending on its acquisition date, based on the company’s internal financial statements for the period prior to Daseke’s acquisition. These adjusted amounts (i) have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X or any other securities laws relating to the presentation of pro forma financial information, (ii) do not reflect any pro forma adjustments, (iii) are presented for informational purposes only, (iv) are not necessarily indicative of what our result of operations would have been had such acquisitions been completed on January 1, 2017, and (v) do not purport to project our future operating results.\nDaseke’s board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures as key measures of its performance and for business planning. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures assist them in comparing Daseke’s operating performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because they remove from Daseke’s operating results the impact of items that, in their opinion, do not reflect Daseke’s core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures also allows Daseke to more effectively evaluate its operating performance by allowing it to compare the results of operations against its peers without regard to its or its peers’ financing method or capital structure.\nAdjusted EBITDAR is used to view operating results before lease charges as these charges can vary widely among trucking companies due to differences in the way that trucking companies finance their fleet acquisitions. Daseke’s method of computing Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with that used in its debt covenants and also is routinely reviewed by its management for that purpose.\nDaseke believes its presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures is useful because they provide investors and industry analysts the same information that Daseke uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures are not substitutes for, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, operating income or any other measure prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital, tax structure and the historic costs of depreciable assets. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAR and Acquisition Adjusted Measures should not be considered measures of the income generated by Daseke’s business or discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of its business.\nDaseke’s board of directors and executive management team use free cash flow to assess the Company’s performance and ability to fund operations and make additional investments. Free cash flow represents the cash that its business generates from operations, before taking into account cash movements that are nonoperational. Daseke believes its presentation of free cash flow is useful because it is one of several indicators of Daseke’s ability to service debt, make investments and/or return capital to its stockholders. Daseke also believes that free cash flow is one of several benchmarks used by investors and industry analysts for comparison of performance in its industry, although Daseke’s measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, free cash flow is not a substitute for, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, operating income or any other measure prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered a measure of the income generated by Daseke’s business or discretionary cash available to it to invest in the growth of its business.\nDaseke defines adjusted operating ratio as (a) total operating expenses (i) less fuel surcharges, acquisition related transaction expenses, non-cash impairment charges and withdrawn initial public offering-related expenses and (ii) further adjusted for the net impact of the step-up in basis resulting from acquisitions (such as increased depreciation and amortization expense), as a percentage of (b) total revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue.\nDaseke’s board of directors and executive management team view adjusted operating ratio, and its key drivers of revenue quality, growth, expense control and operating efficiency, as a very important measure of Daseke’s performance. Daseke believes fuel surcharge is often volatile and eliminating the impact of this source of revenue (by eliminating fuel surcharge from revenue and by netting fuel surcharge against fuel expense) affords a more consistent basis for comparing its results of operations between periods. Daseke also believes excluding acquisition-related transaction expenses, additional depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of acquisitions, non-cash impairments and withdrawn initial public offering-related expenses enhances the comparability of its performance between periods.\nDaseke believes its presentation of adjusted operating ratio is useful because it provides investors and industry analysts the same information that Daseke uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating profitability. However, adjusted operating ratio is not a substitute for, or more meaningful than, operating ratio, operating margin or any other measure derived solely from GAAP measures, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating ratio. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures tables below. We have not reconciled non-GAAP forward looking measures to their corresponding GAAP measures because certain items that impact these measures are unavailable or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable efforts.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes “ ” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
