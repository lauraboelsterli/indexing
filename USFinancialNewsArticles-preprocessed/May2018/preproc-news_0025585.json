In this role, Mr. Blair will oversee L3’s global treasury operations, including foreign exchange and capital markets, cash planning, rating agency relations, risk management and worldwide banking activities.\n“Jim has been a valuable member of the finance team for 13 years,” said Mr. D’Ambrosio. “He has an extensive background in finance and business operations, as well as a strong understanding of L3 and its culture.
