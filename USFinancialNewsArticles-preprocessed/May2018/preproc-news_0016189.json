FILE PHOTO: Aidells brand chicken and apple sausage which is owned by Tyson Foods are pictured in a grocery store cooler in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S. May 11, 2017. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\nTyson, like other U.S. meat processing and packaged food companies, has been facing higher transportation costs as railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy.\nNet income attributable to the maker of Ball Park hotdogs and Jimmy Dean sausages fell to $315 million (233 million pounds), or 85 cents per share, in the second quarter ended March 31, from $340 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe company paid $109 million in one time cash bonuses to its employees across its businesses as it passed on the benefits on of the changes in the U.S. tax code.\nExcluding certain items, the company earned $1.27 per share, while revenue rose 7.6 percent to $9.77 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $1.30 per share on revenue of $9.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
