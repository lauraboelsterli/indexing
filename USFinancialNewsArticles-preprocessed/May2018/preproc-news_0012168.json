(NASDAQ:VVUS) (the \"Company\"), a specialty pharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies focusing on treatments for patients with serious unmet medical needs, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided a business update.\n\"The acquisition of PANCREAZE ® , a cash flow-positive asset, and the restructuring of a portion of our corporate debt are significant steps toward our goal of positioning VIVUS as a robust generator of value for stockholders and patients,\" said John Amos, VIVUS' new Chief Executive Officer. \"Our new management team is energized and actively engaged in seeking additional product acquisitions that will leverage our commercialization expertise and strengthen our balance sheet. I am confident that we have the strategy, resources and employee talent to make VIVUS a leader in the specialty pharmaceutical market.”\nRecent Business Highlights\nVIVUS Management Transition\nIn April 2018, VIVUS announced the addition of John Amos as its new Chief Executive Officer and Board Member. The Company also announced the addition of Kenneth Suh as President and Chief Executive Officer of Willow Biopharma Inc. (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of VIVUS, Inc.), and Scott Oehrlein as the Company’s Chief Operations Officer to the senior leadership team. These three individuals each have strong track records of building successful cash-flow positive businesses through product acquisition and enhanced commercialization strategies and efficiencies. This leadership transition is a critical first step in executing VIVUS’ strategy to expand and optimize the management of the Company’s portfolio of commercial products and accomplishes one of the Company’s key goals outlined for 2018.\nVIVUS to Acquire PANCREAZE to Expand its Commercial Product Portfolio\nIn May 2018, VIVUS announced that it had entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which VIVUS will acquire all product rights for PANCREAZE ® (pancrelipase) Delayed-Release Capsules in the United States and Canada. The transaction is expected to close, subject to governmental anti-trust reviews and other customary closing conditions, by the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nApproved in 2010, PANCREAZE is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands, as well as other enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, proteases and amylases. The pancreatic enzymes in PANCREAZE act like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas. PANCREAZE is specifically indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. VIVUS Enters into an Agreement to Restructure a Portion of its Convertible Notes and Establish a New Credit Line with Athyrium\nVIVUS entered into an agreement for a new $120 million Senior Secured Note with investment funds managed by Athyrium Capital Management, LP (“Athyrium”). The agreement provides for $110 million of notes to be issued by VIVUS concurrent with the closing of the PANCREAZE acquisition and subject to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The remaining $10 million will be available for issuance upon meeting certain financial thresholds or repurchasing the Company’s Convertible Notes at certain prices. Payments on the Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at 10.375% and will be interest-only for the first three years. Concurrently with the Senior Secured Notes issuance, VIVUS will repurchase Athyrium’s Convertible Notes, due in May 2020 with a face value of $60 million, at a discount to par.\n2018 Strategic Objectives\nExpand the Company's growing commercial portfolio through the acquisition of additional cash-flow positive specialty pharmaceutical products that leverage the Company’s demonstrated commercialization capabilities. Continue monetizing VIVUS' legacy assets through innovative sales and marketing strategies and potential expansion into additional markets. Further the development of tacrolimus, a potentially first-in-class therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). VIVUS expects to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tacrolimus in the treatment of PAH and complete the development of its proprietary formulation of tacrolimus.\nFinancial Results\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million, as compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities were $209.1 million at March 31, 2018.\nRevenue consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Qsymia product revenue, net $ 9,632 $ 17,620 (1 ) License and milestone revenue -- 5,000 STENDRA/SPEDRA supply revenue 1,683 3,812 STENDRA/SPEDRA royalty revenue 585 580 Total revenue $ 11,900 $ 27,012 (1) Includes one-time accounting adjustment of $7.3 million\nNet Qsymia product revenue decreased to $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, excluding the one-time change in accounting adjustment of $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 for the change to the “sell-in” revenue recognition methodology. In the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, VIVUS shipped approximately 83,000 and 89,000 units of Qsymia to the wholesalers, respectively. Approximately 92,000 and 102,000 Qsymia prescriptions were dispensed in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTotal cost of goods sold was $2.7 million and $6.2 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily a result of lower Qsymia product revenue and the lower STENDRA/SPEDRA supply revenue as described above.\nResearch and development expense was $1.4 million and $2.2 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2017, research and development expenses were impacted by the payment of license fees to Selten for the acquisition of tacrolimus. Excluding these license fees, development costs increased due to the ongoing development of tacrolimus.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $5.8 million and $6.0 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling and marketing expense for the commercialization of Qsymia totaled $4.3 million and $5.5 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales and marketing expense in 2017 included a $0.7 million one-time adjustment related to the one-time accounting adjustment.\nConference Call Details\nAs previously announced, VIVUS will hold a conference call and an audio webcast to provide a business update and to discuss the 2018 first quarter financial results today, May 8, 2018, beginning at 4:30PM Eastern Time.

If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, and call a doctor right away.\nSudden decrease or loss of hearing has been rarely reported in people taking PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors.
