    "text": "Rent-A-Center achieves positive same store sales across all operating segments with stronger than expected portfolio performance, free cash flow, and debt reduction\nPLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rent-A-Center, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ/NGS: RCII) today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"During the first quarter, strong portfolio performance helped Rent-A-Center achieve positive same store sales across all operating segments. In addition, we began the execution of our Strategic Plan, both of which resulted in delivering free cash flow of approximately $85 million putting the Company on a positive trajectory going forward,\" stated Mitch Fadel, Chief Executive Officer of Rent-A-Center.\nMr. Fadel continued, \"We announced a plan to capture at least $100 million in annualized EBITDA and working capital opportunities last quarter and have been busy implementing that plan. These actions were necessary to improve the performance of the business. I am pleased to say that we are currently exceeding expectations on these critical initiatives and I am further encouraged by our operational performance.\"\nStrategic Plan\nThe Company's Strategic Plan focuses on several improvement areas including a cost savings plan, a more targeted value proposition and a more robust franchising program. Significant progress has been made in all three areas of the Strategic Plan. Through April 2018, the Company has already executed initiatives expected to generate $70 million in annualized cost savings and $25 million in one-time working capital benefits, effectively capturing substantially all the savings outlined in the Company's previously announced guidance.\nCost Savings - Overhead\nCorporate overhead was reduced by approximately 250 positions, or 25 percent of the corporate office, in March, resulting in $28 million in annualized run-rate savings, with $20 million to be realized in 2018. Field overhead was reduced by approximately 60 positions, in April, resulting in $9 million in annualized run-rate savings with $6 million to be realized in 2018.\nCost Savings - Other Store Expense\nOther Store Expense savings primarily include cost rationalization of indirect spend at the store level. Targeted savings of $15 million annually have been identified, with 20 percent of the targeted savings already realized.\nCost Savings - Supply Chain\nThe Company restructured its supply chain organization supporting Acceptance NOW by closing all collection centers which included a reduction of over 500 positions and nearly 400 vehicles, in March, resulting in over $25 million in annualized run-rate savings, with $20 million to be realized in 2018. The Company has identified and largely executed $7 million in annualized run-rate savings within its Core U.S. product service centers through the optimization of routes with $5 million to be realized in 2018.\nWorking Capital Optimization\nActions were taken during the first quarter to right size the inventory in the Core U.S. segment, which resulted in a one-time working capital benefit of $25 million. The Company made the decision to revert back to a direct to store supply chain and discontinue the third party distribution center network, resulting in $12 million in annualized working capital reduction and cost of goods run rate savings, with $6 million in working capital savings to be realized in 2018. The direct to store network is expected to be fully operational in the latter half of 2018. The Company also expects to realize a one-time working capital benefit of $15 million due to the elimination of third party distribution centers in 2018.\nValue Proposition\nThe enhanced value proposition was launched nationally in the Core U.S. segment within the quarter. The changes reflect a more targeted approach to competitively pricing elastic categories offsetting those changes from a margin perspective within inelastic categories. In the Acceptance NOW segment, a new value proposition was rolled out to all partners. The value proposition lowers the total cost of ownership over a shorter term in order to improve ownership and retention.\nFranchising\nThe Company franchised 31 Core U.S. locations in one transaction during the quarter, enabling the Company to maintain and grow its presence while using proceeds from the refranchising efforts for debt reduction.\nConsolidated Overview\nExplanations of performance are excluding special items and compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.\nOn a consolidated basis, total revenues of $698.0 million declined by 5.9 percent primarily due to closures of certain Core U.S. and Acceptance NOW locations, offset by a consolidated same store sales increase of 0.8 percent. Net loss and diluted loss per share, on a GAAP basis, were $19.8 million and $0.37 compared to net loss and diluted loss per share of $6.7 million and $0.13 in the first quarter of last year.\nSpecial items of $17.5 million included $10.3 million related to cost savings initiatives primarily driven by severance, $4.4 million related to store closure costs, $1.9 million in capitalized software write-downs, $1.7 in incremental legal and advisory fees and ($0.8) million related to the 2017 hurricanes (Refer to Table 4).\nExcluding special items, the Company’s diluted loss per share was $0.08 and the Company generated $25.1 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.04 and adjusted EBITDA of $33.3 million in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue increased 490 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated $84.5 million of cash from operations, ended the first quarter with $81.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, and reduced its outstanding debt balance by $77.6 million. Subsequent to quarter end, debt on the revolver was reduced to a zero balance as of April 30, 2018.\nSegment Operating Performance\nCORE U.S. first quarter revenues of $482.0 million decreased 1.8 percent primarily due to the rationalization of the Core U.S. store base partially offset by a same store sales increase of 0.3 percent. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year increased 100 basis points primarily due to the intercompany book value adjustment on returned Acceptance Now products. Labor decreased $2.4 million versus prior year driven primarily by lower store count. Other store expenses decreased $7.2 million driven by store count and timing related to advertising expense. EBITDA was $40.0 million or 8.3 percent of revenue.\nACCEPTANCE NOW first quarter revenues of $197.0 million decreased 16.0 percent primarily due to closures of the Company's Conn’s and HHGregg locations partially offset by a same store sales increase of 3.3 percent. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year decreased 370 basis points primarily due to the intercompany book value adjustment on returned Acceptance NOW products, discounting early payout amounts to encourage ownership, and the new value proposition changes. Labor, as a percent of store revenue, improved 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $20.3 million or 10.3 percent of revenue.\nMEXICO first quarter revenues were flat on a constant currency basis. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year decreased 130 basis points driven by lower rental sales gross margin and merchandise sales gross margin. EBITDA was $1.2 million or 10.1 percent of revenue.\nFRANCHISING first quarter revenues were $7.0 million and EBITDA was $1.3 million.\nCORPORATE operating expenses increased $6.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a one-time benefit, in the first quarter of 2017, resulting from the reversal of unvested stock compensation previously granted to former executives.\nSAME STORE SALES (Unaudited) Table 1 Period Core U.S. Acceptance\nNow\nMexico Total Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (1) 0.3 % 3.3 % 0.7 % 0.8 % Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 (1) (3.6 )% 6.7 % (2.3 )% (2.0 )% Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 (12.5 )% 2.9 % (6.0 )% (7.8 )% Note : Same store sale methodology - Same store sales generally represents revenue earned in stores that were operated by us for 13 months or more and are reported on a constant currency basis. The Company excludes from the same store sales base any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from closed stores or acquisitions. The receiving store will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the 24 th full month following account transfer.\n(1) Given the severity of the recent natural disasters, the Company instituted a change to the same store sales store selection starting in the month of September, excluding geographically impacted regions for 18 months.\n2018 Selected Guidance\nAs the Company remains in the midst of a strategic and financial alternatives review process, the following selected guidance is being updated at this time:\nThe Company has identified annualized cost savings opportunities of $75 to $95 million, increased from the previously communicated range of $65 to $85 million. The Company expects two thirds of the benefit to be realized in 2018. These cost savings opportunities include: Overhead of $30 to $40 million Supply Chain of $35 to $40 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $25 to $30 million Other Store Expenses of $10 to $15 million Working capital benefits of $40 to $45 million, an increase from the previous guidance of $20 to 25 million, 100 percent of which is expected to be realized in 2018 Free Cash Flow of at least $170 million, an increase from the previous guidance of at least $130 million\nGuidance Policy\nThe Company provides selected guidance and will only provide updates if there is a material change versus the original guidance.\nStrategic & Financial Alternatives Update\nThe Company’s Board of Directors and its advisors remain actively engaged with parties interested in acquiring the Company and continue to expect to reach a determination during the second quarter of 2018. The Company does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions or any potential transaction unless and until a formal agreement has been reached or the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a definitive course of action with respect to its ongoing financial and strategic alternatives review.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nTo supplement the Company's financial results presented on a GAAP basis, Rent-A-Center uses the non-GAAP measures (\"special items”) indicated in Table 2 below, which primarily excludes charges in the first quarter of 2018 related to cost savings initiatives, including reductions in overhead and supply chain, store closures, incremental legal and advisory fees, capitalized software write-downs, and impacts related to the 2017 hurricanes and previous store closure plans. Gains or charges related to store closures will generally recur with the occurrence of these events in the future. The presentation of these financial measures is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Rent-A-Center management believes that excluding special items from the GAAP financial results provides investors a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results. This press release also refers to the non-GAAP measures EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Free Cash Flow (operating cash flow less investing activities). Reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in Tables 3 and 4, below. The Company believes that presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors, as among other things, this information impacts certain financial covenants under the Company's senior credit facilities and the indentures governing its 6.625% senior unsecured notes due November 2020 and its 4.75% senior unsecured notes due May 2021. The Company believes that presentation of free cash flow provides investors with meaningful additional information regarding the Company's liquidity. While management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.\nReconciliation of net loss to net (loss) earnings excluding special items:\nTable 2 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands, except per share data) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net loss $ (19,843 ) $ (0.37 ) $ (6,679 ) $ (0.13 ) Special items, net of taxes: Other charges (1) 15,633 0.29 8,687 0.17 Discrete income tax items 62 — 123 — Net (loss) earnings excluding special items $ (4,148 ) $ (0.08 ) $ 2,131 $ 0.04 (1) Other charges for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily includes charges, net of tax, related to cost savings initiatives, including reductions in overhead and supply chain, store closures, capitalized software write-downs, incremental legal and advisory fees, and impacts related to the 2017 hurricanes. Other charges for the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily includes closure of Acceptance Now locations, reductions in our field support center, incremental legal and advisory fees, and litigation claims settlement. Charges related to store closures are primarily comprised of losses on rental merchandise, lease obligation costs, employee severance, asset disposals, and miscellaneous costs incurred as a result of the closures.\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow:\nTable 3 Three Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities 84,477 59,317 Cash flows from investing activities Purchase of property assets (8,649 ) (22,048 ) Proceeds from sale of stores 9,463 475 Acquisitions of businesses (440 ) — Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 374 (21,573 ) Free cash flow 84,851 37,744 Webcast Information\nRent-A-Center, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter results, guidance and other operational matters on Tuesday morning, May 1, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET.
