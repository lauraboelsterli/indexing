    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp ( MPC.N ) missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Monday, as its expenses surged during a period of increased refining activity.\nThe results came hours after Marathon announced a $23 billion deal to buy rival Andeavor ( ANDV.N ), an acquisition that will see the company leapfrog Valero Energy ( VLO.N ) as the largest U.S. refiner by capacity.\nFindlay, Ohio-based Marathon has seen expenses surge, as it ramps up refining activity to meet rising demand following record levels of U.S. crude oil production.\nMarathon, which said it would save $1 billion in costs each year after closing the Andeavor deal, reported expenses of $18.54 billion in the three months ended March 31, up 15 percent from a year earlier.\nThe company’s shares fell 5.2 percent to $77.19 in premarket trading on Monday.\nNet income attributable to Marathon rose about 23 percent to $37 million in the first quarter.\nExcluding one-time items, Marathon earned 4 cents per share, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company, which also operates convenience store chain Speedway, said revenue jumped 16 percent to $18.98 billion, led by higher refining and marketing margins.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
