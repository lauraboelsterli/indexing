    "text": "Times@ (Adds background)\n* Trump announcement on Iran deal due Tuesday\n* Pullout would stoke Middle East strains\nWASHINGTON/PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. told French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that the United States was going to pull out of the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the New York Times reported, citing a person briefed on the conversation.\nThe source said the United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the deal and impose additional economic penalties, the Times reported.\nTrump is to make an announcement on the Iran deal at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday.\nOne senior European official closely involved in Iran diplomacy told Reuters that U.S. officials had indicated late on Monday that Trump would withdraw from the agreement but it remained unclear on what terms and whether sanctions would be reimposed.\nThe 2015 deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from being able to make an atomic bomb.\nTrump has frequently criticized the Iran accord because it does not address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025, nor its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.\nIran has ruled out renegotiating the accord and threatened to retaliate, although it has not said exactly how, if Washington pulled out.\n(Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann, Makini Brice and Arshad Mohammed in Washington, Sybille de La Hamaide, John Irish and Tim Hepher in Paris, Parisa Hafezi in Ankara, Bozorgmehr Sharafedin in London, Andrew Torchia in Dubai, Writing by William Maclean and Alistair Bell Editing by Janet Lawrence, Angus MacSwan and Peter Graff)",
