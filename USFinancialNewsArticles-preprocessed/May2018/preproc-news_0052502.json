Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY Sports Boston Celtics small forward Jayson Tatum fell one vote shy of being a unanimous selection. Also making the first team were Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kumza (93 of 100 first-team votes) and Chicago Bulls power forward Lauri Markkanen (76).\nMitchell, Simmons and Tatum are the three finalists for the Rookie of the Year award, which will be revealed June 25 during the 2018 NBA Awards on TNT.\nNamed to the second team were Dallas Mavericks point guard Dennis Smith Jr., Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball, Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins, Sacramento Kings guard Bogdan Bogdanovic and Phoenix Suns swingman Josh Jackson.\n—Golden State Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala will not play in the team’s Game 4 against the Houston Rockets due to a left knee injury, coach Steve Kerr announced pregame.\nEarlier in the day, the team had upgraded Iguodala, who has a lateral left knee contusion, from doubtful to questionable for the contest.\nMay 7, 2018; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons (25) rebounds the ball past Boston Celtics forward Al Horford (42) during the first quarter in game four of the second round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Wells Fargo Center. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports Second-seeded Golden State holds a 2-1 series lead in the Western Conference showdown against the top-seeded Rockets. The 34-year-old Iguodala is averaging 8.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.7 assists over the first three games of the series.\n—The attorney for Milwaukee Bucks guard Sterling Brown told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his client plans to file a civil rights lawsuit against the Milwaukee Police Department as a result of being tased and arrested by officers in January.\nThe news of the suit comes after Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett said he is concerned about public backlash that could emerge when a video of the incident is released, which is expected to happen Wednesday.\nIn the body-camera video from the incident, Brown “isn’t provocative, isn’t threatening” before officers use a stun gun on him, a source told the Journal Sentinel, calling the video “very bad.” Brown was cited for a parking violation but not charged following his arrest. The officers involved are currently under internal investigation, the status of which is unclear.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
