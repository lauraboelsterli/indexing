Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. THE GLOBE AND MAIL\n** Ontario's Liberal government took direct aim at Hydro One Ltd's \"unjustifiably generous\" compensation on Monday, forcing the electrical transmission utility's board to revisit pay packages for senior executives. tgam.ca/2jkIpCT\n** The Liberal government defended its carbon-pricing plan on Monday, with an analysis that concludes the federal and provincial levies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90 mega tonnes by 2022, the equivalent of shutting down more than 20 coal-fired power plants. tgam.ca/2KuyaIu\n** The federal government introduced new legislation on Monday aimed at curbing foreign interference in Canadian elections, but is leaving parliament with a tight schedule for passing the bill in time for the 2019 campaign. tgam.ca/2rcuSRn NATIONAL POST\n** Canada's largest medical regulator is taking too long to resolve its thousands of discipline cases, according to an inquiry commissioned by the Ontario government, with even unfounded patient complaints against doctors lingering for months. bit.ly/2I2SzGh (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)",
