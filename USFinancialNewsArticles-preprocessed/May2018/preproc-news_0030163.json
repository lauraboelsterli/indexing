    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 5:30 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Scotland's Sturgeon warns of 'catastrophic' no deal Brexit Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cautioned on Monday that the United Kingdom could be heading towards a no deal Brexit that would have catastrophic consequences. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, speaks at a Reuters Newsmaker event, in London, Britain May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nSpeaking at Thomson Reuters in London, Sturgeon said she felt there was no majority for a hard Brexit in the country but that the United Kingdom was at a moment when momentum could swing either towards a softer Brexit or a no deal Brexit.\n“At some point that majority for the least damaging Brexit, a softer Brexit, at some point has to assert itself,” Sturgeon said.\n“The danger if I am being less optimistic, or pessimistic, is that the whole process crashes before that can emerge because time is running out and the clock is ticking,” she said.
