    "text": "The company that makes Gibson guitars and Baldwin pianos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection early Tuesday amid what it called a \"devastating\" financial fall.\nNashville, Tenn.-based Gibson Brands requested court protection from its creditors, saying it had support from many of them for a deal that would allow the company to survive.\nFounded in 1894, the company said it planned to continue designing, building and selling musical instruments and equipment, including other brands such as Wurlitzer, Dobro, Epiphone, KRK and Cerwin Vega.\nBut the company said it would kill its Gibson Innovations unit, which makes Philips-branded headphones, speakers and other electronic accessories.\nKnown for providing instruments to stars such as Elvis Presley, BB King, Keith Richards, Pete Townsend and Lenny Kravitz, Gibson sells more than 170,000 guitars annually in more than 80 countries, according to a court filing. The company claims market share of more than 40 percent in electric guitars above $2,000.\nshow chapters This 36-year-old makes over $150,000 'playing with guitars' for just 5 hours a day 12:23 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 01:07 But sales have declined significantly, and cost-cutting efforts haven't been enough to stop the bleeding. In recent months, lenders required accelerated repayment as the company's business deteriorated.\n\"Over the past 12 months, we have made substantial strides through an operational restructuring,\" Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz said in a statement, adding that Gibson will \"refocus on our core business\" of musical instruments, which \"we believe will assure the company's long-term stability and financial health.\"\nRead more from USA Today:\n401(k) investors' gains in 2018 won't match last year's as stock market stalls\nRoger Chen and Bret Schoolmeester: How we became innovators and shoe designers at Nike\nMortgages, other loans get pricier as 10-year Treasury rate tops 3 percent\nJuszkiewicz owns 36 percent of the company, according to the bankruptcy petition.\nTo be sure, the best-laid plans of companies that file for bankruptcy often go awry in court.\nA federal judge will be required to sign off on the company's plan to shed debt, which has the support of 69 percent of secured lenders on notes due in 2018.\nUnsecured creditors, such as other lenders and vendors, could object to the restructuring plan and demand liquidation on the grounds that they'd be better off with the company going out of business.\nGibson's guitars include the Les Paul, SG, Flying V, Explorer, J-45 and Hummingbird.\nThe company sells its products in more than 3,000 places, including physical retailers and websites.\nThe company has long trumpeted its made-in-America guitars. Gibsons are manufactured in Nashville, Memphis and Bozeman, Mt.\nGibson's musical instruments business has more than 875 workers.",
