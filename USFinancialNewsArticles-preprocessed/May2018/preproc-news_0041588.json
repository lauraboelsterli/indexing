One company executive told the Wall Street Journal the guidance on nonpaying guests had long been a gray area, which the Philadelphia incident brought to the forefront.\nThe company said at the time that it had different guidelines for its 28,000 stores globally, depending on the market. The new policy will apply to its more than 8,000 U.S. company-operated cafes. ",
