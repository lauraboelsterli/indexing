    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a Moscow court on Tuesday for his role in organizing nation-wide protests against President Vladimir Putin on May 5.\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was detained at a recent protest called under the slogan \"Putin is not our tsar\", walks before entering a court building in Moscow, Russia May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva Some 1,600 anti-Kremlin activists, including Navalny, were detained during protests held ahead of Putin’s inauguration for a fourth term as president.\nNavalny had called for demonstrations in more than 90 towns and cities under the slogan “Putin is not our tsar” to protest what he says is Putin’s autocratic rule.\nPutin, 65, won re-election overwhelmingly in March, extending his grip over Russia for six more years - a tenure of 24 years that would make him Moscow’s longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.\nNavalny, who has been detained and jailed several times for organizing similar protests, was barred from running in Russia’s presidential election for what he says was a false pretext.\nThe court on Tuesday said Navalny’s 30-day sentence would come into effect immediately, a Reuters correspondent there reported. The court then launched into a second trial on a separate charge - refusing to comply with a police order - which carries a maximum sentence of 15 days.\nReporting by Polina Ivanova; writing by Maria Kiselyova and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
