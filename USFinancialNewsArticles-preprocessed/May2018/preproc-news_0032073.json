    "text": "PARIS, May 14 (Reuters) - Airbus finance chief Harald Wilhelm will leave the European planemaker in 2019, the company said on Monday, following outgoing CEO Tom Enders.\nA statement from Wilhelm said that next year would be the right time to leave after 18 years with the company’s finance department.\n“Until then, I remain committed to the performance of the company and I will work with the management to ensure a smooth transition to the next Airbus CFO,” he said.\nAirbus is also in the process of finding a new chief executive to replace Enders. The company has said a candidate will be submitted to shareholders at the annual meeting in spring 2019 and Enders will help to secure a smooth transition.
