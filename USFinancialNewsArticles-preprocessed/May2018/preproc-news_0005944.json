This represents our 9 th consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth despite competitive new capacity being added to the market.\nWe continue to drive each and every segment of our business with a particular focus on yielding our resorts. GEG's renowned 'World Class, Asian Heart' service combined with our differentiated resorts offerings have delivered memorable customer experiences and resulted in our portfolio of hotels reporting virtually 100% occupancy.\nOur balance sheet remains one of the strongest in global gaming with cash and liquid investments of $41.8 billion and net cash of $34.5 billion. Our strong balance sheet combined with substantial cash flow from operations allows us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and to fund our development pipeline and international expansion plans. These include Cotai Phases 3 & 4, Hengqin, Japan and the Philippines. On 28 February 2018 we announced another special dividend, which was paid on 27 April 2018. The dividend was $0.41 per share which was a 58% increase compared to the previous April dividend.\nThe first quarter was a very productive one for GEG in terms of our development initiatives. In March 2018, we announced our plans to develop a premium quality, eco-friendly beach resort in Boracay, Philippines. We support President Duterte's and the Philippine Government's initiative to clean-up and restore the pristine isle of Boracay.\nIn March 2018, we also announced a passive minority equity investment in Wynn Resorts, Limited (\"Wynn Resorts\") which we closed in early April 2018.\nWe continue to actively pursue Japan and subsequently announced that we enhanced and will continue to expand our team in Japan with the appointment of Mr. Ted Chan as Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\") - Japan Development.\nGEG is embarking on its next growth program with the construction of its Cotai Phases 3 & 4, which will include 4,500 hotel rooms, including family and premium high end rooms, significant MICE space, a 16,000-seat arena, F&B, retail and casinos, among others. GEG has the largest and the most well-defined development growth pipeline of any Macau concessionaire.\nWe are committed to continue to support the Macau Government's vision to develop Macau into a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure as demonstrated by GEG's Cotai Phases 3 & 4 and our planned development in Hengqin. Additionally, the Group supports the Central Government's Greater Bay Area integration program, as well as leveraging on the Belt & Road initiative by our proposed beach front resort development in the Philippine island of Boracay.\nThe continued growth in the rapidly emerging and underpenetrated middle-class in the Mainland and their demand for leisure and travel gives us great confidence in the longer term outlook for Macau. Additionally, the recent opening of new capacity in Macau and the soon to be launched Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge should further stimulate growth in visitations.\nLast but not least, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of our committed team members who deliver 'World Class, Asian Heart' service every day and contribute to the success of the Group.\"\nMacau Market Overview\nThe positive momentum of 2017 has continued into 2018, supported by a solid economic performance in China and strong outbound tourism.

The opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will eventually improve accessibility for international travelers who arrive by air via Hong Kong.

GEG supports and will leverage on the plan by enhancing the competitiveness of our resort portfolio, including our development plans on Hengqin.\nWe also look forward to international expansion opportunities, such as Boracay Island in the Philippines and an IR in Japan. We will continue to prudently seek opportunities to strategically expand our brand and serve guests with our \"World Class, Asian Heart\" philosophy.\nAs we enter Macau's seasonally high summer months, Galaxy Macau™ with its unique and highly differentiated Grand Resort Deck, complete with the world's largest Skytop Wave Pool and the world's longest Skytop Adventure Rapids is ideally positioned to capture above market share of customers seeking a more holistic holiday experience in Macau. We will continue to focus on driving profitable volumes, yielding our resorts and attracting higher spending customers.\nHowever, we do acknowledge that we face increased competition both in Macau and regionally and a tightening regulatory environment. There are a number of geo-political events occurring globally that may also impact consumer sentiment in the short term.\nGEG is committed to invest in Macau's economic diversification and support the Macau Government's vision of becoming a World Centre of Tourism and Leisure. We also support the Central Government's Belt & Road initiative and the Greater Bay Area initiative that will support further economic development between nine cities of southern Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macau.\n[1] The primary difference between statutory revenue and management basis revenue is the treatment of City Clubs revenue where fee income is reported on a statutory basis and gaming revenue is reported on a management basis.
