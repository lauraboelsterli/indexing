Our bookings and backlog growth also reflects sustained strong customer demand across our solutions which are enabling the development, testing and deployment of wireless connectivity.” Whelan added, “We continued to accomplish new and improved product initiatives during the first quarter in our Test & Measurement and Embedded Solutions segments. We were also proud to announce our selection by Lockheed Martin for integrated software and hardware solutions for an innovative satellite communications project. We are actively engaged with our customers on project designs and deployment planning and, looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth momentum.”\nThe Company expects the following for the quarter ended June 30, 2018:\nRevenue between $12,250,000 and $12,750,000 Gross margins between 45-46% of revenues Non-GAAP operating expenses between $5.4 and $5.6 million (specifically, the Company’s GAAP operating expenses, excluding depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges, purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with US GAAP, non-recurring acquisition and integration expenses, and foreign exchange gains and losses which cannot be itemized with particularity for reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure at this time).\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Wireless Telecom Group Inc. will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET in which management will discuss first quarter 2018 results.

Management believes, however, that certain non‐GAAP financial measures used in managing the Company’s business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results. Certain of the information set forth herein and certain of the information presented by the Company from time to time may constitute non‐GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have presented herein a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The non‐GAAP measures presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The foregoing measures do not serve as a substitute and should not be construed as a substitute for GAAP performance, but provide supplemental information concerning our performance that our investors and we find useful.\nThe Company views Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important performance metric because it facilitates the analysis of our results, exclusive of certain non‐cash and non-recurring items, including items which do not directly correlate to our business operations.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA metrics provide qualitative insight into our current performance; we use these measures to evaluate our results, the performance of our management team and our management’s entitlement to incentive compensation; and we believe that making this information available to investors enables them to view our performance the way that we view our performance and thereby gain a meaningful understanding of our core operating results, in general, and from period to period.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
