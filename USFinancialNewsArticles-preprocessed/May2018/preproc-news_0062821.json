RECALLS 12-COUNT FROZEN BREAKFAST BURRITOS DUE TO POSSIBLE FOREIGN MATTER CONTAMINATION\nWASHINGTON, MAY 31, 2018 – Ruiz Food Products, Inc., a Denison, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 50,706 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos that may be contaminated with extraneous material, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.\nThe frozen cook and serve breakfast burritos were produced on March 3, 2018. The following products are subject to recall:\n3.38-lb. plastic wrapped packages containing 12 Count, 4.5-ounce individually wrapped frozen “EL MONTEREY SIGNATURE BURRITOS, EGG, SAUSAGE, CHEESE & POTATO” with lot code 18062 and 18063, and a best if used date of 3/3/2019 or 3/4/2019. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 17523A” on the back of the packaging. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.\nThe problem was discovered after the company received complaints from consumers who reported finding white, semi-rigid plastic pieces in the product.\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.\nFSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers.
