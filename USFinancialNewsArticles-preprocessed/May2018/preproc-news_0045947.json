    "text": "0 COMMENTS Baseball Hall of Famer Tom Glavine and his wife Christine custom built an Atlanta home that incorporates both Gothic elements and a sports playground with a small-scale baseball field. Now the couple is putting that property on the market for $6.75 million.\nThe couple, who have been primarily based in Atlanta since Mr. Glavine was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1987, moved into the house in 2008, shortly before Mr. Glavine played his final game for the Braves. Mr. Glavine said he and his wife are selling because the house is too big for their family; their eldest three children have moved out, and their fourth will be going to college next year, leaving them with a third-grader. The couple is building another home in Alys Beach, Fla., near Panama City, but will maintain a presence in Atlanta, Mr. Glavine said.\nBaseball Hall of Famer Tom Glavine and his wife Christine are listing their custom-built home for $6.75 million. Photo: ZUMA PRESS The property is located in the Country Club of the South, a large gated community adjacent to a Jack Nicklaus -designed golf course. On over 3 acres, the approximately 16,132-square-foot house features Gothic-style archways and limestone floors reclaimed from a church in France.\nMore from Mansion\nShaquille ‘Shaq’ O’Neal’s Mega Florida Estate Asks $28 Million May 17, 2018 Former Beverly Hills Compound of Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman Asks $85 Million May 16, 2018 Malibu Home Steps to the Beach Seeks $57.5 Million May 15, 2018 A study has paneling replicated from the Cathedral of St. Philip in Atlanta, and a great room has a handmade leaded glass transom window. There are eight bedrooms and 9 bathrooms.\nMr. Glavine, 52, said the property was also designed to be a playground for the children. There is a sports court for hockey, a pool and a billiard and arcade room. The baseball field is a full-size infield installed by the Braves’ groundskeeper, he said. The Glavines’ 19-year-old son Peyton plays for the Auburn Tigers baseball team.\nLocated in the Country Club of the South, a large gated community north of Atlanta adjacent to a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, the approximately 16,132-square-foot house includes Gothic elements. Photo: Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby’s International Realty “What better place to really develop an arm,” quipped listing agent Paul Wegener of Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby’s International Realty.\nThere is also a display area for the family’s guitar collection, which includes guitars that formerly belonged to members of the bands Maroon 5 and Fleetwood Mac as well as Paul McCartney. The children all played guitar and Mrs. Glavine picked up a few at charity auctions, Mr. Glavine said.\n“We were trying to be that house where the children wanted to hang out with their friends, so that we could covertly keep an eye on them,” he laughed. The guitars aren’t for sale.\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com",
