REUTERS/Aly Song The reduced tariff will apply to 1,449 items, with the average rate dropping to 6.9 percent from 15.7 percent, the finance ministry said in a statement on its website.\nThe ministry said it would also scrap temporary tariff rates on 210 imported products from most favored nations from July 1.\nThe news comes a day after Chinaâ€™s state council, or cabinet, said it would reduce import tariffs on a range of consumer goods such as cosmetics, apparel and home appliances to force its industries to upgrade and boost competitiveness.\nReporting by Min Zhang in Beijing and Chyenyee Lee in Singapore; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
