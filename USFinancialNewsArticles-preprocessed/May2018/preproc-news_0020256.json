    "text": "Total Revenue Grows 28% Year over Year, ARPS Grows 31% Year over Year\nSubstantive Acquisitions Set the Company up for Future Growth\nSAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MINDBODY, Inc. (NASDAQ:MB), the leading technology platform for the fitness, wellness and beauty services industries, today announced the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Q1 was a pivotal quarter for MINDBODY,” said Rick Stollmeyer, co-founder and chief executive officer of MINDBODY. “With nearly 45 million consumer bookings on our mobile apps and a more than doubling of promoted offer sales year over year, our consumer marketplace strategy is in full swing. Now, with the acquisitions of FitMetrix, Booker and Frederick we are positioned for an acceleration of consumer adoption and strong growth for years to come.”\n“Our pricing and refined subscriber growth strategy contributed to excellent unit economics and yet another quarter of improving profitability while we continue to invest in our business,” said Brett White, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $53.8 million, a 28% increase year over year. Subscription and services revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $32.7 million, a 31% increase year over year. Payments revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.2 million, a 21% increase year over year. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $(1.7) million, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $(3.9) million, or $(0.10) per share. In the first quarter of 2018 the Company completed the acquisition of FitMetrix, Inc. In the transaction, the Company acquired the net deferred tax liabilities of FitMetrix. The acquired net deferred tax liabilities will provide a source of income for the Company to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets, for which a valuation allowance is no longer needed, resulting in an income tax benefit of $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.9 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $(1.2) million, or $(0.03) per share. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 of $1.1 million.\nRecent Business Highlights\nReleased a new and improved version of the MINDBODY app. Combined class lists and easy-to-use filters make it easier for people to explore and book a wide variety of workouts offered at the time, place and price that best fit their lifestyles. Completed the acquisition of Booker Software, Inc. on April 2, 2018. Booker is a leading cloud-based business management platform for salons and spas, and is the provider of Frederick, a fast-growing, automated marketing software for wellness businesses. The acquisition adds approximately 10,000 salons and spas to the MINDBODY marketplace. Acquired FitMetrix on February 19, 2018, which provides performance tracking integrations with fitness studio equipment and wearables, enabling fitness businesses to deliver a more immersive experience to their clients.\nFirst Quarter Key Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions and assess working capital needs.\nAs of and for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 2017 YoY Subscribers (end of period) 2 57,909 59,919 (3 )% Average monthly revenue per subscriber $ 302 $ 230 31 % Payments volume (in millions) $ 2,245 $ 1,866 20 % Dollar-based net expansion rate (average for the quarter) 3 106 % 108 % 1 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n2 Starting the first quarter of 2018, we define subscribers as unique physical locations or individual practitioners who have active subscriptions to services on our platform, as of the end of the period, including subscriptions to FitMetrix services and, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, Booker services.\n3 Starting the first quarter of 2018, we calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate using a quarterly average. We believe that this change in methodology for calculating our dollar-based net expansion rate mitigates some of the volatility that can occur when this key metric is calculated using only the last month in the period. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with this new methodology.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter and full year 2018, MINDBODY expects to report:\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2018 in the range of $59.5 million to $61.5 million, representing 35% to 39% growth over the second quarter of 2017. Revenue for the full year of 2018 in the range of $246.0 million to $252.0 million, representing 35% to 38% growth over the full year of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2018 in the range of $(4.5) million to $(3.0) million and weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter of approximately 47.6 million shares. Non-GAAP net loss for the full year of 2018 in the range of $(10.0) million to $(6.0) million and weighted average shares outstanding for the full year of approximately 47.8 million shares.\nThe outlook has been updated to reflect the acquisitions of FitMetrix and Booker. Non-GAAP net loss excludes estimates for, among others, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial guidance measures to corresponding GAAP financial guidance measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net loss and are not able to present the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss without unreasonable effort. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by MINDBODY’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of MINDBODY’s Class A common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and is subject to constant change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2018 will have a significant impact on MINDBODY’s future GAAP financial results.\nQuarterly Conference Call and Related Information\nMINDBODY will discuss its quarterly results today at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET)\nDial in : To access the call, please dial (844) 494-0191, or outside the U.S. (508) 637-5581, with Conference ID# 1051179 at least five minutes prior to the 1:30 p.m. PT start time.

We disclose the following historical non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in understanding and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss before (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) acquisition-related expenses, including, transaction expenses, (4) income tax provision (benefit), and (5) other expense, net, which consisted of interest income (expense), net, and other income (expense), net. Prior period acquisition-related expenses were insignificant. Accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect these expenses.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Adjusted EBITDA has a number of limitations, including the following: (1) Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in MINDBODY’s business; (2) although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (3) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements for acquisition-related expenses or tax payments; and (4) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balance attributable to common stockholders adjusted for: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (3) acquisition-related expenses, including, transaction expenses, and (4) partial releases of valuation allowances due to acquisition. Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss per share, is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding. Prior period acquisition-related expenses were insignificant. Accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect these expenses.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations, including the following: (1) these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in MINDBODY’s business; and (2) other companies, including companies in our industry, may exclude different items in their calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nMINDBODY, INC.
