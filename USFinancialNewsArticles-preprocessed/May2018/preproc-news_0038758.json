    "text": "HOUSTON, May 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turner Valley Oil and Gas, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC:TVOG), pending name change to PrimeStar Bitumen, Inc., is pleased to announce the appointment of Mike Lorrey, Director of Blockchain and M&A development, as Turner begins to transform itself into a fully operating shipping, infrastructure, and blockchain technology company.\nMr. Lorrey, one of the early engineers involved in the Cypherpunk mailing list that spawned Bitcoin, has an extensive bio in the crypto and blockchain fields and the company could not be more honored to bring his expertise and experience onto the team. He is currently the CTO at Pluto Inc., which is the developer of the Metalyfe next generation web/game/app browser, powered by Blockchain for seamless distributed web commerce and game/VR/AR/MR consolidated data enhanced immersive experiences. He is also President/Chairman at Galactic Systems Inc., a multi-service company providing consulting, software, and virtual goods and services in the virtual reality, communications, and blockchain industries. He was CEO at Octaneum, where he was co founder of the first comprehensive global oil and gas supply chain Blockchain. This is of special interest to TVOG as it is used to democratize capital in the petroleum commodity trading and supply chain marketplace, enabling the monetization of assets from in ground reserves to the gas pump. His educational background includes degrees from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Franklin Pierce College, and Woodbury University. His full Linkedin profile is located at Linkedin .\nMr. Lorrey commented on his appointment, “With TVOG’s entrance into the infrastructure and shipping industries, those markets are primed for blockchain technology to enter them as well. The opportunities available are endless, especially on the insurance side of the market as ghost bookings are a major issue, and I am excited and anxious to begin turning these opportunities into revenue producing deals for the company.”\nThis is the first of many management additions, and the company is preparing to introduce the full team in the coming weeks via press releases and filings.\nAs stated in Turners most recent press release, the Company has already been involved in advanced negotiations with three well established blockchain technology companies. All are in the advanced stages of discussions moving towards closing, or in one case, the transaction has already been closed. They are aimed at M & A (Merger & Acquisition) and JV (Joint Venture) agreements, and the first completed closing will be announced in an upcoming press release as soon as prudently possible. This undertaking, along with all of the upcoming blockchain transactions, will be structured in a way so that the company can benefit from the growth of the blockchain technology sector while strategically applying it to the bitumen and related supply chain, shipping, and infrastructure segments.\nManagement believes that by making strategic acquisitions, investments, and mutually beneficial alliances, it can have a competitive advantage in its market places and be able to help shape the blockchain technology expansion currently taking place across various industries.\nIn addition to the pending blockchain press releases, TVOG expects to make announcements soon regarding a new Board of Directors and more management additions, expansion/shipping contract details, M & A’s, JV’s, an updated website, and a host of other company events as the company builds upon its initial bitumen shipping asset purchase.\nNASDAQ Material Disclosure Link: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tvog/press-releases\nSEC Form 10 Link: https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/sec-filings/12583468/content/html\nAbout Turner Valley Oil & Gas, Inc.\nTurner Valley Oil & Gas, Inc.
