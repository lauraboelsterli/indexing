    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acasta Enterprises Inc. (TSX:AEF) (“ Acasta ” or the “ Company ”) announced today that it has monetized its interest in the profit participating notes (“ PPNs ”) that were retained by Acasta following the sale of its Stellwagen business unit. The net proceeds from the monetization of the PPNs were approximately $28.5 million which amount was used by Acasta to further pay down indebtedness. These proceeds exclude the additional U.S.$5 million due from the purchaser of the Stellwagen business unit pursuant to the sale agreement.\nAs a result of sale of the Stellwagen business unit and the PPNs, Acasta has effectively reduced its total indebtedness by approximately $68.8 million.\nAdvisories:\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements\nThis news release may include forward looking statements.
