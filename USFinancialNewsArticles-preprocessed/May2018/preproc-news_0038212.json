    "text": "ATLANTA, The Home Depot®, the world's largest home improvement retailer, today reported sales of $24.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a 4.4 percent increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were positive 4.2 percent, and comp sales in the U.S. were positive 3.9 percent.\nNet earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $2.4 billion, or $2.08 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $2.0 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2017. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, diluted earnings per share increased 24.6 percent from the same period in the prior year.\n\"We are pleased by the strength of our business despite a slow start to the spring selling season,\" said Craig Menear, chairman, CEO and president. \"Outside of our seasonal business, we had solid results in all markets and categories and are seeing strong momentum in all lines of business during these first few weeks of May. These trends, as well as a favorable housing and macroeconomic backdrop, give us confidence to reaffirm our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. I would like to thank our associates for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers.\"\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nIncluding the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 discussed below, the Company expects its fiscal 2018 sales to grow by approximately 6.7 percent and comp sales to be up approximately 5.0 percent. The Company also reaffirmed its diluted earnings-per-share growth guidance for the year and expects diluted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 28.0 percent from fiscal 2017 to $9.31.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement – Revenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, which pertains to revenue recognition. The adoption of this standard will not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Under ASU No. 2014-09, the Company has changed the presentation of certain expenses and cost reimbursements associated with its private label credit card program, certain expenses related to the sale of gift cards to customers, and gift card breakage income. The Company also has changed its recognition of gift card breakage income to be recognized proportionately as redemption occurs, rather than based on historical redemption patterns.\nThe Company has adopted this standard on a modified retrospective basis. In accordance therewith, financial information prior to fiscal 2018 will not be recast. The consolidated statement of earnings and balance sheet for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflect the effect of this accounting policy adoption. The impact of adoption was an increase of $33 million to net sales, a decrease of $98 million to cost of sales, and a corresponding increase of $131 million to operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. There is no impact from the Company's adoption on operating income, net earnings or earnings per share. The balance sheet reflects the cumulative impact of adoption using the modified retrospective method as well as the impact of recording the sales return allowance on a gross basis rather than as a net liability. Additional information about the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is available at http://ir.homedepot.com/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2018 .\nThe Home Depot will conduct a conference call today at 9 a.m. ET to discuss information included in this news release and related matters. The conference call will be available in its entirety through a webcast and replay at http://ir.homedepot.com/events-and-presentations .\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company operated a total of 2,285 retail stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 10 Canadian provinces and Mexico. The Company employs more than 400,000 associates. The Home Depot's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: HD) and is included in the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index.\n###\nCertain statements contained herein constitute \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
