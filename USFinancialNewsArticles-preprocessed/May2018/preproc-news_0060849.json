    "text": "1 COMMENTS Pacific Investment Management Co. is raising money for a new, multibillion-dollar commercial real-estate debt fund, the bond manager’s latest foray into more lucrative—and less liquid—markets, people familiar with the matter said.\nPimco Commercial Real Estate Debt, or PCRED, will invest in both public and private debt—including mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and mezzanine loans—the firm wrote in a public job listing seeking to hire investment staff. Pimco’s U.S. real-estate team will manage the fund, which will target deals valued at $20 million to $500 million.\nCommercial real-estate debt funds finance properties ranging from office buildings and shopping centers to hotels. Mezzanine loans are riskier than senior debt, and therefore typically pay investors a higher interest rate.\nThe push into privately held debt, real estate and other so-called alternative investments is a key plank in the strategy led by Emmanuel Roman , the former hedge-fund firm manager tapped as the firm’s chief executive in 2016. Driving Pimco’s move: The pressures traditional stock- and bond-pickers are facing from exchange-traded funds and other low-cost investments options. Alternatives command higher fees and their strategies can’t be easily mimicked by exchange-traded funds, insulating them from a passive-investing wave that has turned the asset-management industry on its head.\nIn addition to alternatives, Pimco recently unveiled plans to invest heavily in computer-driven trading and investing. The firm also plans to open an office in Austin, Texas, in the coming months.\nPimco’s portfolio of alternative funds has grown from $26 billion in assets in late 2016, when Mr. Roman was hired, to some $30 billion today. The firm oversees more than $1.7 trillion in total.\nIn its bid to beef up its alternatives business, Pimco has sought to take advantage of big banks’ reticence to lend as often as they had before the financial crisis amid a number of new capital requirements.\nThree so-called Bravo funds, which invested in different kinds of loans, from Pimco have raised more than $12 billion since 2011.\nThe first fund, Bravo I, produced a net return of 22.1% from its inception through June 2017, according to a memorandum made public by Pennsylvania’s Public School Employees’ Retirement System, a Pimco client. Bravo II, launched in 2013, had an 11.8% net return as of June, the memo said. Pimco launched Bravo III last year, raising $4.6 billion.\nPCRED, the new fund, is narrowing that strategy to focus exclusively on commercial real-estate loans.\nThe company’s U.S. real-estate group is led by John Murray and Devin Chen. Mr. Chen said in a September interview on the company’s website that “more than $1 trillion of U.S. commercial real-estate loans are set to mature over the next three years” and banks may be unwilling to refinance all of that debt. Pimco is hoping to step in.\nPimco has taken other steps to build out its alternatives business.\nThe firm formed a joint venture with private-debt investor Solar Capital Partners in December 2016, and in 2017 hired former Blackstone Group executive Greg Hall to lead its private-strategies business.\nLate last year, though, Pimco dissolved the Solar partnership before raising any money from outside investors after the firm determined it was “better for us to own 100% of something,” Mr. Roman said in a recent interview.\nWrite to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com",
