    "text": "NEW YORK, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tyme, Inc. (NASDAQ:TYME), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics, today announced the appointment of Don DeGolyer to the Company’s board of directors .\nMr. DeGolyer is the founder, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of Vertice Pharma, LLC, a specialty pharmaceuticals company focused on improving patients’ health. He was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Endo Pharmaceuticals and, before that, served as President & CEO of Sandoz North America. Mr. DeGolyer also held various leadership roles at Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis, in all totaling over 30 years of experience in the pharmaceuticals industry.\nMr. DeGolyer will be an independent director and a member of the Company’s audit committee. In conjunction with Mr. DeGolyer’s election and appointment to the audit committee, director Paul Sturman has stepped down from the audit committee. Mr. Sturman continues to serve as the chairman of the compensation committee of the Board.\n“We are delighted to have Don joining our board,” said Steve Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer of Tyme. “His extensive industry experience and successful track record in manufacturing and commercialization will be a real asset for Tyme as we continue into an important period for the company.”\nAbout Tyme Technologies\nTyme Inc., is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that are intended to be broadly effective across tumor types and have low toxicity profiles. Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system.\nFor more information, visit www.tymeinc.com .\nForward-Looking Statements/Disclosure Notice\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements within this press release include, without limitation, statements regarding our drug candidates (including SM-88), their clinical potential and non-toxic safety profiles, our drug development plans and strategies, our completed studies, ongoing and planned clinical trials, preliminary data results and the therapeutic design and mechanisms of our drug candidates; and readers can identify forward-looking statements by sentences or passages involving the use of terms such “believes,” “expects,” “hopes,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “intends,” “estimates,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “continue,” “seeks,” or “anticipates,” and similar words (including their use in the negative) or by discussions of future matters such as the development of new products, technology enhancements, possible collaborations, the timing, scope and objectives of our planned clinical trials, funding plans and planned uses of proceeds, and other statements that are not historical. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s current expectations, which are subject to uncertainty, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of Tyme’s control. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any historical results and future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, that the information is of a preliminary nature and may be subject to change; uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to achieve clinical study start and completion dates; the possibility of unfavorable study results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing data; risks associated with early, initial data, including the risk that the final Phase II data may differ from prior study data or preliminary Phase II data; final results of additional clinical trials that may be different from the preliminary data analysis and may not support further clinical development; that past reported data are not necessarily predictive of future patient or clinical data outcomes; whether and when any applications or other submissions for SM-88 may be filed with regulatory authorities; whether and when regulatory authorities may approve any applications or submissions; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters that could affect commercial availability of SM-88; competitive developments; and the factors described in the section captioned “Risk Factors” of Tyme’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 12, 2017, as well as subsequent reports we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available at www.sec.gov ). The data analyses discussed above are not necessarily predictive of future patient or clinical data outcomes.\nThe information contained in this press release is as of release date and Tyme assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of future events or developments.\nContacts\nLifeSci Advisors\nAshley Robinson\narr@lifesciadvisors.com\n617-535-7742\nSource:Tyme Technologies, Inc.",
