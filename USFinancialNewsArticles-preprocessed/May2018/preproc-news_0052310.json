    "text": "McDonald’s shareholders rejected a proposal to phase out plastic straws , according to the Associated Press, marking a setback for environmentalists who had hoped to reduce the amount of waste produced by the fast-food giant.\nFewer than 8% voted in favor of the proposal, according to the BBC . The proposal put forth by a minor shareholder asked for a report on the “business risks” of keeping plastic straws, according to a SEC filing, and asked the company “to develop and implement substitutes for plastic straws in its restaurants.”\n“The requested report is unnecessary, redundant to our current practices and initiatives, and has the potential for a diversion of resources with no corresponding benefit to the company, our customers, and our shareholders,” the board said, according to the BBC.\nThe result was in line with McDonald’s board, which had urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, according to the SEC filing .\n“We continue to work to find a more sustainable solution for plastic straws globally,” the company said in a statement to USA Today before the vote. “In the meantime, we have adopted compostable straws in certain markets to meet regulations while we work with packaging experts to develop a planet-friendly, cost-effective answer for all McDonald’s restaurants.”\nGlobal consumer watchdog group SumOfUs, which backed the shareholder proposal, collected nearly 500,000 signatures asking McDonald’s to phase out plastic straws due to environmental concerns.\nYuk! If we eat seafood, all that plastic in the oceans ultimately ends up in us…along with all the toxins that it soaks up on the way.

These actions are part of our broader efforts to source 100% of packaging from renewable, recycled, or certified sources by 2025 and to have guest packaging recycling in all restaurants.

Since we filed the shareholder proposal and began our petition, McDonald’s has taken some important steps to get in front of this issue – including phasing out plastic straws in the UK. We hope McDonald’s will continue to take this issue seriously and we look forward to them reporting back on a timeline for instituting these important reforms.”\nUpdate: This article was updated from the original statements from SumOfUs and McDonald’s",
