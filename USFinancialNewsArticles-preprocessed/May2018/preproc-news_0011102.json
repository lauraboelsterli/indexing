[If] the Saudis decide they're going to start selling oil, we're going to say, 'Wow, why didn't Cramer tell me to get out of Hi-Crush? 'Cause I was crushed.'\"\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Co. : \"Keep waiting [to buy]. There's nothing there. There's nothing there.\"\nGeron Corp. : \"No, no. Look, we've got enough problems. Gilead's all down there and Celgene and the downgrade in Regeneron . We don't [need] to go down the food chain and buy Geron.\"\nCognex Corporation : \"Oh, no. Machine vision, no, no, no. No vision. We like machine learning, but not machine vision. That's why we like Nvidia.\"\nBox Inc. : \"Box is a winner. [CEO] Aaron Levie. I've liked this guy since $12 bucks. I, of course, was the only guy who did, but that's alright. I mean, I really like him personally â€“ I'm saying the stock.\"\nApplied Materials Inc. : \"Look, I'm not going to fight you on [buying Applied Materials]. I know a lot of people are selling Applied Materials because they feel like it's a play on DRAMs. I think it's much bigger than that. It's got a big display business. I'm going to concur that Applied Materials is just too low down here.\"\nJacobs Engineering Group : \"Jacobs Engineering is a very well-run company. I'm going to say I endorse.\"\nEditas Medicine : \"Oh, boy, another one of these small biotech companies. I got all the guys who would possibly buy them just absolutely on the ropes, so I'm going to have to say pass.\"\nWatch the full lighting round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Get out of Hi-Crush before you get crushed 4 Hours Ago | 03:50 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia.\n ",
