    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 11:02 AM / Updated 37 minutes ago No forced layoffs in planned Innogy break-up: unions, companies Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nDUESSELDORF (Reuters) - The planned break-up of German energy group Innogy ( IGY.DE ) will happen without forced layoffs, according to a framework agreement between labor unions, Innogy, its parent RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and rival E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) published on Friday.\nThe far-reaching asset swap deal between RWE and E.ON, first announced in March, will essentially mark the end of Innogy as an independently listed company and has led to concerns that Innogy could bear the brunt of planned job cuts.
