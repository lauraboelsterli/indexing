Last year, it generated revenues of 29 million euros and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 5 million euros.\nAt 0710 GMT, Mondi shares in London were up 0.8 percent.\n$1 = 0.8245 euros Reporting by Nqobile Dludla, Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter\n ",
