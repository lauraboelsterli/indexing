All CFO Journal-produced content can be accessed without a subscription.\nJackie Donkhong worked on a motorcycle at the Polaris Industries factory in Spirit Lake, Iowa, U.S., Aug. 2014. Getty Images Good morning. Decision-makers at large U.S. companies are considering to rein in corporate spending amid rising commodity prices, reports the WSJ’s Ben Eisen. Part of the increase stems from the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports, including steel and aluminum.\nHeating, ventilation, and cooling company Lennox International Inc. said at the start of the year it expected a $40 million impact on pretax earnings from higher commodity prices. After the tariff announcement, the company raised that projection to $50 million.\nSteve Harrison, Lennox vice president of investor relations, said the company is passing the costs on to customers. The firm raised prices 4% to 6% at the beginning of the year, then on Friday announced another increase of 5% to 8%. His competitors are lifting prices as well, Mr. Harrison said.\n“We expect steel and other commodity costs to be a headwind all year,” said Bradley Halverson, chief financial officer at Caterpillar Inc. , on an earnings call. Companies including Harley-Davidson Inc. and Polaris Industries Inc. have said in recent earnings calls that tariffs are boosting commodity prices that had already been climbing.\nThis also affects the U.S. labor market. States with high production of steel, aluminum, aircraft, cars and soybeans recently have been adding a smaller share of new jobs, according to Deutsche Bank AG.\nTHE DAY AHEAD\nFed to release policy statement. The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to publish a policy statement at 2 P.M. ET on Wednesday. U.S. central bank officials are expected to leave interest rates unchanged, reports Bloomberg.\nBunge Ltd. , Clorox Co. , CVS Health Corp. , Kraft Heinz Co. , Tesla Inc. and Manulife Financial Corp. are among the companies slated to report earnings today. The WSJ’s Tim Higgins has six things to watch in Tesla’s results.\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE\nDeutsche Telekom expects debt repayment if T-Mobile buys Sprint. Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG plans to rein in its borrowing as it expects substantial repayments from its subsidiary T-Mobile US Inc. , should it complete the Sprint Corp. takeover. The Bonn-based company has provided its U.S. unit with billions of dollars of intercompany financing, a practice that will end with the acquisition, report CFO Journal’s Nina Trentmann and Ezequiel Minaya.\nCORPORATE NEWS\nThe Apple logo is seen in a store in New York, N.Y., U.S. Reuters Apple in new share buyback. Apple Inc. announced a record $100 billion plan to buy back shares from investors, as it reported strong revenue growth and profit even though increases in the number of iPhones sold remained weak.\nAmazon tells U.S. cities what it does not like. Amazon.com Inc. has made about 200 phone calls to U.S. cities the retail giant rejected for its second headquarters. Some of the cities say they are learning from the disappointing results and making changes.\nXerox CEO exits as company settles with activists. Xerox Corp. said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, is resigning in a settlement with two of the company’s biggest investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. The pact shakes up the majority of the board and puts its transaction with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. at risk.\nFacebook readies new privacy tool. Facebook Inc. is giving users the ability to see and control data the social network receives about them from outside apps and websites that use the company’s ads and analytics tools.\nTesla under pressure to fulfill solar panel promises. Executives at Tesla Inc. are facing another financial challenge. Installations of the company’s home solar panels are declining and the business is under pressure to fulfill promises it made to investors, just as the U.S. tax overhaul presents new risks to the industry.\n7-Eleven falls behind in fresh-food wave. For 7-Eleven Inc. , Big Gulps and Slurpees are no longer enough. The convenience-store pioneer is falling behind rivals that are gleaning more sales from healthier snacks and freshly cooked meals.\nSnap shares fall as results disappoint. Snap Inc. on Tuesday said revenue rose 54% in the first quarter from a year ago, missing analyst estimates. Efforts to wrest a larger share of advertisers’ budgets were impeded by Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\nMondelez boosted by higher snack sales. Mondelez International Inc. said it sold more Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate in emerging markets in the first quarter, highlighting the growing appetite for snacks around the world.\nREGULATION\nA Goldman Sachs sign is seen at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, N.Y., U.S., Jan. 24, 2014. Reuters Goldman Sachs to settle forex case. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will pay around $110 million to settle claims that it failed to supervise foreign exchange traders who put clients at a disadvantage by inappropriately sharing information about their market positions with rivals.\nEU to clear UTC, Rockwell Collins deal. European Union regulators are set to give conditional approval to U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp.’s $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. , people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, as reported by Reuters.\nU.S. amends Russia sanctions program. The Trump administration on Tuesday made changes to its Russia sanctions program, paving the way for aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC to be taken off the list and granting the metals market a reprieve from a supply scare that rocked markets over the past month.\nECONOMY\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, left, talks to President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., Jan. 23, 2018.

One of the deadlines will be in mid-May when U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer wants to finish the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nEurozone economy wavers in first quarter. The eurozone economy slowed to an annualized growth rate of 1.7% in the first three months of this year, down from 2.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. The slowdown doesn’t come as a surprise, as industrial output, retail sales and other indicators had pointed towards an easing of growth.\nPBoC makes improvements to cross-border payment system. China’s central bank extended the working hours of its cross-border interbank payment system from 12 to 24 hours a day. Given time differences among markets, the system will be running for an extra four hours each week so it can cover the entire global financial market.\nBank of Canada governor warns on household debt. Canadians amassed high levels of household debt while interest rates were low and house prices were rising, a natural consequence of prolonged stimulus that today poses risks to the economy, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said Tuesday.\nCFO MOVES\nMetLife Inc. , the New York-based insurance and financial services provider, appointed John McCallion as Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1.

Talent concerns have topped CFOs’ list of internal risks for many quarters, and their focus on talent acquisition, quality, and retention seems to have intensified. Despite talent constraints, 69% of the 155 CFOs responding to the survey say now is a good time to be taking greater risk—up from 63% in Q4 2017, and a new survey high.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
