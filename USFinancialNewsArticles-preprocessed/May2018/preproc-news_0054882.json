    "text": "LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Britain wants to continue fully participating in the European Union’s Galileo satellite navigation programme, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday.\n“Our position remains that we want to continue as full participants of the programme.
