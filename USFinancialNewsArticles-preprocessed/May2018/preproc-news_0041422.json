    "text": "ROME, May 17 (Reuters) - A proposal by the 5-Star Movement and the far-right League to exclude government bonds held by the European Central Bank from countries’ debt calculations can help Italy meet European rules on debt reduction, a 5-Star lawmaker told Reuters on Thursday.\nA draft policy agenda drawn up by the two parties as the basis of a coalition government includes a proposal that sovereign debt bought by the ECB under its “quantitative easing” programme not be counted in EU countries’ debt-to-GDP ratios.\n“The only effect (of the proposal) is to make it easier to respect the fiscal compact,” said 5-Star deputy Laura Castelli, who helped draw up the parties’ joint programme.\nThe EU’s “fiscal compact” imposes steep annual reductions in the debt of highly indebted countries such as Italy.
