For information regarding the presentation of the 2017 financial information contained in this release, including with respect to our adoption of ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, see notes 1 and 12.\nCEO Mike Fries stated , \"We generated 4.2% rebased 2 revenue growth in Q1, which was our third consecutive quarter of top-line improvement, underpinned by 5.2% rebased growth at Virgin Media, on the back of accelerating ARPU and strong mobile and B2B results.\"\n\"Our rebased OCF growth of 4.7% in Q1, which represents our strongest first quarter result since 2014, was driven by 11.8% growth in Germany, 6.3% in Central and Eastern Europe, 5.5% at Virgin Media and a flat indirect cost base. We continue to expect around 5% rebased OCF growth for the full year.\nOn the innovation front, we remain at the forefront of delivering cutting-edge products and services. Earlier this month in Bochum, Germany, we launched our first gigabit broadband service powered by Docsis 3.1 technology. In addition, nearly half of our video and broadband bases now enjoy a next-generation set top and/or a WiFi connect box. Of course, we will continue to deploy market-leading products while readying our fiber-rich networks for Docsis 3.1 roll-outs across Europe.\"\n\"We expect our previously announced sale of UPC Austria for €1.9 billion to T-Mobile Austria to close in the second half of 2018. In March, we announced the termination of our planned purchase of Multimedia Polska, which highlights our acquisition discipline as we stepped away from this opportunity when the remedies became too burdensome.\nAt March 31, 2018, our balance sheet had an average long-term debt tenor 9 of more than seven years, a fully-swapped borrowing cost of 4.2% and a liquidity 10 position in excess of $4 billion. With regards to our share buyback program, we bought nearly $500 million of stock in Q1 and remain on track to repurchase a total of $2 billion this year.\"\nQ1 2018 Highlights 2018 Guidance Targets NEW PREMISES BUILT 204,000\nREBASED OCF GROWTH ~5% B2B 5 REVENUE GROWTH 2 +12.4% ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW 7 $1.6BN 8 ORGANIC RGU 6 ADDITIONS 66,000 P&E ADDITIONS OF $5.1 BN 8 About Liberty Global\nLiberty Global (NASDAQ: LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) is the world’s largest international TV and broadband company, with operations in 11 European countries under the consumer brands Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet and UPC.

On the fixed product side, all three products showed year-over-year declines U.K./Ireland: Q1 RGU additions of 45,000 were lower than the prior year, as the impacts of lower gross additions more than offset improved performance in new build areas. This performance reflects our focus on improving the value and tenure of our customer base through structured promotions, select price rises and the launch of initiatives such as our V6 set-top box upgrade program Belgium: RGU attrition of 22,000 in Q1 was primarily due to intensified competition. However, our converged quad-play package additions continued to grow, as we gained 30,000 new \"WIGO\" subscribers during Q1 Germany: Reported 29,000 RGU additions in Q1, which was below our Q1 2017 result, mainly due to higher video attrition as last year's performance was driven by strong results in our MDU segment. Q1 broadband and fixed-line telephony net additions were impacted by churn from price increases implemented in the quarter Switzerland/Austria: Lost 35,000 RGUs in Q1, compared to a loss of 2,000 in Q1 2017, primarily due to heightened competition in Switzerland CEE: Delivered 49,000 RGUs in Q1, largely in line with the prior-year period Next-Generation Video Penetration (including Horizon TV, Horizon-Lite, TiVo, Virgin TV V6 and Yelo TV): Added 201,000 subscribers to our advanced platforms in Q1 and reached 7.9 million or 45% of our total cable video base (excluding DTH) by the end of the quarter WiFi Connect Box: Deployments of our latest WiFi Connect box increased by over 800,000 in Q1, ending the quarter with an installed base of nearly 7.3 million or 48% of broadband subscribers across Europe Mobile: Added 52,000 mobile subscribers in Q1, as 101,000 postpaid additions were partially offset by continued attrition in our low-ARPU prepaid base Belgium added 22,000 new mobile subscribers during Q1, a strong year-over-year improvement. This was driven by the continued success of our converged \"WIGO\" offers U.K./Ireland added 69,000 postpaid mobile subscribers in Q1, 87% higher than the prior-year result. Total mobile net additions increased by 25,000 in the quarter as postpaid growth was partially offset by low-ARPU prepaid losses. The penetration of 4G at Virgin Media increased to 62% of our postpaid base at the end of Q1 and almost 20% of our U.K. mobile base has been migrated to our full MVNO platform, which went live in Q4 2017 Switzerland/Austria mobile subscriber additions were up year-over-year with 16,000 mobile subscriber additions in Q1, driven by improved Swiss offerings, which include free EU roaming\nRevenue Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) revenue of each of our consolidated reportable segments for the comparative periods and (ii) the percentage change from period to period on both a reported and rebased basis:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease/(decrease)\nRevenue 2018 2017 12\n%\nRebased % in millions, except % amounts U.K./Ireland $ 1,778.2 $ 1,502.5 18.3 5.2 Belgium 759.6 660.0 15.1 (1.3 ) Germany 782.8 624.1 25.4 8.7 Switzerland/Austria 454.6 422.8 7.5 (0.4 ) Central and Eastern Europe 330.8 270.7 22.2 4.3 Central and Corporate 51.7 32.8 57.6 41.1 Intersegment eliminations (1.6 ) (3.7 ) N.M.

These results included: A favorable $33.2 million impact of the settlement of prior-year fees in connection with the execution of a new carriage fee contract in Germany during the first quarter of 2018 A reduction in channel carriage fee revenue primarily related to the June 2017 discontinuation of our analog video services in Germany, which resulted in decreased revenue of $7.3 million in Q1 2018 A $5.3 million headwind from the expected recovery of VAT paid in prior periods with respect to copyright fees in Belgium, which benefited revenue in Q1 2017 The unfavorable $3.9 million impact due to the reversal during the first quarter of 2018 of revenue in Switzerland that was recognized during prior-year periods A $3.7 million headwind from the release of unclaimed customer credits in Switzerland in Q1 2017 Our residential cable business reported rebased revenue growth of 2.8% in Q1 Our B2B business (including SOHO and non-subscription revenue) reported rebased revenue growth of 12.4% in Q1 Our residential mobile business (including interconnect and handset sales) posted 4.5% rebased revenue growth in Q1\nQ1 2018 Rebased Revenue Growth - Segment Highlights\nU.K./Ireland: Rebased revenue growth of 5.2% reflects (i) 3.0% growth in our residential cable business supported by accelerating cable ARPU and subscriber growth, (ii) 17.8% rebased growth in residential mobile revenue (including interconnect and mobile handset revenue), reflecting higher revenue from mobile handset sales that was partially offset by lower mobile subscription revenue, and (iii) 4.5% rebased revenue growth in our B2B business, largely driven by continued growth in the SOHO segment Belgium: Rebased revenue contraction of 1.3% was mainly driven by the net effect of (i) lower cable revenue, (ii) lower mobile revenue and (iii) growth in B2B segment Germany: Rebased revenue growth of 8.7% reflects the net effect of (i) higher residential cable non-subscription revenue, mainly driven by higher carriage fee revenue, including the net impact of the aforementioned $33.2 million settlement and the $7.3 million loss of carriage fee revenue, (ii) B2B revenue growth, largely driven by an increase in B2B non-subscription revenue, (iii) higher residential cable subscription revenue as a result of increases in subscribers and higher ARPU per RGU Switzerland/Austria: Rebased revenue declined slightly, primarily related to the net effect of (i) lower ARPU per RGU, which was impacted by competitive pressures, (ii) higher revenue from the distribution of MySports channels, (iii) higher mobile revenue and (iv) an increase in B2B revenue CEE: Rebased revenue growth of 4.3%, driven by the net effect of (i) growth in our B2B business, (ii) higher cable revenue supported by solid RGU additions over the last 12 months and (iii) a small decline in ARPU per RGU\nOperating Income\nOperating income of $493.1 million and $419.5 million in Q1 2018 and Q1 2017, respectively, representing an increase of 17.5% year over year The increase in operating income primarily resulted from the net effect of higher OCF, as further described below, and an increase in depreciation and amortization\nOperating Cash Flow Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) OCF of each of our consolidated reportable segments for the comparative periods, and (ii) the percentage change from period to period on both a reported and rebased basis:\nThree months ended Increase/(decrease) March 31, OCF 2018 2017 12\n%\nRebased % in millions, except % amounts U.K./Ireland $ 762.6 $ 642.9 18.6 5.5 Belgium 357.6 296.5 20.6 2.5 Germany 492.1 381.3 29.1 11.8 Switzerland/Austria 243.5 252.0 (3.4 ) (10.4 ) Central and Eastern Europe 139.1 110.9 25.4 6.3 Central and Corporate (96.0 ) (90.6 ) 6.0 4.7 Total $ 1,898.9 $ 1,593.0 19.2 4.7 OCF Margin 45.7 % 45.4 % N.M. - Not Meaningful\nReported OCF for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 19.2% year-over-year, respectively This result was primarily driven by the net impact of (i) the aforementioned impact of FX movements and (ii) organic OCF growth Rebased OCF growth of 4.7% in Q1 included: The net favorable impact on our revenue of certain items, as discussed in the \"Revenue Highlights\" section above An unfavorable $8.4 million network tax increase following an increase in the rateable value of our existing U.K. networks An unfavorable $8.8 million associated with the settlement of prior-year amounts in connection with the execution of a new programming agreement in Germany A favorable $6.7 million benefit in Q1 2018 due to the expected settlement of a portion of our 2018 annual incentive compensation with Liberty Global ordinary shares through a shareholding incentive program that was implemented in 2018 As compared to the prior-year period, our Q1 2018 OCF margins were up 30 basis points to 45.7%\nQ1 2018 Rebased Operating Cash Flow Growth - Segment Highlights\nU.K./Ireland: Rebased OCF growth of 5.5% reflects the net effect of (i) increased revenue, (ii) higher handset and programming spend, (iii) lower marketing costs and (iv) a $8.4 million year-over-year increase in network taxes following an April 1, 2017 increase in the rateable value of our U.K. networks Belgium: Rebased OCF growth of 2.5%, largely driven by the net effect of (i) lower direct costs as a result of the migration of subscribers to our own mobile network and (ii) the aforementioned revenue decrease Germany: Rebased OCF growth of 11.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in revenue, (ii) higher direct costs, primarily due to an increase in interconnect, programming and copyright costs, partially offset by lower handset costs, (iii) lower SG&A costs, primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing costs, and (iv) lower indirect expenses, primarily driven by in-sourced labor Switzerland/Austria: Rebased OCF declined 10.4% due to the aforementioned revenue impacts and an increase in the expense associated with the MySports Platform, which is more heavily weighted to the hockey season in the first and fourth quarters of the year CEE: Rebased OCF growth of 6.3%, driven by the net effect of (i) the aforementioned revenue growth, (ii) higher interconnect costs related to higher volumes in our voice transit business and (iii) lower indirect costs\nNet Loss Attributable to Liberty Global Shareholders\nNet loss attributable to Liberty Global shareholders (including discontinued operations) was $1,186.5 million and $325.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively\nLeverage and Liquidity\nTotal capital leases and principal amount of third-party debt: $42.8 billion Leverage ratios: Our adjusted gross and net leverage ratios at March 31, 2018 were 5.3x and 5.2x, respectively Average debt tenor : Over 7 years, with ~75% not due until 2024 or thereafter Borrowing costs: Blended fully-swapped borrowing cost of our third-party debt was 4.2% Liquidity: $4.2 billion, including (i) $0.6 billion of cash at March 31, 2018 and (ii) aggregate unused borrowing capacity 13 under our credit facilities of $3.6 billion\nForward-Looking Statements and Disclaimer\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to our strategies, future growth prospects and opportunities; expectations with respect to our OCF growth, our Adjusted FCF and our P&E additions; expectations with respect to the development, enhancement and deployment of our innovative and advanced products and services, including WiFi Connect and next generation set-top boxes as well as Docsis 3.1 roll outs; expectations with respect to the sale of UPC Austria; expectations regarding our share buyback program; the strength of our balance sheet and tenor of our third-party debt; and other information and statements that are not historical fact.

We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nBalance Sheets, Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows\nThe condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows of Liberty Global are in our 10-Q.\nRebase Information\nFor purposes of calculating rebased growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned during 2017, we have adjusted our historical revenue and OCF for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to (i) include the pre-acquisition revenue and OCF of an entity acquired during 2017 in our rebased amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the same extent that the revenue and OCF of this entity is included in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, (ii) include revenue and certain operating and SG&A expenses associated with the framework services agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV to reflect an amount equal to the framework services agreement amounts included in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, (iii) exclude the revenue and OCF of four small disposals made in Belgium during 2017 to the same extent that the revenue and OCF of these disposed businesses is excluded from our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, (iv) include revenue for the temporary elements of the Split-off Agreements with Liberty Latin America as if the Split-off Agreements had been in place at the beginning of 2017, (v) to reflect the January 1, 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) as if such adoption had occurred on January 1, 2017 and (vi) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2017 at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. We have included SFR BeLux in whole or in part in the determination of our rebased revenue and OCF for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We have reflected the revenue and OCF of this acquired entity in our 2017 rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial statements), as adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally accepted accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entity and (d) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired business during the pre-acquisition periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present the revenue and OCF of this entity on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post-acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors. The adjustments reflected in our rebased amounts have not been prepared with a view towards complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. In addition, the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and OCF that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and OCF that will occur in the future. The rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis, and are not presented as a measure of our pro forma financial performance.\nThe following table provides adjustments made to the 2017 amounts to derive our rebased growth rates:\nRevenue OCF Three months\nended\nMarch 31,\nThree months\nended\nMarch 31,\n2017 2017 in millions Acquisitions $ 17.3 $ 9.6 Revenue Recognition (ASU 2014-09) (9.8 ) (7.6 ) Dispositions * (8.6 ) (4.4 ) Foreign Currency 472.4 215.2 Total increase $ 471.3 $ 212.8 *Includes rebase adjustments related to agreements to provide transitional and other services to the VodafoneZiggo JV and Liberty Latin America. These adjustments result in an equal amount of fees in both the 2018 and 2017 periods for those services that are deemed to be temporary in nature. The net amount of these adjustments resulted in decreases in revenue and OCF for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $0.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nSummary of Debt, Capital Lease Obligations & Cash and Cash Equivalents\nThe following table (i) details the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of the outstanding principal amount of our debt, capital lease obligations and cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018:\nCapital Debt & Capital Cash Lease Lease and Cash Debt (ii) Obligations Obligations Equivalents in millions Liberty Global and unrestricted subsidiaries $ 2,451.5 $ 63.8 $ 2,515.3 $ 437.5 Virgin Media (iii) 17,296.6 81.3 17,377.9 38.2 Unitymedia 8,945.6 733.6 9,679.2 7.4 UPC Holding 7,221.8 95.4 7,317.2 27.7 Telenet 5,417.6 476.2 5,893.8 44.1 Total $ 41,333.1 $ 1,450.3 $ 42,783.4 $ 554.9\n(i) Except as otherwise indicated, the amounts reported in the table include the named entity and its subsidiaries.

(iii) The Virgin Media borrowing group includes certain subsidiaries of Virgin Media, but excludes the parent entity, Virgin Media Inc. The cash and cash equivalents amount includes cash and cash equivalents held by the Virgin Media borrowing group, but excludes cash and cash equivalents held by Virgin Media Inc. This amount is included in the amount shown for Liberty Global and unrestricted subsidiaries.

(ii) The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed under vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these expenditures are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered, and as repayments of debt when the related principal is repaid.

(ii) Our Internet Subscribers exclude 37,600 digital subscriber line (“DSL”) subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 81,500 subscribers who have requested and received this service. (iii) Our Telephony Subscribers exclude 29,200 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 137,100 subscribers who have requested and received this service. (iv) In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of March 31, 2018, our mobile subscriber count included 509,500 and 470,600 prepaid mobile subscribers in Belgium and the U.K., respectively. (v) Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At March 31, 2018, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 136,100 Cable Customer Relationships, 314,900 RGUs, 113,400 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 115,300 Internet Subscribers, and 86,200 Telephony Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. Due to the fact that we do not own these partner networks, we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks. Additional General Notes to Tables:\nMost of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our B2B SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.\nIn Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet's owned and leased networks.\nWhile we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.\nSubscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.\nFootnotes\n1 The former LiLAC Group has been treated as a discontinued operation and accordingly, the information in this release relates only to our continuing operations. For additional information, see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our 10-Q. 2 The indicated growth rates are rebased for acquisitions, dispositions, FX and the new revenue recognition standard (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Please see Rebase Information for information on rebased growth. 3 Please see Glossary for our Operating Cash Flow (\"OCF\") definition and the required reconciliations. 4 Our gross and net debt ratios are defined as total debt and net debt to annualized OCF of the latest quarter. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of these calculations, debt is measured using swapped foreign currency rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements, and excludes the loans backed or secured by the shares we hold in ITV plc, Sumitomo Corporation and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. 5 Total B2B includes subscription (SOHO) and non-subscription revenue. B2B and SOHO growth rates include upsell from our residential businesses. 6 Please see Glossary for the definition of RGUs. Organic figures exclude RGUs of acquired entities at the date of acquisition and other nonorganic adjustments, but include the impact of changes in RGUs from the date of acquisition. All subscriber/RGU additions or losses refer to net organic changes, unless otherwise noted. 7 Please see Glossary for information on Adjusted Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) and the required reconciliations. For more detailed information concerning our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows included in our 10-Q. 8 Based on FX rates as of February 13, 2018. New build and upgrade spend excludes related CPE. 9 For purposes of calculating our average tenor, total third-party debt excludes vendor financing. 10 Liquidity refers to cash and cash equivalents plus the maximum undrawn commitments under subsidiary borrowing facilities, without regard to covenant compliance calculations. 11 Includes subscription and non-subscription revenue. For additional information regarding how we define our revenue categories, see note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our 10-Q. 12 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), on a prospective basis. All applicable 2017 amounts in this release are presented on a pro forma basis that gives effect to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as if such adoption had occurred on January 1, 2017. In addition, on January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”) on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, the operating income and OCF amounts for the 2017 periods in this release have been retrospectively revised to reflect the impact of ASU 2017-07. For additional information, see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our 10-Q.

Upon completion of the relevant March 31, 2018 compliance reporting requirements for our credit facilities, and assuming no further changes from quarter-end borrowing levels, we anticipate that our subsidiaries' borrowing capacity will remain at $3.6 billion. Glossary\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow: net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions and (ii) expenses financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c) principal payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany that we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions), with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. We believe that our presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the indicated periods:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (i)\nin millions Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations $ 1,279.3 $ 904.4 Cash payments for direct acquisition and disposition costs 1.6 1.8 Expenses financed by an intermediary (ii) 557.8 297.8 Capital expenditures (646.0 ) (500.4 ) Principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (1,796.8 ) (1,014.2 ) Principal payments on certain capital leases (21.0 ) (20.4 ) Adjusted FCF $ (625.1 ) $ (331.0 )",
