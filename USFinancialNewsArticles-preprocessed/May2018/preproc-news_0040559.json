This issuing price represents 95% of the average opening prices Quote: d on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the 20 trading days preceding the date of the Annual General Meeting less the amount of the balance of the dividend payment, and rounded upward to the nearest euro cent.\nThe dividend ex-date is set on 23 May 2018.\nThe shareholders may opt for the dividend payment in cash or in new shares from 23 May 2018 to 6 June 2018 included, by sending their request to their financial intermediaries. For the shareholders who have not exercised their dividend payment option by 6 June 2018, the dividend shall necessarily be paid in cash.\nFor the shareholders who have not opted for a dividend payment in shares, the dividend shall be paid in cash on 14 June 2018. For the shareholders who have opted to receive the dividend in shares, settlement and delivery of the shares will take place as from 14 June 2018.\nIf the amount of dividends for which the option is exercised does not amount to a whole number of shares, shareholders may choose to either receive the rounded-up whole number of shares by paying the difference in cash on the day they exercise the option or receive the rounded-down whole number of shares and the balance in cash. In this case, the balance in cash will be paid on 14 June 2018.\nThe shares issued as dividend payment will carry dividend rights from January 1, 2018. An application to list these new shares on Euronext Paris will be made. The new shares will rank pari passu with existing shares and will be fully equivalent with existing listed shares.\nThe maximum total number of new shares which may be issued for the purpose of the dividend payment in shares is 4,386,971 shares (excluding additional shares issued for rounding purposes), representing approximately 3.25% of the share capital and of the voting rights of Carmila based on the total number of shares and voting rights outstanding on 16 May 2018.\nCalendar:\n23 May Dividend ex-date and beginning of the option period for the election of share dividend 6 June End of the option period for the election of share dividend 12 June Disclosure of the options exercised 14 June Payment of cash dividend, settlement-delivery of share dividend and payment of cash balance\nDisclaimer\nThis release constitutes the information document required pursuant to Article 212-4 4° and 212-5 5° of the French Financial Market Authority (AMF) General Regulation and Article 18 of the AMF Instruction AMF n° 2016-04 dated October 21, 2016 as amended.\nThis release does not constitute an offer to purchase securities.
