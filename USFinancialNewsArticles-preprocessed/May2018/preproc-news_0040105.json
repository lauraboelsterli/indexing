    "text": "TYSONS CORNER, Va., May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Old Dominion National Bank successfully completed an oversubscribed private offering of common equity, which was upsized from $30 million to raise an aggregate of $38.7 million in new capital, largely from about 320 accredited individual investors in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and Pennsylvania.\n\"The continued support of our growing base of shareholders in the D.C. metro area and Pennsylvania will enable Old Dominion to continue executing on its growth strategy, as we seek to develop this company into a high-performing regional financial institution,\" said President and Chief Executive Officer Mark S. Merrill. \"We have shown that we can effectively and efficiently deploy capital for the benefit of our company, shareholders and customers. Over the last two years, we have grown loans organically by more than 225% to $117 million, added new, high-performing branches in our D.C. metro and legacy Charlottesville markets, and most importantly invested in talented bankers who are introducing our true community bank to a growing number of customers. We view the success of our recent capital raise as an endorsement to our expanding leadership team and a validation of our growth strategy, and we intend to continue executing on it in a prudent and responsible manner.\"\nThis is the Virginia bank's second successful private placement of common equity since December 2016, when Old Dominion announced it raised $30 million from more than 175 accredited individual investors, largely in the D.C. metro and Pennsylvania. The 2016 capital raise was also upsized, from $20 million, due to investor demand. Through the direct efforts of its directors and executives, without the use of an underwriter or placement fees, the company has raised a combined total of nearly $69 million in two stock offerings over the last 18 months.\nTotal expenses from this latest offering were less than $100 thousand and the $38.6 million in net proceeds from the bank's latest offering will be used to support Old Dominion's lending, investment activities and its growth in existing markets and expansion into new ones.\n\"Old Dominion is differentiating itself as a high-touch, relationship building community bank that provides exceptional service and access to state-of-the art technology to our consumer and business banking customers. With the proceeds of this capital raise, we will be able to focus on expanding our customer base and market share throughout our footprint,\" said bank Chairman Wesley Yuan. \"We have a highly experienced and connected Board of Directors, whose 12 members bring valuable guidance, wide ranging expertise and exceptional business development opportunities. This, combined with our strong executive management and experienced, customer-focused team, leaves Old Dominion very well-positioned to continue its growth in the markets we serve, including the metro Washington D.C. market where our executive offices are located.\"\nOld Dominion's legal advisor on its private offerings was Buckley Sandler LLP.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security nor shall there be any sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Old Dominion National Bank\nOld Dominion is an independent, locally-owned and managed community bank with executive headquarters in Tysons Corner, Va., with approximately $200 million in assets.
