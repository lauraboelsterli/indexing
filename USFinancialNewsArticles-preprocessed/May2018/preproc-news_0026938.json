(NASDAQ:OBLN), a vertically integrated medical technology company with the first and only FDA-approved swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon system for the treatment of obesity, today announced its unaudited financial results as of and for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 highlights:\nHighest number of treating accounts ever, up 40% vs Q4-17 and 300% vs Q1-17 Highest number of patients treated ever, up over 60% vs Q4-17 and 240% vs Q1-17 Highest unique website visits ever, up over 70% vs Q4-17 and over 260% vs Q1-17 Highest Find-A-Doctor searches ever, up 55% vs Q4-17 and over 600% vs Q1-17 Todd Wood joins as new Vice President of Global Sales\nThe Company reported revenue of $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was reported at $12.1 million compared to a net loss of $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and net loss per share for the quarter was $0.71 as compared to net loss per share of $0.47 in the first quarter of 2017.\nCost of revenue was $0.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, in-line with $0.8 million for the prior year period. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.6 million, resulting in a gross margin of 43%, compared to a gross profit of $0.6 million and gross margin of 44% for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $2.6 million, up from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, and Selling, General and Administrative expense increased to $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter 2017.
