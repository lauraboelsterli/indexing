    "text": "LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific Drilling S.A. (OTC: PACDQ) today reported results for the first quarter of 2018. Net loss for the first-quarter 2018 was $96.1 million or $4.50 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $129.7 million or $6.08 per diluted share for the fourth-quarter 2017, and net loss of $99.8 million or $4.69 per diluted share for first-quarter 2017.\nPacific Drilling CEO Paul Reese commented, “During the quarter the Pacific Drilling team again delivered the industry-leading excellence our clients have come to expect. In the midst of a continually challenging market environment, we further reduced average daily expenses for operating rigs to $110 thousand per day while achieving strong safety performance and revenue efficiencies. Pacific Scirocco achieved 7 years without a lost time incident, a remarkable milestone in safety performance and a reflection of Pacific Drilling’s focus on safety and customer service. Pacific Santa Ana provided outstanding service to Petronas in Mauritania under a unique, integrated-services contract structure. Pacific Sharav also continued its stellar performance in some of the world’s most challenging well conditions by delivering 100 percent revenue efficiency for the quarter.\nMr. Reese continued, “We also successfully implemented our innovative, clustered smart-stacking process in Las Palmas, using one rig to feed power to three other vessels. We expect this approach to reduce our stacking costs by more than 50% while allowing us to maintain the condition of our rigs and thereby return to work without any material capital expenditure.\nMr. Reese concluded, “This operational performance is even more notable in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts. We continue to engage in active discussions with our stakeholders for the purpose of agreeing to the terms of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.”\nUpdate on Financial Restructuring under the Protection of Chapter 11\nOn November 12, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). This process aims to optimize Pacific Drilling’s capital structure pending recovery in the floating rig drilling industry.\nWe are currently operating our business as debtors-in-possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. After we filed our Bankruptcy Petitions, we sought and obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court for a variety of “first day” motions, including authority to maintain bank accounts and other customary relief. The relief granted in these motions allows us to continue to operate our business in the normal course.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, we had the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 through March 12, 2018. On March 22, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved our request for an order under which we, our secured creditor groups and our majority shareholder would take part in mediation before the Honorable James R. Peck, retired Bankruptcy Court Judge for the Southern District of New York. The scope of the mediation is to facilitate discussions among us and our stakeholders for the purpose of agreeing to the terms of a binding term sheet or restructuring support agreement describing a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. On May 16, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved our request for an agreed order under which we, our secured creditor groups and our majority shareholder agreed to extend the mediation and the exclusive filing period to June 4, 2018 without prejudice to seek further extensions of the exclusive period. We are currently in the midst of the mediation.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Operational and Financial Commentary\nFirst-quarter 2018 contract drilling revenue was $82.1 million, which included $6.2 million of deferred revenue amortization. This compared to fourth-quarter 2017 contract drilling revenue of $65.0 million, which included $5.1 million of deferred revenue amortization. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from the Pacific Santa Ana operating for the full quarter under a contract with Petronas in Mauritania, as compared to only 12 days in the fourth-quarter 2017 when it started its contract on December 20, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter, our operating fleet of drillships achieved an average rig-related revenue efficiency of 97.6%. Including unpaid downtime related to integrated services on the Pacific Santa Ana, our average revenue efficiency was 95.4% for the first quarter. Revenue efficiency is defined as the actual contractual dayrate revenue (excluding mobilization fees, upgrade reimbursements and other revenue sources) divided by the maximum amount of contractual dayrate revenue that could have been earned during such period.\nOperating expenses were $64.4 million compared to $59.7 million in the fourth-quarter 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of costs from the Pacific Santa Ana working for the full first quarter in 2018.\nFirst-quarter 2018 general and administrative expenses were $17.2 million compared to $22.4 million for the fourth-quarter 2017. Certain legal and advisory expenses related to our debt restructuring efforts are classified as reorganization items subsequent to the Petition Date of November 12, 2017. Net of the legal costs associated with the arbitration proceeding, our corporate overhead (a) for the first-quarter 2018 was $11.6 million. This compares to $11.0 million for fourth-quarter 2017, which is net of legal costs associated with the arbitration proceeding and the restructuring.\nAdjusted EBITDA (b) for the first-quarter 2018 was $1.1 million, compared to ($16.5) million in the fourth-quarter 2017.\nInterest expense for the first-quarter 2018 was $14.9 million, as compared to $27.4 million for the fourth-quarter 2017, primarily due to interest expense that we have not accrued subsequent to the Petition Date for the 2017 Senior Secured Notes, the 2020 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loan B, as we believe this interest is not probable of being treated as an allowable claim in the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nIncome tax expense for the first-quarter 2018 was $0.3 million, compared to $8.8 million for the fourth-quarter 2017, primarily as a result of the non-cash write-off of deferred tax assets in the fourth-quarter 2017.\nFor the first-quarter 2018, cash flow from operations was $(40.6) million. Cash balances, including $8.5 million in restricted cash, totaled $273.0 million as of March 31, 2018, and liabilities subject to compromise totaled approximately $3.1 billion.\nAdditional information about our financial results and the Chapter 11 proceedings can be found (i) in the Form 20-F containing our annual report for the period ended December 31, 2017 as filed with the SEC, (ii) on the Company’s website at www.pacificdrilling.com/investor-relations/sec-filings , and www.pacificdrilling.com/restructuring or (iii) via the Company’s restructuring information line at +1 866-396-3566 (Toll Free) or +1 646-795-6175 (International Number).\nThe Company intends to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC, which will also be available on the Company’s website. The Company will not hold an earnings conference call this quarter.\nFootnotes\n(a) Corporate overhead expenses is a non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure.

Management uses this operational metric to track company results and believes that this measure provides additional information that highlights the impact of our operating efficiency as well as the operating and support costs incurred in achieving the revenue performance.\nAbout Pacific Drilling\nWith its best-in-class drillships and highly experienced team, Pacific Drilling is committed to becoming the industry’s preferred high-specification, floating-rig drilling contractor.
