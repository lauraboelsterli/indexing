These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating results; therefore, they have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We also believe that it is in the best interests of our investors to provide this non-GAAP information.\nWhile we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures.
