GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street jumped on Thursday, and Apple inched closer to a $1 trillion stock market value, as tepid inflation data eased worries of faster U.S. interest rate hikes this year. • Asian markets started on a firm footing and the dollar eased as softer-than-forecast U.S. inflation data tempered expectations for faster Federal Reserve interest rate rises this year. • The dollar hovered below a 4-1/2-month high against a basket of major currencies after tepid inflation data, prompting traders to pare bets of faster U.S. rate hikes. • Longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday, flattening the yield curve as a smaller-than-expected increase in the consumer price index in April reduced fears that domestic inflation is picking up steam as the labor market tightens. • Oil prices dipped away from multi-year highs reached the previous session on hopes that alternative supplies could replace a looming drop in Iranian exports when U.S. sanctions against Tehran are re-imposed. • Gold prices were steady, as the dollar held below its 2018 highs against a basket of currencies after softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data.
