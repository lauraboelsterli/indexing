    "text": "President Trump: 'I would love to' talk to special counsel Robert Mueller, but the Russia probe is an unfair 'witch hunt' Published 4 Hours Ago The Associated Press Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks to the press before making his way to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on May 4, 2018 in Washington, DC.\nPresident Donald Trump says he would \"love to\" speak to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia probe but tells reporters he wants to ensure he'd be \"treated fairly.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on the South Lawn on Friday, Trump again expressed interest in consenting to an interview.\nThe president says, \"I would love to go. Nothing I want to do more.\" But he says he needs to \"find that we're going to be treated fairly because everybody sees it now and it's a pure witch hunt.\"\nTrump's comments come as he is now being advised by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani .\nGiuliani has warned Trump against sitting down for an interview with Mueller and has suggested the president needs to place limits on his level of co-operation.
