    "text": "Reiterates Strong Outlook\nSINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KLIC) (“Kulicke & Soffa”, “K&S” or the “Company”), following the filing of its quarterly report on Form 10Q for the second fiscal quarter, and the amendment of its Form 10Q for the first fiscal quarter and Form 10K for fiscal 2017, today announced final results of its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company reaffirmed its previously reported second quarter net revenue of $221.8 million, and reported diluted EPS of $0.51 and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54. The Company also reaffirmed its third quarter revenue guidance of approximately $255 million to $270 million.\nDuring its second fiscal quarter, K&S repurchased $21.5 million of common stock in open market transactions at an average price of $23.90 per share.\nQuarterly Results - U.S. GAAP Fiscal Q2 2018\nChange vs.\nFiscal Q2 2017\n(As Restated) Change vs.\nFiscal Q1 2018\n(As Restated) Net Revenue $221.8 million up 11.1% up 3.8% Gross Profit $99.4 million up 7.7% up 2.3% Gross Margin 44.8% down 140 bps down 70 bps Income from Operations $38.4 million up 5.2% down 2.0% Operating Margin 17.3% down 100 bps down 100 bps Net Income $36.3 million up 11.0% up 152.2% Net Margin 16.4% - up 4890 bps EPS – Diluted (a) $0.51 up 13.3% up 151.5% (a) GAAP diluted net earnings per share reflects any dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and stock options, but that effect is excluded when calculating GAAP diluted net (loss) per share because it would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended December 30, 2017, 1.2 million shares of restricted stock units and stock options were excluded due to the Company's net loss.\nQuarterly Results - Non-GAAP\nFiscal Q2 2018\nChange vs.\nFiscal Q2 2017\n(As Restated) Change vs.\nFiscal Q1 2018\n(As Restated) Income from Operations $40.5 million up 6.3% down 4.5% Operating Margin 18.2% down 90 bps down 160 bps Net Income $38.2 million up 11.4% down 3.0% Net Margin 17.2% - down 120 bps EPS - Diluted $0.54 up 14.9% down 1.8% * A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in the financial tables included in this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results” section.\nDr. Fusen Chen, Kulicke & Soffa's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Looking ahead, the entire organization continues to be extremely committed to pursuing several near and long-term goals in parallel. Our ongoing progress within LED, memory, recurring revenue and advanced packaging strategies has improved our financial performance and growth prospects.\"\nThe Company does not anticipate that the delays associated with filing its second quarter 2018 results have had a material adverse impact on the Company's operations or business prospects.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet revenue of $221.8 million. Gross margin of 44.8%. Net income of $36.3 million or $0.51 per share; Non-GAAP net income of $38.2 million or $0.54 per share. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $628.2 million as of March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently expects net revenue in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 ending June 30, 2018 to be approximately $255 million to $270 million. For the first three quarters of 2018, this guidance represents an increase of 17.6% over the same period in the prior year.\nLooking forward, Dr. Fusen Chen commented, \"Our core products' alignment with several major industry trends, our share gains within LED and recurring revenue as well as our ongoing development progress to further expand the advanced packaging portfolio provide additional confidence in our ability to generate strong results going forward.\"\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company's non-GAAP results exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, goodwill impairment, costs associated with restructuring, income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as well as tax benefits or expense associated with the foregoing non-GAAP items. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying operational performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s period-to-period financial results and the Company’s overall performance to that of its competitors.\nManagement uses both U.S. GAAP metrics as well as non-GAAP operating income, operating margin, net income, net margin and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP items is meant to supplement, but not substitute for, GAAP financial measures or information. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results in combination with GAAP results provides better transparency to the investment community when analyzing business trends, providing meaningful comparisons with prior period performance and enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibit.\nAbout Kulicke & Soffa\nKulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) is a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and electronic assembly solutions supporting the global automotive, consumer, communications, computing and industrial segments.
