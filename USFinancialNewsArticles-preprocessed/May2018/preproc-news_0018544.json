    "text": "EditorsNote: fixes style on “Great American Ball Park” in first and third grafs; updates Reds’ record in second graf\nAdrian Gonzalez hit two homers Monday night for the visiting New York Mets, who raced out to a big early lead and hung on for a 7-6 win over the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park.\nThe Mets snapped a six-game losing streak. The Reds have lost six of seven and have the worst record in baseball at 8-27.\nGonzalez (3-for-4) homered in the third inning to give the Mets a 5-0 lead and went deep again in the fifth to produce New York’s final and, eventually, decisive run. He has hit 14 homers in 33 games at Great American Ball Park, his third-most homers at any stadium where he has only performed as a visiting player.\nThe Mets finished with four homers, including a leadoff blast in the first inning by Michael Conforto. Jay Bruce, who spent the first eight-plus seasons of his career with the Reds, hit a two-run homer in the third inning.\nAmed Rosario (second inning) and Yoenis Cespedes (fourth inning) lofted sacrifice flies. Bruce, Rosario, Cespedes and Conforto had two hits apiece.\nThe Reds chipped away against starter P.J. Conlon and relievers Paul Sewald and Robert Gsellman but could not catch the Mets. Billy Hamilton homered in the third, and Tucker Barnhart and Scooter Gennett had RBI doubles as Cincinnati chased Conlon in the fourth.\nEugenio Suarez homered and Scott Schebler hit a sacrifice fly off Sewald in the sixth. Gennett homered off Gsellman (4-0) in the eighth, but that was the only hit allowed over 2 2/3 innings by the right-hander, who was credited with the win.\nJeurys Familia notched his 10th save with a perfect ninth.\nConlon, who was making his major league debut in place of the injured Jacob deGrom, allowed three runs on four hits and two walks while striking out one over 3 2/3 innings.\nSuarez, Gennett and Barnhart had two hits each for the Reds.\nHomer Bailey (0-5) took the loss after allowing six runs on eight hits and one walk while striking out three over four innings.\n—Field Level Media\nOur ",
