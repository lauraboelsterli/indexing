    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, said on Monday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was taking the right approach on Iran.\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, Britain July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall “Uniting (our) efforts is the correct path for Iran to realize the futility of its incursions and expansionism,” Gargash wrote on his official Twitter account, several hours after a policy speech on Iran by Pompeo.\nPompeo demanded Iran make broad changes to its foreign policy in the wartorn Middle East or face economic sanctions, as the Trump administration hardened its stance after pulling out of an international deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear programme.\nA close U.S. ally in the energy-rich Gulf, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, accuses Iran of backing armed groups across the region in a bid for domination.\n“The Pompeo strategy requires wisdom and a change of the Iranian compass,” Gargash added.\nReporting by Noah Browning and Sarah Dadouch; editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
