    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 9:03 AM / Updated an hour ago Renault-Nissan merger unlikely before 2020, CEO Ghosn says Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Renault ( RENA.PA ) and Nissan ( 7201.T ) are reviewing the ownership structure of their carmaking alliance but are unlikely to merge into a single listed entity this year or next, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn delivers a speech during the official presentation of the new Renault RS16 car at the company's research center, the Technocentre, in Guyancourt, near Paris, France, February 3, 2016. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nSpeaking at a Bloomberg conference, Ghosn reiterated that the carmakers were examining ways to consolidate the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and assuage doubts about its survival after his eventual departure. Renault currently owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, which controls Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ).\nAsked whether this could transform the carmakers into a single listed entity in 2018 or 2019, however, Ghosn answered: “I don’t think so.” Reuters reported in March that Renault and Nissan were discussing a deeper tie-up.
