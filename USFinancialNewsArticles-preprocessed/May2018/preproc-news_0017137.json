    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank’s investment banking arm has been hired by the Saudi city of Jeddah as a financial adviser on a bridge project, the first stage of a larger multi-billion-dollar public transport network in the city.\nGIB Capital will advise on the Obhur Creek Bridge project, which will span around 360 meters in length and carry eight lanes of traffic and a metro line, and be located next to the King Abdulaziz International Airport.\nThe mandate was disclosed by sources and later confirmed on the local government’s Twitter feed.\nThe larger project encompasses a metro, light rail, tram, rail, local bus and marine transportation.\nThe government is on a drive to engage the private sector in sectors of the economy including transport, healthcare and industry to ease pressure on state finances.\nProposals for the bridge project were originally unveiled in 2014 when the plan was for it to be government funded.\nEditing by Louise Heavens\n ",
