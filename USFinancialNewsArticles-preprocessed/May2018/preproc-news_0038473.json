    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., OmniComm Systems, Inc. (OTCQX:OMCM), a global leading provider of clinical data management technology, today announced record financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are off to a considerably better start this year in comparison to last year,” said Stephen Johnson, chief executive officer and president of OmniComm. “With more than 120 clients and the introduction of three new product lines — IRTMaster, Acuity and AutoEncoder — we are well-positioned for strong financial growth in the near future. These new product lines, coupled with a shift in our business toward a subscription model, will enhance the predictability and sustainability of future revenue.”\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, OmniComm reported revenue of $7.2 million, a 25% increase over the prior year’s first quarter revenue of $5.7 million. Gross margin improved by 35% to $6.0 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% or $0.6 million to $5.1 million, which resulted in operating income of $0.9 million. EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure OmniComm uses as an additional financial measure, was $1.0 million compared to $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOmniComm provides EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as additional information to its financial results. Non-GAAP EBITDA excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses that are included in operating income. Non-GAAP EBITDA is not an alternative or substitute for the financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) of operating income. The non-GAAP EBITDA financial measure presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define this non-GAAP financial measure in the same way. OmniComm’s management uses non-GAAP EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency and as a goal for incentive compensation. Management believes non-GAAP EBITDA is a useful measure investors may use as an additional factor in their analysis of OmniComm’s performance. Please review the below reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure operating income, as well as OmniComm’s financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOMNICOMM SYSTEMS, INC.

We wish to caution the reader that these regarding matters that are not historical facts are only predictions and are based on information available at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events. No assurance can be given that plans for the future will be consummated or that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved. While sometimes presented with numerical specificity, these plans and projections and other are based upon a variety of assumptions, which we consider reasonable, but which nevertheless may not be realized. Because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying our projections and , many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond our reasonable control, some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this press release. Therefore, our actual experience and results achieved during the period covered by any particular projections or may differ substantially from those projected. Consequently, the inclusion of projections and other should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that these plans will be consummated or that estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially. There can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the contained herein will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made. OmniComm does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement made by it or on its behalf, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOMNICOMM SYSTEMS, INC.
