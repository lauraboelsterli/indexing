    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 7:33 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Daily Briefing: Trump steel tariffs - a final reprieve Mark John , Mike Dolan 7 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Hours before the deadline for a decision, U.S. President Donald Trump overnight extended exemptions from new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from a number of allies, including in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump gestures while addressing a joint news conference with Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari in the Rose Garden of the White House, April 30, 2018\nHowever he gave to understand that this latest delay would be the final one, meaning the levies will kick in from June unless there is a deal in the meantime.\nIn a first reaction, the European Commission has complained that Trump is creating uncertaint y that is hitting business decisions; it continues to demand permanent exemptions on the grounds that overcapacity in steel and aluminium is not from Europe.\nGiven the likelihood of reprieves for Australia, Argentina and Brazil and movement in the NAFTA talks , the EU could be the only one of the U.S. allies that seriously risks losing its exemption.\nWill today herald a new start for Armenia after street protesters cut short an attempt by the former leader to cling onto power beyond his time? Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, who played a starring role in the protests, is the sole candidate for interim prime minister in parliamentary elections today.\nPashinyan has received the support of all opposition parties in parliament, who hold 47 seats in the 105-seat legislature, but he will require a majority to win. He promises his main task as caretaker premier would be to organise new free and fair parliamentary elections for the post of prime minister.\nWith much of Europe closed for the May Day public holiday, the main economic numbers in the region today come from the UK. Britain's factories have so far had a weak start to 2018. A poor reading in the April purchasing managers index at 0830 GMT would further reduce the change of a Bank of England rate hike move on May 10, now put at barely 25 percent.\nSeparately, the BoE figures on mortgage approvals, consumer credit growth and business lending are expected to show a slowdown in lending in March, mirroring the weak start to the year for the economy overall.\nMARKETS\nMay Day holidays in many centres across Asia and Europe are set to keep global markets trading under wraps for most of the day, with an upbeat mood at the margins despite Wall St’s retreat on Monday as U.S. President Trump extended the steel and aluminium tariffs exemption for the European Union, Canada and Mexico for another month. Supporters of Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally as they wait for the results of the parliament's election of an interim prime minister in central Yerevan, Armenia May 1, 2018 “ Apple is like an A student with a bad report card. We’re not going to throw them out of the house just yet, but we want to see that number pick back up” Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners\nApple’s quarterly result s after the bell tonight are the other big focus after several weeks of speculation about ebbing smartphone demand based on selective reports from companies in its supply chain.\nTechnology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for Q1 and the overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent. Much of that seems largely priced, however, and the tax cut driven profit surge is struggling to give overall indices much of an additional lift.\nThe S&P500 closed 0.8 percent lower on Monday, led by big healthcare and pharma companies, with one eye on Apple and another on Wednesday’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Although no change in Fed policy rates is expected this week, eyes will be trained on its statement for acknowledgement of an acceleration in the central bank’s favoured inflation gauge close to target in March and for nods about whether as many as three more rate hikes are due over the rest of 2018. U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar were firmer, as were Brent crude prices on anxiety about the fate of the Iran nuclear deal.\nJitters about today’s steel tariff deadlines also weighed on Wall St overnight and news of the exemption extensions has already lifted S&P500 futures 0.2 percent. For the same reason, the Canadian dollar was one of the big overnight gainers on currency markets. With the Fed meeting in sight and euro zone April inflation numbers coming in soft, euro/dollar is slipping again and set to test Friday’s low of $1.2053.\nMost major Asia bourses were closed, but Tokyo’s Nikkei closed 0.2 percent higher and Australia’s benchmark index hit its highest in six weeks as Trump was reported to have reached an agreement in principle on steel and aluminium imports with Australia, Brazil and Argentina alongside the other deadline extensions and the Reserve Bank of Australia left its key interest rates on hold at its latest policy meeting.\nLondon is the only major European trading centre opened this morning and futures indicate a slightly positive open for the FTSE100, helped by a BP profits surge . Sterling continued to trade heavy as markets have revised back expectations of a UK interest rate rise this month since the poor first quarter GDP numbers on Friday.\nHalf an eye was kept on Brexit debates in parliament. Britain’s upper house on Monday voted to give parliament powers to block or delay a final deal on departure from the EU, defeating UK PM May’s government .\n— A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
