    "text": "SAN DIEGO & CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shareholder rights law firm Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that purchasers of InnerWorkings, Inc. (NasdaqGS: INWK) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between August 11, 2015 and May 7, 2018. InnerWorkings provides marketing execution solutions in North America and internationally.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog:\nwww.robbinsarroyo.com/innerworkings-inc-may-2018\nInnerWorkings Accused of Submitting Inaccurate Financial Statements\nAccording to the complaint, InnerWorkings submitted a series of public filings attesting to the accuracy of financial reporting and the disclosure of all fraud. It therefore came as a surprise to investors when InnerWorkings disclosed on May 7, 2018, that its financial statements contained accounting errors. InnerWorkings admitted that the errors were related to recording a portion of costs of goods sold in the wrong period, and that the company would consequently be restating its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and all interim periods within those years. On this news, InnerWorkings' stock fell 6.4% to close at $9.06 per share on May 8, 2018.\nInnerWorkings Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
