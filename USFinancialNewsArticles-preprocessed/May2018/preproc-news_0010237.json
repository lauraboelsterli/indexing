    "text": "(Adds details on business segments, shares, analyst comments)\nMay 2 (Reuters) - Lumentum Holdings Inc's quarterly profit and revenue beat analysts' estimates on Wednesday as the company sold more of the 3D sensing lasers that industry experts say power the Face ID technology on Apple's latest iPhones.\nLumentum's shares rose 9 percent to $57.45 before the bell.\nRevenue from Lumentum's optical communications business, which accounts for more than 80 percent to the California-based firm's total revenue, rose 14 percent to $246.3 million, beating analysts' estimate of $218.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nIn March, Lumentum bought optical components producer Oclaro Inc for about $1.7 billion to broaden its portfolio of laser offerings and gain an edge in the fast-developing market for the 3D sensing technology.\nRevenue from its lasers business rose 32.2 percent to $52.5 million, narrowly missing analysts' estimate of $52.7 million.\nLumentum reported net income of $2.7 million, or 4 cents per share, for the third quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $56 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 78 cents per share. Total revenue rose 16.8 percent to $298.2 million.\nAnalysts on average had expected the company to earn 71 cents per share on revenue of $292.2 million.
