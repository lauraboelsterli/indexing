    "text": "HOUSTON, May 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vantage Drilling International (\"Vantage\" or the “Company”) reported a net loss of approximately $32.1 million or $6.43 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a net loss of $36.5 million or $7.30 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Vantage had approximately $197.7 million of cash, including $5 million of restricted cash, compared to $195.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nIhab Toma, CEO, commented, “I am pleased to report our improved overall company performance, with revenues up 37% from the comparable quarter in the prior year. This increase is a direct result of our industry leading utilization with six of our seven high specification assets being contracted during the quarter. In addition, with the earlier announced follow on contract for the Topaz Driller in Gabon, we have added an additional $16.7 million in backlog.”\nVantage, a Cayman Islands exempted company, is an offshore drilling contractor, with a fleet of three ultra-deepwater drillships and four premium jackup drilling rigs. Vantage's primary business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells globally for major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies. Vantage also provides construction supervision services and preservation management services for, and will operate and manage, drilling units owned by others.\nThe information above includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified above or as disclosed from time to time in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
