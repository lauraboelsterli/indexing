    "text": "(Reuters) - Casino operator Wynn Resorts Ltd ( WYNN.O ) said on Monday that John Hagenbuch will not stand for re-election to the company’s board at the annual meeting on May 16.\nCompany logos are displayed at Wynn Macau resort in Macau, China February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip Co-founder and largest shareholder Elaine Wynn who has been in a proxy fight with the board, has been asking shareholders to vote against Hagenbuch’s re-election, whom she called a close friend of the company founder and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn.\nSteve, Elaine’s ex-husband, resigned earlier this year on allegations of sexual misconduct and disposed his entire 11.8 percent stake in the firm for $2.1 billion.\nIn a letter, Elaine said “Mr. Hagenbuch represents all that is wrong with the long-serving legacy directors,” suggesting a revamp of the board, given the proximity of board members to Steve.\nIn April new Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox detailed steps the company had taken to distance itself from its founder and adjust its corporate culture, including adding three women to its board.\nThe company also said on Monday Robert Miller has resigned from the board.\nThe company’s shares were down 2 percent at $191.70 in after-market trading.\nReporting by Taenaz Shakir in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
