(\"Concordia\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CXRX) (TSX: CXR), an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on becoming a leader in European specialty, off-patent medicines, today announced its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2018. All financial references are in U.S. dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted.\n\"Concordia's first quarter results were consistent with management's expectations,\" said Graeme Duncan, interim Chief Executive Officer of Concordia. \"The Company has also recently made significant progress towards the realignment of its capital structure. Looking forward, we are optimistic Concordia can complete its proposed recapitalization transaction by July 31, 2018 and emerge as a stronger business.\"\nConsolidated First Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results\nReported first quarter revenue of $152.3 million, compared to $160.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, and $150.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss for the first quarter of $55.7 million.\nReported first quarter adjusted EBITDA 1 of $72.0 million, compared to $84.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, and $70.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn a constant currency basis, first quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 2.2% and 2.0% lower than their respective amounts in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGenerated cash flows from operating activities of $50.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $86.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's liquidity consisted of $343.8 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nOn May 2, 2018, Concordia announced the execution of a support agreement with debtholders holding in aggregate more than 72 per cent of its affected secured debt and more than 64 per cent of its affected unsecured debt in connection with a proposed recapitalization transaction that would raise $586.5 million and reduce the Company's outstanding debt by approximately $2.4 billion and reduce its annual interest costs by approximately $172 million.\nIn connection with the proposed recapitalization transaction, on May 2, 2018, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (\"the Court\") issued an interim order authorizing the holding of meetings of affected debtholders and shareholders to vote on Concordia's CBCA plan of arrangement pursuant to which the proposed recapitalization transaction is to be implemented.\nCompletion of the proposed recapitalization transaction will be subject to, among other things, approval of the CBCA plan of arrangement by the requisite majorities of the secured debtholders and the unsecured debtholders at the meetings to be held on June 19, 2018, such other approvals as may be required by the Court or the TSX, other applicable regulatory approvals, approval of the CBCA plan of arrangement by the Court and the satisfaction or waiver of applicable conditions precedent.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Results\nConcordia International segment's revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $113.0 million compared to $113.7 million in the fourth quarter of the 2017.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $5.8 million or 5%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017.\nThis decrease is attributable to volume and price declines on key products, including Liothyronine Sodium, Trazodone, and Prednisolone. These revenue decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from Nitrofurantoin. The sterling strengthening against the U.S. dollar resulted in $14.7 million of additional translated revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017.\nConcordia North America segment's first quarter 2018 revenue of $39.3 million was moderately higher than fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $36.5 million.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $2.5 million or 6%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to competitive pressures on products, including Donnatal® and Kapvay®. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from Plaquenil® authorized generic.\nPipeline Update\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Concordia launched one new product into markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $20 million.\nConcordia also has 28 products that have already been approved or are awaiting approval by the regulators. These products, if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $250 million.\nIn addition, the Company currently has 17 products under development that are anticipated to launch in the next three to five years. These products, if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $1.4 billion.\nThe Company believes that these products include several first-to-market or early-to-market opportunities for difficult-to-make products.\nAdditionally, Concordia has 14 products identified for potential development that if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $350 million.\nTherefore, in total, Concordia's current pipeline is now comprised of approximately 60 products that could compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $2 billion.\nWith its recently announced leadership transition, the Company will continue to evaluate the composition of its pipeline of medicines.\nLeadership Transition\nConcordia announced on May 2, 2018, that Graeme Duncan has been appointed interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Duncan succeeded Concordia's previous CEO, Allan Oberman, who left the Company to pursue other opportunities.\nThe Company also announced on May 2, 2018, that its Chief Corporate Development Officer, Sarwar Islam, left the Company to pursue other opportunities. Guy Clark, previously Chief Strategy Officer at AMCo Pharmaceuticals from 2013 to 2015, joined Concordia, effective May 3, 2018, as the Company's Chief Corporate Development Officer.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThree months ended\n(in $000's, except per share data)\nMar 31, 2018\nMar 31, 2017\nRevenue\n152,264\n160,557\nGross profit\n101,106\n115,415\nGross profit %\n66%\n72%\nTotal operating expenses\n112,345\n97,049\nOperating income (loss)\n(11,239)\n18,366\nIncome tax expense (recovery)\n4,704\n4,489\nNet loss\n(55,694)\n(78,824)\nLoss per share\nBasic\n(1.09)\n(1.54)\nDiluted\n(1.09)\n(1.54)\nEBITDA (1)\n94,503\n56,932\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n72,024\n84,242\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $8.3 million, or 5%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease was due to lower sales from both segments, partially offset by higher foreign exchange rates impacting translated revenues from the Concordia International segment for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Revenues were lower primarily due to lower volumes resulting from competition on a number of the Company's products in both segments.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $14.3 million or 12%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017 primarily due to the revenue decreases described above. The decrease in gross profit percentage of 6% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the corresponding period in 2017, is primarily due to a change in the mix of product sales within both segments.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $15.3 million, or 16%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Operating expenses were higher for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.3 million higher restructuring costs arising from the Company's initiative to realign its capital structure and $8.9 million higher amortization charges on intangible assets, partially offset by $1.7 million lower share-based compensation expense and $1.6 million lower general and administrative costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses reflect costs related to salaries and benefits, professional and consulting fees, public company costs, travel, facility leases and other administrative expenditures. General and administrative expenses of $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 11%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease is a result of the Company's objective to reduce operating costs across the business.\nSelling and marketing expenses reflect costs incurred by the Company for the marketing, promotion and sale of the Company's broad portfolio of products across the Company's segments. Selling and marketing costs of $9.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $0.05 million compared to the corresponding period in 2017 primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements impacting translation.\nResearch and development expenses reflect costs for clinical trial activities, product development, professional and consulting fees and services associated with the activities of the medical, clinical and scientific affairs, quality assurance costs, regulatory compliance and drug safety costs (pharmacovigilance) of the Company. Research and development costs for the first quarter of 2018 of $7.1 million decreased by $0.9 million, or 11%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to a refund for regulatory fees.\nThe current income tax expense recorded for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $1.3 million compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Income taxes were lower primarily due to lower taxable income compared to the corresponding period in 2017, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation of the income tax expense from the Concordia International segment.\nThe net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $55.7 million. Significant components comprising the net loss for the first quarter of 2018 are interest and accretion expenses of $80.1 million and amortization of intangible assets of $65.6 million offset by gross profit of $101.1 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $72.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $12.2 million, or 15%, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decline is primarily due to lower sales and gross margins from both segments, partially offset by higher foreign exchange rates impacting translated results during the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $344 million and 51,283,574 common shares issued and outstanding.\nThis press release is not an offer of securities for sale in the United States. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nConference Call Notification\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET hosted by senior management.

These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. When used, these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure. These measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit to provide investors with supplemental information of the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets, to assess its ability to meet future debt service requirements, in making capital expenditures, and to consider the business's working capital requirements. Readers are cautioned that the non-IFRS measures contained herein may not be appropriate for any other purpose.\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nAs used herein, adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit adjusted for non-cash fair value increases to the cost of acquired inventory from a business combination. Under IFRS, acquired inventory is required to be written-up to fair value at the date of acquisition. As this inventory is sold the fair value adjustment represents a non-cash cost of sale amount that has been excluded in adjusted gross profit in order to normalize gross profit for this non-cash component.\nThree months ended\n(in $000's)\nMar 31, 2018\nMar 31, 2017\nGross profit per financial statements\n101,106\n115,415\nAdd back: Fair value adjustment to acquired inventory\n—\n311\nAdjusted Gross profit\n101,106\n115,726\nEBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net loss from continuing operations adjusted for net interest and accretion expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Management uses EBITDA to assess the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain charges including costs associated with acquisitions, restructuring initiatives, and other costs (which includes onerous contract costs and direct costs associated with contractual terminations), management retention costs, non-operating gains / losses, integration costs, legal settlements (net of insurance recoveries) and related legal costs, non-cash items such as unrealized gains / losses on derivative instruments, share based compensation, fair value changes including purchase consideration and derivative financial instruments, asset impairments, fair value increases to inventory arising from purchased inventory from a business combination, gains / losses from the sale of assets and unrealized gains / losses related to foreign exchange. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other non-IFRS financial measures, as the key metric in assessing business performance when comparing actual results to budgets and forecasts. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance and cash flow, and provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in the underlying business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures.\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations to EBITDA and to adjusted EBITDA for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.\nThree months ended\n(in $000's)\nMar 31, 2018\nMar 31, 2017\nNet loss\n(55,694)\n(78,824)\nInterest and accretion expense\n80,122\n92,541\nInterest income\n(706)\n(18,479)\nIncome taxes\n4,704\n4,489\nDepreciation\n470\n488\nAmortization of intangible assets\n65,607\n56,717\nEBITDA\n94,503\n56,932\nFair value adjustment to acquired inventory\n—\n311\nAcquisition related, restructuring and other\n15,494\n5,216\nShare-based compensation\n1,267\n2,952\nFair value (gain) loss on purchase consideration and derivatives\n425\n27,506\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n1,341\n990\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss\n(41,006)\n(9,665)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n72,024\n84,242\nNotice Regarding Trademarks\nThis press release includes trademarks that are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of Concordia or its affiliates or its licensors.
