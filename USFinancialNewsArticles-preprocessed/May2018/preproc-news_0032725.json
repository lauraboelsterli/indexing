    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Monday that it has taken a dispute to the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States for imposing tariffs on washing machines and solar panels as the measure was deemed to be in violation of the WTO agreement.\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a statement that it has delivered its request for bilateral consultation to the U.S. side to start a dispute settlement process.\nThe move is a set of measures that the South Korean government had taken after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped a steep tariff on imported washing machines and solar panels in February to protect American manufacturers.\nIn April, South Korea said it notified its plan to suspend tariff concessions on imported U.S. goods worth $480 million following U.S. tariff measures against South Korean imports.\nThe ministry said it will respond to unfair import restrictions taken by the country’s major trading partners against South Korean companies.\nReporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
