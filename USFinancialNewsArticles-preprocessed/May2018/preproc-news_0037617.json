    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, May 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lonestar Resources US Inc. (NASDAQ: LONE) (including its subsidiaries, \"Lonestar,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nLonestar reported a 48% increase in net oil and gas production to 7,777 Boe/d during the three months ended March 31, 2018 (\"1Q18\"), compared to 5,266 Boe/d for the three months ended March 31, 2017 (\"1Q17\"). Production volumes exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance, and were 86% crude oil and NGLs on an equivalent basis. The increase in production was attributable to the drilling of new Eagle Ford Shale wells and production associated with our acquisition of producing properties in June 2017. Lonestar's 2018 drilling program continues to deliver outstanding results. At Hawkeye, our two wells, which delivered Max-30 IP's of 938 Boe/d, have now outperformed third party forecasts by 16% through 90 days. At Horned Frog, our two wells delivered average Max-30 IP's of 2,155 Boe/d, a record for the Company. In Karnes County, our first three wells there have recently been placed on production and are averaging over 1,250 Boe/d per well (95% liquids) in their first week of production, surpassing third party forecasts. Benefitting from better-than-expected production results, Lonestar issued production guidance of 10,000 to 10,500 Boe/d for the second quarter of 2018. The midpoint of guidance represents a 32% increase over 1Q18 results and is 82% higher than production reported for the three months ended June 30, 2017 (\"2Q17\"). Lonestar also issued guidance for Adjusted EBITDAX for 2Q18 of $27 to $29 million. Based on the strength of its drilling results to date, Lonestar is raising its full-year 2018 production guidance to a range of 10,300 to 11,000 Boe/d. Commensurately, Lonestar is increasing its EBITDAX guidance to $110 to $125 million, based on a $60 WTI oil price average oil price for 2018. The Company has contractually locked in most of its service costs for 2018, but based on results-to-date, is extending some of its laterals and/or increasing proppant concentrations on several of its remaining wells in its 2018 drilling program, which will increase budgeted 2018 capital spending by $5 million, to a range of $100 to $105 million. The source of higher EBITDAX guidance is a result of outstanding performance of our 2018 drilling program, more lateral length, higher WTI crude oil prices, and sustained positive basis realizations of our Eagle Ford Shale crude oil. Lonestar reported a net loss attributable to its common stockholders of $18.5 million, or ($0.75) per weighted average share, during 1Q18 compared to net income of $3.1 million, or $0.14 per weighted average share during the 1Q17. Excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, certain items that the Company does not view as either recurring or indicative of its ongoing financial performance, our adjusted net loss for 1Q18 was ($3.1) million, or ($0.13) per common share. Most notable among these items include: unrealized hedging losses on financial derivatives; loss on the extinguishment of debt; office lease write-off; and stock-based compensation. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information. Lonestar reported a 103% increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $23.4 million compared to $11.5 million for the prior year period. This improvement was driven by a 48% increase in production and a 24% increase in the Company's oil-equivalent price realization after the effect of hedging. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for the definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDAX, and the reasons for its use.\nLonestar's Chief Executive Officer, Frank D. Bracken, III, stated, \"In the first quarter, production increased by 48% and realized prices after hedging rose 24%, resulting in a 103% increase in EBITDAX. While we are pleased with the progress that our first quarter represents, our second quarter results will more fully reflect the outstanding drilling results we have generated thus far in 2018. The midpoint of our 2Q18 guidance reflects significant increases in production and EBITDAX over our 1Q18 results. Importantly, these results are expected to significantly strengthen our financial position. Since 2Q17, we have reduced Debt / EBITDAX (Last Quarter Annualized) from 5.4x to 3.4x, and expect that this ratio will improve to 3.0x or better in 2Q18. Our stronger financial position has allowed us to secure dedicated drilling and pressure pumping services, which is greatly enhancing our ability to control the quality, timing and costs of our capital program. Given the excellent start, we have increased our 2018 full-year production guidance to 10,300 to 11,000 Boe/d, which represents 65% growth versus 2017. We have also raised our full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDAX guidance to $110 to $125 million, representing a similar growth rate. While encouraged by our drilling results to date, we are highly focused on delivering exceptional results for our shareholders as we move through 2018 and beyond.\"\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE\nLonestar reported net oil and gas production of 7,777 Boe/d during the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 48% compared to 5,266 Boe/d during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Production volumes during 1Q18 consisted of 5,740 barrels of oil per day (74%), 965 barrels of NGLs per day (12%), and 6,435 Mcf of natural gas per day (14%). The Company's production mix for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 86% liquid hydrocarbons. Lonestar delivered excellent wellhead realizations in 1Q18. Lonestar's realized wellhead crude oil price was $64.18 per barrel, which reflects a positive differential of $1.31/bbl vs. West Texas Intermediate. Lonestar's realized NGL price was $19.97 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018. Lonestar's natural realized wellhead natural gas price was $3.12 per Mcf, which reflects a positive differential of $0.04 to the Henry Hub. Lonestar has delivered consistent non-tax cash operating costs in the first quarter of 2018, and exhibited significant sequential improvement in lease operating expenses in the quarter ended March 31, 2018: Lease Operating Expenses (\"LOE\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4.1 million, which was 56% higher than Lease Operating Expenses of $2.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, but commensurate with a 48% increase in production. On a unit-of-production basis, lease operating expenses were fairly flat, rising 5% to $5.92 per Boe for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This comparison is somewhat misleading in that in June 2017, Lonestar acquired the Marquis and Battlecat assets, which were more mature and bear structurally higher operating expenses. However, on a sequential basis, Lonestar reduced lease operating expenses by 19% vs. 4Q17 on an absolute basis, and by 23% vs. 4Q17 to $5.92 per Boe. For 2018, the Company expects LOE to be between $5.60 and $6.50 per Boe, as relatively fixed costs are spread over substantially larger production volumes. Gathering, Processing & Transportation Expenses (\"G,P&T\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $0.5 million, which was 50% higher than the G,P&T of $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, but commensurate with a 48% increase in production. On a unit-of-production basis, G,P&T was fairly flat, rising 2% to $0.63 per Boe for the three months ended March 31, 2018. For 2018, the Company expects G,P&T to be between $0.75 and $0.85 per Boe. General & Administrative Expenses, excluding stock-based compensation of $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 (\"G&A\"), increased from $2.5 million to $3.0 million, respectively. On a unit-of-production basis, G&A per Boe was reduced 19% year over year, from $5.26 per Boe in 2017 to $4.24 per Boe in 2018. For 2018, the Company expects G&A to be between $2.80 and $3.00 per Boe. Interest Expense excluding amortization of debt issuance cost, premiums, and discounts increased year over year from $4.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $8.2 million in 2018. This was primarily due to a combination of higher stated interest rates and principal on the new 11.25% Senior Notes versus the 8.75% Senior Notes that were retired in January 2018. On a unit-of-production basis, interest per Boe was rose 25% year over year from $9.38 per Boe in 2017 to $11.72 per Boe in 2018. For 2018, the Company expects interest expense to be between $8.15 and $8.75 per Boe. Lonestar has commenced a more active drilling and completion program in 2018, and all four wells with established production rates are producing at rates that exceed our forecasts. In the first quarter of 2018, Lonestar placed online 4.0 gross / 3.8 net wells. In May, Lonestar placed its first three (3.0 / 2.4 net wells) Karnes County wells onstream and anticipates production from an additional 2.0 gross / 2.0 net wells in the Horned Frog area in June 2018.\nEAGLE FORD SHALE TREND- WESTERN REGION\nAsherton â€“ In Dimmit County, no new wells were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Asherton leasehold is held by production, and Lonestar does not currently plan any drilling activity here in 2018.\nBeall Ranch â€“ In Dimmit County, no new wells were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Beall Ranch leasehold is held by production, and Lonestar does not currently plan any drilling activity here in 2018.\nBurns Ranch Area â€“ In La Salle County, Lonestar was hit by offset fracs that negatively impacted production during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and the beginning of the three months ended March 31, 2018. Oil and gas rates have since rebounded above the production trend lines. The Company did not drill or complete any new wells during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Burns Ranch leasehold is held by production, and Lonestar does not currently plan any drilling activity here in 2018.\nHorned Frog â€“ In La Salle County, the Company completed the Horned Frog G #1H and H #1H, and commenced flowback operations on March 19, 2018. These wells were drilled to total measured depths of approximately 22,800 and 20,950 feet, respectively and were fracture-stimulated in engineered completions with an average proppant concentration of 1,650 pounds per foot across an average of 40 stages per well utilizing diverters. The Horned Frog G #1H, which has a perforated interval of 12,280 feet, produced at a Max 30-day production rate of 2,243 Boe/d, consisting of 467 barrels of oil per day, 643 barrels of natural gas liquids, and 6,799 Mcf per day of natural gas. The H #1H, which has a perforated interval of 10,445 feet, produced at a Max 30-day production rate of 2,067 Boe/d, consisting of 427 barrels of oil per day, 592 barrels of natural gas liquids, and 6,286 Mcf per day of natural gas. The Horned Frog G #1H rate marks the highest 30-day rate in the Company's history, exceeding the 2,123 Boe/d rates at Wildcat established in June 2017. As it has successfully done at Wildcat, Lonestar plans to stringently choke manage these wells to optimize the total liquids recovery over the life of these wells. Lonestar is encouraged by the early performance of its newest wells at Horned Frog. Lonestar has a 100% WI and 80% NRI in these wells. Lonestar has completed drilling operations on the Horned Frog North West #2H and #3H, in which it holds a 100% WI and 75% NRI. These wells have been drilled to measured depths of 17,560 feet and 17,440 feet, respectively and estimated perforated intervals of approximately 7,700 feet, each. Lonestar plans to initiate fracture stimulations on these wells in May 2018.\nEAGLE FORD SHALE TREND- CENTRAL REGION\nGonzales County â€“ In April 2018, Lonestar commenced drilling the Cyclone #13H and Cyclone #14H with planned total measured depths of 20,150 feet and 19,650 feet, respectively. We project that these wells will have perforated intervals of approximately 11,000 feet. Completion of drilling operations is expected this week. Fracture stimulation operations are scheduled for June 2018. Lonestar owns a 100% WI and 78.5% NRI in these two wells.\nHawkeye â€“ Lonestar owns an 87.5% WI in the Hawkeye #1H and Hawkeye #2H, which were placed onstream in January 2018. These wells have now been producing for in excess of three months and the results continue to be encouraging. After registering Max-30 IP's averaging 938 Boe/d, these wells continue to exhibit robust performance. During the first 90 days of production, the Hawkeye #1H has produced cumulative production of 65,600 barrels of oil, 37,250 Mcf, or 74,136 barrels of oil equivalent on a three-stream basis or 824 Boe/d over its first 90 days of production. Over the same period, the Hawkeye #2H has produced cumulative production of 57,020 barrels of oil, 30,655 Mcf, or 64,045 barrels of oil equivalent on a three-stream basis or 712 Boe/d over its first 90 days of production. Through 90 days of production, the Hawkeye wells are 28% better than the average Cyclone well and 19% better than our best Cyclone well, on a per-foot basis. To date, our initial Hawkeye wells are outperforming Third-Party projections by 16%.\nKarnes County â€“ In March 2018, the Company completed drilling operations on the Georg EF #18H, Georg EF #19H, and Georg EF #20H to an average total measured depth of approximately 15,450 feet. These wells have perforated intervals of approximately 6,300 feet with an average proppant concentration of 2,040 pounds per foot. Lonestar owns an 80% WI and 61% NRI in these wells. Fracture stimulation of these wells was completed with our dedicated frac spread in April, 2018 and flowback operations commenced on May 7, 2018. With 1% of their load recovered, the three wells are currently flowing on a 22/64\" choke at an average of 1,121 barrels of oil per day and 639 Mcfpd, or 1,269 Boe/d on a three-stream basis.\nPirate â€“ In Wilson County, no new wells were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Pirate leasehold is held by production, and Lonestar does not currently plan any drilling activity here in 2018.\nEAGLE FORD SHALE TREND- EASTERN REGION\nBrazos & Robertson Counties â€“ In Brazos County, no new wells were completed during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Generally speaking, this area is not an area where we have a clear line of site on meaningful acquisitions, and while our results here have augmented returns, we are reviewing our options on this asset with our partner. Lonestar does not currently have drilling activity budgeted here in 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nLonestar will host a live conference call on Monday, May 14, 2018 at 9:00 AM CDT to discuss the first quarter 2018 results and operational highlights.\nTo access the conference call, participants should dial:\nUSA: 800-931-3971\nInternational: +1 212-231-2929\nA playback of the conference call will be available on the Investor Relations section of Company's website beginning approximately May 15, 2018.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net (loss) income before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, exploration costs, non-recurring costs, (gain) loss on sales of oil and natural gas properties, impairment of oil and gas properties, stock-based compensation, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, rig standby expense, other income (expense) and unrealized (gain) loss on derivative financial instruments and unrealized (gain) loss on warrants.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information to investors because it assists investors in the evaluation of the Company's operating performance and comparison of the results of the Company's operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX to eliminate the impact of certain non-cash items or because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for each of the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31\n($ in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet (Loss) Income\n$\n(18,541)\n$\n3,066\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(3,131)\n1,587\nInterest expense (1)\n11,148\n5,032\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n15,563\n12,142\nEBITDAX\n5,039\n21,827\nStock-based compensation\n450\n178\nGain on sale of oil and gas properties\nâ€”\n142\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivative financial instruments\n7,594\n(8,339)\nUnrealized loss (gain) on warrants\n152\n(2,270)\nOffice lease write-off\n1,568\nâ€”\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n8,619\nâ€”\nOther expense (income)\n(7)\n(4)\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n$\n23,415\n$\n11,534\n1 Interest expense also includes dividends paid on Series A Preferred Stock\nAdjusted Loss\nAdjusted net income comparable to analysts' estimates as set forth in this release represents income or loss from operations before income taxes adjusted for certain non-cash items (detailed in the accompanying table) less income taxes. We believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts' estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts' estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. Diluted earnings per share (adjusted) as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts' estimates on a diluted per share basis. A table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts' estimates and diluted earnings per share (adjusted).\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for each of the periods indicated.\nLonestar Resources US Inc.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of Income Before Income Taxes As Reported To Loss Before Income Taxes Excluding Certain Items, a non-GAAP measure (Adjusted Income)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands)\n(Loss) income before income taxes, as reported\n$\n(19,783)\n$\n4,653\nAdjustments for special items:\nGeneral & administrative non-recurring costs\n7\n7\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n8,619\nâ€”\nUnrealized hedging (gain) loss\n7,594\n(8,339)\nOffice lease write-off\n1,568\nâ€”\nStock based compensation\n450\n178\nLoss before income taxes, as adjusted\n(1,545)\n(3,501)\nIncome tax benefit (expense), as adjusted\nCurrent\nâ€”\nâ€”\nDeferred (a)\n247\n1,216\nNet loss excluding certain items, a non-GAAP measure\n$\n(1,298)\n$\n(2,285)\nPreferred stock dividends\n(1,848)\nâ€”\nNet loss after preferred dividends excluding certain items, a non-GAAP measure\n$\n(3,146)\n$\n(2,285)\nNon-GAAP loss per common share\nBasic\n$\n(0.13)\n$\n(0.10)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.13)\n$\n(0.10)\nNon-GAAP diluted shares outstanding, if dilutive\n24,559,132\n22,833,615\n(a) Effective tax rate for 2018 and 2017 is estimated to be approximately 16% and 35%, respectively.\nLonestar Resources US Inc.\nUnaudited Operating Results\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nIn thousands, except per share and unit data\n2018\n2017\nOperating revenues\nOil\n$\n33,152\n$\n14,489\nNGLs\n1,734\n1,671\nNatural gas\n1,806\n1,456\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n36,692\n$\n17,616\nTotal production volumes by product\nOil (Bbls)\n516,576\n292,528\nNGLs (Bbls)\n86,819\n83,467\nNatural gas (Mcf)\n579,152\n587,480\nTotal barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE)\n699,920\n473,907\nDaily production volumes by product\nOil (Bbls/d)\n5,740\n3,250\nNGLs (Bbls/d)\n965\n927\nNatural gas (Mcf/d)\n6,435\n6,528\nTotal barrels of oil equivalent (BOE/d)\n7,777\n5,266\nAverage realized prices\nOil ($ per Bbl)\n$\n64.18\n$\n49.53\nNGLs ($ per Bbl)\n19.97\n20.02\nNatural gas ($ per Mcf)\n3.12\n2.48\nTotal oil equivalent, excluding the effect from hedging ($ per BOE)\n52.42\n37.18\nTotal oil equivalent, including the effect from hedging ($ per BOE)\n47.34\n38.04\nOperating and other expenses\nLease operating expense\n$\n4,141\n$\n2,661\nGathering, processing, and transportation expense\n443\n295\nProduction and ad valorem taxes\n2,166\n1,037\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n15,563\n12,142\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n3,409\n2,670\nInterest expense (2)\n9,258\n5,032\nOperating and other expenses per BOE\nLease operating expense\n$\n5.92\n$\n5.62\nGathering, processing, and transportation expense\n0.63\n0.62\nProduction and ad valorem taxes\n3.09\n2.19\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n22.24\n25.62\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n4.87\n5.63\nInterest expense (2)\n13.23\n10.62\n(1) General and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation\n(2) Interest expense includes amortization of debt issuance cost, premiums, and discounts\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lonestar-announces-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-and-provides-operational-update-300647225.html\nSOURCE Lonestar Resources US Inc.",
