    "text": "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump averted a trade war with the European Union—at least for now—by delaying his decision to impose broad tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that were supposed to go into effect on May 1. As the trade wrangling continues, tariffs will continue to dominate the headlines.\nWe owe the word “tariff” to trade relations around the Mediterranean Sea, particularly the interchange between Arab and European merchants going back to ancient times. Thanks to the extensive trade networks of Islamic dynasties—such as the Cairo-based Fatimid empire, active in the Mediterranean in the 10th through the 12th centuries—many terms relating to commerce entered European languages from Arabic.\nArab approaches to bookkeeping were also introduced via the Mediterranean trade, bringing in arithmetical terms to record financial transactions. The word “zero,” for instance, is based on an Italian rendering of the Arabic word “sifr.” (The same Arabic root became “cipher” along another etymological route.)\n“Tariff” followed a similar path, originating with the Arabic “ta‘rif,” meaning “information” or “notification,” from the verb “‘arafa,” meaning “to make known.” What Arab traders were making known by using this word was a list of fees on goods entering the port of a foreign country. By the mid-14th century, such a list was identified with the word “tariffa” in a Sicilian source. (A popular story claims the word comes from the name of the Spanish port town Tarifa, which charged fees to merchants during Moorish times, but most etymologists discount that explanation.)\n“Tariffa” took hold in Italian through the trading activities of maritime republics such as Venice and Genoa, and other Romance languages followed suit, with “tarifa” entering Spanish and Portuguese and “tarif” entering French. The word first made its appearance in English in the late 16th century, originally mimicking the Italian “tariffa” before the spelling settled as “tariff.”\nEarly on, the word could refer to a table of numbers used to facilitate calculations (also known as a “ready reckoner”), but the trading sense was the meaning that won out. Over time, “tariff” could refer not just to a list of duties on imported and exported goods, but also to any particular item in such an accounting of duties levied by a government.\nMore in Word on the Street\nBritain’s Very Old Way of Welcoming a New Baby Royal April 26, 2018 ‘Wag the Dog’ Leaps From Hollywood to Washington Pundits April 20, 2018 An FBI Raid Puts the Spotlight on ‘Fixer’ April 13, 2018 The Journey of ‘Caravan’ From Ancient Camels to Immigrant Tensions April 6, 2018 Three Centuries of ‘Hush Money,’ From Jonathan Swift to Stormy Daniels March 30, 2018 “Tariff” has been an important term in U.S. politics since the start, beginning with the Tariff Act of 1789, which helped pay off the Revolutionary War debt by taxing imports. It was known as the “Hamilton Tariff” after Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, who advocated a protectionist approach to U.S. trade. Henry Clay and the Whig Party later championed tariffs, and Abraham Lincoln once wrote that he got his start in politics as “an old Henry Clay tariff Whig.”\nThe word has worked its way into international treaties, notably the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. It was replaced in the 1990s by the World Trade Organization, which has similarly sought to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers.\nThanks to Mr. Trump, tariffs are a hot topic once again. The Federal Reserve’s business survey known as the “Beige Book” mentioned the word “tariff” 36 times in its April report , compared with no mentions the month before.",
