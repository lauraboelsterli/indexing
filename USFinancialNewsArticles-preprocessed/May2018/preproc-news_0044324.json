    "text": "Basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal has listed his sprawling, Florida estate for a whopping $28 million, Premier Sotheby's International Realty announced Monday .\nThe lakeside mansion includes a 6,000-square-foot indoor basketball court and an \"aquarium-style room\" with a saltwater triangular fish tank.\nUneek Uneek The three-acre estate is located in the posh, gated golf community of Isleworth, which has also been home to golf star Tiger Woods and N'SYNC member Joey Fatone. The affluent community it located outside Windermere, Florida, near Orlando.\nUneek O'Neal purchased the mansion for $3.95 million in 1993, when it was a 23,000 square-foot Neo-Colonial, according to the Orlando Sentinel . Now, the estate boasts an impressive 31,000 square feet of living space.\nThe property, which is being exclusively marketed by Danial Natoli of Premier Sotheby's International Realty, includes luxurious amenities like a sound-proof home theater, a gallery hall designed for an art collection and a \"gentleman's room\" with game tables and a wet bar.\nUneek The formal dining room seats 16, and there's also a 1,170-square foot, two-story great room with a marble fireplace and glass walls.\nUneek Outside, the mansion features a 95-foot-long, 15-feet-deep pool with a custom rock waterfall, sunken hot tub and tiki-style open cabana overlooking Lake Butler.\nUneek On the main level, there's a guest wing consisting of five en-suite bedrooms, a great room and a bar. The second level contains a master bedroom area consisting of 900-square-feet and a balcony. Also on the second floor are four en-suite bedrooms and a four-room, master closet with custom shelving.\nUneek The home also has a \"showroom-like\" garage (O'Neal has been known for his impressive car collection ) and a 2,100-square foot secondary garage, which includes a dance studio and enclosed recording studio.\nUneek \"This one-of-a-kind estate was designed for one of the most dominant players in the history of the NBA. Every exquisite detail has been curated to deliver the ultimate luxury living experience,\" Natoli says .\nO'Neal, who has reportedly moved to Atlanta, certainly has the net worth to back up his luxurious digs. In 2014, Forbes listed O'Neal as the sixth highest paid retired athlete, with $20 million in earnings.\nO'Neal is now known as a successful businessman and investor and recommends saving and investing 75 percent of your earnings for retirement and long-term goals, and living off the remaining 25 percent.\nBut he hasn't always been so good at managing his money. At 20, he blew through $1 million in an hour .\nDon't miss: Donald Trump used to own this $45 million Connecticut mansion with Ivana — take a look inside\nLike this story?
