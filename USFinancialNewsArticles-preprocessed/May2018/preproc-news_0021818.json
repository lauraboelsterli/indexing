Together, the Company will have seven distribution locations throughout the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and West Coast.\nTruTemp and Norm’s are value-added wholesale distributors of commercial foodservice equipment and aftermarket parts to the foodservice, hospitality, healthcare, and retail industries.

Like TruTemp and Norm’s, Empire understands how to grow with its key vendor partners while continuing to serve the needs of its customers. This is an exciting time for our combined businesses and we look forward to our new partnership with Empire.”\nJim Kirkland, CEO of Empire, said, “We are very excited to be partnering with TruTemp and Norm’s.
