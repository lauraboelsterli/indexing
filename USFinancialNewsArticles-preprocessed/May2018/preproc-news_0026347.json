Tennis - WTA Mandatory - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Romania's Simona Halep looks dejected after losing her quarter final match against Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova REUTERS/Paul Hanna\nHalep, who has won the tournament for the last two years, had looked imperious on her way to the last eight, dropping only nine games in three matches including Wednesday’s win against Pliskova’s twin sister Kristyna.\nBut her winning streak in the Spanish capital ended at 15 matches as her 26-year-old opponent continued her impressive form on the red clay having won the Stuttgart title last month.\nIt was sixth seed Pliskova’s first claycourt victory over Halep and it was the kind of authoritative performance that will turn a few heads as the French Open looms later this month.\nDutchwoman Kiki Bertens continued her impressive week as she backed up a third-round win over world number two Caroline Wozniacki to beat Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals. Tennis - WTA Mandatory - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova in action during her quarter final match against Romania's Simona Halep REUTERS/Paul Hanna\nUnseeded Bertens, who reached the French Open semis two years ago, recovered from losing the first set to win 4-6 6-2 6-3 and set up a semi-final with Caroline Garcia who eased past local hopeful Carla Suarez Navarro.\nBertens’ win over Wozniacki meant Halep will stay as world number one for at least another week, but the Romanian had no answer to Pliskova on centre court.\nPliskova broke for a 4-3 lead in the opening set and although Halep saved two set points serving at 3-5 Pliskova closed out the opener with a love hold. Slideshow (3 Images)\nRomanian Halep’s error-count was surprisingly high, and she found herself under pressure early in the second set as Pliskova pounced to break in the third game.\nHalep could make little impression on Pliskova’s powerful serving and she buckled at 3-5, dropping serve again to bow out.\nShe quickly shrugged off the loss, however, saying she would now focus on Rome next week before turning her thoughts to another attempt to land a first grand slam title.\n“I’m not stressing myself about the (ranking) points,” said Halep, who has another sackload of points to defend in Rome having reached last year’s final. “I’m not stressing myself about this busy schedule.\n“I just want to enjoy it. I enjoy it. I’m looking forward already to start the next tournament. There is no pressure. I feel like it’s an opportunity to play my best tennis.”\n“Maybe I didn’t play my best game, but maybe she didn’t let me play my best game. She was really good today.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis and Hugh Lawson",
