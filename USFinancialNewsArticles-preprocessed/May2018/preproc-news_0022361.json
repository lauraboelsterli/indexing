    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SOI):\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRecord net income of $13.4 million Record adjusted EBITDA of $21.9 million; 44% increase versus fourth quarter 2017 and up 259% year-over-year Record revenue of $36.0 million; 43% increase versus fourth quarter 2017 and up 249% year-over-year Record 7,673 revenue days; 25% increase versus fourth quarter 2017 and up 192% year-over-year Added 21 proppant management systems to the rental fleet; total of 98 systems at quarter-end\nSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SOI) (“Solaris” or the “Company”), a leading independent provider of supply chain management and logistics solutions designed to drive efficiencies and reduce costs for the oil and natural gas industry, today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018, as further described in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) today.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nSolaris reported net income of $13.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for first quarter 2018, compared to net income of $4.8 million in first quarter 2017 and net income of $9.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2017. First quarter 2018 net income included certain non-recurring items, including approximately $1.7 million of earn-out payments in connection with the Railtronix acquisition and $0.6 million of IPO-related compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $21.9 million, an increase of $15.8 million from first quarter 2017 and an increase of $6.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2017. A description of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided below.\nAdjusted pro forma net income for the first quarter was $14.5 million, or $0.31 per fully exchanged and diluted share, an increase of $11.3 million and $0.24 per fully exchanged and diluted share from first quarter 2017 and an increase of $5.5 million and $0.11 per fully exchanged and diluted share compared to fourth quarter 2017. A description of adjusted pro forma net income and a reconciliation to net income attributable to Solaris, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are provided below.\nRevenues were $36.0 million for the quarter, an increase of $25.7 million, or 249%, compared to first quarter 2017, and an increase of $10.8 million, or 43%, compared to fourth quarter 2017.\nDuring first quarter 2018, the Company generated 7,673 revenue days, the combined number of days that its systems earned revenue during the quarter, a 192% increase from first quarter 2017, and up 25% compared to fourth quarter 2017. Customer demand and adoption rates for Solaris’ systems continue to grow as proppant consumption and intensity increase across the industry and customers realize the benefits of Solaris’ technology.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity\nDriven by strong customer demand and continued customer adoption of our proppant management systems and services, the Company invested $41.2 million during the first quarter, which included adding 21 systems to the fleet, ending the quarter with 98 systems. The Company’s first quarter capital expenditures also included $10.7 million in construction activities related to the Kingfisher Facility. These investments help address rising customer demand and are expected to drive future earnings and cash flow growth for Solaris.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company also entered into a new credit agreement with certain lenders in January 2018. The credit facility has a term of four years and is composed of a $20.0 million revolver and a $50.0 million delayed draw term loan.\nAs of April 30, 2018, the Company had approximately $90.0 million of liquidity, including $21.0 million in cash and $69.0 million of availability under the undrawn credit facility.\nOperational Update and Outlook\nWe currently have 108 systems in the rental fleet, all of which are deployed to customers. The Permian Basin continues to be our most active area, followed by the Eagle Ford Shale, SCOOP/STACK formations, Marcellus/Utica Shale, the Rockeis, the Haynesville Shale and the Barnett Shale. Our systems are highly mobile and can be deployed quickly in response to customer demand.\nProppant supply disruptions and logistic complexities continue to drive demand for our products and services. To meet growing demand, we increased our manufacturing rate earlier this year and delivered eight systems per month to the rental fleet in March and April, the highest monthly manufacturing rate the Company has achieved in its history. Based on our current manufacturing outlook, we expect to end the second quarter with 120 to 122 systems in the fleet and expect to end the third quarter with 142 to 146 systems in the fleet.\nTransloading and construction activity continues at the Kingfisher Facility. Completion of the initial phase of construction remains on track for August 2018. In the interim, we are providing direct rail-to-truck transloading service for our anchor customer, and have received our first unit train from an additional customer.\nThe Company has made significant progress integrating the PropView® and Railtronix™ inventory management systems. We have created a custom dashboard for our anchor customer at the Kingfisher Facility that provides live proppant inventory data across the supply chain, including (i) via railcars that are inbound to several transloading facilities in Oklahoma, (ii) available at the transloading facilities, (iii) via trucks that are outbound to various well sites and (iv) available on well sites throughout the basin. We believe we are uniquely positioned to capture this data from mine to well head.\nSolaris’ Chief Executive Officer Greg Lanham commented, “We continued to execute on our plan in the first quarter and we are excited about the outlook for the business. We are the industry leader in new generation well site proppant management solutions and we are focused on continuing to drive efficiencies to help save our customers money and provide solutions to help manage their supply chain challenges. Through our integration with Railtronix, we are now able to provide our customers with the physical and digital tools to optimize their proppant supply chain management from source to destination.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. Central Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time).

We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest expense and (iii) income tax expense, including franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) unit-based compensation expense and (ii) certain non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges.\nWe believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated.\nThree months ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income $ 13,415 $ 4,782 $ 9,244 Depreciation and amortization 3,202 1,164 2,359 Interest expense, net 84 22 26 Income taxes (1) 2,027 22 24,762 EBITDA $ 18,728 $ 5,990 $ 36,391 IPO bonuses (2) 588 — 581 Stock-based compensation expense (3) 925 32 1,039 Non-recurring cash bonuses (4) 1,679 — — Loss on disposal of assets 3 — 47 Non-recurring organizational costs (5) — 90 — Change in payables related to parties pursuant to tax receivable agreement (6) — — (22,939 ) Other (7) — — 107 Adjusted EBITDA $ 21,923 $ 6,112 $ 15,226",
