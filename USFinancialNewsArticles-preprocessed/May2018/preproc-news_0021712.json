Export growth was above the 1.7 percent rise forecast by a Reuters poll, and up from the 2 percent decline in February, when shipments took a hit during the Lunar New Year break. The country's exports in March totalled 84.5 billion ringgit, the highest monthly export value ever recorded, the International Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement. The growth in exports was mainly driven by higher shipments of manufactured goods, particularly electrical and electronic products, the ministry's data showed. Manufactured goods account for more than 80 percent of Malaysia's exports. Imports in March, however, declined 9.6 percent year-on-year, at their weakest annual pace since September 2009, when they dropped 19.9 percent. Imports of intermediate goods, which account for 52.8 percent of total imports, fell 14.4 percent from a year earlier in March. Imports of capital and consumption goods also posted declines, the data showed. Malaysia reports trade data in ringgit. March's trade surplus widened to 14.7 billion ringgit ($3.74 billion), compared with 9 billion ringgit in February. Exports to China, a major trading partner, remained tepid, falling 4.7 percent year-on-year in March. Shipments to the United States also declined marginally by 0.1 percent from a year earlier, due to lower exports of commodities, electrical and electronic products. For the first quarter of 2018, exports grew 5.8 percent, but imports fell 0.8 percent, compared with the corresponding period last year.
