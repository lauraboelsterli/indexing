Based on financial data as of March 31, 2018, the combined company has total assets of approximately $2 billion. With this acquisition, SmartBank expands its footprint into three new attractive markets—Tullahoma and Murfreesboro, Tennessee and Huntsville, Alabama.\n“It is an exciting opportunity to join these two organizations.

SmartBank’s experience and commitment to excellent client service is reassurance for a smooth transition for Southern Community Bank clients.”\n“This partnership allows us to expand our footprint in both Middle Tennessee and Alabama and build on the solid foundation Southern Community Bank has already created in these markets,” said Miller Welborn, SmartFinancial’s Chairman. “We are pleased to welcome Southern Community Bank team members and clients to the SmartBank family and look forward to a bright future together.\"\nThe legacy Southern Community Bank branch offices will continue to operate under the Southern Community Bank name, as a division of SmartBank, until mid-August 2018, at which time it is expected these offices will adopt the SmartBank brand.\nBanks Street Partners, LLC served as financial advisor to SmartFinancial and SmartBank, and SmartFinancial and SmartBank were represented by the law firm Butler Snow LLP. Olsen Palmer LLC served as financial advisor to Tennessee Bancshares and Southern Community Bank, and Tennessee Bancshares and Southern Community Bank were represented by the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP.\nAbout SmartFinancial, Inc.\nSmartFinancial, Inc., headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, is the bank holding company for SmartBank, a full-service commercial bank founded in 2007 and domiciled in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
