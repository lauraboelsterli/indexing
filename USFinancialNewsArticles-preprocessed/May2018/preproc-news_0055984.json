Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 27, 2018 Japan's Kei Nishikori in action during his first round match against France's Maxime Janvier REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n“You’ve got to be really focused... and also you’ve got to relax at the same time, you know?” he smiled after beating French wildcard Maxime Janvier 7-6(0) 6-4 6-3 on Sunday.\nProviding he can master the seemingly contradictory feat, the 19th seed believes he is in great shape to maybe even go one better than the runners-up spot he achieved at the U.S. Open in 2014. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 27, 2018 France's Maxime Janvier in action during his first round match against Japan's Kei Nishikori REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n“I’m feeling almost perfect. I think I had a good preparation, and I had a good couple of matches before coming here,” he told reporters on Sunday.\n“So I’m feeling, yeah, great body-wise, and also tennis-wise, too. “Yeah, I’ve got to stay mentally strong... You know, two weeks is not a short time.” Editing by Clare Fallon",
