    "text": "The New York Giants have made clear their desire to keep wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. long term, but owner John Mara indicated Tuesday the team isn’t in a rush to get a deal done.\nOct 8, 2017; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham (13) is injured after tackle by Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Casey Hayward (26) during second half at MetLife Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY Sports The star wideout is set to make $8.5 million this fall in the fifth and final year of his rookie contract. Beckham has made no secret of his desire for a rich new deal, yet the team isn’t prepared to extend his contract at any cost.\n“I wouldn’t say sense of urgency. The contract will get done when it’s supposed to get done,” Mara said Tuesday while speaking at a United Way-sponsored gala in New York. “I think that is the (general manager) Dave Gettleman line. I think I’m going to adopt that. All spring, all summer, as long as it takes. ...\n“It’s not the first contract negotiation we’ve ever had. It’ll get done when it’s supposed to get done.”\nThe fact that Beckham, 25, showed up at voluntary team workouts this spring pleased Mara.\nFebruary 18, 2018; Los Angeles, CA, USA; New York Giants football player Odell Beckham Jr. in attendance during the 2018 NBA All Star Game at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports “I was happy to see him,” the team owner said.\nBeckham was sidelined for most of last season. He missed the opener due to an ankle injury, then returned to play four games before sustaining a fractured left ankle against the Los Angeles Chargers.\nBeckham finished 2018 with 25 catches for 302 yards and three touchdowns. Over his previous three pro seasons, he averaged 96 catches, 1,374 receiving yards and 11.7 touchdowns.\nThe Giants selected Beckham 12th overall in the 2014 NFL Draft out of LSU.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
