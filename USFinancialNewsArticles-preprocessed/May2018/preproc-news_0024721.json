(NASDAQ:KTOS), a leading National Security Solutions provider, today reported its first quarter 2018 financial results, which, along with comparable 2017 financial results, have been recast to reflect the pending divestiture of the Company’s Public Safety & Security (PSS) business as a discontinued operation. The sale and divestiture of Kratos’ PSS business is expected to close during the Company’s second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nAccordingly, for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018, Kratos generated revenue of $143.0 million, an increase of 8.3 percent over the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $13.7 million, an increase of 34.3 percent over Adjusted EBITDA of $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 gross margins increased to 28.5 percent from 27.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017, operating income increased 400 percent to $7.0 million in 2018 from $1.4 million in 2017 and Kratos Adjusted EBITDA margin rate increased to 9.6 percent in 2018 from 7.7 percent in 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 Kratos generated positive cash from operations of $6.5 million, the Company’s total backlog was $551.8 million, book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 to 1.0 and Kratos’ bid and proposal pipeline was approximately $6 billion.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division (KUSD) generated year over year revenue growth of 78.2 percent, to $27.8 million, up from $15.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. KUSD’s first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million, or 6.1 percent of revenue, increased from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, KUSD received in excess of $200 million in sole source or single award contracts, all of which is expected to be converted to revenue over the life of the expected contracts, and reported a book to bill ratio of 2.6 to 1.0.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, all businesses within Kratos’ Government Solutions (KGS) generated year-over-year revenue growth, except Kratos’ legacy, non-core government services business, which saw a decline of $8.1 million, resulting in an overall decline in KGS revenues of 1.0% from the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the legacy government services business, KGS revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 7.3 percent over the first quarter of 2017. KGS’ Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was $12.0 million, down from $13.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the decline in Kratos legacy government services business and product mix. During the first quarter of 2018, KGS’ satellite communications business was selected to participate in the U.S. Air Force TETRAS program under a $998 million multiple award IDIQ contract, and Kratos’ Microwave Electronics Division received an approximate $20 million initial sole source contract award in support of a new airborne electronic warfare system.\nApproximately $7.7 million of the increase in the first quarter 2018 revenues was a result of the Company’s adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance effective January 1, 2018. Approximately $3.2 million and $4.5 million of the increase were related to the KGS and KUSD divisions, respectively. The Company’s adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance impacts the timing of revenue recognition. The adoption also resulted in an approximate $138.6 million reduction in total backlog.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EPS* was $0.05 and EPS from continuing operations was $0.01. In the first quarter of 2018, net loss was $2.2 million, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $3.5 million, or a loss from discontinued operations of $0.03 per share, and net loss per share was $0.02.\nEric DeMarco, Kratos’ President and CEO, said, “Kratos’ core unmanned target drone, satellite communications, microwave electronics, training and missile defense related businesses drove Kratos’ first quarter results. These businesses, and in particular Kratos’ unmanned target drone business with several new programs under contract and beginning production, and existing programs with expected increased production quantities, are forecast to drive a strong organic growth curve for our Company over the next several years. Additionally, with our Dynetics team Gremlins win, Kratos has successfully won every high performance tactical unmanned aerial drone program we have pursued, beating certain of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the industry in competitive solicitations. With the Gremlins award, we are now more confident than ever that Kratos’ tactical unmanned aerial systems business will significantly increase the already strong organic growth we are forecasting for our current core businesses in future years.”\nMr. DeMarco concluded, “With a 2018 DoD budget now in place, we have high confidence in Kratos’ 2018 financial forecast, including an extremely strong third and fourth quarter, as we execute and deliver on the numerous new, long term programs we have under contract. With the planned divestiture of PSS, we have positioned Kratos as a high growth, technology and intellectual property based aerospace and defense Company, and we are laser focused on operational execution, increasing Kratos’ profit margins and increasing our cash flow.”\nFinancial Guidance\nKratos is affirming its full year 2018 financial guidance for revenues, excluding the PSS business, of $640 to $650 million, compared to $603.3 million for the full year of 2017, and full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $55 to $59 million, compared to $47.6 million for full year 2017. Kratos is also affirming its full year 2018 financial guidance of positive cash flow generation from operations of $35 to $45 million, including the expected collection of net working capital proceeds of the PSS business retained by Kratos.\nKratos’ second quarter 2018 financial guidance for revenues excluding PSS is $140 to $150 million, as compared to $147.9 million for the second quarter of 2017, and second quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance is $9.0 to $11.0 million, which reflects the anticipated product mix based on delivery and production schedules, as compared to $10.2 million for the second quarter of 2017.\nSimilar to 2017, as a result of the approximate six month U.S. Federal Budget Continuing Resolution Authorization which ended March 23, 2018, and the approval of the 2018 DoD Budget, Kratos is forecasting strong third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, and for the second half of its fiscal year financial performance to be substantially stronger than the first half of 2018.\nManagement will discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results, second quarter and full year 2018 guidance in a conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (5:00 p.m. Eastern) today.

These and other risk factors are more fully discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017, and in our other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted income (loss) per share (computed using income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets and capitalized contract and development costs, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, contract design retrofit costs, acquisition and restructuring related items and other, and impairment of goodwill, which includes but is not limited to unused office space expense, excess capacity, investments in unmanned combat systems initiatives, and foreign transaction gains and losses, less the estimated tax cash payments) and Adjusted EBITDA (which excludes, among other things, losses and gains from discontinued operations, restructuring and transaction related items, investments in unmanned combat systems initiatives, stock compensation expense, unused office space expense, impairment of goodwill, loss on extinguishment of debt, foreign transaction gains and losses, and the associated margin rates). Additional non-GAAP financial measures include Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to our KUSD, KGS and PSS businesses. Kratos believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the Company’s available capital resources, the actual and forecasted operating performance of the Company’s business and the Company’s cash flow, excluding extraordinary items and non-cash items that would normally be included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company’s actual and forecasted operating performance, capital resources and cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and investors should carefully evaluate the Company’s financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. As appropriate, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP are included in this news release.\n*Adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) excludes loss from discontinued operations, non-cash amortization expenses, as the Company has historically been acquisitive, non-cash stock compensation costs, foreign transaction gains and losses, certain non-recurring items such as acquisition and restructuring related items and other, the loss on extinguishment of debt, and the non-cash impairment of goodwill, and includes cash actually expected to be paid for income taxes on continuing operations, reflecting the benefit of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards of over $300 million. Kratos believes that reporting adjusted income (loss) per share is a meaningful metric to present the Company’s financial results.\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by us may be calculated differently than Adjusted EBITDA for other companies. We have provided Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is a commonly used measure of financial performance in comparable companies and is provided to help investors evaluate companies on a consistent basis, as well as to enhance understanding of our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as either an alternative to net income or as an indicator of our operating performance or an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The adjustments to calculate this non-GAAP financial measure and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below. Please refer to the following table below that reconciles GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. The adjustments to calculate this non-GAAP financial measure, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below: Interest income and expense. The Company receives interest income on investments and incurs interest expense on loans, capital leases and other financing arrangements, including the amortization of issue discounts and deferred financing costs. These amounts may vary from period to period due to changes in cash and debt balances. Income taxes. The Company's tax expense can fluctuate materially from period to period due to tax adjustments that may not be directly related to underlying operating performance or to the current period of operations and may not necessarily reflect the impact of utilization of our NOLs. Depreciation. The Company incurs depreciation expense (recorded in cost of revenues and in operating expenses) related to capital assets purchased or constructed to support the ongoing operations of the business. The assets are recorded at cost or fair value and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Amortization of intangible assets. The Company incurs amortization of intangible expense related to acquisitions it has made. These intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are amortized over the estimated useful lives. Amortization of capitalized contract and development costs. The Company incurs amortization of previously capitalized software development and non- recurring engineering costs related to certain aerial targets in its Unmanned Systems business as these units are sold. Stock-based compensation expense. The Company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. Although stock-based compensation is an expense of the Company and viewed as a form of compensation, these expenses vary in amount from period to period, and are affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of the Company's shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards. Management believes that exclusion of these expenses allows comparison of operating results to those of other companies that disclose non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation. Foreign transaction (gain) loss. The Company incurs transaction gains and losses related to transactions with foreign customers in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, certain intercompany transactions can give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. Acquisition and restructuring related items. The Company incurs transaction related costs, such as legal and accounting fees and other expenses, related to acquisitions and divestiture activities. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company's business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results. Excess capacity and restructuring costs. The Company incurs excess capacity and excess overhead costs related to certain of its manufacturing businesses within its Unmanned Systems and Modular Systems businesses due primarily to underutilization of manufacturing facilities and support costs resulting from less than optimal volumes and efficiencies. The Company incurs restructuring costs for cost reduction actions which include employee termination costs, facility shut-down related costs and remaining lease commitment costs for excess or exited facilities. Management believes that these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating results as they are either non-recurring and/or not expected when full capacity and volumes are achieved. Litigation related items. The Company periodically incurs expenses related to pending claims and litigation and associated legal fees and potential case settlements and/or judgments. Although we may incur such costs and other related charges and adjustments, we do not believe it is indicative of any particular outcome until the matter is fully resolved. Management believes these items are outside the normal operations of the Company's business and are not indicative of ongoing operating results. Investment in unmanned combat systems. The Company makes discretionary investments related to its tactical unmanned combat systems initiative with the intention of retaining the intellectual property and data package rights of the technology it is developing. Management believes these rights will result in securing future sole source positions on new platforms which will provide an attractive rate of return. Management believes that these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating results. Contract design retrofits. The Company makes certain design retrofits primarily related to its development programs in its Unmanned Systems business which are necessary for the final design and configuration of these vehicles. Management believes that these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating results. Impairment of goodwill . As management has de-emphasized its legacy government services business since 2012 and has considered this business non-core, management believes that this non-cash charge is not indicative of ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the Adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from the Company's presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. Reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Three Months Ended April 1, March 26, 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2.2 ) $ (10.0 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 3.5 (0.1 ) Interest expense, net 5.1 8.2 Loss on extinguishment of debt - 2.1 Provision for income taxes from continuing operations 0.9 1.4 Depreciation (including cost of service revenues and product sales) 2.8 2.9 Stock-based compensation 1.7 2.1 Foreign transaction gain (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Amortization of intangible assets 1.7 2.6 Acquisition and restructuring related items and other 0.4 1.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13.7 $ 10.2 Reconciliation of acquisition and restructuring related items and other included in Adjusted EBITDA: Three Months Ended April 1, March 26, 2018 2017 Acquisition and transaction related items $ - $ 0.4 Excess capacity and restructuring costs 0.4 0.8 $ 0.4 $ 1.2 Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.

Unaudited Non-GAAP Measures Computation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share (in millions, except per share data) Adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP measure for reporting financial performance, exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying continuing operations results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. The Company uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company's business and to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations before amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, foreign transaction gain/loss, contract design retrofit costs, acquisition and restructuring related items and other, and impairment of goodwill. The Company uses the estimated cash tax provision in computing adjusted earnings per share to reflect the benefit from the utilization of the Company's net operating losses. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
