    "text": "BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) slipped for a second session on Thursday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said any trade deal with top metals consumer China would \"need a different structure\". Copper had rallied at the start of the week after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war was \"on hold\". FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the LME had fallen 0.3 percent to $6,846 a tonne by 0147 GMT, extending a 1.6-percent drop from the previous session. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped by 1 percent to 51,340 yuan ($8,032.29) a tonne, snapping a five-day winning streak. * GRASBERG: Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd confirmed on Wednesday that it was in discussions to sell its interest in the world's second largest copper mine to Indonesia's state mining holding company Inalum. * INDIA: One person died and others were wounded by gunfire in southern India on Wednesday in fresh violence related to protesters' demands that a copper smelter be shut on environmental grounds. * RUSAL: United Company Rusal resumed shipping aluminium to some customers last week following an extension of the deadline for companies to wind down contracts with the Russian firm under U.S. sanctions, sources said. Meanwhile, the CEO of Russia's VTB Bank, Andrey Kostin, said on Wednesday the bank was ready to give aluminium producer Rusal more time to make repayments on its loans, TASS news agency reported.
