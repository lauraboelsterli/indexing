He succeeds Andy Reinland, who will retire May 31 in order to assist with the transition. Mr. Pelzer was most recently president and chief operating officer of the cloud business group at SAP SE, a role he held since August 2015, and prior to that served as the group’s CFO starting in 2015. Mr. Pelzer served as CFO of Concur Technologies Inc. from May 2010 to January 2015.\nMr. Pelzer’s compensation includes a salary of $490,000, a bonus targeting 90% of his salary and a cash sign-on bonus of $500,000. He will also receive restricted stock units valued at $5.3 million as a one-time incentive award, a quarter of which will vest a year after grant date, with the rest vesting in quarterly increments over the following three-year period, according to a filing .\nDixons Carphone PLC , a London-based specialist electrical and telecommunications retailer and services company, named Clare Pettitt as interim group chief financial officer, effective today. She succeeds Humphrey Singer, who will remain in the business and on the board of directors until he departs at the end of June to join Marks & Spencer Group PLC as finance chief. Ms. Pettitt was previously group financial controller, having joined Dixons Carphone in November 2013.
