    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 9:29 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago U.N. warns of more Gaza violence, condemns Israel's use of force Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nGENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. human rights office condemned Monday’s “appalling deadly violence” by Israeli security forces in Gaza and said it was extremely worried about what might happen later on Tuesday, while calling for an independent investigation. An Israeli tank is seen on the Israeli side of the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Baz Ratner\nU.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva that Israel had a right to defend its borders according to international law, but lethal force must only be used a last resort, and was not justified by Palestinians approaching the Gaza fence.
