Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - May 5, 2018 Tottenham's Erik Lamela shoots at goal Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nTottenham lost 1-0 at the Hawthorns on Saturday and while they sit fourth in the standings on 71 points, the London club cannot afford to step off the gas just yet as Chelsea are just two points behind them in the race for a top-four place.\nLamela said the loss was a setback but the team needed to respond with home wins over Newcastle United and Leicester City in their final two games.\n\"We have to win both games, at home especially, to finish the season well, but I think we can do it... we have to... because the team deserves it,\" the Argentine told Tottenham's website here\nThe London club are eager to ensure participation in Europe’s elite club competition next season as they prepare to move to a new stadium and Lamela called on the team to take a maximum six points from the fixtures.\n“Always we have to show character, in every game, and the last two games at home, in front of our people, we have to win both to make them happy and also for us,” Lamela said.\nTottenham take on 10th-placed Newcastle on Wednesday before completing their campaign against ninth-placed Leicester on Sunday.
