    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned power group EDF said some padlocks had been stolen from its Flamanville nuclear power site, although EDF said there was no impact on the plant’s safety.\nAn EDF worker is seen on the construction site of the third-generation European Pressurised Water nuclear reactor (EPR) in Flamanville, France, November 16, 2016. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier EDF added in a statement on Monday that local police in Cherbourg, northern France, were examining the case after EDF reported the theft.\n“On 5 May 2018, EDF filed a complaint against unknown persons at the Cherbourg police station. This complaint concerns disappearance of the padlocks closing cabinets housing the computer equipment for Flamanville EPR I & C system,” EDF said in its statement.\n“However, the seals inside the cabinet were intact. No padlocks were missing from the cabinets housing the computer equipment for the reactor protection I & C system. All the competent authorities were immediately notified,” added EDF.\n“An enquiry is being conducted to ascertain the circumstances of this event. EDF has also initiated an audit on integrity of the I & C system. This event did not have any impact on plant safety,” it also said.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain\n ",
