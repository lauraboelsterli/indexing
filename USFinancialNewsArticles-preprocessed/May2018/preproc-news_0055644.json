    "text": "BERLIN, May 24 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott said it sees room for significant improvement at Thyssenkrupp, confirming it had taken a stake in the German industrial group.\n“Elliott believes Thyssenkrupp has significant scope for operational improvement which would benefit all stakeholders and looks forward to engaging in a constructive dialogue with them in the near future, including with the supervisory and management boards,” the investor said in a statement on Thursday.\nIt confirmed it had taken a stake in Thyssenkrupp, but that this did not exceed the 3 percent threshold for mandatory disclosure.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan Editing by Caroline Copley\n ",
