The combination adds personalized learning to ECS Learning Systems’ approach to its test preparation offerings. It also expands PREPWORKS’ Learning Positioning System® (LPS), currently focused on seventh to twelfth grade End-of-Course Tests, into the critical developmental lower grades. By combining the strengths of both companies, ECS Learning Systems will offer a new kind of blended, personalized test preparation solution that aligns with rigorous State, and College and Career readiness standards.\nCommenting on the transaction, ECS Learning Systems’ President and CEO David Cumberbatch, formerly of ACT, said, “Acquiring PREPWORKS allows us to expand ECS Learning Systems’ offerings into high school and the addition of LPS accelerates our mission to help all students achieve academic success harnessing the power of the latest educational technology. We will continue our investment in the industry-leading LPS computer adaptive learning platform, as we transform STAAR MASTER and TEST SMART® into our complete suite of K through 12 blended offerings.”\nPREPWORKS’ Founder and CEO Tracy LaFlamme Ortega will join ECS Learning Systems as Chief Product Officer, and PREPWORKS Michael Penney will join ECS Learning Systems maintaining his role as CTO.\n“We are proud to join the ECS Learning Systems family of education leaders and distinct brands,” said LaFlamme Ortega. “The combination enables both companies to reach our mutual goal of making learning easy and accessible through cutting-edge educational technology. PREPWORKS’ LPS facilitates the science of one-to-one learning by leveraging artificial intelligence that can personalize a student’s path through the curriculum. Together, our educational solutions can scale and continue to grow, providing all learners the opportunity for better academic achievement.”\nECS Learning Systems has also provided bilingual supplemental materials for Spanish-speaking students in Texas for over 20 years. Through the acquisition, ECS Learning Systems plans to continue to serve the national community of bilingual Hispanic students and hopes to expand the company’s efforts in the coming years.\nAvailable immediately from ECS Learning Systems are the STAAR MASTER and TEST SMART® solutions for Grades 1 to 8 and PREPWORKS high school programs in PSAT, SAT, ACT, Algebra I, Geometry, Civics, Biology, and U.S. History. Additional core courses are in development.\nAbout PREPWORKS®\nCurrently serving students across the U.S. and in 68 countries, the PREPWORKS’ model translates the science of one-to-one tutoring into an adaptive learning online platform. PREPWORKS and its adaptive learning technology, the Learning Positioning System® (LPS), has won more than 40 national awards, including the 2018 BESSIE Awards for Best College and Career Readiness, Algebra, Geometry, and Civics programs. LPS leverages artificial intelligence to personalize a student’s path through the curriculum and will become the platform for ECS Learning Systems’ adaptive, blended learning solutions across its product lines. Today, PREPWORKS’ LPS transforms the way students in Grades 6 through 12 learn and achieve improved results on high-stakes tests. It evaluates each student's starting position, by utilizing micro and macro assessments throughout a student’s program. PREPWORKS delivers learning activities targeted at each student’s strengths and weaknesses tracking student progress in real-time. LPS enables up to 281 trillion personalized learning paths across ACT, SAT, Algebra, Geometry, and Civics programs. The methodology has resulted in student improvement on precollege admissions tests, including the SSAT, ISEE, HSPT, PSAT, SAT, ACT, SAT, Subject Tests, and AP Exams. For End-of-Course Exams, students see an average increase of 29% in scores and an average improvement of 300 SAT points and 5 ACT points.\nAbout ECS Learning Systems\nECS Learning Systems pioneered the Integrated Standards Prep™ approach in its quality education solutions that build core knowledge fully aligned to state standards and works to ensure students complete tests with confidence.
