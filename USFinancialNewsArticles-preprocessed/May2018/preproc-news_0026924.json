    "text": "DELAND, Fla., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARC Group Worldwide, Inc. (“ARC” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ARCW), a leading global provider of advanced manufacturing and metal 3D printing solutions, today reported its results for the period ending April 1, 2018, its fiscal third quarter 2018.\nHighlights for the third quarter fiscal year 2018, compared to the second quarter fiscal year 2018:\n• Sales of $21.5 million, an increase of 16.9%;\n• Gross profit of $1.1 million, an increase of 398.9%;\n• Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations of $1.3 million, an increase of 629.7%;\n• Cash Flow from Operations of $1.3 million, an increase of 1,053.6%; and\n• Bank borrowings debt levels of $37.3 million, a decrease of 17.3%.\nQuarterly Financial Summary\nFiscal third quarter 2018 revenue from continuing operations was $21.5 million, compared to $18.4 million in the prior sequential period. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher metal injection molding (“MIM”) and plastics sales, the combination of higher sales and orders by customers in the aerospace, medical, and firearm and defense markets. Separately, the Company’s international performance continues to improve as revenues from Hungarian operations increased 7.9% sequentially to $2.3 million.\nGross Profit from continuing operations was $1.1 million in the fiscal third quarter, compared to $(0.4) million in the previous sequential quarter. The aforementioned revenue growth, along with ongoing cost reduction initiatives, were the primary drivers of Gross Profit improvement. This improvement was achieved despite expenses of $1.3 million incurred due to planned, ongoing inventory reductions, primarily in our Colorado MIM entity.\nEBITDA from Continuing Operations was $1.3 million in the fiscal third quarter compared to $(0.2) million in the prior sequential quarter. Similar to Gross Profit, EBITDA was positively impacted by the increased revenues and lower costs. These gains were partially offset by the aforementioned inventory reduction efforts of $1.3 million, which added additional expense in the third fiscal quarter.\nFiscal third quarter Cash Flow from Operations was $1.3 million, compared to $(0.1) million in the prior sequential quarter. The increase in Cash Flow from Operations was driven by a lower net loss coupled by modest improvement in working capital management.\nAt the end of the fiscal third quarter the debt level was $37.3 million, compared to $45.1 million in fiscal second quarter. The lower debt levels were due to the use of our Rights Offering proceeds coupled with our improved cash flow generation.\nARC’s CEO, Alan Quasha, commented, “While we still have a long way to go, we are making great progress. During our fiscal third quarter, we have seen a marked improvement over our prior quarter. Management’s focus on repositioning our sales team, cost reductions, and inventory efficiency efforts all have begun to show meaningful positive impacts. At the same time, we have begun to see some of our key, strategic customers in the defense and firearm industry return to more normal levels of demand. Despite the improving conditions both internally and externally, Management remains focused on returning the Company to profitability and improving cash flow generation by driving existing product revenue, increasing operational efficiency, and rightsizing the balance sheet. We expect to see continued progress over the coming quarters.”\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nThe Company has provided non-GAAP financial information to provide additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe are representative or indicative of its results of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, EBITDA from Continuing Operations, EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations, Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations, Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations and Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations are calculated by dividing EBITDA from Continuing Operations and Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations, respectively, by sales.\nThe reconciliation to GAAP is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nApril 1, December 31, For the three months ended: 2018 2017\nNet Loss $ (3,116 ) $ (4,322 ) Interest Expense, Net 870 927 Income Taxes (13 ) (366 ) Depreciation and Amortization 2,579 2,534 Adjustment to Exclude Loss from Discontinued Operations — 7 EBITDA from Continuing Operations $ 320 $ (1,220 ) EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations 1.5 % (6.6 ) % Corporate Expenses 946 981 Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations $ 1,266 $ (239 ) Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations 5.9 % (1.3 ) % Net Loss $ (3,116 ) $ (4,322 ) Adjustment to Exclude Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax — 7 Reorganization/Transaction Expenses 86 — Adjusted Earnings $ (3,030 ) $ (4,315 ) Adjusted Earnings Per Share $ (0.15 ) $ (0.24 ) Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 20,051,710 18,265,323 EBITDA from Continuing Operations excludes interest expense, net and income taxes as these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA from Continuing Operations also excludes depreciation and amortization expense as these non-cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions, which may not be indicative of future capital expenditure requirements. EBITDA from Continuing Operations excludes the (income) or loss associated with discontinued operations.\nFacility EBITDA from Continuing Operations consists of EBITDA from our operating segments, which excludes Corporate Expenses. We believe this is a meaningful measurement of the operating performance of our manufacturing facilities. Corporate Expenses primarily consist of costs not allocated to our manufacturing facilities, such as compensation related costs for employees assigned to corporate, board of directors’ fees and expenses, professional fees, insurance costs, and marketing costs.\nAdjusted Earnings removes the impact of reorganization/transaction related expenses and the impact of discontinued operations. Reorganization expenses are primarily labor and labor related costs associated with the termination of employees. Transaction expenses are primarily professional fees related to the refinancing of debt and the sale of non-core assets.\nAbout ARC Group Worldwide, Inc.\nARC Group Worldwide, Inc. is a global advanced manufacturing and metal 3D printing service provider focused on accelerating speed to market for its customers.
