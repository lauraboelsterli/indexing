    "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was working on a plan to reduce U.S. aid to countries he says are doing nothing to stop MS-13 gang members from crossing into the United States illegally.\n\"We're looking at our whole aid structure. It's going to be changed very radically,\" Trump told a roundtable discussion about the threat posed by the violent MS-13 gang.\nTrump has made the fight against MS-13 a major part of his drive to stem the flow of immigrants illegally into the United States .\nLast week, he called gang members \"animals,\" drawing scorn from Democrats . On Wednesday, he defended his description.\n\"I called them 'animals' the other day and I was met with rebuke,\" Trump said. \"They said: 'They are people.' They're not people. These are animals,\" he said.\nTrump did not give detail on his plan to cut funding for countries from which MS-13 gang members originate.\n\"We're going to work out something where every time someone comes in from a certain country, we are going to deduct a rather large sum of money,\" he said.",
