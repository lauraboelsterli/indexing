    "text": "Chicago catcher Welington Castillo had two hits and a homer and right-hander Reynaldo Lopez pitched eight scoreless innings to help the White Sox win their first series since late April with a 3-0 victory over the Texas Rangers at Guaranteed Rate Field on Sunday.\nLeury Garcia had two hits and drove in two runs and Lopez (1-3) gave up two hits and retired 17 of the last 19 he faced in his longest career outing. It was his first victory since Sept. 22, 2017.\nThe White Sox won three of four from Texas for their first series victory since taking three of five against Kansas City from April 26-29. They have the worst record in the majors at 13-30.\nLopez struck out eight and did not allow a hit after Carlos Perez opened the third inning with a double, Texas’ only extra-base hit. Perez was the only Ranger to get as far as third, moving up on a groundout before Lopez struck out Jurickson Profar to end the inning.\nProfar reached on an infield error with two outs in the sixth inning and Lopez issued the second of his two walks with two outs in the eighth before striking out Shin-Soo Choo.\nChoo had the Rangers’ other hit, a single with one out in the first inning.\nThe Rangers have lost six of eight and finished 3-6 on a nine-game road trip.\nLeft-hander Jace Fry pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his first career save.\nTexas left-hander Mike Minor (3-3) gave up six hits and three runs in five innings, with a season-high nine strikeouts.\nLopez rebounded after giving up seven hits and six runs in a 7-0 loss to Pittsburgh in his shortest outing of the season. Lopez has received an average of 3.1 runs of support in his nine starts, fourth-lowest in the AL.\nCastillo hit his sixth homer of the season with one out in the second inning for a 1-0 lead.\nThe White Sox scored two runs on three singles in the third inning to make it 3-0. Adam Engel singled and took third on Tim Anderson’s single. With the runners moving, Garcia dropped a single into right field to score both runners.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
