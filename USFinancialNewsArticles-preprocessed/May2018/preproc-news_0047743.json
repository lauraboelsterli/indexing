Yurcisin and his zulily team will play an integral role in the continued evolution of Qurate Retail Group and its focus on delivering a differentiated shopping experience for consumers. Yurcisin will be based in Seattle.\nYurcisin joins Qurate Retail Group after 13 years with Amazon, where he led several large businesses with a track record of rapid innovation and strong sales growth.

Lori has served as Chief Merchant since she joined zulily in November 2009, prior to the launch of zulily.com .\n\"I would like to thank Lori for serving as interim President, in addition to her responsibilities as Chief Merchant, as she and the zulily leadership team continued to drive the business forward and grow by 17% during Q1,\" said George. \"Lori's willingness to step up has also allowed zulily co-founder Darrell Cavens to immediately launch our New Ventures division, which is focused on supporting our growth by imagining and developing new forms of discovery-based shopping.\"\nMary Campbell Named Chief Merchandising and Interactive Officer, Qurate Retail Group\nAs Chief Merchandising and Interactive Officer, Campbell oversees Qurate Retail Group's product leadership, platform evolution and consumer marketing agenda, curating exclusive assortments of compelling brands and products, and bringing them to life in highly engaging ways across the Group's television networks, ecommerce sites, social pages, mobile apps, print catalogs and in-store destinations.\nThis new team's shared purpose is to drive product leadership across the Group's dynamic, ever-evolving, ever-expanding live platforms and customer touchpoints.

Most recently, she served as Chief Interactive Experience Officer, Qurate Retail Group.\n\"Mary is a dynamic leader with a long history of creating innovative organizations and leading them to extraordinary results,\" said George. \"During the six years when Mary led Commerce Platforms, QVC achieved our largest television reach, ecommerce and mobile penetration, and customer base ever. She brings more than 20 years of merchandising experience to her new role, including her success identifying and attracting several strategic brands and concepts to QVC.\"\nAidan O'Meara Named President, Qurate Retail Group International\nO'Meara will be responsible for driving growth, team member engagement and innovation at our retail operations outside of the U.S., which bring the QVC shopping experience to customers in Japan, UK & Ireland, Germany & Austria, Italy, France, and QVC's joint venture in China.

During this time, he oversaw the development of a large, direct-to-consumer business (with high ecommerce penetration and over 600 owned stores), multiple transformation initiatives, and the establishment of a product localization capability. In addition, O'Meara pioneered the flow of talent between VF Corp's businesses globally. Across his career, O'Meara has run businesses in Ireland, the UK, Scandinavia, EMEA, Asia and the U.S.\n\"Aidan combines a low-ego, highly collaborative leadership style with a relentless drive to succeed and a nuanced understanding of how to build and rebuild complex, multi-channel businesses across multiple cultures,\" said George. \"Throughout his career, he has led high-performing teams to strong growth through product innovation, channel expansion, and disruptive digital technology and business models. His guidance will help our teams build on their momentum in Europe and Asia.\"\nTom Bazzone Named President, Frontgate\nBazzone will lead our Frontgate team as they drive growth, innovation and customer loyalty. Bazzone and his team will work together to provide customers with beautifully thoughtful, timeless home furnishings and products that instill life into extraordinary spaces and hold long-term value.
