Penney’s Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison to the top position boosted consumer discretionary stocks.\nJ.C. Penney’s tumbled 4.2 percent.\nAt 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.78 points, or 0.05 percent, at 25,026.07 and the S&P 500 was up 5.81 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,738.82. The Nasdaq Composite was up 19.98 points, or 0.27 percent, at 7,414.01.\nDeclines in Caterpillar and Boeing, which drove gains on Monday, weighed on the blue-chip Dow.\nToll Brothers declined 7.3 percent after disappointing second-quarter profit and weighed on other homebuilders. Lennar dipped 1.7 percent, while PulteGroup slid 2 percent.\nThe possibility of a ZTE reprieve helped shares of optical component makers. Acacia Communications, which got 30 percent of its 2017 revenue from ZTE, rose 1.4 percent, while Oclaro gained 1.1 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.41-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 90 new highs and 9 new lows.\nReporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
