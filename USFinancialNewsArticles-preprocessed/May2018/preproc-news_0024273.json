REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\nJowell, who was 70, was diagnosed with brain cancer in May last year.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair led the tributes to Jowell, saying she had “passion, determination and simple human decency in greater measure than any person I have ever known”.\nJowell joined the government as a minister in the Department for Health after Blair’s Labour Party won the 1997 election by a landslide. Slideshow (5 Images)\nBlair appointed her to the cabinet in 2001 as Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, where she headed London’s successful Olympic Games bid.\nFollowing her cancer diagnosis, Jowell campaigned for better treatment for cancer patients from Britain’s state-funded health service.\nConservative Prime Minister Theresa May said: “The dignity and courage with which Dame Tessa Jowell confronted her illness was humbling and inspirational.” Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by John Stonestreet",
