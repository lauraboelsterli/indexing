    "text": "Southwest Airlines has apologized to the Cal women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb after she claimed an airline employee stopped her from boarding because the worker didn't believe her 1-year-old biracial son was hers.\nGottlieb tweeted that a desk agent wouldn't let her on a flight from Denver to Oakland Sunday because her son had a different last name. However, the coach from the University of California, Berkeley said she believed it was \"because he has a different skin color.\" Gottlieb was travelling with her fiance, Patrick Martin, the boy's father, who is black.\n@CalCoachG tweet\n@CalCoachG tweet\nAirlines aren't required to match the last name of a child and guardian for domestic flights.\nSouthwest said Tuesday it reached out to Gottlieb.\nGottlieb says she appreciates the apology.",
