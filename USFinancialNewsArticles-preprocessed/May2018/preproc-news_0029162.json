    "text": "May 13, 2018 / 7:30 PM / in 18 minutes Cadence agrees to buy State Bank in $1.4 billion all-stock deal Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Cadence Bancorp ( CADE.N ) said on Sunday it had agreed to buy State Bank Financial Corp ( STBZ.O ) in an all-stock deal valued at about $1.4 billion, signaling a potential rise in regional bank consolidation in the United States. A logo and ticker info for Cadence Bancorp, LLC is displayed on a screen during the company's IPO, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe agreement, approved by the boards of both banks, will create an entity with $16 billion in assets and about 100 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, the banks said in a press release.\nInvestors expect a wave of mergers among mid-sized banks as U.S. lawmakers work to rewrite banking rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These changes would likely raise the limit on what is considered a systemically important financial institution, which had hampered some banks from merging.\nLawmakers also are tinkering with older bank rules, emboldened by President Donald Trumpâ€™s vow to loosen banking restrictions.\nState Bank shareholders will receive 1.160 shares of Cadence class A common stock for each State Bank share, Cadence said in a statement. Cadence shares closed at $30.23 on Friday, while State Bank shares closed at $33.08.\nCadence and State Bank shareholders will collectively own about 65 percent and 35 percent of the combined company, respectively, after the deal is closed.
