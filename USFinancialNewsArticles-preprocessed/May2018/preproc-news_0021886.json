    "text": "BEVERLY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ARA) (the “Company”), a leading provider of outpatient dialysis services, today announced financial and operating ended March 31, 2018.\nCertain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted basis, are Non-GAAP financial measures (See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation tables further below).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (all percentage changes compare Q1 2018 to Q1 2017 unless noted):\nNet patient service operating revenues increased 10.0% to $194.7 million; Net loss attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. was $0.9 million as compared to a net loss of $1.3 million in Q1 2017; Adjusted EBITDA less noncontrolling interests (“Adjusted EBITDA-NCI”) was $22.7 million as compared to $21.4 million in Q1 2017; Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. was $3.8 million, or $0.11 per share, for Q1 2018; Total dialysis treatments increased 5.2%, of which 4.2% was non-acquired growth. Normalized total growth treatment was 6.3% and normalized non-acquired growth was 5.3%; and As of March 31, 2018, the Company operated 228 outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately 15,700 patients.\nJoseph (Joe) Carlucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are very pleased that the Company’s first quarter 2018 performance represented a return to year-over-year growth in terms of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA-NCI and Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. per share. We expect to continue to deliver growth in 2018, driven by a more sustainable cost structure, continued execution on our development program, treatment growth, and the new coverage policy for Calcimimetic pharmaceuticals. We are proud that our partnership model continues to be differentiated by strong quality metrics and outstanding patient satisfaction rates.”\nFinancial and operating highlights include:\nRevenue: Patient service operating revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $194.7 million, an increase of 10.0% as compared to $177.0 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to treatment growth and reimbursement of certain pharmaceuticals under the Medicare ESRD PPS Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment (“TDAPA”), which became effective January 1, 2018.\nTreatment Volume: Total dialysis treatments for the first quarter of 2018 were 558,936, representing an increase of 5.2% over the first quarter of 2017. Non-acquired treatment growth was 4.2%, and acquired treatment growth was 1.0% for the first quarter of 2018. Normalized for clinic sales and the number of treatment days in the period, Q1 2018 total treatment growth was 6.3% and non-acquired treatment growth was 5.3% as compared to Q1 2017.\nCenter Activity: As of March 31, 2018, the Company provided services at 228 outpatient dialysis centers serving 15,776 patients. During the first quarter of 2018, we opened one de novo center and sold one center. As of March 31, 2018, we had 28 signed clinics scheduled to open in the future.\nNet income, Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, Net loss attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc., Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI:\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease (Decrease) (in thousands)\n2018 2017 Amount Percentage\nChange\nNet income $ 13,713 $ 12,902 $ 811 6.3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14,623 ) (14,153 ) 470 3.3 % Net loss attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. $ (910 ) $ (1,251 ) $ 341 NM\nNon-GAAP financial measures**: Adjusted EBITDA $ 37,361 $ 35,568 $ 1,793 5.0 % Adjusted EBITDA-NCI $ 22,738 $ 21,415 $ 1,323 6.2 %\n** See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nOperating Expenses: Patient care costs for the first quarter of 2018 were $133.7 million, or 68.7% of patient service operating revenues, as compared to $120.3 million, or 68.0% (or 67.0% excluding the Modification Expense described below) of patient service operating revenues, in the prior-year period. General and administrative expenses were $25.0 million, or 12.8% of patient service operating revenues, as compared to $31.2 million, or 17.6% (or 13.5% excluding the Modification Expense described below) of patient service operating revenues, in the prior-year period. Patient care costs include $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 of stock-based compensation related to modification of options at the time of the Company’s initial public offering (the “Modification Expense”). General and administrative expenses include $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 of Modification Expense.\nCash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.0 million as compared to $16.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million as compared to $2.5 million in the prior-year period. Total capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $9.9 million as compared to $6.4 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include $3.0 million for maintenance and $6.9 million for expansions and new clinic development.\nBalance Sheet: At March 31, 2018, the Company’s balance sheet included consolidated cash of $64.3 million and consolidated debt of $557.9 million, including the current portion of long-term debt. Excluding clinic-level debt not guaranteed by the Company and clinic-level cash not owned by the Company, Adjusted owned net debt (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”) was $462.7 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $459.5 million at December 31, 2017. Adjusted owned net debt to last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA-NCI leverage ratio was 4.3x at March 31, 2018, an improvement of 0.1x from December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, net patient accounts receivable was $85.7 million, and days sales outstanding (“DSO”) for the period was 40 days as compared to 37 days as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA-NCI:\nThe Company is reiterating its prior guidance for 2018 Adjusted EBITDA-NCI to be in a range of $110 million and $116 million.\nThe Company’s 2018 Adjusted EBITDA-NCI excludes legal costs and any potential adverse financial impact resulting from any broader resolution of our disputes with United to the extent they occur during 2018.\nWe are not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our Non-GAAP outlook to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP measures that we exclude from our Non-GAAP outlook are not available without unreasonable effort on a forward-looking basis due to their unpredictability, high variability, complexity and low visibility. These excluded GAAP measures include noncontrolling interests, interest expense, income taxes, and other charges. We expect the variability of these charges to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nPlease see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this release for a discussion of certain risks to our outlook.\nConference Call\nAmerican Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss this release on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI provide information useful for evaluating our business and a further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because Adjusted EBITDA excludes the results of actions that are outside the operational control of management, but can differ significantly from company to company depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA-NCI is helpful in highlighting the amount of Adjusted EBITDA that is available to us after reflecting the interests of our joint venture partners. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI are not measures of operating performance computed in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in conformity with GAAP, or as measures of profitability or liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be indicative of historical operating results, and we do not mean for these items to be predictive of future results of operations or cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these items in isolation, or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI:\ndo not include stock-based compensation expense, and beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017, do not include associated payroll taxes; do not include transaction-related costs; do not include depreciation and amortization—because construction and operation of our dialysis clinics requires significant capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization are a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits; do not include interest expense—as we have borrowed money for general corporate purposes, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits and cash flows; do not include income tax receivable agreement income and expense; do not include loss on early extinguishment of debt; do not include costs related to certain legal matters; do not include executive and management severance costs; do not include certain income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us and other non-income based taxes; and do not reflect gain on sale of assets.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not adjusted for the portion of earnings that we distribute to our joint venture partners.\nYou should not consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI as alternatives to income from operations or net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, since not all companies use identical calculations.\nWe use Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. because it is a useful measure to evaluate our performance by excluding the impact of certain items that we believe are not related to our normal business operations and/or are a result of changes in our liabilities from period to period. See the notes to the tables below for further explanation of the exclusion of certain items. By excluding these items, we believe Adjusted net income allows us and investors to evaluate our net income on a more consistent basis. “Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc.” is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. plus or minus, as applicable, stock-based compensation due to option modifications and other transactions at the time of the Company’s initial public offering, certain legal matter costs, transaction-related costs, income tax receivable agreement income/expense, tax valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, and accounting changes in fair value of non-controlling interest puts, net of taxes. We use the Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares to calculate Adjusted net income attributable to American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. per share. For the first quarter of 2017, the Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is calculated using the treasury method as if certain unvested in-the-money options subject to a contingency are treated as being vested to provide investors with a calculation of the fully-diluted number of shares assuming certain pre-IPO options vested prior to their actual vesting on April 21, 2017.\nWe use Adjusted cash provided (used) by operating activities less distributions to NCI because it is a useful measure to evaluate the cash flow that is available to the Company for investment in property, plant and equipment, debt service, growth and other general corporate purposes. “Adjusted cash provided (used) by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests” is defined as cash provided by operating activities plus transaction-related expenses less distributions to noncontrolling interests.\nWe use Adjusted owned net debt because it is a useful metric to evaluate the Company’s share of interests in the cash on our consolidated balance sheet and the debt of the Company. “Adjusted owned net debt” is defined as debt (other than clinic-level debt) plus clinic-level debt guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries of American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. less cash (other than clinic-level cash) less the Company’s pro rata interest in clinic-level cash. “Owned net leverage” is defined as the ratio of Owned net debt to our trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA-NCI.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-NCI for the periods indicated:\n(Unaudited) Reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nLTM (1) as of\nMarch 31, 2018\n2018 2017 Net income $ 13,713 $ 12,902 $ 76,494 Interest expense, net 7,457 7,609 29,137 Income tax benefit and other non-income based tax (792 ) (3,524 ) 11,206 Depreciation and amortization 9,623 9,074 38,183 Transaction-related costs 856 — 1,573 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — 526 Income tax receivable agreement expense (income) 1,021 (4,517 ) (1,696 ) Certain legal matters (2) 4,103 3,936 15,416 Executive and management severance costs — — 917 Stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes 1,380 10,088 7,651 Gain on sale of assets — — (1,257 ) Adjusted EBITDA (including noncontrolling interests) $ 37,361 $ 35,568 $ 178,150 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14,623 ) (14,153 ) (71,296 ) Adjusted EBITDA-NCI $ 22,738 $ 21,415 $ 106,854\n(1) Last twelve months (“LTM”) is the period beginning April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018.\n(2) Certain legal matters costs include legal fees and other expenses associated with matters outside the ordinary course of our business, including, but not limited to, our handling of, and response to, the UnitedHealth litigation, a now-concluded SEC inquiry, the CMS request for information, the securities and derivative litigation, and the Company’s internal review and analysis of factual and legal issues relating to the aforementioned matters as described in our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.
