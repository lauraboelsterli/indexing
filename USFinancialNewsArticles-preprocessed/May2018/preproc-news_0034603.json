    "text": "United Airlines is bringing back tomato juice.\nLate Thursday, United said it would initiate plans to restock airplane galleys with a beverage apparently more beloved by many of the Chicago-based carrier's loyal customers than had been anticipated.\nThe about-face comes in the context of United recently revealing it was in the process of streamlining onboard food and beverage offerings. Those plans call for less elaborate meal options in premium cabins on flights of less than four hours as well as a variety of changes in the range of liquor and spirits offered on flights.\nBut sources within the ranks of United frontline flight attendants told the Chicago Business Journal none of the planned changes hit harder from their vantage point than did the news the airline was dropping tomato juice from the beverage list and substituting instead an additional can of Bloody Mary mix on beverage trolleys.\nAs the Chicago Business Journal noted in an article on Monday, many within the ranks of United flight attendants were already \"in full apology mode\" as tomato juice had gone missing on United flights.\nBy late Thursday, United spokespeople were busy spreading the news that tomato juice is coming back. \"We do listen to customer feedback and make adjustments accordingly,\" noted a United spokesman, who indicated tomato juice should be back on board all United flights by July.\nUnited flight attendants, needless to say, responded quite favorably to United's reversal of course. Noted one United flight attendant: \"I am amazed by how quickly the Titanic changed course. My Thursday is much happier!\"\nThe flight attendant also characterized United's change of heart as \"change for good.\"\nUnited Airlines is a unit of United Continental Holdings.\nMore from Chicago Business Journal:\nMcDonald's ads spotlight 'speechless' celebrities, fresh-beef burgers\nLand O'Frost takes viewers inside sandwich boardroom in first-ever ad\nSnapchat rolling out redesign of its redesign",
