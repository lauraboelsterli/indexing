    "text": "First quarter GAAP and non-GAAP earnings of $0.35 and $0.28 per diluted share, respectively Achieved best-ever first quarter net sales of $491 million, an increase from prior year of 36 percent Strong Quote: and order activity increases backlog to record level of $1.3 billion Company increases full-year 2018 guidance for new trailer shipments to 58,000 to 62,000 trailers and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings to $2.01 to $2.13 per diluted share and $1.94 to $2.06 per diluted share, respectively\nLAFAYETTE, Ind., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wabash National Corporation (NYSE:WNC), a diversified industrial manufacturer and a leading producer of semi-trailers, truck bodies and liquid transportation systems, today reported results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nNet sales for the first quarter 2018 increased 36 percent to $491 million from $363 million in the prior year quarter. This increase reflects growth in each of the Company’s three operating segments due to strong demand and the favorable impact of the acquisition of Supreme Industries, Inc. (“Supreme”) in September 2017. Operating income decreased 15 percent to $25.7 million compared to operating income of $30.3 million for the first quarter 2017 due primarily to increased material costs, new product development initiatives and labor costs attributable to increased production to meet current demand.\n“We are pleased to report record first quarter top-line results, driven by a strong overall demand environment, greater than anticipated new trailer shipments of 13,200, and further supported by the revenue delivered from our expanded Final Mile business,” stated Dick Giromini, chief executive officer. “Backlog grew once again, reaching record levels of $1.3 billion, with significant sequential backlog increases of 40% and 50% within the Diversified Products and Final Mile segments, respectively. Additionally, trailer orders received during the quarter within our Commercial Trailer segment remained strong, leading to its third highest first quarter backlog on record. As expected and previously discussed, raw material inflation, along with normal seasonally higher operating costs, further impacted margins throughout the quarter. However, expectations are that this past quarter will represent the low-water mark of operating performance for the year as a combination of higher shipments, lower operating costs, and repricing actions already taken to offset the impact of material cost increases, will all help to contribute strong results throughout the balance of the year. As such, we are increasing our previous full-year guidance for 2018 new trailer shipment to 58,000 to 62,000 units and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings to $2.01 to $2.13 per diluted share and $1.94 to $2.06 per diluted share, respectively.”\nNet income for the first quarter 2018 was $21.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to the first quarter 2017 net income of $20.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP adjusted earnings were $16.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, a $2.7 million decrease as compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings for the first quarter 2018 excludes net gains on sale of former facilities offset by expenses related to acquisition and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisition of Supreme and the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the Company’s repurchase of a portion of its outstanding convertible senior notes. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings for the first quarter 2017 excluded net gains on sale of former facilities offset by charges related to the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the Company’s amendment to its term loan credit facility.\nOperating EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain items, for the first quarter 2018 was $39.0 million, a decrease of $2.9 million compared to operating EBITDA for the prior year period. On a trailing twelve month basis, net sales totaled $1.9 billion, generating operating EBITDA of $186.1 million, or 9.8 percent of net sales.\nThe following is a summary of select operating and financial results for the past five quarters:\nThree Months Ended (Dollars in thousands, except per\nshare amounts) March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, March 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2018 Net Sales $ 362,716 $ 435,903 $ 425,098 $ 543,444 $ 491,319 Gross Profit Margin 16.4 % 15.5 % 14.3 % 13.4 % 13.1 % Income from Operations $ 30,264 $ 38,668 $ 26,591 $ 35,293 $ 25,656 Income from Operations Margin 8.3 % 8.9 % 6.3 % 6.5 % 5.2 % Net Income $ 20,173 $ 22,945 $ 18,947 $ 49,356 $ 21,272 Diluted EPS $ 0.32 $ 0.36 $ 0.30 $ 0.80 $ 0.35 Non-GAAP Measures (1) : Operating EBITDA $ 41,930 $ 49,450 $ 46,561 $ 51,062 $ 38,984 Operating EBITDA Margin 11.6 % 11.3 % 11.0 % 9.4 % 7.9 % Adjusted Earnings $ 19,517 $ 23,189 $ 21,214 $ 22,250 $ 16,857 Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 0.31 $ 0.37 $ 0.34 $ 0.36 $ 0.28 Notes:\n(1) See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for explanation of the non-GAAP results included above.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nThe table below is a summary of select segment operating and financial results prior to the elimination of intersegment sales for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017.

Gross profit margin for the first quarter decreased 410 basis points as compared to the prior year period primarily due to increases in material costs, start-up expenses associated with the ramp-up of new product initiatives, as well as increased labor costs resulting from higher wage rates and increased overtime requirements to meet current demand. Operating income decreased $3.9 million, or 12 percent, from the first quarter last year to $29.5 million, or 9.0 percent of net sales.\nDiversified Products’ net sales for the first quarter were $95 million, an increase of $5 million, or 6 percent, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to the increased demand for liquid tank trailers as compared to the previous year period. Gross profit and profit margins as compared to the prior year period decreased $0.3 million and 140 basis points, respectively, primarily due to increased material and labor costs related to the ramp-up of production in order to meet higher demand requirements. Operating income for the first quarter 2018 was $5.0 million, or 5.3 percent of net sales, an increase of $0.4 million compared to the prior year.\nFinal Mile Products’ net sales for the first quarter totaled $75 million. Gross profit and gross profit margin for the first quarter were $11.5 million and 15.3 percent, respectively. Excluding non-recurring acquisition and integration related costs, gross profit and operating margins for the first quarter were 16.1 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively. Truck body demand continues to be strong as backlog increased 50 percent compared to the prior quarter.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the financial information included in this release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures and results calculated in accordance with GAAP, including net income, and reconciliations to GAAP financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nOperating EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, charges incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Supreme, and other non-operating income and expense. Management believes providing operating EBITDA is useful for investors to understand the Company’s performance and results of operations period to period with the exclusion of the items identified above. Management believes the presentation of operating EBITDA, when combined with the GAAP presentations of operating income and net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company’s operating performance. A reconciliation of operating EBITDA to net income is included in the tables following this release.\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the three-month period ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect adjustments for charges incurred in connection with acquisition and integration of Supreme, the losses attributable to the Company’s extinguishment of debt, executive severance costs, income or losses recognized on sale of former branch locations as well as tax benefits associated with the adjustment of the Company’s net deferred income tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions. Management believes providing adjusted measures and excluding certain items facilitates comparisons to the Company’s prior year periods and, when combined with the GAAP presentation of net income and diluted net income per share, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance. A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share is included in the tables following this release.\nFirst Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Conference Call\nWabash National will conduct a conference call to review and discuss its first quarter results on May 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.
