    "text": "Published: May 16, 2018 1:17 a.m. ET Share\nTakes issue with demands of national security adviser Reuters North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in April 27, 2018.\nBy Michael R. Gordon Nancy A. Youssef\nA senior North Korean official said Pyongyang isn’t interested in a summit with the U.S. focused solely on denuclearization and accused Washington of trying to “impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq.”\nIn a Wednesday statement attributed to Kim Kye Gwan, a senior foreign ministry official, North Korea said it doesn’t want to deal away its nuclear weapons for economic compensation or benefits. That cast doubt on the North’s willingness to proceed with a planned June 12 summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore.\n“If the U.S. is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the DPRK-U.S. summit,” Kim was quoted as saying, using the acronym for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nRead: North Korea threatens to pull out of summit with U.S. over military exercises\nKim Kye Gwan, a longtime North Korean diplomat who has met frequently with U.S. negotiators and high-level officials over the years, singled out national security adviser John Bolton and his demands, which include a Libya-style denuclearization process and the disposal of biological and chemical weapons.
