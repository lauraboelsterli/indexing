    "text": "** Fish farmer Norway Royal Salmon suspects outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) at the Lubben site in region north\n** Shares drop 3.5 pct to 179.6 Norwegian crowns vs Oslo Bourse benchmark index rising 0.5 pct\n** Lubben site has 0.67 million fish with an average weight of 1.4 kilograms\n** Broker Sparebank 1 Markets says net impact in worst case scenario is over 10 pct on 2018 EBIT, but Norway Royal Salmon could be allowed to let the fish grow to a sellable size (above 2kg) and be able to recover some of the loss, the broker added\n** Sparebank 1 Markets says will probably have to cut its 2018 volume estimates by more than 5 pct after this announcement, but awaits more information from the company\n** Sparebank 1 Markets: A share price drop in the 4-6 pct range is not unfair, but it has to be said that the Norway Royal Salmon share fell 5.4 pct in the previous trading session (Olepetter.skonnord@thomsonreuters.com)\n ",
