Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Bank of America, Inc. is pairing research into how artificial intelligence could be used to be detect fraud with an effort to understand the ethical implications of AI’s use.\nGetting it right . In April the bank, together with Harvard Kennedy School, launched The Council on the Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence. As Cathy Bessant, chief operations and technology officer, tells CIO Journal’s Sara Castellanos and Kim S. Nash . “AI is a key driver of growth for our future, it’s a worthy investment in getting it right.”\nExplainable AI… The bank at an event last week in New York City underscored its commitment, saying there is no time frame for deploying an AI fraud-detection system until they understand how it works. “We want to understand how the decision is made, so that we can stand behind it and say that we’re not disfavoring someone,” said Hari Gopalkrishnan, client-facing platforms technology executive at Bank of America.\n…and beyond. BofA’s involvement on the council extends beyond “explainable AI,” a nascent field of research aimed at understanding how a machine-learning model comes to a logical decision, to include the technology’s impact on jobs. “The scale and pace of development mean that there’s a real risk that AI can change the nature of the workforce much more quickly than reskilling can take place,” Ms. Bessant tells CIO Journal.\nThe promise and current state of blockchain. CIO Journal Columnist Irving Wladawsky-Berger shared the stage recently with senior supply chain executives to discuss blockchain. He found that their views–skeptical yet open to experimentation–captured the current state of blockchain in the business world.\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS\nSteve Eisman, managing director of Neuberger Berman, during an interview with Bloomberg Television in New York last year. Mr. Eisman on Monday threw cold water on the cryptocurrency frenzy. Photo: CHRISTOPHER GOODNEY/BLOOMBERG NEWS\nBig Short star not impressed with cryptocurrencies. Steve Eisman, whose bet against subprime mortgages a decade ago was memorialized in “The Big Short,” isn’t such a fan of the investing craze around cryptocurrencies, the Journal’s Steven Russolillo reports .“I don’t see the purpose of it,” he said Monday in Hong Kong, on stage in front of roughly 1,500 attendees. “What value does cryptocurrency actually add? No one’s been able to answer that question for me.”\nTrump throws lifeline to ZTE. President Donald Trump said he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to keep ZTE Corp. in business, a surprise intervention that comes less than a month after the Chinese telecommunication giant was it with an order banning U.S. companies from selling components to the firm, the Journal reports . The U.S. Commerce Department directed companies to stop exporting to ZTE in mid-April, saying the Chinese company violated terms of a settlement resolving evasion of U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.\nJust call us guinea pigs. Even if you don’t drive a Tesla, you’re part of the company’s experiments in automotive safety, t he Journal’s Christopher Mims writes . More than 200,000 Teslas are on the road, and all of them built after 2015 are capable of semiautonomous driving. That makes all drivers, and anyone else on the road, guinea pigs helping to train the artificial intelligence Tesla hopes to use in a fully autonomous driving system.\nHSBC performs trade finance deal on blockchain. HSBC Holdings PLC said it performed the world’s first trade finance transaction using a single blockchain platform, Reuters reports . HSBC and ING Groep N.V. ADR completed a deal for Cargill last week when a shipment of soybeans was moved from Argentina to Malaysia. The transaction marked the use of a single, shared digital application instead of multiple systems, HSBC tells Reuters.\nAmazon teaches cities how to sell themselves . Many of the 20 cities shortlisted as sites for the retail giant’s second headquarters are using the multimedia presentations they created for Amazon.com Inc .’s application to pitch to other companies, WSJ’s Keiko Morris and Laura Stevens write .\nAT&T executive linked to Michael Cohen forced out . Bob Quinn, AT&T Inc. ’s top executive in Washington, is retiring after the company’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said it was a mistake to hire President Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen. The company told employees Friday in an internal memo that Mr. Quinn was retiring, but people familiar with the matter said the policy chief was forced to leave, the Journal’s Drew FitzGerald reports .\nTesla Executives Step Away. Matthew Schwall, who was the company’s main technical contact with U.S. safety investigators, left the company for rival self-driving car company Waymo LLC , the WSJ’s Tim Higgins and Sam Goldfarb report . His departure comes as the National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating multiple crashes involving Tesla vehicles. Mr. Schwall’s exit comes after Tesla said Friday that its engineering chief, Doug Field, was taking a leave of absence to recharge and spend time with his family.\nCisco pauses advertising on YouTube . The networking-gear giant Wednesday attacked the video service over concerns about its advertisements appearing alongside unsavory content, the Journal’s Jay Greene reports . Other companies to have pulled their ads from YouTube for the same reason include Procter & Gamble Co. , Coca-Cola Co. and Walmart Inc.\nRace to $1 trillion. Apple Inc. last week said its market capitalization topped $934 billion. But don’t count out Amazon.com Inc. from reaching the mark first, says Reuters . The e-commerce giant is a mere $150 billion behind Apple.\nHey, it’s me (Google). Technology critics raised ethical concerns last week after the search giant demoed an AI-powered voice assistant that spoke to a human on the phone without identifying itself as a bot. Google now says whatever shape the consumer product takes will have “disclosure built in,” the Verge reports .\nSprint, T-Mobile promise merger won’t repeat Nextel havoc. Customers are worried that the $26 billion deal to combine telecommunications companies Sprint and T-Mobile will interrupt cell phone service, as happened in 2005 when Sprint merged with Nextel Communications Inc. More than 10 million customers left that combined company during its eight-year integration effort, reports the Journal’s Drew FitzGerald .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nThe World Health Organization is pressing producers of trans fats to accelerate work to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths from heart disease each year. (WSJ)\nDrivers gearing up for trips this summer face escalating prices at the gasoline pump, an early sign that $70-a-barrel oil is starting to reach into consumers’ wallets.(WSJ)\nAfter three fairly wet years, a drought has descended on the southern Great Plains , one of the nation’s most fertile farming areas, affecting everything from cotton to cattle to farming-equipment sales.(WSJ)\nMore than a dozen technology companies from China are rushing to go public abroad , an enticing opportunity for investors but one that has generated poor returns recently.
