    "text": "BEIJING, May 4 (Reuters) - China raised with a visiting U.S. trade delegation the issue of a ban by the United States on its companies selling components and software to ZTE Corp for seven years, the Ministry of Commerce said on Friday.\nWashington imposed sanctions on ZTE last month for breaking an agreement to punish employees after the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecoms gear shipped U.S. goods to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\nZTE said the ban was unacceptable and threatened its survival.\nThe Commerce ministry said Chinese officials made solemn representations to the U.S. delegation that took part in bilateral trade negotiations in Beijing this week.\nU.S. officials said they attached great value to Chinaâ€™s representations and would report back to U.S. President Donald Trump on the matter, the ministry said.
