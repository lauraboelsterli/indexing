    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 7:34 AM / Updated an hour ago Italian stocks attempt comeback amid tepid European market Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - A modest recovery in Italian stocks failed to lift European equities more broadly in early trading on Wednesday, as investors mulled the possibility of fresh Italian elections as early as July. Traders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0722 GMT, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI rose 0.2 percent.\nLate on Tuesday sources said that Italy may hold repeat elections as early as July after the man asked to be prime minister failed to secure support from major political parties for even a stop-gap government.\nWorries over Italian politics and the country's future in the European Union have hit European stocks this week, with Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB .FTMIB touching its lowest level since July 2017 on Tuesday. Italian banks .FTIT8300, which dropped 4.7 percent in the previous session, rose 0.6 percent.\nThough Italy’s index recovered some ground with a 0.5 percent rise on Wednesday, Italian stocks are down 4 percent so far this week and have given up all of 2018’s gains.\nElsewhere concerns over U.S.-China trade relations also soured the mood after the U.S. said on Tuesday that it still holds the threat of imposing tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China.\nWhile the focus remained firmly on politics, shares in Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) were the biggest individual fallers, down 3.8 percent after its subsidiary Canal+ was left empty-handed in a crucial soccer broadcasting rights auction in France on Tuesday.
