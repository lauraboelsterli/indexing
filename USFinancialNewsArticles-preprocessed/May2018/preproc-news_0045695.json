    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 8:44 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago China regrets closing of door to U.S. after 'disinvited' from drill Reuters Staff 4 Min Read\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Defence Ministry expressed regret on Thursday after the United States withdrew an invitation to China to attend a major U.S.-hosted naval drill, saying that closing the door does not help promote mutual trust and cooperation. Chinese and U.S. flags are set up for a meeting during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao at China's Ministry of Transport in Beijing, China April 27, 2018. Picture taken April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee\nThe Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC and previously attended by China, is billed as the world’s largest international maritime exercise and held every two years in Hawaii in June and July.\nRIMPAC had enabled the armed forces of the world’s two largest economies to directly engage with each other and had been viewed by both countries as a way to lessen tensions and reduce the risk of miscalculation should the two meet under less friendly circumstances.\nThe Pentagon said the withdrawal of the invitation was in response to what it sees as Beijing’s militarisation of islands in the disputed South China Sea, a strategic waterway claimed in large part by Beijing.\nIn a brief statement, China’s Defence Ministry said that the United States had “ignored the facts and hyped up the so-called ‘militarisation’ of the South China Sea,” using it as an excuse to uninvite China.\n“This decision by the United States is not constructive. Closing the door to communication at any time is not conducive towards promoting mutual trust and communication between the Chinese and U.S. militaries,” it added.\nChina’s island-building programme in the South China Sea has sparked concern around the region and in Washington about Chinese intentions. China says it has every right to build what it calls necessary defensive facilities on its own territory.\nOver the weekend China’s air force landed bombers in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise, triggering concern from Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThe ministry reiterated that its building of defence facilities was to protect the country’s sovereignty and legitimate rights, and had nothing to do with militarisation.\n“The United States has no right to make irresponsible remarks about this,” it added.\n“Being invited or not cannot change China’s will to play a role in protecting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and cannot shake China’s firm determination to defend its sovereignty and security interests”.\nIt is in both countries interests to develop healthy military ties, and China hopes the United States keeps the broader picture in mind, abandon its “zero sum” mentality and appropriately handle disputes, the ministry said.\nPentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up and using South China Sea islands to gather intelligence in the region.\nChinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, “Cold War” terms.\nSpeaking at a separate briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China has sovereign rights in the South China Sea and it is not realistic for the United States to use this kind of action to try to coerce Beijing.\nThe United States has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is subject to various claims by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia.
