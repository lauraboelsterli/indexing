This 63.5% increase in closings, over the first quarter of last year, was a result of robust sales and a heightened focus on inventory management. In addition, gross margin increased 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and our average sales price for the quarter reached an all-time high at $224,296.”\n“Starting the second quarter with great momentum, we maintain our positive outlook on the remainder of 2018 and reaffirm our guidance. For the year, we expect to close between 6,000 and 7,000 homes, believe average sales price will be between $220,000 and $230,000, and believe basic EPS will be in the range of $6.00 to $7.00 per share,” Lipar concluded.\n2018 First Quarter Results\nHome closings during the first quarter of 2018 increased 63.5% to 1,244 from 761 during the first quarter of 2017. Active selling communities increased to 79 at the end of the first quarter of 2018, up from 69 communities at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\nHome sales revenues of 2018 were $279.0 million, an increase of $116.1 million, or 71.3% over the first quarter of 2017. The increase in home sales revenues is due to both the increase in the number of homes closed and an increase in the average home sales price.\nThe average home sales price was $224,296 of 2018, an increase of 4.8% over the first quarter of 2017. This increase is largely attributable to changes in product mix, price points in certain new markets, and a favorable pricing environment.\nGross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues of 2018 was 24.8% as compared to 26.7% of 2017. Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues of 2018 was 26.4% as compared to 28.0% of 2017. This decrease is primarily due to a combination of higher construction and lot costs partially offset by higher average home sales prices. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure.\nNet income of $27.3 million, or $1.23 per basic share and $1.10 per diluted share, of 2018 increased $15.5 million, or 131.8%, from $11.8 million of 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to the 63.5% increase in homes closed, the 4.8% increase in average home sales price, a 58.2% decrease in the effective tax rate and a decrease in operating leverage realized related to selling, general, and administrative expenses. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate of 12.6% was lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of the deductions in excess of compensation cost (“windfalls”) for share-based payments.\nOutlook\nSubject to the caveats in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this press release, the Company reaffirms the following guidance for 2018. The Company believes it will have between 85 and 90 active selling communities at the end of 2018, close between 6,000 and 7,000 homes in 2018, and generate basic EPS between $6.00 and $7.00 per share during 2018. In addition, the Company believes 2018 gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 24.0% and 26.0% and 2018 adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 25.5% and 27.5% with capitalized interest accounting for substantially all of the difference between gross margin and adjusted gross margin. The Company also believes that the average home sales price in 2018 will be between $220,000 and $230,000. This outlook assumes that general economic conditions, including interest rates and mortgage availability, and average home sales price, construction costs, availability of land, land development costs and overall absorption rates in the remainder of 2018 are similar to those in the first quarter of 2018. This guidance also assumes that no additional Convertible Notes are converted during 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 (the “Earnings Call”).

The Company defines adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact the Company’s results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of the Company’s operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that the Company does. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of the Company’s performance.\nThe following table reconciles adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) Home sales revenues $ 279,024 $ 162,911 Cost of sales 209,765 119,412 Gross margin 69,259 43,499 Capitalized interest charged to cost of sales 4,312 2,075 Purchase accounting adjustments (a) (3 ) 35 Adjusted gross margin $ 73,568 $ 45,609 Gross margin % (b) 24.8% 26.7% Adjusted gross margin % (b) 26.4% 28.0% Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates.\nCalculated as a percentage of home sales revenues.\nHome Sales Revenues and Closings by Division\n(Revenues in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) Revenues Closings ASP Revenues Closings ASP Central $ 107,498 521 $ 206,330 $ 64,918 315 $ 206,089 Southwest 54,283 197 275,548 33,126 132 250,955 Southeast 45,108 229 196,978 27,847 151 184,417 Florida 42,443 209 203,077 24,200 123 196,748 Northwest 29,692 88 337,409 12,820 40 320,500 Midwest — — — — — — Total home sales revenues $ 279,024 1,244 $ 224,296 $ 162,911 761 $ 214,075 CONTACT:\nInvestor Relations:\nCaitlin Stiles, (281) 210-2619\nInvestorRelations@LGIHomes.com\nSource:LGI Homes, Inc.",
