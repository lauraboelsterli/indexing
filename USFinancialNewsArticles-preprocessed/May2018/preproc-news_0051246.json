    "text": "Milwaukee third baseman Travis Shaw hit a three-run homer in a seven-run fourth inning and Jesus Aguilar had three RBIs and the Brewers possess the best record in the National League after a 9-2 victory over the skidding Arizona Diamondbacks at Miller Park on Wednesday afternoon.\nTyler Saladino had two hits and a homer, Aguilar had two hits and left-hander Brent Suter tied a season high with six strikeouts as the Brewers (31-19) won for the sixth time in seven games. All three of Saladino’s homers this season have come against Arizona.\nPaul Goldschmidt and John Ryan Murphy homered for the Diamondbacks, who have lost seven in a row and 13 of 14. Goldschmidt has eight homers and 21 RBIs in 23 career games at Miller Park.\nSuter (4-3) gave up two runs on four hits and two walks while winning his second straight start in the Brewers’ first home sweep of Arizona since 2008. Suter tied a season high with 5 2/3 innings, set in an 8-3 victory at Minnesota last Friday.\nThe Diamondbacks (25-24) scored four runs and had 10 hits in the three-game series, a franchise low for hits in a three-game set. They had 10 runs and 22 hits while losing five of six to Milwaukee in the season series, a major league record for fewest hits in a six-game season series. They had not been fewer than two games over .500 since opening the season 2-1.\nArizona right-hander Zack Godley (4-4) gave up eight runs (six earned) and seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked six. Godley has given up 15 earned runs and 15 walks in his last 21 1/3 innings over four starts.\nChristian Yelich doubled with one out in the first inning and Aguilar singled for a 1-0 lead.\nGoldschmidt hit his sixth homer of the season to lead off the second inning and Murphy hit his fifth with one out to give Arizona a 2-1 lead.\nJett Bandy singled to open the seven-run fourth and Suter was safe at first when first baseman Goldschmidt threw wildly first on a sacrifice bunt attempt. Yelich walked to load the bases with one out and Aguilar singled to drive in two for a 3-2 lead.\nShaw followed with a homer off the facing of the second deck in right field to make it 6-2. Domingo Santana doubled and Jonathan Villar walked before Fernando Salas replaced Godley. Saladino singled in one run, and a second scored on center fielder Chris Owings’ error.\nSaladino homered in the seventh to complete the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
