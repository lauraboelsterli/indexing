    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:UEPS) (JSE:NT1) today released results for the third quarter fiscal 2018.\nQ3 2018 revenue of $163 million, 10% higher in USD and Fundamental EPS of $0.95 (including $0.52 fair value adjustment related to Cell C investment);\nQ3 2018 cash flow from operations of $85.2 million;\nReiterate FY 2018 constant currency FEPS guidance of at least $1.61 per share, excluding any fair value adjustments.\nBased on recent public statements by the Minister for Social Development, the South African Post Office and SASSA, we look forward to being released from the social grants payment contract by the end of September 2018. This will allow us to refocus our considerable skills and experience in delivering commercially compelling services to the unbanked population of South Africa and in other emerging countries. Our organic growth developments, along with a number of new opportunities, will enhance the group’s future prospects as we close out on the social grants contract that has become a burden on the management and financial resources of the group. We believe that we are already the market leaders in terms of cost, scale and distribution in the provision of bank accounts, credit and insurance products in the market segments we serve, and we intend to further improve our product offering and our unmatched ability as the “last mile” service provider.\nSummary Financial Metrics Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change in USD % change in ZAR (All figures in USD ‘000s except per share data) Revenue 162,721 147,944 10 % (1 %) GAAP net income 3,009 18,392 (84 %) (85 %) Fundamental net income (1) 53,759 23,468 129 % 109 % GAAP earnings per share ($) 0.05 0.34 (84 %) (86 %) Fundamental earnings per share ($) (1) 0.95 0.43 121 % 101 % Fully-diluted shares outstanding (‘000’s) 56,777 54,808 4 % Average period USD/ ZAR exchange rate 11.95 13.22 (10 %)\nNine months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change in USD % change in ZAR (All figures in USD ‘000s except per share data) Revenue 463,695 455,010 2 % (5 %) GAAP net income 32,114 61,665 (48 %) (51 %) Fundamental net income (1) 100,656 71,859 40 % 30 % GAAP earnings per share ($) 0.57 1.15 (51 %) (55 %) Fundamental earnings per share ($) (1) 1.77 1.34 32 % 23 % Fully-diluted shares outstanding (‘000’s) 56,842 53,088 7 % Average period USD/ ZAR exchange rate 12.89 13.77 (6 %) (1) Fundamental net income and earnings per share are non-GAAP measures and are described below under “Use of Non-GAAP Measures—Fundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share.” See Attachment B for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to fundamental net income and earnings per share. Factors impacting comparability of our Q3 2018 and Q3 2017 results\nGrowth in insurance and lending businesses: Volume growth and operating efficiencies in our insurance and lending businesses during Q3 2018 resulted in an improved contribution to our financial inclusion revenue. However, operating income and operating margin during Q3 2018 was adversely impacted by investments to expand our financial services offering; Ongoing contributions from EasyPay Everywhere: EPE revenue and operating income growth was driven primarily by the further expansion of our customer base driven by our ATM infrastructure; Higher equity-accounted earnings related to DNI and Bank Frick: The acquisition of 49% of DNI and 35% of Bank Frick positively impacted our reported results by approximately $4.4 million, before amortization of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes; Favorable impact from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against South African Rand: The U.S. dollar depreciated by 10% against the ZAR and 8% against the KRW during Q3 2018, which positively impacted our reported results; Higher revenue from Masterpayment and severance payments: Masterpayment contributed higher revenues as a result of an increase in processing activities, particularly related to its crypto-currency processing launched in December 2017, which was offset by severance payments to two of its senior managers as a result of our mutual agreement to terminate their employment; Non-cash impairment loss related primarily to Masterpayment intangible assets: We recorded an impairment loss of $19.9 million related to Masterpayment and Masterpayment Financial Services goodwill; Indirect taxes refund in Korea: We received a refund of indirect taxes of approximately $2.5 million during Q3 2018 which positively impacted our reported results; Regulatory changes in South Korea pertaining to fees on card transactions: The impact of changes to regulations governing the fees that may be charged on card transactions continues to adversely impact our revenues and operating income in South Korea as all parties in the payment process adapt to the new laws and renegotiate their respective positions in the marketplace; Lower net interest income resulting from strategic investments: Interest income was $1.8 million lower due to cash utilized for strategic investments. Interest expense increased due to the South African lending facility we obtained in August 2017 and March 2018 to partially fund our investments.\n“After years of uncertainty and litigation relating to the social services contract held by our subsidiary CPS, we now appear to have more clarity and are likely to be relieved of our constitutional obligations by September 2018, allowing us to dedicate all our energies, resources, products and distribution towards our strategy of providing financial inclusion services in South Africa and internationally,” said Herman Kotzé, CEO of Net1. “We planned appropriately for this eventuality, and the strides we have made and traction we have already gained, give us increased confidence that Net1 has never been better positioned to return to being a sustainable and profitable growth company on an international scale,” he concluded.\n“For fiscal 2018, we anticipate our fundamental earnings per share to remain at least $1.61 per share excluding any fair value adjustments and in excess of $2.00 per share including fair value adjustments,” said Alex Smith, CFO of Net1. “Our guidance assumes a constant currency base of ZAR 13.62/$1, a share count of 56.6 million shares, and a tax rate of between 34%-36%. For clarity, our guidance as always is on a constant currency basis,” he concluded.\nIncrease in Cell C carrying value\nWe have included the fair value adjustment in respect of our Cell C investment within fundamental earnings per share (under the line item “net unrealized income on asset available for sale, net of tax” on Attachment B) as we believe that the return on this significant investment made by the company needs to be factored into an assessment of our overall performance. The uplift in the fair value reflected in the Q3 results reflects the improving operational performance of Cell C during the period since our investment. On top of this investment return we are also starting to see the introduction of new product sets developed through collaboration between Cell C and Net 1 which should contribute to our operational performance in future periods. We will continue to provide guidance on fundamental earnings per share excluding the fair value adjustments.\nSupplemental Presentation for Q3 2018 Results\nA supplemental presentation for Q3 2018 will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website – ir.net1.com one hour prior to our earnings call on Friday, May 11, 2018.\nResults of Operations by Segment and Liquidity\nOur operating metrics will be updated and posted on our website ( www.net1.com ).\nSouth African transaction processing\nSegment revenue was $73.5 million in Q3 2018, up 15% compared with Q3 2017 in USD, and 4% higher on a constant currency basis. The increase in segment revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the number of EPE accounts as well as higher transaction revenue as a result of increased usage of our ATMs. Operating income decreased however, primarily due to an increase in inter-segment charges, the impact of annual salary increases granted to our South African employees in October 2017, increases in goods and services purchased from third parties and declining profitability at CPS given the fact that its monthly fee per grant recipient has been fixed for the last six years. Our operating income margin for Q3 2018 and 2017 was 17% and 24%, respectively.\nInternational transaction processing\nSegment revenue of $46.2 million grew modestly during Q3 2018 compared with Q3 2017, due to an increase in processing activities, particularly related to Masterpayment’s crypto-currency processing launched in December 2017. Operating income during Q3 2018 was adversely impacted by the impairment loss, lower operating income generated in Korea as a result of the impact on us of changes to regulations governing the fees that may be charged on card transactions and severance payments to Masterpayment managers, partially offset by an ad hoc refund of indirect taxes of $2.5 million in Korea. Operating (loss) income margin for Q3 2018 and 2017 was (32%) and 5%, respectively. Excluding the Masterpayment impairment and the refund of indirect taxes, segment operating income and margin were $2.4 million and 5% respectively.\nFinancial inclusion and applied technologies\nSegment revenue was $59.6 million in Q3 2018, up 5% compared with Q3 2017 in USD and down 5% on a constant currency basis. Financial inclusion and applied technologies revenue decreased primarily due to fewer prepaid airtime and other value added services sales, partially offset by increased volumes in our insurance and lending businesses, and an increase in inter-segment revenues. Operating income was also impacted by these factors as well as an increase in the allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable resulting from a commensurate increase in our lending book.\nOperating income margin for the Financial inclusion and applied technologies segment was stable at 25% during each of Q3 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was impacted by fewer low margin prepaid product sales, improved revenues from our insurance businesses and an increase in inter-segment revenues, offset by annual salary increases granted to our South African employees.\nCorporate/eliminations\nOur corporate expenses have decreased primarily due to lower transaction-related expenditures and lower executive compensation, which was partially offset by a modest increase in ZAR denominated goods and services purchased from third parties and directors’ fees.\nCash flow and liquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $87.2 million and comprised mainly ZAR-denominated balances of ZAR 528.3 million ($44.7 million), KRW-denominated balances of KRW 32.7 billion ($30.8 million), U.S. dollar-denominated balances of $4.7 million, and other currency deposits, primarily Botswana pula, of $7.0 million, all amounts translated at exchange rates applicable as of March 31, 2018. The decrease in our cash balances from June 30, 2017, was primarily due to our investments in DNI, Bank Frick, Cell C and a $9.0 million listed note, scheduled repayments of our South African long-term debt, unscheduled repayment of Korean debt in full, growth in our South African lending book, and capital expenditures, which were partially offset by cash generated by most of our core businesses.\nExcluding the impact of interest received, interest paid under our Korean and South Africa debt and taxes, the increase in operating cash flow relates primarily to the receipt of certain working capital loans outstanding, offset partially by the expansion of our South African lending book and weaker trading activity. Capital expenditures for Q3 2018 and 2017 were $4.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and increased primarily due to the acquisition of data processing computer equipment and payment processing terminals in Korea and ATMs in South Africa. We also paid approximately $11.1 million for an additional 5% interest in Bank Frick, provided a $10.6 million (ZAR 126.0 million) loan to DNI and paid $7.5 million (ZAR 89.3 million) for an additional 4% interest in DNI. Finally, we made a scheduled South African debt facility payment of $17.7 million (ZAR 187.5 million) and also utilized this facility to fund our additional investment in DNI. We also utilized $9.8 million of our overdraft facilities and repaid $42.6 million of our European facilities.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nUS securities laws require that when we publish any non-GAAP measures, we disclose the reason for using the non-GAAP measure and provide reconciliation to the directly comparable GAAP measure. The presentation of fundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share and headline earnings per share are non-GAAP measures.\nFundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share\nFundamental net income and earnings per share is GAAP net income and earnings per share adjusted for the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (net of deferred taxes), the amortization of intangible assets (net of deferred taxes) related to equity-accounted investments, stock-based compensation charges (reversals), the amortization of South African and Korean debt facility fees and unusual non-recurring items, including costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued.\nFundamental net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2018 also includes the Cell C fair value adjustment (net unrealized income on asset available for sale, net of tax), as well as adjustments for an impairment loss, an allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables, refund of indirect taxes in Korea, the impact of changes in tax laws in the U.S and a gain realized on the sale of XeoHealth. Fundamental net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2017 also includes adjustments for a refund (net of taxes) related to Korean industry-wide litigation and US government investigations-related expenses.\nManagement believes that the fundamental net income and earnings per share metric enhances its own evaluation, as well as an investor’s understanding, of our financial performance. Attachment B presents the reconciliation between GAAP and fundamental net income and earnings per share.\nWe provide earnings guidance only on a non-GAAP basis and do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking fundamental earnings per share guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material.\nHeadline earnings per share (“HEPS”)\nThe inclusion of HEPS in this press release is a requirement of our listing on the JSE. HEPS basic and diluted is calculated using net income which has been determined based on GAAP. Accordingly, this may differ to the headline earnings per share calculation of other companies listed on the JSE as these companies may report their financial results under a different financial reporting framework, including but not limited to, International Financial Reporting Standards.\nHEPS basic and diluted is calculated as GAAP net income adjusted for the impairment loss and (profit) loss on sale of property, plant and equipment. Attachment C presents the reconciliation between our net income used to calculate earnings per share basic and diluted and HEPS basic and diluted and the calculation of the denominator for headline diluted earnings per share.\nConference Call\nWe will host a conference call to review these results on May 11, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
