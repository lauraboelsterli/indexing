Cognitive traits evaluated include: problem-solving, mental flexibility, learning agility, attention, creativity, and quantitative aptitude.\nCandidates can rapidly demonstrate their competencies and personality traits within a highly engaging experience. Instead of simply uploading resumes and filling out online forms, candidates can answer some job-relevant questions and play a set of scientific mini-games to more effectively show their range of professional and cognitive strengths.\n\"The MindX team has been working rigorously to enable companies to hire the best talent for the job using cognitive science in combination with technology,\" said Clemens Aichholzer, founder and CEO at MindX. \"We're thrilled to be teaming up with HireVue at a time of rapid global expansion.
