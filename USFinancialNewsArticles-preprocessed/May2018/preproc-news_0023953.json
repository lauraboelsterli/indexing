FILE PHOTO: Athletics - London Marathon - London, Britain - April 22, 2018 General view outside Buckingham Palace during the London Marathon REUTERS/Andrew Boyers\nThe final total of 414,168 applicants from Britain and overseas represents a 7.3 percent increase on last year’s 386,050 bidding for a place at the world’s most popular marathon.\nJust under 55 percent of British entrants have never participated in a marathon and for a second consecutive year, the majority of those are women.\n“One of our goals is to inspire people to take up sport, and it’s fantastic that more than 190,000 people from the UK have been inspired to apply to run a marathon for the first time in 2019,” event director Hugh Brasher said in a statement.\nEntrants will be notified of the result of the ballot in October.\nThe marathon is on April 28, 2019.
