    "text": "NANJING, China, Ever-Glory International Group, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Ever-Glory\") (NASDAQ: EVK), a retailer of branded fashion apparel and a leading global apparel supply chain solution provider, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMr. Yihua Kang, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ever-Glory, said, \"We are pleased to start 2018 with solid first quarter results, highlighted by 18.9% year-over-year increase in retail sales as our strong execution on the overall strategy which focuses on operational improvements. Specifically, La go go achieved outstanding performance with innovative and distinctive designs that stand for exceptional styling, quality and value.\"\n\"Heading into 2018, we remained our focus on driving retail business through store network optimization strategy, as well as inventory management strategy,\" Mr. Kang continued. \"Following the remodeling or relocation of 40 stores during the first quarter, we operated a nationwide network of 1,409 stores as of March 31, 2018.\"\n\"Looking at our wholesale business, we maintained focus on upgrading customer portfolio to reduce credit risk and improve margin in the light of weak micro environment. Our wholesale gross margin continued to improve on a year-over-year basis despite decrease in sales. Going forward, we'll implement a stricter client evaluation system and remain diligent in account receivables collection. We believe the enduring strength of our wholesale business will support its long-term profitability.\" concluded Mr. Kang.\nMr. Jason Jiansong Wang, Chief Financial Officer of Ever-Glory, added, \"We're delighted to see that our operating efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter. Overall gross margin increased by 30 basis points, with wholesale gross margin increasing by 70 basis points, compared with the same period of last year. With strengthened fundamentals and improved operating leverage of our overall business, we are excited about the opportunities that lay before us and we look forward to updating you with our progress next quarter.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $92.8 million, an increase of 9.0% from $85.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an 18.9% increase in our retail business, partially offset by a 10.8% decrease in wholesale business.\nSales for the Company's branded fashion apparel retail division increased by 18.9% to $67.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $56.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in same-store sales. The Company had 1,409 retail stores as of March 31, 2018, compared with 1,369 retail stores as of March 31, 2017.\nSales for the Company's wholesale division decreased by 10.8% to $25.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $28.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales in Mainland China, Germany, the United Kingdom, other European markets and Hong Kong, partially offset for increased sales in the United States and Japan.\nTotal gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 9.9% to $31.3 million, compared with $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Total gross margin increased to 33.8% from 33.5% for the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the retail business increased by 15.0% to $25.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $22.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 37.8%, compared to 39.1% for the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the wholesale business decreased by 7.9% to $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin increased to 23.0% from 22.3% for the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 12.6% to $22.2 million, or 24.0% of total sales, compared with $19.7 million, or 23.2% of total sales for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was attributable to the increased store decoration and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 5.8% to $7.7 million, or 8.3% of total sales, compared with $7.3 million, or 8.5% of total sales for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to the increased average salaries.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 4.2% to $1.4 million compared with $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.8 million compared with 1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.06 for the first quarter of 2018 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.07 for the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, Ever-Glory had approximately $65.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared with approximately $62.9 million as of December 31, 2017.
