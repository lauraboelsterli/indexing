    "text": "Roadshow LA Peloton CEO John Foley says fitness company is 'weirdly profitable' Peloton co-founder and CEO John Foley told CNBC the fitness, technology and media company is more than doubling its size every year. Foley said Peloton is considering going public, but nothing is planned yet. Competitor SoulCycle filed for an IPO in 2015 but still hasn't gone public. 5 Hours Ago | 06:00\nPeloton CEO and co-founder John Foley told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday that the company is \"weirdly profitable.\"\n\"It's a beautiful business model. Our investors are happy,\" said Foley, whose company was ranked No. 20 on CNBC's 2018 Disruptor 50 list. Meet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies\nFoley said it's not weird to him that Peloton is profitable, rather it's unusual for a four-year-old company to already be making money. He describes Peloton as a fitness, technology and media company. It was founded in 2012 and sold its first spinning bike in 2014.\nThe company is more than doubling the size of the company every year, Foley told CNBC.\nPeloton sells $2,000 spinning bikes that are equipped with a screen to stream recorded and live classes that are filmed from its New York-based studio. Subscriptions to access them cost $39 a month.\nMore from CNBC Disruptor 50:",
