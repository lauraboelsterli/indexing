    "text": "LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, said on Tuesday it will close its non-food website Tesco Direct, having concluded it could not make the loss-making business profitable.\nThe group said Tesco Direct will cease trading on July 9 and, as part of this, the intention is to close the distribution centre which handles the website’s orders.\nIt said the decision means 500 workers across the business will be at risk of redundancy.
