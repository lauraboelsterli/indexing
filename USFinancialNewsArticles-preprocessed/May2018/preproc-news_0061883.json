REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo\nFried, a non-executive director at the court for six years, will replace Anthony Habgood with effect from July 1.\n“Anthony overhauled the Bank’s governance and improved the workings and transparency of Court, leaving behind him a body that is well positioned to guide the Bank for years to come,” Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in a statement.\nFried is a co-founder of Grovepoint, a private equity firm, before which he was chief executive of Investec Bank.
