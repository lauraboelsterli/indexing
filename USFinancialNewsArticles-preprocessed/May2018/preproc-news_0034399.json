    "text": "197 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—First lady Melania Trump on Monday underwent a medical procedure to treat a benign kidney condition, the White House said.\nThe embolization procedure was successful and was carried out without complications, the White House said. Mrs. Trump, 48 years old, is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is likely to remain there the rest of the week, the White House said.\n“The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,” the White House said.\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday afternoon he was headed to the Bethesda, Md., medical center to see Mrs. Trump. “Successful procedure, she is in good spirits,” he tweeted . “Thank you to all of the well-wishers!”\nLast week, Mrs. Trump rolled out her “Be Best” program, which aims to protect children from cyberbullying and drugs.\nAn embolization of a kidney isn’t uncommon, said Brian Funaki, chief of vascular and interventional radiology at the University of Chicago Medical Center. He said the idea is to block off blood flow to a kidney growth that can either be benign or cancerous, although the procedure is more often used with benign growths. Doctors go in with a catheter and block off vessels with coils or other particles, with the intention of shrinking the growth to reduce the likelihood of symptoms such as bleeding or pain.\nFurther details about Mrs. Trump’s condition and treatment weren’t immediately disclosed.",
