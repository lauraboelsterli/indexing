    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 5:49 AM / Updated 22 minutes ago Munich Re sees 2018 profit at upper end of targeted range Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Munich Re ( MUVGn.DE ), the world’s largest reinsurer, said on Tuesday it expected its 2018 profit to come near the upper end of its target range after posting a 48 percent jump in first-quarter profit. FILE PHOTO: The company logo of German reinsurer Munich Re is seen before the company's annual news conference in Munich, Germany, March 16, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo\nMunich Re has posted declines in profit over the past five years but is counting on a reversal in fortune this year.\nIt stuck to its broader guidance for 2018 consolidated net profit of 2.1 to 2.5 billion euros ($2.50-2.98 bln), but in a call with journalists, finance chief Joerg Schneider said he was “very confident that profit would land at least the upper end of the range”.\nThat more optimistic outlook followed an increase in first-quarter net profit to 827 million euros, from 557 million during the same period last year, as the company bounces back from record payouts for natural disasters in 2017.\nLast year, Munich Re eked out a small profit after a spate of hurricanes and other natural catastrophes in North America prompted record claims to insurers across the industry.\nMajor losses in the first quarter totalled 62 million euros, down from 403 million a year ago. “It was thus significantly below our major-loss projection,” Munich Re said.\nPrices that reinsurers can charge customers have been under pressure for years amid intense competition. Last year’s natural catastrophes have helped put a floor on prices.\nMunich Re said that prices increased 0.8 percent during the April period of contract renewals.
