Starting in 2018, when Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) was adopted, our comparable store sales refer to period-over-period comparisons of our net sales based on when the customer obtains control of their product, which is typically at the time of sale and may be slightly different than our historically reported net sales due to timing of when final delivery of the product has occurred. A store is included in the comparable store sales calculation on the first day of the thirteenth full fiscal month following a store’s opening, which is when we believe comparability has been achieved. Since our e-commerce sales are fulfilled by individual stores, they are included in comparable store sales only to the extent the fulfilling store meets the above mentioned store criteria. Changes in our comparable store sales between two periods are based on net sales for stores that were in operation during both of the two periods. Any change in square footage of an existing comparable store, including remodels and relocations, does not eliminate that store from inclusion in the calculation of comparable store sales. Stores that are closed temporarily and relocated within their primary trade areas are included in same store sales. Additionally, any stores that were closed during the current or prior fiscal year are excluded from the definition of comparable stores.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (which are shown in the reconciliations below) have been presented in this earnings release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We define Adjusted net income as net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance and the tax effect related to those items. We define Adjusted diluted EPS as Adjusted net income divided by Adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding (i.e., the weighted average shares outstanding during the relevant period plus the weighted average impact of issuing shares in our initial public offering (our “IPO”). We define EBITDA as net income before interest, loss on early extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, loss on early extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are set forth in the tables below.\nAdjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance and enterprise value. We believe that Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures, as they eliminate certain items that are not indicative of our core operating performance and facilitate a comparison of our core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine covenant compliance with respect to our credit facilities, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as performance measures to evaluate companies in our industry.\nAdjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or diluted EPS as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for management's discretionary use. In addition, these non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring and other charges. Each of these non-GAAP measures has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In evaluating Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, such as stock compensation expense, loss on asset disposal, and other adjustments. Our presentation of Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in the retail industry, and therefore Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies.\nPlease see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFloor & Decor Holdings, Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this release, including statements regarding the Company’s future operating results and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company’s business, the economy and other future conditions, including the impact of recent natural disasters on sales.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “seeks,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “budget,” “potential,” “focused on” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this release are only predictions. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements in this release are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future events, results, performance or achievements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this release or the associated webcast/conference call, including, without limitation, those factors described in “Risk Factors,” “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Business” sections and elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements contained in this release or the associated webcast/conference call speak only as of the date hereof. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict those events or how they may affect the Company. If a change to the events and circumstances reflected in the Company’s forward-looking statements occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results may vary materially from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, the Company does not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein or in the associated webcast/conference call, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise, including the Company’s estimated net sales, comparable store sales growth, diluted EPS, diluted weighted average shares outstanding, Adjusted EBITDA, warehouse format store count and new warehouse format stores for both the thirteen weeks ended June 28, 2018 and all of fiscal 2018 and with respect to the Company’s estimated depreciation and amortization expenses, interest expense, tax rate and capital expenditures for fiscal 2018.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005463/en/\nInvestor Contacts:\nFloor & Decor Holdings, Inc.\nMatthew McConnell\n770-257-1374\nInvestorRelations@flooranddecor.com\nor\nICR, Inc.\nFarah Soi/Rachel Schacter\n203-682-8200\nInvestorRelations@flooranddecor.com\nSource: Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc.",
