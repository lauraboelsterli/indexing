    "text": "MARRAKECH (Reuters) - In his home in Marrakech, artist Lahcen Iwi brings out a cutter and gets to work, slicing up squares of used tires to craft his sculptures.\nFrom dragons to unicorns, Iwi creates his artwork out of tires he collects from landfill sites and scrapyards.\nThe Moroccan artist believes that there is something noble in recycling tires, “injecting art” into an object that would otherwise be harmful to the environment.\n“It is a good message for humanity,” he said.\nA single sculpture can take Iwi anything from a week to two months to make.\nHe sells his art and previous works have gone on display in exhibitions in France.\nWriting by Hend Kortam; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
