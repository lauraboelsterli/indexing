A trader works at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.2 percent by 0713 GMT, hovering around its highest level since early February, while Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB fell 0.8 percent.\nItalian banks .FTIT8300, which are seen as a proxy for political risk in the country due to their government bond holdings, fell as much as 1.1 percent as borrowing costs rose after a report that Italy’s 5-Star and League plan to ask the ECB to forgive 250 billion euros of Italian debt.\nTop gainers on the STOXX were Britain’s leading software company Micro Focus International ( MCRO.L ) and French manufacturing group Alstom ( ALSO.PA ), up 5 and 6 percent respectively following their trading updates.\nElior ( ELIOR.PA ), however, fell 15 percent following a profit warning.
