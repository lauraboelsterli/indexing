(NYSE: VG), a business cloud communications leader, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nConsolidated Results\n\"We are proud of our strong first quarter financial results and the progress we are making transforming Vonage into a cloud communications leader,\" said Vonage CEO Alan Masarek. \"We believe that communications is key to driving business transformation. Our unique platform strategy of combining unified communications and embedded communications is delivering better business outcomes to our customers by linking employee and customer communications seamlessly into company workflows.\"\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Vonage reported revenues of $254 million, a 4% increase from the year ago quarter. Income from Operations was $18 million, up from $5 million in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted OIBDA\") 1 was $42 million, up from $37 million in the prior year. GAAP net income was $25 million or $0.11 per share, up from $6 million or $0.03 per share in the year ago quarter. Adjusted net income 2 was $31 million or $0.13 per share, up from $15 million or $0.07 per share in the year ago quarter.\nBusiness Segment Results and Highlights\nVonage Business total revenues were $137 million, representing 54% of total consolidated revenues and 22% GAAP growth.\nUCaaS revenues were $95 million, of which $74 million were service revenues.

Launched a new comprehensive channel program to accelerate adoption of business cloud communications in mid-market and enterprise segments. Announced Vee, a virtual assistant chatbot enabling Vonage Business Cloud users to streamline managing account services via simple, natural language text commands.\nThe Company created new Vonage Business KPIs to better reflect how it manages its UCaaS and Nexmo products on a combined basis. The new KPIs are:\nService Revenue per Customer, which includes UCaaS and Nexmo products. The Company is providing this metric to enable investors to track Vonage's \"land and expand\" strategy and its move to the mid-market and Enterprise. Service revenue per customer in the first quarter of 2018 was $328, a 3% year-over-year increase. Business Churn, which measures revenue churn on a combined basis, was 1.2% in the first quarter of 2018, consistent with the year ago quarter.\nConsumer Segment Results and Highlights\nConsumer revenues were $117 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $132 million in the prior year, a decline of 11%.

For more information, visit www.vonage.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by Regulation G adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, including: adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (\"adjusted OIBDA\"), adjusted OIBDA less Capex, adjusted net income, net debt (cash), free cash flow and adjusted revenues.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nVonage uses adjusted OIBDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of its business.\nVonage defines adjusted OIBDA as GAAP income (loss) from operations excluding depreciation and amortization, share-based expense, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, change in contingent consideration, acquisition related consideration accounted for as compensation, organizational transformation costs and loss on sublease.\nVonage believes that adjusted OIBDA permits a comparative assessment of its operating performance, relative to its performance based on its GAAP results, while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance; of share-based expense, which is a non-cash expense that also varies from period to period; of one-time acquisition related transaction and integration costs, acquisition related consideration accounted for as compensation and change in contingent consideration, organizational transformation costs and loss on sublease.\nThe Company provides information relating to its adjusted OIBDA so that investors have the same data that the Company employs in assessing its overall operations. The Company believes that trends in its Adjusted OIBDA are valuable indicators of the operating performance of the Company on a consolidated basis.\nThe Company does not reconcile its forward-looking adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measure of income from operations due to the significant variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts with respect to the various expenses we exclude, as they may be significantly impacted by future events the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict or are not within the control of management. As such, the Company has determined that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\nAdjusted OIBDA less Capex\nVonage uses adjusted OIBDA less Capex as an indicator of the operating performance of its business. The Company provides information relating to its adjusted OIBDA less Capex so that investors have the same data that the Company employs in assessing its overall operations. The Company believes that trends in its Adjusted OIBDA less Capex are valuable indicators of the operating performance of the Company on a consolidated basis because they provide our investors with insight into current performance and period-to-period performance.\nAdjusted net income\nVonage defines adjusted net income, as GAAP net income (loss) excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition related transaction and integration costs, change in contingent consideration, acquisition related consideration accounted for as compensation, loss on sublease and tax effect on adjusting items.\nThe Company believes that excluding these items will assist investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance and in better understanding its results of operations as amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is a non-cash item, one-time acquisition related transaction and integration costs, change in contingent consideration, acquisition related consideration accounted for as compensation, loss on sublease and tax effect on adjusting items are not reflective of operating performance.\nNet debt (cash)\nVonage defines net debt (cash) as the current maturities of capital lease obligations, current portion of notes payable, notes payable and indebtedness under revolving credit facility, net of current maturities and debt related costs, and capital lease obligations, net of current maturities, less unrestricted cash and marketable securities.\nVonage uses net debt (cash) as a measure of assessing leverage, as it reflects the gross debt under the Company's credit agreements and capital leases less cash available to repay such amounts. The Company believes that net cash is also a factor that first parties consider in valuing the Company.\nFree cash flow\nVonage defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, purchase of intangible assets, and acquisition and development of software assets.\nVonage considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of equipment and software, can be used by Vonage for debt service and strategic opportunities. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used by Vonage may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\nAdjusted Revenues\nVonage uses adjusted Business revenues to illustrate the impact of one-time items for UCaaS and CPaaS revenues.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about acquisitions, acquisition integration, growth priorities or plans, revenues, adjusted OIBDA, churn, seats, lines or accounts, average revenue per user, cost of telephony services, the Company's share repurchase plan, capital expenditures, new products and related investment, and other statements that are not historical facts or information, that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
