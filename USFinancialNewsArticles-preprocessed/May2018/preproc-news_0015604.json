FILE PHOTO: Joaquim Barbosa, former Chief Justice in Brazil, is seen before a meeting with PSB Election Commission in Brasilia, Brazil April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\nJoaquim Barbosa, the first and only black member of Brazil’s high court, was considered a strong center-left contender. He wrote on his verified Twitter account that the decision was “strictly personal.” Last month, top members of the Brazilian Socialist Party, which Barbosa joined, gushed about the prospect of his running.
