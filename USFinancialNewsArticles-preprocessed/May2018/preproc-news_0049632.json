    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 5:54 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Penpix of the top men's contenders for the French Open Reuters Staff 4 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Penpix of the top men’s contenders at the 2018 French Open: FILE PHOTO: Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 11, 2017 General view during the men's final. Picture taken June 11, 2017. Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\nRafa Nadal (Spain)\nWorld ranking: 1\nBorn: June 3, 1986 (Age 31)\nGrand Slam titles: 16 (Australian Open 2009; French Open 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017; Wimbledon 2008, 2010; U.S. Open 2010, 2013, 2017)\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017)\n2018 ATP match record: 23-2\n2018 ATP titles: 3\nBiggest weapon: Nadal’s trademark whipped topspin forehand can bully the best opponent. Its fizzing bounce means he can control the court like no other player on clay. His left-handed serve is also potent and his backhand is better than ever. Add in amazing movement and fight and he is the complete package.\nBiggest weakness: Tough to find a weakness in a man who has lost two matches out of 81 at Roland Garros. His body occasionally betrays the years of battles though.\nAlexander Zverev (Germany)\nBorn: April 20, 1998 (Age 21)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nBest Roland Garros performance: Third round (2016)\n2018 ATP match record: 30-8\n2018 ATP titles: 2\nBiggest weapon: One of the cleanest strikers of the ball among the younger generation with his double-handed backhand being one of the best shots in tennis. Zverev has oodles of talent and is being touted as a future world number one.\nBiggest weakness: Lack of experience on the biggest stage and a curiously disappointing record at the slams where the weight of expectation has occasionally proved too much.\nDominic Thiem (Austria)\nBorn: Sept. 3, 1993 (Age 24)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nBest Roland Garros performance: Semi-finals (2016, 2017)\n2018 ATP match record: 25-8 (not including Lyon Open)\n2018 ATP titles: 1\nBiggest weapon: Thiem’s single-handed backhand is his most destructive shot but he is equally comfortable on both wings. His all-round game makes him a threat on clay and Roland Garros represents his best chance of winning a Grand Slam title.\nBiggest weakness: His decision making has been suspect on occasion and he has been known to crack under pressure.\nNovak Djokovic (Serbia)\nWorld ranking: 22\nBorn: May 22, 1987 (Age 31)\nGrand Slam titles: 12 (Australian Open 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016; French Open 2016; Wimbledon 2011, 2014, 2015, US Open 2011, 2015)\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2016)\n2018 ATP match record: 10-7\n2018 ATP titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: The Serb’s surgical accuracy from the baseline has been his trademark, as has his almost superhuman ability to reach balls that would evade any other player.\nBiggest weakness: Djokovic’s serve has come under the microscope on occasion and it will be interesting to see how it holds up after elbow surgery.\nMarin Cilic (Croatia)\nBorn: Sept. 28, 1988 (Age 29)\nGrand Slam titles: 1 (U.S. Open 2014)\nBest Roland Garros performance: Quarter-finals (2017)\n2018 ATP match record: 18-8\n2018 ATP titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: Experience. The Croat rarely gets ruffled and packs a mean punch from the baseline. He also boasts a booming serve that can act as a get out of jail free card.\nBiggest weakness: Court coverage. While good for a big man, Cilic is not the most graceful mover which is why clay causes him more problems than other surfaces.\nGrigor Dimitrov (Bulgaria)\nBorn: May 16, 1991 (Age 27)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nBest Roland Garros performance: Third round (2013, 2017)\n2018 ATP match record: 16-10\n2018 ATP titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: His ability to switch gears rapidly during points to turn defence into attack. Has all the shots in the book and his backhand slice is much improved.\nBiggest weakness: No technical weaknesses but lacks focus at times and his game plan can sometimes be found wanting.
