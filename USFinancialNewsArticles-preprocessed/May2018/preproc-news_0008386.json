Soccer Football - Scottish Premiership - Celtic v Rangers - Celtic Park, Glasgow, Britain - April 29, 2018 Rangers manager Graeme Murty Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nThe 43-year-old was handed the job in December until the end of the campaign following the dismissal of Pedro Caixinha.\nBritish media reported this week that Rangers have held talks with former Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard about taking on the task of reviving the fortunes of the record 54-times Scottish champions.\nThey failed to mount a serious title challenge this season and were thrashed 5-0 on Sunday by arch-rivals Celtic, who sealed their seventh successive Scottish league crown.\n\"Graeme has had to contend with difficult and challenging circumstances but conducted himself in a thoroughly professional manner. He will take some time to consider his options, which include returning to his role at the Rangers Academy,\" Rangers said in a statement on their website rangers.co.uk .\nThe 37-year-old Gerrard has been coaching Liverpoolâ€™s development squad since retiring as a player in 2016 and has stated his desire to become a manager.\nAssistant coaches Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson will take charge of Rangers, who are third in the table, for the rest of the season.
