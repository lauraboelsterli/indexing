Photo: Kim S. Nash / The Wall Street Journal MAYFIELD, OHIO — Before software developers at Progressive Corp. wrote a line of code last year to build a chatbot version of Flo, the insurer’s quirky character in the white apron, they spent a few days at a conference center discussing how to render in algorithms a mascot that has represented Progressive for a decade.\nA jokey persona might work on TV but could deter business online, where customer attention can flit away in seconds, says Dan Witalec, Progressive’s personal lines direct acquisition leader. A bot can entertain but ultimately it must propel business, he says. “We’re trying to sell insurance.”\nMore In Chatbots The Morning Download: Artificial Intelligence Transforms the Sales Process The Morning Download: Daimler Financial CIO Explores Ever-More Lifelike Chatbots ‘ “I live on the internet. So many cat pictures…I love it.” ’\n—Eno, Capital One Financial's chatbot At Capital One Financial Corp., a team of software engineers, developers and designers, including a character-development expert from Disney’s Pixar, worked for about a year to create a gender-neutral, empathetic, witty chatbot named Eno. The bot can check account balances, make credit-card payments and do other tasks.\nAlso, it can banter. Ask Eno where it lives and it will reply, “I live on the internet. So many cat pictures…I love it.”\nBots that bring “humanity” to banking, rather than simply convey data, are a competitive advantage, Chief Information Officer Rob Alexander says. “The winners in banking are going to be great technology companies that are able to … bring banking to customers in ways that really appeal to them,” he said.\nAt Progressive, employees are immersed in Flo at the headquarters campus here outside Cleveland. Flo-themed art hangs on walls and Flo bobble-heads nod on desks. Tchotchke is one thing. Creating a software bot to talk to customers about insurance means Progressive programmers must understand the character that has become synonymous with the brand, says Chief Marketing Officer Jeff Charney.\n“She personifies us. We personify her,” he says. The company declines to say how many people have used Flo the bot since it launched on Facebook Messenger last October.\nProgressive's Flo bot can recognize some categories of words outside of insurance jargon but is oblivious to others, helpful for avoiding a reputation-damaging encounter. Photo: Kim S. Nash / The Wall Street Journal\nGetting the bot right is critical for Progressive: Ten times as many people follow Flo on Facebook than follow the company itself — 4.7 million to 475,000. Even her silhouette is better recognized than Progressive’s blue capital P logo, the company’s own surveys show.\nMatt White, manager, PL acquisition experience, says the company decided to limit Flo’s AI smarts. The bot can recognize some categories of words outside of insurance jargon but is oblivious to others. Many corporate customer service bots are built the same way to avoid a reputation-damaging encounter.\nAsk Flo a potentially controversial question – Hillary or Trump? – and the answer is, “Rats. I’m having trouble understanding what you mean. Can you try again?”\nSo far, the only full business transaction that Flo the bot can conduct is to provide a car insurance quote. Asked to file a claim or sell a policy, the bot acknowledges that it understands the request and then offers buttons that link to an agent or Progressive’s more-functional website. “There are limits to this technology,” says Mr. Witalec. “We have to design off-ramps.”\nShare this: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAPITAL ONE CHATBOTS PROGRESSIVE ROB ALEXANDER Previous The Morning Download: Microsoft, Google Reveal AI Efforts to Go 'Full Duplex' Next The Morning Download: Chatbots Push Software Developers Into New Territory",
