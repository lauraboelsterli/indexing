    "text": "LONDON, May 10 (IFR) - Ghana has revised pricing for a US dollar dual-tranche offering comprising amortising bonds with 10 and 30-year average lives, according to a lead.\nThe African sovereign has set guidance for the May 2029 bond at 7.75%-7.875%. The notes were first marketed in the low 8% area yield.\nGhana has revised pricing for the May 2049 tranche to 8.75%-8.875% from the initial low 9% area.\nTotal books have passed US$5.5bn, evenly split between the two tranches.\nThe 144A/Reg S deal is todayâ€™s business via Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered.\nGhana is rated B3/B-/B.\nThe deal follows a tender offer for its 2022 and 2023 bonds. Ghana announced on Wednesday that it has received valid tenders of just over US$702m for its US$750m 9.25% 2022 notes.\nGhana, however, terminated the invitation to holders of its 2023s and will not accept for purchase any of the bonds.
