They are seeking a personalized career navigation experience that provides visibility into a career path that will land them their dream job,” said Ron Mitchell, CEO of Virgil. “At the same time, employers need more dynamic candidate search and engagement tools that deliver the candidates they need and reduce time to hire.”\nVirgil’s proprietary technology solves these needs by creating greater transparency into the career navigation process. Through this technology, job seekers are able to gain an understanding of how their skills match to careers they desire based on competency scores, and recruiters are able to communicate the talents they are looking for and find candidates that have demonstrated those qualifications. These capabilities will be available to Hcareers clients later this year.\n“Nearly every major hotel brand depends on Hcareers to fill hospitality positions as it has the largest hospitality talent pool in North America,” said Peter Shaper, founding partner of Genesis Park. “Given today’s competitive market for talent, we are excited to invest in a platform that will give employers innovative options to get the talent they need. We look forward to continuing to serve the hospitality industry and to be the destination of choice for hospitality professionals.”\nAbout Virgil Holdings, Inc.\nVirgil Holdings Inc. owns and operates Virgil Careers, a career navigation and recruiting platform that utilizes proprietary machine learning algorithms and micro-assessments to match job seekers to the perfect career path, employment opportunity and developmental resources. Virgil automatically generates a competency-based profile that enables corporate recruiters to quickly identify and contact the right candidates for their open roles.
