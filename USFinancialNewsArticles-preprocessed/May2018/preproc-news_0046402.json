    "text": "2 COMMENTS This isn’t a typical sports story, but I think it’s an important one.\nOver the past few months, a handful of high-profile athletes have come forward to talk about their personal issues with mental health. The Olympic legend Michael Phelps opened up on his struggles with depression , as did the NBA All-Star DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors. Another basketball All-Star, Kevin Love, currently in the playoffs with the Cleveland Cavaliers, went public about his battles with anxiety —including a panic attack he suffered during a game this season.\nNow comes Mauro Ranallo. If you’re not a major fan of boxing or other combat sports, it’s very possible you don’t know Ranallo—but you’ve probably heard him. For years, Ranallo has served as the ringside announcer in everything from boxing to mixed-martial arts to good ol’ professional wrestling. Among other events, he called the megafight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight, as well as Mayweather’s 2017 stunt fight with the UFC star Conor McGregor.\nMore by Jason Gay\nA Feud—Then the Summer’s Craziest Bike Race May 17, 2018 Here Comes the Sports Gambling Apocalypse May 14, 2018 Great, Fantastic, Another Boston Sports Team Is Doing Well May 10, 2018 Ballad of the Renegade Hockey Licker May 6, 2018 I’m Letting My Kids Stay Up Late to Watch LeBron James May 2, 2018 While still a teenager, Ranallo was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, mixed states, after a series of episodes and a hospitalization. As tumultuous as his condition can be—Ranallo can veer abruptly from high highs to severe lows, sometimes over the course of a single day—it has not derailed his success. Now 48, he’s come forward with an intimate look at his mental health in a documentary, “Bipolar Rock ’N’ Roller,” which airs May 25 on Showtime.\nDirected by Ranallo’s friend, Haris Usanovic, “Bipolar Rock ’N’ Roller” isn’t an airbrushed rendering. It is a raw, rough ride at the edges of Ranallo’s life—sometimes joyous (especially as a young, mulleted Ranallo breaks out as a wrestling voice in his native Canada), and sometimes hard to watch. There is footage of Ranallo having manic episodes in his teens and 20s. Usanovic also shows him fighting the condition today, decades later. Ranallo’s struggles are not abstractions, told after the fact—here they are, for the world to see, on film, in real time.\nThat’s what makes “Bipolar Rock ’N’ Roller” both jarring and significant. Ranallo told me he decided to go public with his mental health situation as a means of saving others. “We are losing so many people to suicide due to mental health issues,” he said the other day. “I just thought, I have a voice, I have a platform—and the stigma around mental health is costing people their lives.”\nSecure in his career—Showtime, which produced Ranallo’s film, is also one of his employers—he sees no reason not to be candid. He’s breathtakingly open about his own encounters with suicidal thoughts, as well as the upsides of living with bipolar disorder, what he calls the “beautiful aspect of my illness,” its bursts of energy and creativity.\nMauro Ranallo, center, during a Showtime broadcast. Photo: Showtime There’s a difficult scene in “Bipolar” in which Ranallo returns from a spectacular personal triumph—calling Mayweather vs. Pacquiao—and crumbles in his hotel room.\n“Wow, dude, I’m a f—ing prisoner of my own f—ing mind,” he says to Usanovic. “If I can’t appreciate the night, then I’m going to kill myself. I’m done with this, Haris, I’m not doing well, I’m never going to do well.”\nThis kind of mood swing is characteristic, Ranallo said. It never goes away, but there are outlets that help him manage. There’s work—Ranallo said he struggles the most when he’s not on an assignment. There’s a support network of friends, family and professional colleagues. There’s exercise and eating better. There’s also cannabis, which Ranallo turned to after experiencing “egregious side effects” with prescription medications.\n“The only thing that keeps me alive is cannabis,” he said. He said he never uses it on the air, but finds a puff on a vape to have medicinal value. “To me, it’s not a party drug.”\nMichael Phelps has recently talked about his struggles with depression. Photo: ai project/Reuters Ranallo knows he is putting himself out there with his film. He’s OK with that. Going public—eliminating the stigma around talking about mental health, and showing how productive life can be—is essential to helping people, he believes. Ranallo’s been inspired by the testimonies of athletes like Phelps, DeRozan and Love.\n“There’s no such thing as this [film] being a bad thing for me,” Ranallo said. “If it costs me work, or friends, or family…I’m fine. I’m blessed to have a great support network.”\nI think Ranallo is brave—as are all the athletes putting a voice to this subject. Sports can be hard to take seriously, because sports are often unserious. But sports also has enlightened side, an undeniable ability to influence broader progress. What’s happening now with mental health is courageous and overdue. Good for the Bipolar Rock ’N’ Roller—and good for everyone else, too.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com",
