Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Researchers have identified a new security flaw affecting nearly almost all modern processors. For those experiencing a sense déjà vu, the flaw is a variant of Spectre and Meltdown, chip flaws first announced in January that were found to exploit a technique used to speed chip processing.\nSimilar to Spectre and Meltdown , the Speculative Store Bypass or “Variant 4,” touches upon processors from Intel Corp ., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and ARM Holdings , targeting the same process, called speculative execution, where chips perform calculations out of order to speed performance.\nThe good-ish news . Researchers tell Reuters that risks are lower, because of the prevalence of patches created earlier to address Spectre. But because the patches address a flaw in how chips process data, fixes have resulted in performance sluggishness. Writes Wired : “Once companies push all the various types of updates, though, users will decide case by case whether to install them, since bypassing processing efficiencies to neuter potential attacks can also slow systems down… For SSB—which seems like it may be a less dangerous bug—some users may consider the pros and cons of patching rather than immediately moving forward.”\nWarren Buffett’s insurance company finds global benefits from the cloud. “We’re not going to stand up a technology platform that is unique to Asia and stand up a team in Asia,” Jamie Roser, CIO of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, tells CIO Journal’s Steven Norton . “We want to leverage platforms globally and figure out how to make them support the global needs.”\nPRIVACY + SECURITY\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the company’s annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, Calif., on May 1.

As the Journal’s Gabriel T. Rubin reports , bitcoin’s volatility and worries about bitcoin exchanges’ lack of transparency and cyber vulnerability have caused some on Wall Street, including the Futures Industry Association, to call on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to take a harder look at virtual currency derivatives before allowing them to come to market.\nThe Russian crypto connection. More often than not the CEO or founder of ICO-seeking projects hails from Russia. What gives?

The result: Russia’s crypto pioneers look west.\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nHP Chief Executive Dion Weisler says he has focused the company on higher-margin businesses such as gaming machines.

If completed, the Trump administration would remove the ban on U.S. companies selling components and software to ZTE Corp. , a penalty that has threatened to put the company out of business, the WSJ’s Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report . Instead, ZTE would be forced to make big changes in management, board seats and possibly pay significant fines, the people said.\nVC seeks to make cities smarter.
