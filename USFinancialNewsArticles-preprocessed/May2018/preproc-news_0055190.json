Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attends a meeting with his counterpart from Mozambique Jose Pacheco in Moscow, Russia May 28, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin\nThe Malaysian Airways jet was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 aboard.
