    "text": "CNBC.com Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees prepare packages for shipment on the conveyor belt at the Amazon.com fulfillment center in Hyderabad, India.\nAmazon will thrive in India even after Walmart's acquisition of the e-commerce market leader in the South Asian country, according to one Wall Street firm.\nCiti Research reiterated its buy rating for Amazon shares, predicting strong growth for its international businesses.\nWalmart announced plans last week to acquire an initial stake of about 77 percent in Flipkart, India's top e-commerce company, for $16 billion.\"We believe the India e-commerce market will grow at a 21% CAGR over the next 10 years to $202bn, that Amazon could capture 35% of this market. ... That suggests that Amazon India could be currently worth $16bn,\" analyst Mark May said in a note to clients Thursday. \"In short, not only do we believe that investors continue to under-estimate the value of Amazon's existing Emerging International Retail Markets businesses, but also the pace and value of its recent international expansion efforts.\" show chapters",
