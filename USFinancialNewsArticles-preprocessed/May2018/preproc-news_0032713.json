REUTERS/Leah Millis Trump asked Ross to look into the matter, “consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and it’s been brought up at a number of levels ... as part of bilateral talks on a number of issues,” White House spokesman Raj Shah told a regular news briefing.\nReporting by Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
