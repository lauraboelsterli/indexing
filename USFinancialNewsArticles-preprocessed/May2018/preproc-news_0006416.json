    "text": "GLEN ALLEN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dynex Capital, Inc. (NYSE: DX) reported its first quarter 2018 results today. As previously announced, the Company's quarterly conference call to discuss these results is today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time and may be accessed using conference ID 4576425 via telephone in the U.S. at 1-866-393-4306 (internationally at 1-734-385-2616) or by live webcast which includes a slide presentation, the link for which is provided under “Investor Center” on the Company's website ( www.dynexcapital.com ).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nComprehensive loss to common shareholders of $(0.07) per common share and net income to common shareholders of $0.74 per common share Core net operating income to common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, of $0.18 per common share Dividend declared of $0.18 per common share Book value per common share of $7.07 at March 31, 2018 compared to $7.34 at December 31, 2017, resulting in an economic loss on book value per common share of (1.2)%, inclusive of the dividend declared Leverage including TBA dollar roll positions of 6.5x shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 slightly higher than 6.4x at December 31, 2017\nManagement's Remarks\nByron Boston, President and CEO commented, \"Treasury and swap rates rose sharply during the quarter from improved global growth prospects, among other factors. Our diversified investment portfolio helped mitigate the impact of the increase in rates, limiting the book value decline to (3.7%) during the quarter. Despite the environment and the decline in book value, we generated core net operating income of $0.18 for the quarter. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we maintained a cash dividend of $0.18.\"\nMr. Boston continued, \"We feel that we are in a good position for the second quarter of 2018 even if rates continue to move higher. Our leverage remains modest and our liquidity is strong. We have a large portion of our net interest spread exposure to higher short-term interest rates hedged through interest rate swaps and Eurodollar futures. We believe our diversified investment portfolio will help cushion the impact of a move higher in rates. And finally, we believe the outlook for our Company is favorable as the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet and the attractiveness of returns on mortgage backed securities improves. This should provide us an opportunity to add assets at accretive marginal returns for our shareholders in the future.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Summary\nComprehensive loss to common shareholders was $(4.1) million for the first quarter of 2018 versus comprehensive income to common shareholders of $4.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company recognized an other comprehensive loss of $(45.5) million for the first quarter of 2018 related to a net decline in fair value of MBS as a result of higher interest rates during the quarter. Other comprehensive loss offset net income to common shareholders which increased to $41.4 million for the first quarter compared to $19.1 million for the prior quarter due to a higher net gain on derivative instruments as a result of swap rates increasing during the quarter. Net interest income declined $0.5 million due to an increase of $1.5 million in repurchase agreement financing costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in interest income. Interest income increased $1.7 million as a result of a larger balance of average interest earning assets, which was partially offset by a decline of $0.6 million in prepayment penalty compensation on CMBS and CMBS IO.\nCore net operating income to common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, was $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $10.8 million for the prior quarter of 2017. Adjusted net interest income declined $0.6 million due principally to higher financing rates and lower prepayment income, partially offset by an increase in investments during the quarter as described above. In addition, TBA drop income declined a modest $0.2 million from lower average TBA dollar roll positions during the first quarter. Finally, net periodic interest costs were $0.1 million lower in the first quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017 despite a higher average effective notional balance of interest rate swaps as a result of the increase in three-month LIBOR during the first quarter.\nBook Value and Economic Return\nBook value per common share decreased $(0.27) to $7.07 at March 31, 2018 from $7.34 at December 31, 2017 primarily due to the decline in the fair value of the Company's investments in excess of the increase in fair value of hedges as interest rates rose during the quarter. The $(0.27) decline in book value and the $0.18 dividend declared resulted in an economic loss on book value of $(0.09) per common share, or (1.2)% of beginning book value, for the first quarter of 2018.\nInvestments\nThe average amortized cost basis of the Company's investment portfolio including TBA dollar roll positions (\"TBAs\") increased slightly to $4.0 billion during the first quarter of 2018 versus $3.9 billion for the prior quarter. The following table provides details of our available-for-sale (\"AFS\") investments and dollar roll positions as of March 31, 2018:\nMarch 31, 2018 Type of Investment: Par Amortized\nCost/Implied\nCost Basis\nFair\nValue/Implied\nMarket Value\n($ in thousands) 30-year fixed-rate RMBS: 3.0% coupon $ 240,229 $ 241,958 $ 234,745 4.0% coupon 688,534 723,215 708,060 TBA dollar roll positions (4.1% average coupon) (1) (2) (3) 825,000 844,941 846,940 Total 30-year fixed-rate 1,753,763 1,810,114 1,789,745 Adjustable-rate RMBS: 3.1% coupon (3) 268,543 278,474 272,635 Agency CMBS 1,004,572 1,015,486 984,065 CMBS IO (4) n/a\n652,563 658,269 Other non-Agency MBS 8,771 5,092 7,048 U.S. Treasuries 209,000 207,083 204,535 Total AFS portfolio and TBA dollar roll positions $ 3,244,649 $ 3,968,812 $ 3,916,297 (1) Par, implied cost basis, and implied market value of TBA dollar roll positions represents amounts for the underlying Agency MBS as if settled.\n(2) The net carrying value of TBA dollar roll positions, which is the difference between their implied market value and implied cost basis, was $2.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and is included on the consolidated balance sheet within “derivative assets”.\n(3) Represents the weighted average coupon based on amortized cost.\n(4) Includes both Agency and non-Agency IO securities with a combined notional balance of $25.2 billion.\nAsset Yields and Net Interest Spread\nThe following table provides detail on asset yields for our AFS investments for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Type of Investment: March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 30-year fixed-rate Agency RMBS (1) 3.15 % 3.02 % Adjustable-rate Agency RMBS 2.15 % 2.11 % Agency CMBS 2.80 % 2.80 % CMBS IO 3.84 % 3.82 % Other non-Agency MBS 11.37 % 10.21 % U.S. Treasuries 2.33 % 2.14 % Total asset yield on AFS investments 3.09 % 3.07 % (1) Excludes TBA dollar roll positions.\nThe increase of 2 basis points in the Company's average asset yield on its investment portfolio (excluding TBAs) from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was principally driven by purchases of higher yielding fixed-rate Agency RMBS.\nNet interest spread on the Company's investment portfolio decreased 20 basis points to 1.34% for the first quarter of 2018 from 1.54% for the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher repurchase agreement financing costs which increased 22 basis points during the quarter. Adjusted net interest spread was 1.40% for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusted net interest spread declined as a result of the 22 basis point increase in repurchase agreement financing costs, partially offset by a 9 basis point increase in implied net interest spread on TBAs which was primarily due to slower implied prepayment speeds as a result of the higher interest rate environment during the quarter.\nHedging Summary\nThe Company primarily uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on its comprehensive income. The Company's interest rate swaps had a net favorable impact on comprehensive income of $48.2 million during the first quarter of 2018, inclusive of a realized loss of $(0.5) million due to terminations of $100.0 million of pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps with a notional balance of $1.3 billion and a weighted-average pay-fixed rate of 1.27% matured early in the first quarter, and the Company added swaps with a notional balance of $375.0 million at a weighted average pay-fixed rate of 2.84%. The aggregate notional balance of currently effective and forward-starting interest rate swaps as of March 31, 2018 was $3.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The following table provides details of the Company's interest rate swaps effective during the first quarter of 2018 compared to fourth quarter of 2017:\nThree Months Ended ($ in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nAverage pay-fixed notional balance, net of receive-fixed $ 3,290,556 $ 3,027,065 Weighted average net pay-fixed rate 1.66 % 1.43 % Weighted average net receive-variable rate 1.64 % 1.36 % The Company also utilizes Eurodollar futures to mitigate interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had Eurodollar futures with an aggregate notional balance of $1.3 billion at a weighted average rate of 1.82% with average contractual lives of 3 months that will mature in June and September of 2018. Eurodollar futures do not incur periodic interest or similar costs/benefits and therefore are not included in core net operating income to common shareholders. The Company's Eurodollar futures had a net favorable impact on comprehensive income of $1.9 million during the first quarter of 2018. This favorable impact includes a net realized gain of $0.9 million on $650.0 million of Eurodollar futures with a contract rate of 1.67% that matured in March 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average notional effective during the periods indicated and the weighted average rate for the Company’s interest rate hedges held as of March 31, 2018:\nMarch 31, 2018 Weighted\nAverage\nNotional\nWeighted\nAverage\nRate\n($ in thousands) Remainder of 2018 $ 2,891,218 1.87 % 2019 2,474,027 2.05 % 2020 2,115,451 2.22 % 2021 2,165,479 2.28 % 2022 2,113,795 2.41 % 2023 1,420,000 2.57 % 2024 1,346,503 2.60 % 2025 1,088,973 2.56 % 2026 860,616 2.55 % 2027 415,822 2.77 % 2028 and thereafter 145,737 2.80 % Company Description\nDynex Capital, Inc. is an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, which invests in mortgage assets on a leveraged basis. The Company invests in Agency and non-Agency RMBS, CMBS, and CMBS IO. Additional information about Dynex Capital, Inc. is available at www.dynexcapital.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the Company's operating results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including core net operating income to common shareholders (including per common share), adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income and the related metrics adjusted cost of funds and adjusted net interest spread. Because these measures are used in the Company's internal analysis of financial and operating performance, management believes that they provide greater transparency to our investors of management's view of our economic performance. Management also believes the presentation of these measures, when analyzed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP operating results, allows investors to more effectively evaluate and compare the performance of the Company to that of its peers, although the Company's presentation of its non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. Schedules reconciling core net operating income to common shareholders, adjusted interest expense, and adjusted net interest income to GAAP financial measures are provided as a supplement to this release.\nManagement views core net operating income to common shareholders as an estimate of the Company's financial performance excluding changes in fair value of its investments and derivatives. In addition to the non-GAAP reconciliation set forth in the supplement to this release, which derives core net operating income to common shareholders from GAAP net income to common shareholders as the nearest GAAP equivalent measure, core net operating income to common shareholders can also be determined by adjusting net interest income to include interest rate swap periodic interest costs, drop income on TBA dollar roll positions, general and administrative expenses, and preferred dividends. Management includes drop income, which is included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\" on the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income, in core net operating income and in adjusted net interest income because TBA dollar roll positions are viewed by management as economically equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Management also includes periodic interest costs from its interest rate swaps, which are also included in \"gain (loss) on derivatives instruments, net\", in adjusted net interest expense, and in adjusted net interest income because interest rate swaps are used by the Company to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its borrowing costs from repurchase agreements, and including periodic interest costs from interest rate swaps is a helpful indicator of the Company’s total cost of financing in addition to GAAP interest expense. However, these non-GAAP measures do not provide a full perspective on our results of operations, and therefore, their usefulness is limited. For example, these non-GAAP measures do not include gains or losses from available-for-sale investments, changes in fair value of and costs of terminating interest rate swaps, as well as realized and unrealized gains or losses from any instrument used by management to economically hedge the impact of changing interest rates on its portfolio and book value per common share, such as Eurodollar futures and TBA short positions. As a result, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results as reported on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
