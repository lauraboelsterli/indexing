FILE PHOTO: The NBC and Comcast logos are displayed on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in midtown Manhattan in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\nComcast filed for EU approval for the deal on May 7, confirming a Reuters story.]\nThe world’s biggest entertainment company is competing with Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox to win over Sky. Fox has run into various stumbling blocks since agreeing to a Sky takeover in December 2016.\nThe EU competition enforcer can give the go-ahead to Comcast’s bid with or without concessions, or it can kick off a four-month long investigation if the company is not able to satisfy regulatory concerns.\n($1 = 0.7408 pounds)",
