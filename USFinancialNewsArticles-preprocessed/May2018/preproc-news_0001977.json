    "text": "NEW YORK, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sotheby’s (NYSE:BID) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Sotheby’s reported a net loss of ($6.5) million, or ($0.12) per share. These results represent improvements of 42% from ($11.3) million and 43% from ($0.21) per share in the prior year period. Adjusted Net Income* was $5.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an Adjusted Net Loss* of ($11.4) million, or ($0.21) per share, in the prior year.\n“We remain on track to have an even better year in 2018 than we did in 2017,” commented Tad Smith, Sotheby’s CEO.\nHighlights\nImportant New York auctions begin May 14 th with Amedeo Modigliani’s Nu couché (sur le côté gauche) set to lead the sales with a pre-sale estimate in excess of $150 million. Public exhibition opens tomorrow, May 4 th in our New York headquarters. First quarter results are significantly impacted by the movement of certain Spring Hong Kong sales into the first quarter of 2018 after occurring in the second quarter of the prior year. The schedule change added $130 million in Net Auction Sales to first quarter 2018 results. Consolidated Sales increased 39% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the effect of the Hong Kong calendar shift, Consolidated Sales increased 19% to $0.9 billion. Private sales grew 70% in the first quarter of 2018 to $247 million. Agency commission and fee revenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased 49%, in large part due to the schedule change mentioned above as well as a strengthening art market.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 v. 2017 Financial Highlights\n(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)\nVariance 1Q18 1Q17\n$ % Total revenues (a) $195,796 $199,309 $(3,513 ) (2 %) Net loss attributable to Sotheby's $(6,522 ) $(11,325 ) $4,803 (42 %) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (b) $4,955 $(11,424 ) $16,379 N/A Basic and diluted loss per share $(0.12 ) $(0.21 ) $0.09 (43 %) Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (b) $0.09 $(0.21 ) $0.30 N/A Statistical Metrics: Aggregate Auction Sales (c) $827,735 $567,290 $260,445 46 % Net Auction Sales (d) $691,369 $474,903 $216,466 46 % Private Sales (e) $246,588 $144,783 $101,804 70 % Consolidated Sales (f) $1,090,559 $783,450 $307,109 39 % Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 v. 2017 Financial Highlights\n(in thousands of dollars, except per share data)\nVariance Six months ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ / % % Total revenues (a) $534,002 $532,585 $1,417 -- % Net income attributable to Sotheby's $70,187 $54,177 $16,010 30 % Adjusted Net Income (b) $84,024 $62,332 $21,692 35 % Diluted earnings per share $1.31 $0.99 $0.32 32 % Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (b) $1.56 $1.14 $0.42 37 % Statistical Metrics: Aggregate Auction Sales (c) $2,640,478 $2,168,976 $471,502 22 % Net Auction Sales (d) $2,203,205 $1,812,114 $391,091 22 % Private Sales (e) $537,114 $310,711 $226,403 73 % Consolidated Sales (f) $3,199,995 $2,577,493 $622,502 24 %\n(a) Total revenues for the three and six months ended March 31, 2017 have been updated to reflect the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard that became effective on January 1, 2018.

Included in this earnings release and on our earnings call are financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures include: (i) Adjusted Net Income (Loss), (ii) Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share, (iii) Adjusted Expenses, and (iv) Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs. We caution users of our financial statements that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures as provided below may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies and analysts calculate such measures in the same manner. Our definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:\n(i) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net (loss) income attributable to Sotheby's excluding the after-tax impact of charges related to certain contractual severance agreements, accelerated depreciation charges associated with the York Property enhancement program, net credits related to our previous voluntary separation incentive programs, and the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) also excludes net income tax expense related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (ii) Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share is defined as diluted loss per share excluding the after-tax per share impact of charges related to certain contractual severance agreements, accelerated depreciation charges associated with the York Property enhancement program, net credits related to our previous voluntary separation incentive programs, and the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt. Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share also excludes the per share impact of net income tax expense related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (iii) Adjusted Expenses is defined as total expenses excluding the cost of inventory sales, the cost of finance revenues, charges related to certain contractual severance agreements, accelerated depreciation charges associated with the York Property enhancement program, and net credits related to our previous voluntary separation incentive programs. (iv) Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs, is defined as Adjusted Expenses as noted above excluding Agency Direct Costs. We use Adjusted Expenses and Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs to assess our cost structure when compared to prior periods and on a forward-looking basis, particularly in evaluating performance against our cost control initiatives. These measures provide insight into our ongoing cost structure, absent variable direct costs of revenue, which are unpredictable and can vary significantly from one period to the next, and costs associated with unusual items.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share, Adjusted Expenses, and Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs are important supplemental measures used in our financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting, and as part of our forecasting and budgeting processes, as they provide helpful measures of our core operations. These measures allow us to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and benchmark performance between periods. We also believe that these measures may be used by securities analysts, investors, financial institutions, and other interested parties in their evaluation of our performance.\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to Sotheby's to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table (in thousands of dollars):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net (loss) income attributable to Sotheby's $ (6,522 ) $ (11,325 ) $ 70,187 $ 54,177 Add: Contractual severance agreement charges, net of tax of ($676), $0, ($676), and $0 2,146 — 2,146 — Add: Accelerated depreciation charges, net of tax of ($385), $0, ($1,106), and $0 1,168 — 2,344 — Add: Extinguishment of debt, net of tax of ($2,692), $0, ($2,692), and $0 8,163 — 8,163 — Add: Acquisition earn-out compensation expense, net of tax of $0, $0, $0, and ($5,213) — — — 8,187 Add: Voluntary separation incentive programs credits, net, net of tax of $0, $63, $0, and $26 — (99 ) — (32 ) Add: Net income tax expense related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — — 1,184 — Adjusted Net Income (Loss) $ 4,955 $ (11,424 ) $ 84,024 $ 62,332 Variance versus prior period - $ $ 16,379 $ 21,692 Variance versus prior period - % N/A 35 % The income tax effect of each line item in the reconciliation above of net loss attributable to Sotheby's to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is computed using the relevant jurisdictional tax rate for each item.\nA reconciliation of diluted (loss) earnings per share to Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Six Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Diluted (loss) earnings per share $ (0.12 ) $ (0.21 ) $ 1.31 $ 0.99 Add: Contractual severance agreement charges, per share 0.04 — 0.04 — Add: Accelerated depreciation charges, per share 0.02 — 0.04 — Add: Acquisition earn-out compensation expense, per share — — — 0.15 Add: Extinguishment of debt, per share 0.15 — 0.15 — Add: Net income tax expense related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, per share — — 0.02 — Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share $ 0.09 $ (0.21 ) $ 1.56 $ 1.14 Variance versus prior period - $ $ 0.30 $ 0.42 Variance versus prior period - % N/A 37 % A reconciliation of total expenses to Adjusted Expenses and Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is presented in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Total expenses $ 188,885 $ 213,367 $ 420,457 $ 457,050 Subtract: Cost of inventory sales 15,995 71,407 25,086 105,454 Subtract: Cost of finance revenues 2,263 5,037 5,406 9,795 Subtract: Contractual severance agreement charges 2,822 — 2,822 — Subtract: Accelerated depreciation charges 1,553 — 3,450 — Subtract: Acquisition earn-out compensation expense — — — 13,400 Subtract: Voluntary separation incentive program credits, net — (162 ) — (58 ) Adjusted Expenses 166,252 137,085 383,693 328,459 Subtract: Agency Direct Costs 35,273 21,289 90,342 73,276 Adjusted Expenses, excluding Agency Direct Costs $ 130,979 $ 115,796 $ 293,351 $ 255,183 Variance versus prior period - $ $ 15,183 $ 38,168 Variance versus prior period - % 13 % 15 %\nLauren Gioia | Jennifer Park | Dan Abernethy | Lauren.Gioia@Sothebys.com | Jennifer.Park@Sothebys.com | Dan.Abernethy@Sothebys.com +1 212 606 7176\nSource:Sotheby's",
