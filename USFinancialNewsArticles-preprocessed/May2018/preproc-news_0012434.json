(NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today reported operating results for first-quarter 2018, and provided an update on the Company's commercial products and development programs.\n“2018 is off to an excellent start for TESARO, as ZEJULA continues to penetrate the recurrent ovarian cancer market,” said Lonnie Moulder, CEO of TESARO. “We expect to expand the market for ZEJULA to the front-line setting with PRIMA, our Phase 3 trial for patients with first-line ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status, with data expected late next year. In March, data presented from our TOPACIO trial of ZEJULA in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody surpassed historical monotherapy benchmarks in difficult-to-treat platinum-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer patients, and we look forward to presentations from both the ovarian and triple-negative breast cancer cohorts of TOPACIO at ASCO. Our immuno-oncology pipeline is advancing quickly and we are on track to submit a biologic license application for TSR-042, our anti-PD-1 antibody, for patients with MSI-high tumors in 2019. Enrollment continues in our AMBER trial of TSR-022, our anti-TIM-3 antibody, in combination with TSR-042, and data from this trial in tumor-specific expansion cohorts are expected to be presented at a medical meeting later this year.”\nRecent Business Highlights\nZEJULA is the most utilized PARP inhibitor among ovarian cancer patients in the U.S., with more than 5,000 patients treated since launch in April 2017. The European launch of ZEJULA continues in Germany. Enrollment was completed in the Phase 3 PRIMA trial for patients with first-line ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status. Data from this study are anticipated in late 2019. Data were presented from the ovarian cancer cohort of the TOPACIO trial of ZEJULA in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody at the Society for Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting in March. Data demonstrated activity of ZEJULA in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in difficult-to-treat types of ovarian cancer. Results from a retrospective analysis of the NOVA trial were presented at the SGO Annual Meeting, which identified two characteristics, patient body weight and platelet counts, to be predictors of dose modification. In April, preliminary Phase 1 data from expansion cohorts of the GARNET trial of TSR-042 were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Activity of TSR-042 monotherapy was demonstrated in patients with MSI-high endometrial cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a well-tolerated safety profile comparable to other anti-PD-1 antibodies. Top-line results from the QUADRA study of ZEJULA monotherapy in fourth-line plus treatment of ovarian cancer were announced in April. This trial successfully achieved its pre-specified primary endpoint and demonstrated activity in patients with fourth or fifth-line HRD-positive ovarian cancer who were PARP inhibitor naïve and platinum sensitive. Additional QUADRA data will be presented at ASCO in June. Phase 2 data from the TOPACIO trial of ZEJULA with an anti-PD-1 for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer or triple-negative breast cancer were accepted for two separate oral presentations at ASCO. TSR-042 is in a registration trial (GARNET) for MSI-high tumors. Data are being generated to demonstrate the activity of TSR-042 in multiple tumor types, including lung, breast and ovarian cancer. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate TSR-022 (anti-TIM-3 antibody) and TSR-033 (anti-LAG-3 antibody) in combination with TSR-042.\n• AMBER: Phase 1 trial of TSR-022 in combination with TSR-042 is enrolling three tumor specific cohorts.\n• CITRINO: Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of TSR-033 is ongoing to determine dose and schedule for combination with TSR-042.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTESARO reported net product revenue of $50.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, including ZEJULA sales of $48.9 million, compared to $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses increased to $96.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $66.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher manufacturing and clinical development costs associated with ZEJULA, TSR-042, and TSR-022, increased headcount, and research collaborations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $93.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $69.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased sales and marketing headcount and activities to support sales of ZEJULA in the U.S. and launches in Europe.\nOperating expenses as described above include total non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $18.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss totaled $162.8 million, or ($2.98) per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $136.7 million, or ($2.55) per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 2018 Product revenue, net ZEJULA ® - $ 48,869 VARUBI ® /VARUBY ® $ 2,139 $ 1,303 Total product revenue, net $ 2,139 $ 50,172 License, collaboration, and other revenue $ 934 $ (430 ) Total revenues $ 3,073 $ 49,742 Net loss $ (136,725 ) $ (162,816 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (2.55 ) $ (2.98 ) Operating Expenses\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 2018 Cost of sales - product $ 444 $ 9,997 Cost of sales - intangible asset amortization $ 490 $ 1,437 Research and development (R&D) $ 66,122 $ 96,755 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 69,262 $ 93,607 Acquired in-process R&D $ - $ - Cash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of March 31, 2018, TESARO had approximately $499.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 54.8 million outstanding shares of common stock.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nIn 2018, TESARO expects:\nTotal Revenue, net, worldwide (FY) $310 to $345 million ZEJULA (FY) $255 to $275 million ZEJULA (Q2) $50 to $55 million Other revenue, including licensing and VARUBI/Y oral (FY) $55 to $70 million Interest expense (FY) $50 to $60 million, including non-cash interest expense of $14 million In the first quarter, TESARO’s cash and cash equivalents balance declined by approximately $144 million.

In preclinical studies, ZEJULA concentrates in the tumor relative to plasma, delivering greater than 90% durable inhibition of PARP 1/2 and a persistent antitumor effect. Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML), including some fatal cases, was reported in patients treated with ZEJULA. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Hematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia), as well as cardiovascular effects (hypertension and hypertensive crisis) have been reported in patients treated with ZEJULA. Monitor complete blood counts to detect hematologic adverse reactions, as well as to detect cardiovascular disorders, during treatment. ZEJULA can cause fetal harm and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception.
