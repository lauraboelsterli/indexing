    "text": "DALLAS, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nExecuted business transformation Closed on divestiture of company-operated sites to 7-Eleven, Inc. with 15-year take-or-pay fuel distribution contract Converted 207 West Texas company-operated sites to commission agent channel Completed refinancing and equity repurchase initiatives Current quarter cash coverage of 1.00 times and trailing twelve months coverage of 1.22 times with leverage of 3.82 times at the end of the first quarter of 2018 Generated first quarter Net Loss of $315 million, Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $109 million and Distributable Cash Flow (1) , as adjusted, of $85 million Utilized scale to grow fuel distribution and logistics business In April 2018, SUN acquired 26 retail sites from 7-Eleven and converted into commission agent channel In April 2018, SUN acquired the wholesale fuel distribution business and terminal assets from Superior Plus Corporation\nSunoco LP (NYSE: SUN) (\"SUN\" or the \"Partnership\") today announced financial and operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 33.5 percent, compared to $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was the result of the average selling price of fuel being higher than last year.\nTotal gross profit increased to $296 million, compared to $256 million in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of higher motor fuel gross profits.\nLoss from continuing operations was $78 million, including a $109 million loss on extinguishment of debt and other, versus income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, was $237 million versus a loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of $11 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was $315 million, or ($3.74) per diluted unit, versus a net income of $1 million, or ($0.22) per diluted unit, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $109 million, compared with $155 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDistributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, was $85 million, compared to $77 million a year ago. This year-over-year increase reflects lower cash interest expense and a decrease in maintenance capital spend.\nOn a weighted-average basis, fuel margin for all gallons sold was 10.5 cents per gallon, compared to 14.5 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017. The 4.0 cent per gallon decrease was attributable to a shift in volumes away from the retail segment to the wholesale segment and the adoption of revenue recognition.\nNet loss for the wholesale segment was $58 million compared to net income of $38 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $80 million, versus $91 million in the first quarter of last year. Total wholesale gallons sold were 1,612 million, compared to 1,313 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 22.8 percent. The Partnership earned 8.4 cents per gallon on these volumes, compared to 10.6 cents per gallon a year earlier.\nNet loss for the retail segment was $257 million compared to a net loss of $37 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $29 million, versus $64 million in the first quarter of last year. Total retail gallons sold were 245 million, down from 595 million gallons a year ago as volumes migrated to the wholesale segment. The Partnership earned 24.4 cents per gallon on these volumes, compared to 23.1 cents per gallon a year earlier.\nSUN's recent accomplishments include the following:\nClosed the strategic divestiture of company-operated sites in the continental United States to 7-Eleven, Inc. on January 23, 2018 for gross proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion Completed the following refinancing and equity repurchase initiatives: Closed the private offering of $2.2 billion of new senior notes on January 23, 2018, comprised of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due 2026 and $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2028. Proceeds from this offering were used to redeem in full amounts owed under existing senior notes Repaid in full and terminated the term loan agreement and paid down all outstanding amounts owed under the revolving credit facility Redeemed $300 million of Series A Preferred Units held by Energy Transfer Equity for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $313 million Repurchased 17,286,859 Sunoco common units owned by Energy Transfer Partners for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $540 million at a 10-day volume weighted average price of $31.2376 per unit\nFollowing the conversion of sites to the commission agent channel through April 2018, SUN operates 21 company-operated sites along the New Jersey turnpike and 54 retail sites in Hawaii.\nSUN's segment results and other supplementary data are provided after the financial tables below.\nDistribution\nOn April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of SUN's general partner declared a distribution for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.8255 per unit, which corresponds to $3.3020 per unit on an annualized basis. The distribution will be paid on May 15, 2018 to common unitholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nSUN's distribution coverage ratio for the first quarter was 1.00 times. The distribution coverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.22 times.\nLiquidity\nAt March 31, SUN had no borrowings against its revolving line of credit and other long-term debt of $2.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2018, SUN did not issue any common units through its at-the-market equity program. The leverage ratio of debt to Adjusted EBITDA, calculated in accordance with SUN's credit facility, was 3.82 times at the end of the first quarter.\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are non-GAAP financial measures of performance that have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income. Please refer to the discussion and tables under \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\" later in this news release for a discussion of our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, and a reconciliation to net income.\nEarnings Conference Call\nSunoco LP management will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 10, at 9:30 a.m. CT (10:30 a.m. ET) to discuss first quarter results and recent developments.
