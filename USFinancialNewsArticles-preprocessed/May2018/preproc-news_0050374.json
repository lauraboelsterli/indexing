    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 2:30 AM / in 15 hours NFL approves changes to kickoffs, ejections Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nIn an effort to improve safety, the NFL announced on Tuesday a handful of approved changes to kickoffs following a vote at the spring league meetings on Tuesday. Feb 4, 2018; Minneapolis, MN, USA; General view of the opening kickoff in Super Bowl LII between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots at U.S. Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: James Lang-USA TODAY Sports\nThe rule changes will be re-evaluated next offseason.\nThe changes, designed to limit full-speed collisions, are summarized as follows:\n—Players on the kickoff team will line up five on each side and must be within 1 yard of the point of kickoff to prevent getting a running start downfield after the kick.\n—At least eight players on the returning team must be aligned in a 15-yard “setup zone” prior to the kickoff so more players are closer to where the ball is kicked in order to reduce speed. Dec 7, 2014; New Orleans, LA, USA; Carolina Panthers tight end Brandon Williams (86) fights with New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan (94) during the first quarter of a game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Williams was ejected from the game due to the fight. Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n—Two-man wedge blocks have been eliminated, along with “jump-set/attack” blocks.\n—There is no requirement for the kickoff returner to down the ball in the end zone. Instead, it will be an automatic touchback.\nThe NFL owners also expanded reviewable plays to include disqualification of players and approved ejection standards to go along with the “use of the helmet” rule. According to the new rule, ejection is possible if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent, provided the contact is clearly avoidable.\n—Field Level Media",
