    "text": "LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - British satellite firm Inmarsat said its first-quarter revenue rose 5 percent, building on the momentum achieved last year in its maritime and aviation services.\nThe company, which kept its full-year outlook unchanged, reported core earnings of $174.9 million, down 4.5 percent, in part reflecting less government work in the quarter, on revenue of $345.4 million.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
