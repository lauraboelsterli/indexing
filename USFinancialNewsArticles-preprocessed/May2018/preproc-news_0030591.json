    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 6:11 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago CYBG reports first half loss of £76 million on PPI charges Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s CYBG ( CYBGC.L ) reported a loss of 76 million pounds for the first half of the year on Tuesday, as it booked a previously-announced 350 million pound charge for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.\nCYBG reported the hit in March after a media campaign by Britain’s financial watchdog boosted claims by customers against banks for Britain’s costliest ever consumer scandal, in which people were mis-sold often worthless insurance products.\nThe bank offered no update on the status of its 1.6 billion pound all-shares takeover bid for rival Virgin Money ( VM.L ), a move that spiked wider talk of consolidation among British mid-sized lenders when it was announced earlier in May.
