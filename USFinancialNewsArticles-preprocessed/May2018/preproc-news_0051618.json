    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 2:19 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Pacific Ocean features in new royal Markle's Coat of Arms Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - A Coat of Arms has been created for U.S. actress Meghan Markle, who married Britain’s Prince Harry in a lavish ceremony watched by millions last weekend, featuring California’s state flower and a blue background to represent the Pacific Ocean. Britain's Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex's, new coat of arms can be seen in this undated handout illustration issued by Kensington Palace in London, Britain, May 25, 2018. Kensington Palace/Handout via REUTERS\nMeghan, who is now officially the Duchess of Sussex, joined Britain’s royal family when she wed Harry at Queen Elizabeth’s Windsor Castle home last Saturday.\nHarry’s office said on Friday the design for her Coat Of Arms had been approved by his grandmother Queen Elizabeth and Thomas Woodcock, the Senior Herald in England based at London’s College of Arms.\n“Her Royal Highness worked closely with the College of Arms throughout the design process to create a Coat of Arms that was both personal and representative,” Kensington Palace said in a statement.\nMeghan was born and raised in Los Angeles and the statement said the blue background of the shield on her arms represented the Pacific Ocean off California’s coast while two golden rays were symbolic of the state’s sunshine. Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend a garden party at Buckingham Palace, their first royal engagement as a married couple, in London, May 22, 2018. Dominic Lipinski/Pool via Reuters\nIt also features three quills which represent communication and the power of words while beneath the shield are a collection of golden poppies, California’s state flower, and wintersweet, which grows at Kensington Palace where she now lives with her new husband, the palace said.\nNext to the shield are two “Supporters”, one for her husband and one relating to her - a songbird with an open beak which also represents the power of communication.\n“Good heraldic design is nearly always simple and the Arms of The Duchess of Sussex stand well beside the historic beauty of the quartered British Royal Arms,” Woodcock said.\nThe technical description of the arms is “Azure a Feather bendwise Argent quilled between two Bendlets Or all between two like Feathers Argent quilled Or”.
