Send links of surveys and reports to ben.dipietro@wsj.com .\nNot Ready for Prime Time: A survey of around 6,000 business professionals around the world by Isaca, an advocacy group for information-security professionals, found 29% said their companies will be fully compliant with the European Union’s Global Data Protection Regulation when it takes effect May 25. Data discovery and mapping remains the top challenge to GDPR compliance; 59% named that as their biggest issue. Ten percent didn’t know if their organization was required to comply with GDPR.\n“It is not easy to alter entrenched business practices, or conform to new requirements, even if those requirements might be beneficial to the organization and its lines of business,” Isaca said. “GDPR provides an opportunity for organizations to engage employees and hold them accountable for the safeguarding and protection of the personal data they handle.”\nResilience Review: Switzerland, Luxembourg and Sweden remained in the top three positions in this year’s business resilience index from insurer FM Global, meaning they are the countries considered best situated to survive disruptive events such as natural disasters, political upheaval or cyberattacks. The U.S. was divided into three regions—East, Central and West—and they placed 10th, 9th and 15th, respectively.\nFraud All Around: A survey of 2,550 executives that work in compliance or antifraud positions at large companies world-wide by EY found 38% said bribery and corruption occur routinely in their country . Eleven percents said it is common to bribe people to win contracts in their business segment.\nAutomated Help Wanted: A survey of around 600 U.S. security and IT professionals by data analysis firm Domain Tools and Ponemon Institute found 41% said they are turning to automation because they can’t find enough qualified people to fill open security positions.\nKeeping Auditors Awake: A report from the Institute of Internal Auditors ranks the top five risks facing chief audit executives. They are talent management; data analytics; cyber; regulations; and responding to disruption.\nStress From Change: A survey of around 1,111 C-suite-level executives by law firm Littler Mendelsohn found 64% said the 180-degree changes in regulatory policies from the Trump administration compared with the Obama administration have put a strain on their operations .\nPassword Fails: A survey of 400 IT decision-makers by identity governance firm SailPoint and research firm Vanson Bourne found 55% said they used the same password in their work and personal life. Ten percent admitted to using the most common choices, such as “password.”\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: Survey Roundup Previous The Morning Risk Report: GDPR Is Newest Human Resources Headache Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte Does Your Team Strengthen Your Brand?
