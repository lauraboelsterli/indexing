    "text": "BRUSSELS, May 22 (Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologised to EU lawmakers on Tuesday and said the company had not done enough to prevent misuse of the social network.\nMeeting the leaders of the European Parliament, Zuckerberg stressed the importance of Europeans to Facebook and said he was sorry for not doing enough to prevent abuse of the platform.\n\"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility. That was a mistake and I am sorry for it,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks.\nFacebook has been embroiled in a data scandal after it emerged that the personal data of 87 million users were improperly accessed by a political consultancy.
