    "text": "TORONTO, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AGF Investments Inc. (AGF) today announced the extension of its preferred pricing offering to allow eligible investors to automatically benefit from the lowest fee option available in a particular series. Effective August 2018, AGF will introduce an automatic management fee rebate (MFR) for existing eligible investors within their current series.\nThe MFR will be automatically implemented across all currently available purchase options of Series MF (including Classic), F, T and V with the current AGF Gold Label (Series Q and W) rules being used to determine eligibility.\n“Before developing our preferred pricing enhancements, we spent time engaging dealers and researching the range of fee options within the industry,” said Florence Narine, Senior Vice-President, Head of Product, AGF. “We wanted to provide investors with a simplified solution that addresses their pricing expectations as their assets grow.”\nAGF will monitor client fund accounts for qualification and will automatically begin to apply MFRs on qualified accounts.\n“With a focus on the best interests of our clients, AGF recently announced a series of changes, including management fee reductions, to simplify our product line-up and ensure we have the right products in place,” said Kevin McCreadie, President and Chief Investment Officer, AGF. “The extension of our preferred pricing offering is the next step in ensuring we have a competitive product shelf to better meet the evolving needs of our clients. We don’t anticipate any further product changes impacting fees for the foreseeable future.”\nThe new preferred pricing offering is expected to result in a revenue reduction to AGF Management Limited, which will equate to approximately one basis point of total assets under management.\nABOUT AGF MANAGEMENT LIMITED\nFounded in 1957, AGF Management Limited (AGF) is a diversified global asset management firm with retail, institutional, alternative and high-net-worth businesses.
