    "text": "May 17 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden is leaving the ride-hailing company, an Uber spokesman told Reuters on Thursday.\nHolden oversaw Uber Elevate, the companyâ€™s flying car operation, which is now headed by Eric Allison, the spokesman said in a phone interview, declining to elaborate.\nLast month, Holden told the Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas that the company expected to deploy flying taxi services in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Dubai in 2020.\nThe Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Holden, who was hired by former Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick from Groupon Inc, told colleagues that Thursday was his last day with the company.\nHolden previously spent nine years at online retailing company Amazon.com Inc.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
