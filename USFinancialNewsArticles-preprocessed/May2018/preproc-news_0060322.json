Embler, as well as Nominee Jonathan Litt\nLand & Buildings’ Proposal Regarding the Company’s Capital and Voting Structure Rejected by Taubman Centers Shareholders\nBLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Taubman Centers, Inc. (NYSE:TCO) (the “Company”) today announced that shareholders elected Taubman Centers director nominees Mayree C. Clark and Michael J. Embler, as well as director nominee Jonathan Litt, to Taubman Centers’ Board of Directors at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders based on the assessment of its proxy solicitor and subject to the final certification of the voting results by the inspector of election.\nThe preliminary results also indicate that shareholders approved proposals 2-4 at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting, including the ratification of KPMG LLP as Taubman Centers’ independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, the advisory approval of the compensation of Taubman Centers’ named executive officers and the approval of the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, based on the preliminary vote count and subject to the final certification of the voting results by the inspector of election, Taubman Centers shareholders did not approve Land & Buildings’ non-binding proposal regarding the Company’s capital and voting structure.\nThe Company issued the following statement:\nThe Taubman Centers Board and management team thank shareholders for their support and valuable feedback. We are pleased that shareholders elected Mayree Clark and Mike Embler to the Taubman Centers Board, and welcome Jonathan Litt as a new director.

We remain committed to acting in the best interests of shareholders and building on the Company’s long, proven track-record of shareholder value creation.\nThe Company will file preliminary voting results on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days and will file the Inspector’s final certified vote report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 8-K as soon as practicable, following the customary review period.\nAbout Taubman\nTaubman Centers is an S&P MidCap 400 Real Estate Investment Trust engaged in the ownership, management and/or leasing of 26 regional, super-regional and outlet shopping centers in the U.S. and Asia.
