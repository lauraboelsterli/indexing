    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 7:28 PM / in 18 minutes Angola passes new law scrapping need for local investment partner Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLUANDA, May 17 (Reuters) - Angola’s parliament approved unanimously on Thursday a new law to facilitate private investment into sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest economy, doing away with the need for local partners and a minimum spend of one million dollars.\nThe new law, which does not apply to the oil, mining or the finance sectors, is a cornerstone of President Joao Lourenco’s attempts to open up and diversify the Angolan economy in a bid to revive growth battered by a fall in the price of oil.\nPreviously foreigners looking to invest in Angola had to, in most sectors, join with a local partner who by law was required to have at least a 35 percent stake. Investors had long described the requirements as restrictive. (Reporting by Stephen Eisenhammer)",
