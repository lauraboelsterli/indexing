    "text": "--One-Time Charges and Operating Loss Due to Regulatory Impact--\n--Aggressive Cost-Cutting Program Underway--\n--Expect Second Half Profit--\n--Earnings Conference Call Expected by Mid-June--\nSHANGHAI, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- China Rapid Finance Limited (\"China Rapid Finance\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: XRF), operator of one of China's largest consumer lending marketplaces, today disclosed preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company expects to report a net loss in the range of $25 to $30 million, the majority of which consists of approximately $16 million of one-time expenses: 1) non-recurring expenses associated with preparing for registration; 2) write-offs related to receivables and amortizations; 3) non-cash accounting charges related to adoption of the new GAAP standard for revenue recognition (ASC 606); and 4) one-time costs associated with a pilot funding program that was discontinued due to regulatory changes.\nDr. Zane Wang, Chief Executive Officer, Founder and Chairman of the Company, commented: \"Regulatory changes had a short-term negative impact on our operations, as we discussed on our last earnings conference call. During this period, we capped our fees and limited loan originations to new borrowers as we increased our testing of new products. Our cash balance is more than adequate to fund operations and provide capital for growth initiatives.\"\nWang continued, \"We have completed all the current regulatory requirements for registration. In the meantime, we continue to aggressively cut operating costs and accelerate company-wide efficiency improvements in order to streamline our business. As of mid-May, operating performance has improved meaningfully due to higher loan originations and the reduced operating expenses. To the extent that the external environment remains stable, we can achieve significantly improved financial results in Q2 and profitable operations in the second half.\"\nThe company expects to formally announce Q1 2018 results in mid-June.\nAbout China Rapid Finance\nChina Rapid Finance operates a leading online consumer finance marketplace in China, facilitating millions of loans annually. The Company deploys machine learning and proprietary decisioning technology to facilitate affordable digital credit for one of the world's largest untapped consumer credit markets: China's 500 million emerging mobile-active consumers. China Rapid Finance operates a pure play marketplace, and does not take credit risk.
