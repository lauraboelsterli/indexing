This compares to a GAAP net loss of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a GAAP net loss of $1.5 million in Q1 2017. GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS was $0.27 in Q1 2018. This compares to a GAAP net loss per fully diluted ADS of $0.07 in Q4 2017 and a GAAP net loss per fully diluted ADS of $0.06 in Q1 2017.\nSupplementary Data:\nThe Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with $45.1 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments or $1.73 per outstanding ADS.
