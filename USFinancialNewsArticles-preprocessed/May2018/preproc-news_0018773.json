    "text": "Former President Bill Clinton had some choice words about the new tax law.\n\"The law basically is a bullet aimed at New York and California,\" Clinton told CNBC on Tuesday of changes to the tax code.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , signed into law by President Donald Trump in December, caps state and local tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000 .\nshow chapters 800,000 people are about to flee New York, California because of taxes 10:53 AM ET Fri, 27 April 2018 | 00:58 For those that live in states with high state income taxes , including California, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, that's a big hit.\nThe change means many residents in these states — and others — will now pay more to the federal government. (See chart below.)\nThe new tax legislation also doubles the standard deduction to nearly $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples who file jointly, which makes it much harder to claim the benefit for charitable contributions.\nHow this will impact people's willingness to give remains to be seen, Clinton said.\n\"They may be less inclined to contribute big money, I think people will still give,\" Clinton said. As a result, \"we may have more crowdfunding,\" he said.\n\"Depending on what happens with the elections, there may be some changes to that law,\" Clinton added, referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act .\nClinton took part in the 16th annual Commissions for Charity Day organized by trading firm BTIG on Tuesday, along with other politicians, all-star athletes, actors and journalists.\nSince 2003, BTIG has raised more than $45 million for charity.\nThe former president's own Clinton Foundation operates a range of philanthropic projects around the world and has raised billions since its founding , but has also been dogged by accusations of influence peddling and conflicts of interests.\nshow chapters Shaq talks business at BTIG’s Charity Day 23 Hours Ago | 07:42 More from Personal Finance:\nHow these states are rebelling against the GOP tax code\n10 tax changes you need to know for 2018\nSee your new tax withholding rates",
