    "text": "BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - Beiersdorf, the maker of Nivea and other skin care products, beat its consumer product rivals on Tuesday by posting a 6.5 percent rise in first-quarter organic group sales, but stuck to its conservative outlook for 2018.\nSales, excluding exchange rate effects as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, rose to 1.807 billion euros ($2.16 billion), just ahead of average analyst forecasts, although exchange rate effects meant nominal growth was just 0.4 percent.\nBeiersdorf has performed strongly against rivals Unilever , the maker of Dove products, and Britainâ€™s Reckitt Benckiser, with the quarter powered by 8.5 percent sales growth at its Tesa adhesives unit.\nHowever, it reiterated a cautious forecast for 2018 sales growth of around 4 percent, predicting Tesa will record sales growth of 3 to 4 percent and its consumer products division to grow 4 to 5 percent. ($1 = 0.8384 euros) (Reporting by Emma Thomasson Editing by Maria Sheahan)\n ",
