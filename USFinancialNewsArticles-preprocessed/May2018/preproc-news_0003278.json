    "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bel Fuse Inc . (NASDAQ:BELFA) and (NASDAQ:BELFB) today announced preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales of $118.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4.0% $178.3 million in backlog represents gain of $31.8 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2017 GAAP net loss of $1.3 million compared to net earnings of $0.7 million in first quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million, or 4.5% of sales, versus $7.9 million, or 6.9% of sales, in first quarter 2017 First quarter 2018 book-to-bill ratio of 1.27\nNon-GAAP financial measures, such as Non-GAAP EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, exclude the impact of costs associated with ERP system implementation costs and restructuring charges. Please refer to the financial information included with this press release for reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to Non-GAAP financial measures and our explanation of why we present Non-GAAP financial measures.\nCEO Comments\nDaniel Bernstein, President and CEO, said, “While first quarter sales showed modest growth from the same period last year, we are more encouraged by the continued growth in our backlog with heightened activity across all of our major product groups and within each of our major end markets. Since year-end, we saw a 33% increase in the backlog at Connectivity Solutions, driven by recent awards on key military programs, and a 25% increase at Magnetic Solutions, driven by demand for our multi-gig variants of ICMs from our key networking customers. Our Power Solutions and Protection backlog grew by 12%, led by higher demand for our power supplies in the industrial and rail industries, and orders from new customers within the E-Mobility, Internet of Things and Blockchain segments.\n\"The majority of the sales growth in the first quarter related to strong demand for our Magnetic Solutions products, particularly our integrated connector modules within industrial, Ethernet and server markets. Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products were also higher in the first quarter of 2018 with an increase in demand related to various military programs and within the industrial market for oil and gas, test and measurement, and broadcasting applications. Our Power Solutions and Protection group, excluding the effects of our divested NPS business, also contributed to our year-over-year sales growth.\n\"While we are optimistic on the revenue front for 2018, our results continue to be impacted by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, minimum wage increases in the PRC and increased material costs related to certain of our purchased components. Furthermore, our Power Solutions business has also had an unfavorable impact on our bottom line, and we continue to work on our plan to restore this business to a position of profitability. Lastly, there have been recent tariff proposals on U.S. imports that may impact our business. We are carefully monitoring the status of these proposals and evaluating various options in the event they are put into effect.\n\"With our new credit facility in place and the ability to cost-effectively repatriate foreign earnings under the recent U.S. tax reform, we continue to evaluate acquisition targets and believe this will be a key component of our strategic development plan going forward,” concluded Mr. Bernstein.\nFinancial Summary\nAll comparative percentages are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $118.3 million, up 4.0% from last year’s first quarter.\nBy geographic segment, Europe was up by 15.8%, Asia was up by 7.8%, and North America was down by 1.6%. By product group, Magnetic Solutions sales were up by 9.3%, Connectivity Solutions sales were 3.0% higher and Power Solutions and Protection sales was up slightly by 0.2%. During the first quarter of 2018, 36% of our sales related to our Connectivity Solutions products (versus 37% in 2017), 32% related to our Magnetic products (versus 31% in 2017) and 32% related to our Power Solutions and Protection products (versus 32% in 2017).\nOn a consolidated basis, sales increased by $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017, despite a $1.6 million decline in sales related to the winding down of our NPS product sales within the Power Solutions Business.\nGross Profit\nGross profit margin decreased to 17.9%, from 20.6% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, as the Chinese Renminbi and Mexican Peso each appreciated by approximately 8% against the U.S. Dollar in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Approximately 70% of the Company’s associates and contract labor are located in the PRC and paid in Renminbi and an additional 8% is located in Mexico and paid in Pesos. Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC also issued an increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel’s factories is located. We anticipate this increase in minimum wage to result in higher labor costs of approximately $1.0 million - $1.4 million per year at this facility going forward.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)\nSG&A expenses were $20.7 million, down from $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in SG&A expenses primarily related to a $0.9 million reduction in legal and professional fees compared to the first quarter of 2017, largely offset by an increase in foreign exchange loss of $0.5 million and higher salaries and fringe benefit costs of $0.3 million.\nOperating Income\nOperating income was $0.4 million, down from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, with an operating margin of 0.4% compared to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared with a tax benefit of less than $0.1 million during the same period of 2017. This resulted in an effective tax rate of -33.2% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to an effective tax rate of -3.2% during the same quarter last year. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in the benefit arising from the losses in the North America segment due to the reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018. Additionally, there was an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions in the 2018 period. The Company continues to evaluate updates to the new tax law and may adjust its initial estimate of the transition tax throughout 2018 as further information becomes available.\nNet Earnings\nThe above factors resulted in a net loss of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared with net earnings of $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet Data\nAs of March 31, 2018, working capital was $184.1 million, including $66.9 million of cash and cash equivalents with a current ratio of 3.1-to-1. In comparison, as of December 31, 2017, working capital was $178.8 million, including $69.4 million of cash and cash equivalents with a current ratio of 3.0-to-1. Total debt at March 31, 2018 was $122.0 million as compared to $122.7 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting $0.7 million of debt repayments made during the first quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nBel has scheduled a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET today.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to such statements are: the market concerns facing our customers; the continuing viability of sectors that rely on our products; the effects of business and economic conditions; difficulties associated with integrating recently acquired companies; capacity and supply constraints or difficulties; product development, commercialization or technological difficulties; the regulatory and trade environment; risks associated with foreign currencies; uncertainties associated with legal proceedings; the market's acceptance of the Company's new products and competitive responses to those new products; our ongoing evaluation of the consequences of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports.
