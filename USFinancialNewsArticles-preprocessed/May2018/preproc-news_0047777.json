    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 12:16 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Campaigners make final pitches on eve of Ireland's abortion referendum Padraic Halpin , Graham Fahy 4 Min Read\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - The rival sides in Ireland’s decades-old battle over abortion made their final pitches to voters on Thursday, the eve of a referendum on liberalising one of the world’s strictest bans on terminations.\nVoters in the once deeply Catholic nation will be asked on Friday if they wish to scrap a prohibition that was enshrined in the constitution by referendum 35 year ago, then partly lifted five years ago for cases where the mother’s life is in danger.\nOpinion polls have put those who favour changing the law in the lead. The two most recent surveys on Sunday showed the “Yes” side pulling slightly further ahead.\n“This is a once-in-a-generation decision for the Irish people,” Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters.\n“It is an opportunity for us to change our country. If there is a ‘Yes’ vote, Ireland will still be the same place, just a place that is a little bit more compassionate, a little kinder and a little more understanding that it has been.”\n“Yes” campaigners are urging voters to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution, which equates the right to life of the mother with her unborn child’s.\nThey argue that with over 3,000 women travelling to Britain each year for terminations and others ordering pills illegally online, abortion is already a reality in Ireland.\nThe “No” camp has seized on government plans to allow terminations with no restriction up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy if the referendum is carried, although that is not on the ballot paper.\nThey have suggested in recent days that if the referendum is defeated, the constitution could instead be amended again to allow for abortions in “hard” cases such as rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality.\nVaradkar and others say this is impossible - citing advice from Ireland’s Attorney General - and have accused their opponents of trying to dupe voters. Presiding Officer Carmel McBride and Garda Alan Gallagher carry the polling box for the referendum on liberalising abortion law a day early onto the Donegal coastal island of Inishbofin, Ireland May 24, 2018.

Many posted photos of themselves wearing sweatshirts bearing the “Yes” side’s “Repeal” slogan.

My generation, my peers, are the ones who are going to be affected. I’m extremely excited to go into the polling booth and put that ‘X’ into the Ta (Yes) box.” Writing by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche",
