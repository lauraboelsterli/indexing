The bank also cut more costs in the first quarter than forecast.\nUniCredit has embarked on a restructuring after hiring French banker Jean Pierre Mustier as chief executive in mid-2016. It raised 13 billion euros early last year in one of Europe’s biggest cash calls, to fund a balance sheet clean-up.\n“First-quarter 2018 results are another tick in the box on the restructuring story — expect the stock to outperform today,” Jefferies analysts said in a note.\nUniCredit said it expected its soured loans to total 37.9 billion euros at the end of 2019, which would be an improvement on a 40.3 billion euro target set in December.\nTo meet regulatory demands, Italian banks have been shedding billions of euros in loans that had soured due to a deep recession.\nUniCredit plans to sell 4 billion euros in impaired loans this year, following a landmark 16 billion euro disposal in 2017.\nThe bank said its core capital stood at a solid 13.06 percent of assets after factoring in a new accounting rule requiring lenders to book expected losses, rather than just actual losses as previously. $1 = 0.8427 euros Reporting by Valentina Za Editing by Mark Bendeich",
