    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 10:22 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago British watchdogs fine Barclays CEO $870,000 for whistleblowing probe Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - British regulators said on Friday they had fined Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley a total of 642,430 pounds ($870,428.41) for breaching conduct rules by attempting to identify who had sent letters criticising a Barclays employee. Barclays' CEO Jes Staley arrives at 10 Downing Street in London, Britain january 11, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files\nThe fine by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority included a 30 percent discount for Staley agreeing at an early stage to settle.\nRegulators said the fine is only 10 percent of his overall pay package. While it draws a line under an episode some insiders had feared might cost him his job, Staley is the first sitting CEO of a major bank to face such a penalty.\nBarclays had no immediate comment.\n($1 = 0.7381 pounds) Barclays' CEO Jes Staley arrives at 10 Downing Street in London, Britain January 11, 2018.
