    "text": "RUFUS, Ore., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Auscrete Corporation (OTC PINK:ASCK) founder and CEO John Sprovieri, along with Otto Paulette, who has been employed with Auscrete in previous years as a production coordinator in a “key-man role,” have acquired the materials to begin the construction of the Company’s site construction office. The office will play an integral role as a temporary HQ as the flagship facility is being built. It will also be home to the engineers as the facility is being constructed.\nOnce completion of the revenue production facility is complete and the operations are re-located within the new buildings, the site construction office will look to be renovated into an efficiency studio apartment. This on-site apartment will be able to accommodate visitors, that travel to discuss potential building developments with ASCK . Initially the structure will be from wood, with external ASCK concrete panels to be added upon completion of the initial production process.\nThe aforementioned “key-man role” of Otto Paulette entails more of day to day physical duties, than the recently hired Mike Young, who joined the ASCK team as VP of Internal Operations on April the 24 th.\nMike’s responsibility in that position will reduce the workload of our CEO considerably as the company moves forward with its construction of the company HQ and Flagship Manufacturing Facility.\nMike’s duties are to assist in the acquisition of goods and services and report directly to the CEO and the Board on the ongoing progression of events going forward. He will also oversee ASCK’s financial operations and auditing obligations which will facilitate regulatory reporting to the SEC, among other necessary company duties.\nASCK Founder and CEO, John Sprovieri said, “Mike’s role will greatly enhance the future of ASCK and assist with completion of activities in the most timely and efficient manner as we move forward to revenue producing operations.”\nCEO, John Sprovieri was Quote: d as saying “the launch of the new facility could not be more exciting and timely,” as he was referenced an article at CNBC, the article states that “Housing confidence hits record high as home prices skyrocket.” 1\nOn Monday April 9 th the Auscrete Blog went live, at AuscreteBlog.com . The main purpose of the blog is to provide shareholders and potential investors alike the information and updates regarding the launch of the flagship facility in Goldendale WA. Initially, the blog will be a static blog, with the goal in the near future of becoming an inter-active blog, and linked to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. ASCK is excited to announce that during the first month of being live the blog, has been averaging 38 unique visitors per day, including weekends, and doing so before the marketing campaign for the blog even begins.\nBeing in contact with HQ and several of the board members, company spokesman Lee Odom said, “The Board of Directors and HQ have never been as excited and optimistic about the future as they are right now. And no one has more invested in the future of ASCK then them, so I feel it’s a fairly accurate barometer to read. And by the recent conversations I that I have had. I feel the future of ASCK looks to be very rewarding both in the near-term and especially for longer-term value investors, and those usually do better than speculators most of the time.”\nTo stay current with development and growth of ASCK be sure and follow the newly launched blog at AusreteBlog.com .\n1 https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/housing-confidence-hits-record-high-as-home-prices-skyrocket.html\nMedia Contact:\nHolly Marie\nExecutive Producer\nUptick Newswire, LLC\nDirect Line: 602-821-1143\nholly.marie@upticknewswire.com\nwww.upticknewswire.com\nSource:Auscrete Corp",
