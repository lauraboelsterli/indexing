    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YogaWorks, Inc. (NASDAQ:YOGA), one of the largest providers of high quality yoga instruction in the U.S., today announced its purchase of Prana Power Yoga’s three Boston-based studios, expanding the YogaWorks portfolio to 69 locations across the country.\nPrana Power Yoga was founded in 2002 by Taylor and Philippe Wells, both life-long students and practitioners of yoga. Classes range from their signature Prana Power Yoga flow to specialty classes such as Relax & Renew, prenatal and meditation. Prana Power Yoga has grown over the years to three studios and is proud to serve the thriving communities of Cambridge, Newton and Winchester.\n“We warmly welcome Prana Power Yoga’s teachers, staff and students to the YogaWorks community,” said Rosanna McCollough, Chief Executive Officer of YogaWorks, “Our goal is to maintain their wonderful variety of programming while selectively adding classes to attract students of all ages and abilities and to provide more choices. In addition, our teachers in Boston will now have even more opportunities to teach across more studios.”\nYogaWorks plans to retain current teachers and staff and maintain Prana Power Yoga’s classes, training programs and workshops as scheduled. In the upcoming months, Prana Power Yoga’s studio signage, website and mobile application will transition to YogaWorks as the Company aims to make it simpler to market to all of its students from one common brand. Students will soon be able to use their class passes at any of the six YogaWorks studios in the Boston area. Additionally, Prana Power Yoga students will receive two months of free access to MyYogaWorks.com , an online video library of over 1,100 yoga and meditation videos to help people enjoy yoga anytime and anywhere. And, as part of its investment in teachers and their continued education, YogaWorks will offer its eligible teachers a chance to take a free 100-hour YogaWorks Teacher Training course. The 100-hour program is part of YogaWorks’ world-renowned curriculum that was taught over 100 times last year across 16 countries and that has graduated some of the top teachers in the yoga industry.\n“We are excited to partner with YogaWorks as we share the same mission and values,” said Taylor Wells, co-founder of Prana Power Yoga, “We feel happy and proud to have YogaWorks step in and continue building a wonderful community of hope, love, joy and support while giving our students and teachers more opportunities for personal growth.”\nAbout YogaWorks\nYogaWorks, Inc. is one of the largest providers of high quality yoga instruction in the U.S., with 69 studios in 9 markets including Los Angeles, Orange County, Northern California, New York City, Boston, Baltimore, the Washington D.C. metro area, Houston and Atlanta.
