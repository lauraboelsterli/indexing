    "text": "Same-hospital net patient revenue grew 6.7%. Admissions increased 0.3%, adjusted admissions increased 0.6%, and revenue per adjusted admission increased 6.0%. Ambulatory Care same-facility system-wide revenue grew 2.7%, with cases up 3.2% and revenue per case down 0.5%. Surgical revenue grew 2.3%, with cases down 0.5% and revenue per surgical case up 2.8%. Conifer’s revenues increased 0.5% with revenue from third parties up 4.5%. Tenet reported net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $98 million or $0.95 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $52 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. After adjusting for certain items, which totaled $39 million or $0.38 per share in the first quarter of 2018, Tenet reported Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.57 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to an Adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.27 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $665 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $527 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 consisted of $402 million in the Hospital segment, $165 million in the Ambulatory segment and $98 million in the Conifer segment. Net cash provided by operating activities was $113 million compared to $186 million in the first quarter of 2017; the $73 million decrease was primarily due to an anticipated $82 million reduction in receipts related to the California Provider Fee program. Free Cash Flow was an outflow of $30 million, a decrease of $18 million when compared to an outflow of $12 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $4 million, a $6 million decrease when compared to $10 million in the first quarter of 2017. 2018 Outlook has been increased to reflect net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet common shareholders of $105 million to $180 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.550 billion to $2.650 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.02 to $1.75 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.36 to $1.70.\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) reported net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $98 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $52 million net loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $665 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $527 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n“The actions we have taken to be a more efficient, agile and decisive organization have resulted in stronger financial performance,” said Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, executive chairman and CEO. “We are continuing our focus on improving quality, growth and financial results and will be exploring additional opportunities to enhance margins and shareholder returns.”\nHospital Operations and Other Segment\nNet operating revenues in the Hospital Operations and other segment were $3.947 billion, down 4.1 percent from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to divestitures and a decline in health plan revenues.\nOn a same-hospital basis, net patient revenues after implicit price concessions (as discussed below in the section titled “New Revenue Recognition Accounting Rules and Uncompensated Care”) was $3.594 billion, up 6.7 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted admissions were up 0.6 percent and revenue per adjusted admission was up 6.0 percent, with 190 basis points related to the California Provider Fee and a benefit from increased acuity. Same-hospital revenue included $64 million from the California Provider Fee Program in the first quarter of 2018 compared to no revenue in the first quarter of 2017 since the 2017 program was not approved until December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Tenet’s hospital segment was $402 million, an increase of $93 million or 30.1 percent as compared to $309 million in the first quarter of 2017. The $93 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the hospital segment was primarily driven by: (i) a $64 million increase in California Provider Fee revenue, (ii) a $12 million favorable adjustment in Q1’18 to malpractice and workers’ compensation expense related to an increase in the discount rate, (iii) strong cost management within the company’s hospital operations and corporate overhead functions, and (iv) increased acuity, which were partially offset by divestiture activity.\nTenet’s health plan business recognized $6 million of revenue and a $1 million EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2018 versus $65 million of revenue and a $16 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. The revenue and expenses associated with the Company’s health plan operations are included in Tenet’s consolidated statements of operations; however, the results are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in both periods.\nSelected operating expenses in the segment, defined as the sum of salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses, increased 2.7 percent on a per adjusted admission basis in the first quarter of 2017.\nExchanges\nSame-hospital exchange outpatient visits were 49,680 in the first quarter of 2018, up 11.4 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Tenet’s same-hospital exchange admissions were 4,677 in the first quarter of 2018, down 1.1 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\nAmbulatory Care Segment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Ambulatory segment produced net operating revenues of $498 million, representing an increase of 9.5 percent as compared to $455 million in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, the Ambulatory segment generated Adjusted EBITDA of $165 million, up 7.8 percent from $153 million in the first quarter of 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA less facility-level noncontrolling interest was $109 million, up 9.0 percent from $100 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe results of many of the facilities in which the Ambulatory segment has an investment are not consolidated by Tenet. To help analyze the segment’s results of operations, management uses system-wide measures, which include revenues and cases of both consolidated and unconsolidated facilities. On a same-facility system-wide basis, revenue in the Ambulatory segment increased 2.7 percent, with cases increasing 3.2 percent and revenue per case declining 0.5 percent. In the surgical business, which represents the majority of the revenue in the Ambulatory segment, same-facility system-wide revenue grew 2.3 percent, with cases down 0.5 percent and revenue per case up 2.8 percent, reflecting growth in higher-acuity surgical procedures. In the non-surgical business, same-facility system-wide revenue grew 11.8 percent, with revenue per case up 2.8 percent and cases up 8.7 percent, reflecting strong growth in urgent care visits due in part to the elevated flu season.\nConifer Segment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Conifer’s revenue increased 0.5 percent to $404 million, up from $402 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue from third party customers grew 4.5 percent to $254 million. Conifer’s revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included $10 million of contract termination fees related to one of Conifer’s customers selling its hospital to a system that chose to insource revenue cycle management.\nConifer generated $98 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018, up 50.8 percent from $65 million in the first quarter of 2017. After normalizing for two items that increased Conifer’s Adjusted EBITDA by $13 million in the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 31 percent, primarily driven by improvements in Conifer’s cost structure. The two items totaling $13 million were the aforementioned $10 million contract termination fee and $3 million in customer incentive payments.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nTenet reported net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $98 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $52 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs shown on Table #2, net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $98 million included: (i) $47 million of pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges consisting of $19 million of impairment charges primarily from the write-down of assets held for sale in the Chicago area to their estimated fair value, $25 million of restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance associated with the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, and $3 million of acquisition-related costs; (ii) a $110 million pre-tax gain on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities, primarily related to a $98 million pre-tax gain on the sale of MacNeal Hospital in the Chicago area on March 1, 2018 and a $13 million pre-tax gain on the sales of our minority interests in several Dallas-area hospitals; and (iii) an $8 million pre-tax loss from other items. These items collectively increased pre-tax income by $55 million, after-tax income by $39 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.38.\nAfter adjusting for the items listed above and on Table #2, Tenet produced Adjusted net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $59 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to an Adjusted net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $27 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nA reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) available to Tenet shareholders to Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders is contained in Table #2 at the end of this release.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nCash and cash equivalents were $974 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $611 million at December 31, 2017. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on its $1 billion credit line as of March 31, 2018. Accounts receivable days outstanding from continuing operations were 54.3 at March 31, 2018 compared to 55.8 at December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $113 in the first quarter of 2018, representing a $73 million decrease compared to $186 million in the first quarter of 2017. After subtracting $143 million and $198 million of capital expenditures in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, Free Cash Flow was an outflow of $30 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decline of $18 million compared to an outflow of $12 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $4 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a $6 million decrease from $10 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year declines in net cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were primarily due to an anticipated $82 million reduction in receipts related to the California Provider Fee program.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $373 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $189 million of net cash used in investing activities in the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 period included $559 million of proceeds from the sales of facilities, long-term investments and other assets, primarily from the sale of the Company’s two hospitals in the Philadelphia area, MacNeal Hospital and the Company’s minority interest in several Dallas-area hospitals.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $123 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $141 million of net cash used in financing activities in the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 period included $50 million of debt retirement through open market purchases.\nReconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to both Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are contained in Table #3 at the end of this release.\nOutlook\nThe Company’s revised Outlook for 2018 includes:\nRevenue of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion, Net income from continuing operations available to Tenet common shareholders of $105 million to $180 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.550 billion to $2.650 billion, Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.245 billion to $1.550 billion, Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $725 million to $925 million, Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $1.02 to $1.75, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders of $1.36 to $1.70.\nThe Company raised the midpoint of its previous 2018 Adjusted EBITDA Outlook range by $50 million to reflect higher expectations for Conifer, primarily as a result of the business achieving improvements in its cost structure on a faster pace than previously anticipated.\nThe Outlook for 2018 assumes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $160 million to $170 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $410 million to $430 million and an average diluted share count of 103 million. The Outlook for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects a reduction in noncontrolling interest expense as a result of Tenet increasing its ownership in USPI from 80 percent to 95 percent, effective April 26, 2018, substantially offset by increased noncontrolling interest expense at Conifer resulting from our increased expectations for Conifer’s net income this year.\nThe Company’s Outlook for the second quarter of 2018 includes:\nRevenue of $4.475 billion to $4.675 billion, Net income from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders ranging from a loss of $5 million to income of $10 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $605 million to $655 million, Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders ranging from a loss of $0.05 to earnings of $0.10, and Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations available to Tenet shareholders ranging from $0.15 to $0.29.\nThe Outlook for the second quarter assumes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $35 million to $40 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $95 million to $105 million, and an average diluted share count of 102 million.\nAdditional details on Tenet’s Outlook for both the second quarter and calendar year 2018 are available in Tables #4, #5 and #6 at the end of this press release and in an accompanying slide presentation that is accessible through the Company’s website at www.tenethealth.com/investors .\nNew Revenue Recognition Accounting Rules and Uncompensated Care\nEffective January 1, 2018, Tenet adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”) using a modified retrospective method of application. For our Hospital Operations and other and Ambulatory Care segments, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 resulted in changes to our presentation for and disclosure of revenue primarily related to uninsured or underinsured patients. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts related to self-pay patients, as well as co-pays, co-insurance amounts and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance. Under ASU 2014-09, the estimated uncollectable amounts due from these patients are generally considered implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net operating revenues, with a corresponding material reduction in the amounts previously considered provision for doubtful accounts. Since implicit price concessions are essentially similar to provision for doubtful accounts, for comparability purposes with the 2017 period implicit price concessions in the 2018 quarter are compared to provision for doubtful accounts in the 2017 quarter.\nTenet’s implicit price concessions in the first quarter of 2018 were $347 million, representing a ratio of 6.9 percent of revenues before these items compared to $383 million in the first quarter of 2017, or 7.4 percent of revenues. The decrease in this ratio was primarily attributable to hospital divestitures, revenue growth in our Ambulatory segment, and revenue from the California Provider Fee program revenue being recorded in the first quarter of 2018.\nTenet’s uncompensated care costs, defined as the sum of implicit price concessions, provision for doubtful accounts, charity care write-offs and uninsured discounts, were $1.362 billion and $1.342 billion in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, including $1.015 billion and $959 million, respectively, of charity care write-offs and uninsured discounts that were offered through Tenet’s Compact with Uninsured Patients. Uncompensated care in the first quarter of 2018 represented 22.5 percent of revenue before implicit price concessions, bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care write-offs, up from 21.8 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Nearly all of Tenet’s uncompensated care is associated with the Hospital Operations and other segment.\nUninsured plus charity admissions increased by 536 admissions, or 5.9 percent on a same-hospital basis in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Uninsured plus charity outpatient visits increased by 1,806 visits, or 1.6 percent, on a same-hospital basis.\nManagement’s Webcast Discussion of First Quarter Results\nTenet management will discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results on a webcast scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time) on May 1, 2018. Investors can access the webcast through the Company’s website at www.tenethealth.com/investors . A set of slides, which will be referred to on the conference call, is available on the Quarterly Results section of the Company’s website.\nAdditional information regarding Tenet’s quarterly results of operations is contained in its Form 10-Q report for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on the Company’s website before the webcast.\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders, Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are contained in the tables at the end of this release.\nTenet Healthcare Corporation is a diversified healthcare services company with approximately 115,000 employees united around a common mission: to help people live happier, healthier lives.

(2) At March 31, 2018, 108 of the 338 facilities in the Company’s Ambulatory segment were not consolidated based on the nature of the segment’s joint venture relationships with physicians and prominent healthcare systems. Although revenues of the segment’s unconsolidated facilities are not recorded as revenues by the Company, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is nonetheless a significant portion of the Company’s overall earnings. To help analyze results of operations, management also uses system-wide operating measures such as system-wide revenue growth, which includes revenues of both consolidated and unconsolidated facilities. We control our remaining 230 facilities and account for these investments as consolidated subsidiaries. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders before (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, (2) net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (3) income (loss) from discontinued operations, (4) income tax benefit (expense), (5) other non-operating income (expense), net, (6) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (7) interest expense, (8) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries, (9) net gains (losses) on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities, (10) impairment and restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs, (11) depreciation and amortization and (12) income (loss) from divested operations and closed businesses (i.e., the Company’s health plan businesses). Litigation and investigation costs do not include ordinary course of business malpractice and other litigation and related expense.\nAdjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders before (1) impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs, (2) litigation and investigation costs, (3) gains on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities, (4) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (5) income (loss) from divested operations and closed businesses, (6) the associated impact of these five items on taxes and noncontrolling interests, and (7) net income (loss) from discontinued operations. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders divided by the weighted average primary or diluted shares outstanding in the reporting period.\nFree Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as (1) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less (2) purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as (1) Adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, less (2) purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations. Adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as cash provided by (used in) operating activities prior to (1) payments for restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs and litigation costs and settlements, and (2) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations.\nThe Company believes the foregoing non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts because they present additional information on the Company’s financial performance. Investors, analysts, Company management and the Company’s Board of Directors utilize these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP measures, to track the Company’s financial and operating performance and compare the Company’s performance to its peer companies, which utilize similar non-GAAP measures in their presentations. The Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management’s performance for the purpose of determining incentive compensation. Additional information regarding the purpose and utility of specific non-GAAP measures used in this release is set forth below.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, in part, because certain investors and analysts use both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, as factors in determining the estimated fair value of shares of the Company’s common stock. Company management also regularly reviews the Adjusted EBITDA performance for each operating segment. The Company does not use Adjusted EBITDA to measure liquidity, but instead to measure operating performance.\nWe use, and we believe investors and analysts use, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures to analyze cash flows generated from our operations because we believe it is useful to investors in evaluating our ability to fund distributions paid to noncontrolling interests, acquisitions, purchasing equity interests in joint ventures or repaying debt.\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Because these measures exclude many items that are included in our financial statements, they do not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. For example, the Company’s definitions of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not include other important uses of cash including (1) cash used to purchase businesses or joint venture interests, or (2) any items that are classified as Cash Flows From Financing Activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, including items such as (i) cash used to repay borrowings, (ii) distributions paid to noncontrolling interests, or (iii) payments under the Put/Call Agreement for USPI redeemable noncontrolling interest, which are recorded on the Statement of Cash Flows as the purchase of noncontrolling interest. Accordingly, investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s financial performance.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in Table #1 below for each quarter in 2017 and 2018. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders is set forth in Table #2 below for each quarter in 2017 and 2018. A reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is set forth in Table #3 below for each quarter in 2017 and 2018.\nTENET HEALTHCARE CORPORATION\nAdditional Supplemental Non-GAAP disclosures\nTable #1 – Reconciliation of Net Income Available (Loss Attributable) to Tenet Healthcare Corporation Common Shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions) 2017 2018 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Total 1st Qtr Net income available (loss attributable) to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders $ (53 ) $ (55 ) $ (367 ) $ (229 ) $ (704 ) $ 99 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (89 ) (87 ) (78 ) (130 ) (384 ) (92 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (1 ) 1 (1 ) 1 — 1 Income (loss) from continuing operations 37 31 (288 ) (100 ) (320 ) 190 Income tax benefit (expense) 33 12 60 (324 ) (219 ) (70 ) Loss from early extinguishment of debt — (26 ) (138 ) — (164 ) (1 ) Other non-operating expense, net (5 ) (5 ) (4 ) (8 ) (22 ) (1 ) Interest expense (258 ) (260 ) (257 ) (253 ) (1,028 ) (255 ) Operating income 267 310 51 485 1,113 517 Litigation and investigation costs (5 ) (1 ) (6 ) (11 ) (23 ) (6 ) Gains on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities 15 23 104 2 144 110 Impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs (33 ) (41 ) (329 ) (138 ) (541 ) (47 ) Depreciation and amortization (221 ) (222 ) (219 ) (208 ) (870 ) $ (204 ) Loss from divested and closed businesses (16 ) (19 ) (6 ) — (41 ) (1 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 527 $ 570 $ 507 $ 840 $ 2,444 $ 665 Net operating revenues $ 4,813 $ 4,802 $ 4,586 $ 4,978 $ 19,179 $ 4,699 Less: Net operating revenues from health plans 65 25 10 10 110 6 Adjusted net operating revenues $ 4,748 $ 4,777 $ 4,576 $ 4,968 $ 19,069 $ 4,693 Net income available (loss attributable) to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders as a % of net operating revenues (1.1 )% (1.1 )% (8.0 )% (4.6 )% (3.7 )% 2.1 % Adjusted EBITDA as a % of adjusted net operating revenues (Adjusted EBITDA margin) 11.1 % 11.9 % 11.1 % 16.9 % 12.8 % 14.2 % TENET HEALTHCARE CORPORATION\nAdditional Supplemental Non-GAAP disclosures\nTable #2 – Reconciliation of Net Income Available (Loss Attributable) to\nTenet Healthcare Corporation Common Shareholders to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nfrom Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders\n(Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts) 2017 2018 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Total 1st Qtr Net income available (loss attributable) to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders $ (53 ) $ (55 ) $ (367 ) $ (229 ) $ (704 ) $ 99 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (1 ) $ 1 (1 ) 1 — 1 Net income (loss) from continuing operations (52 ) (56 ) (366 ) (230 ) (704 ) 98 Less: Impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs (1) (33 ) (41 ) (329 ) (138 ) (541 ) (47 ) Litigation and investigation costs (5 ) (1 ) (6 ) (11 ) (23 ) (6 ) Gains on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities (2) 15 23 104 2 144 110 Loss from early extinguishment of debt (3) — (26 ) (138 ) — (164 ) (1 ) Loss from divested and closed businesses (16 ) (19 ) (6 ) — (41 ) (1 ) Tax impact of above items 14 25 26 49 114 (16 ) Tax reform adjustment — — — (252 ) (252 ) — Noncontrolling interests impact of above items — — — (23 ) (23 ) — Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ (27 ) $ (17 ) $ (17 ) $ 143 $ 82 $ 59 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.52 ) $ (0.56 ) $ (3.63 ) $ (2.28 ) $ (7.00 ) $ 0.95 Less: Impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs (0.33 ) (0.41 ) (3.26 ) (1.35 ) (5.34 ) (0.46 ) Litigation and investigation costs (0.05 ) (0.01 ) (0.06 ) (0.11 ) (0.23 ) (0.06 ) Gains on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities 0.15 0.23 1.03 0.02 1.42 1.08 Loss from early extinguishment of debt — (0.26 ) (1.37 ) — (1.62 ) (0.01 ) Loss from divested and closed businesses (0.16 ) (0.19 ) (0.06 ) — (0.40 ) (0.01 ) Tax impact of above items 0.14 0.25 0.26 0.48 1.12 (0.16 ) Tax reform adjustment — — — (2.47 ) (2.49 ) — Noncontrolling interests impact of above items — — — (0.23 ) (0.23 ) — Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.27 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (0.17 ) $ 1.40 $ 0.81 $ 0.57 Weighted average basic shares outstanding (in thousands)\n100,000 100,612 100,812 100,945 100,592 101,392 Weighted average dilutive shares outstanding (in thousands)\n100,848 101,294 101,523 101,853 101,380 102,656 (1) Impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs of $47 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 consists of $19 million of impairment charges, primarily related to our Chicago-area facilities, $25 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of acquisition-related costs.
