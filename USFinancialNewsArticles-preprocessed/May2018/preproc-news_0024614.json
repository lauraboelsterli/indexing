The primary goal of the program is to offset dilution created by the Company’s equity compensation programs.\nPurchases may be made through the open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, as determined by the Company’s management and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other conditions.\nPipeline Information\nThe Company currently has three abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, filed with the FDA targeting products with a market size of over $0.5 billion, three biosimilar products in development targeting products with a market size of over $15.0 billion, and 12 generic products in development targeting products with a market size of over $12.0 billion.

The Company is currently developing four other proprietary products, which include injectable, inhalation and intranasal dosage forms.\nCompany Information\nAmphastar is a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling technically-challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products.

The Company believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company is disclosing certain non-GAAP results, including (i) Adjusted non-GAAP net income (loss) and (ii) Adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS, that exclude amortization expense, share-based compensation, and impairment charges in order to supplement investors’ and other readers’ understanding and assessment of the Company’s financial performance, because the Company’s management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, and measuring its operating performance. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its financial results today, May 9, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.\nTo access the conference call, dial toll-free (877) 881-2595 or (315) 625-3083 for international callers, five minutes before the conference.
