    "text": "NEW YORK, WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of RPX Corp. (\"RPXC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: RPXC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by HGGC, a middle-market private equity firm. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement RPXC shareholders will receive $10.50 in cash for each share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether RPXC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $16.00 per share, or $5.50 above the offer price.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether RPXC's Board acted in the best interests of RPXC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own RPXC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
