    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EAT Club , the corporate food delivery company personalizing the way employees lunch, announced today that it has acquired the personal meal business of Bay Area-based Farm Hill. The acquisition will enable EAT Club to extend the reach of its virtual cafeteria service to a new customer base, increase employee fresh meal options, and accelerate overall company growth. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\"Farm Hill's extensive customer base, combined with its impressive offering made it the perfect choice as an acquisition target for EAT Club. Together, we will expand the EAT Club service to a larger customer footprint and solidify our leading position in the market,\" said Rodrigo Santibanez, founder and COO of EAT Club.\n\"Farm Hill has always had a mission of bringing the best quality food to the right people at the right time,\" said Farm Hill CEO and former Head of Innovation at GrubHub, Collin Wallace. \"I believe in this vision as a friend of the founders, as an investor, and now as an executive. Combining with EAT Club will allow this vision to continue to grow.\"\nAlso announced today is the appointment of longtime internet executive, Doug Leeds, as CEO. Formerly the CEO of IAC Publishing, leading storied brands Dictionary.com , Ask.com , Urbanspoon, and The Daily Beast, Leeds brings decades of hands-on leadership and internet expertise to EAT Club. Leeds also has extensive M&A experience, driving prior acquisitions of Dictionary.com , About.com , Investopedia, and more by IAC Publishing. He joins EAT Club from August Capital, where he served as an executive in residence and advised August Capital's portfolio companies. Previous experience includes executive positions with Yahoo!, Overture, Vodafone, and others.\n\"Having worked closely with Doug at August Capital, it was clear that he was the right person to take EAT Club to the next stage – from a growth-phase startup with availability in select cities to becoming the leading corporate food delivery service in major metro areas,\" continued Santibanez. \"Doug has proven his ability to scale companies at this stage in their lifecycles, with specific expertise in driving demand for internet services, M&A, and new monetization strategies.\"\nEAT Club is the only corporate food delivery service that owns every part of the customer journey – from ordering, to food preparation and procurement, to on-time delivery – all within one integrated solution. With EAT Club, employees have the power to choose their meals each day, within a tech infrastructure that meets the needs of today's businesses, including digital products for companies to customize and manage their food programs.\n\"EAT Club takes a completely unique approach from the rest of the market in feeding today's workplace by providing personal choice to hungry employees,\" said Doug Leeds, CEO of EAT Club. \"I understand firsthand just how valuable high-quality individual meals are to employee productivity, retention, collaboration, and overall company culture, having been a satisfied EAT Club customer while running IAC Publishing.\"\nEAT Club's expansive culinary offering was created by an exclusive team of talented chefs catering to a sophisticated, global palate.

EAT Club has successfully delivered more than 10 million meals to employees in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles since launch.

EAT Club was founded in 2010 by Kevin Yang and Rodrigo Santibanez after graduating from Stanford Business School. The company has raised $50M in financing from top venture capital firms including August Capital, Trinity Ventures and First Round Capital. Their most recent round of financing was led by strategic investor Sodexo to fund expansion to new markets.
