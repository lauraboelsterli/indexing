    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Highlights\nQuarterly revenue of $116.2 million Quarterly net earnings of $13.0 million, or $0.68 per share Quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $36.9 million, or 31.7% of revenue Lease fleet of 13,326 railcars as of March 31, 2018 vs. 11,869 railcars as of March 31, 2017, with 195 railcars added during the first quarter Current liquidity of $300.1 million, including $200.0 million available under revolving credit facility\nST. CHARLES, Mo., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Railcar Industries, Inc. (ARI or the Company) (NASDAQ:ARII) today reported its first quarter 2018 financial results. John O'Bryan, President and CEO of ARI, commented, \"The North American railcar market remains challenging. While the number of railcars in storage has continued to decrease, an oversupply remains in the marketplace of most railcar types, including covered hoppers and tanks, which continues to impact demand and suppress pricing. On a positive note, inquiry activity increased during the first quarter of 2018, and while customers are carefully making decisions based on economic trends, we are slowly seeing these higher inquiry levels turn into firm orders. As further evidence of this slight uptick, the industry reported quarterly orders of over 10,000 railcars for only the second time since the second quarter of 2015. To align with market conditions, we remain focused on our long-term view and our disciplined approaches to aligning production with industry demand, investing in our lease fleet, and managing costs.\nWe continue to work closely with our customers to understand and meet their needs. With our diversified lease fleet of over 13,300 railcars and our railcar services network providing a wide array of services over the life of a railcar, we are well-positioned and eager to identify and deliver solutions for the railcar industry.”\nFirst Quarter Revenue Summary\nTotal consolidated revenues were $116.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 1% when compared to $114.7 million for the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenues in the manufacturing segment and a slight increase in the railcar leasing segment, partially offset by decreased revenues in the railcar services segment.\nManufacturing revenues were $64.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 6% compared to $60.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by increased railcar shipments for direct sale for both hopper and tank railcars, partially offset by lower selling prices due to the mix of types of hopper and tank railcars shipped during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and more competitive pricing across the North American railcar market.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, ARI shipped 616 railcars for direct sale and 195 railcars for lease compared to 549 railcars for direct sale and 602 railcars for lease during the same period in 2017. Railcars built for the lease fleet represented 24% of ARI’s railcar shipments during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 52% for the same period in 2017. Due to the prevalence of lower lease rates in today's North American railcar market, the Company is maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in its lease fleet. This approach, coupled with lower demand, led to a lower rate of lease fleet shipments during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. Because revenues and earnings related to leased railcars are recognized over the life of the lease based on the terms of the contract, the Company's quarterly and annual results may vary depending on the mix of lease versus direct sale railcars that the Company ships during a given period.\nManufacturing revenues for the first quarter of 2018, on a consolidated basis, exclude $20.5 million of revenues related to railcars built for the Company's lease fleet compared to $60.1 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease in revenues related to railcars built for our lease fleet was due to lower quantities of both tank and hopper railcars shipped for lease, as discussed above. These revenues are based on an estimated fair market value of the leased railcars as if they had been sold to a third party, and are not recognized in consolidated revenues as railcar sales.\nRailcar leasing revenues were $34.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 1% compared to $33.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The primary reason for the increase in revenue was an increase in the number of railcars on lease, partially offset by a decline in weighted average lease rates for both new railcars for lease and lease renewals compared to the same period in 2017. ARI had 13,326 railcars in its lease fleet as of March 31, 2018 compared to 11,869 railcars as of March 31, 2017.\nRailcar services revenues were $18.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 11% compared to $20.1 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to overall decreased demand and lower repair revenue at the Company's tank railcar manufacturing facility as it is ramping up activity on retrofit projects. These railcar services revenues excluded intercompany revenue for lease fleet reassignment work for the Company's leased railcars that is eliminated in consolidation.\nConsolidated earnings from operations were $21.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 4% from $21.9 million for the same period in 2017. Consolidated operating margins decreased to 18.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 19.1% for the same period in 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by lower earnings from operations in the manufacturing and railcar leasing segments.\nManufacturing earnings from operations on a consolidated basis were $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 down 1% from the same period in 2017. The decrease in these earnings was primarily due to more competitive pricing and higher costs associated with lower production volumes, both partially offset by an increase in railcar shipments for direct sale. Profit on railcars built for the Company’s lease fleet was $1.4 million and $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is excluded from consolidated manufacturing earnings from operations. Profit on railcars built for the Company's lease fleet is based on an estimated fair market value of revenues as if the railcars had been sold to a third party, less the cost to manufacture. Profit on railcars built for the Company’s lease fleet decreased due to fewer railcars built for the Company's lease fleet during the first quarter of 2018.\nRailcar leasing earnings from operations on a consolidated basis were $20.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $21.5 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to increased maintenance costs and lower lease rates on certain renewals and reassignments.\nRailcar services earnings from operations on a consolidated basis were $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower demand as well as an increase in services performed on railcars in the Company's lease fleet, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to decreased bad debt expense and stock based compensation. Additionally, due to the sale of ARL in 2017, sales commissions have decreased. These decreases were all partially offset by increased compensation costs relating to additional staff hired to increase the sales and marketing team and other supporting groups in connection with transitioning lease fleet management in-house.\nNet earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $13.0 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.55 per share, in the same period in 2017. This increase was driven largely by lower income tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017 and decreased the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as increased earnings from the Company's joint ventures, partially offset by a decrease in earnings from operations as discussed above.\nEBITDA, adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and other income related to short-term investment activity (Adjusted EBITDA), was $36.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $36.1 million for the comparable quarter in 2017. This increase resulted primarily from increased earnings from joint ventures during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. A reconciliation of the Company’s net earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (both non-GAAP financial measures) is set forth in the supplemental disclosure attached to this press release.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nThe Company’s earnings have contributed to cash flow from operations in the first three months of 2018 of $30.4 million. As of March 31, 2018, ARI had working capital of $169.6 million, including $100.1 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $539.3 million of debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.6 million. The Company had borrowing availability of $200.0 million under a revolving loan.\nThe Company paid dividends totaling $7.6 million during the first three months of 2018. On April 27, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock of the Company to shareholders of record as of June 13, 2018 that will be paid on June 27, 2018.\nThe Company has not repurchased any shares of its common stock thus far in 2018 under its stock repurchase program. Board authorization for approximately $164.0 million remains available for further stock repurchases.\nBacklog\nARI's backlog as of March 31, 2018 was 3,144 railcars with an estimated market value of $279.9 million. Of the total backlog, we currently expect 259 railcars, or 8%, having an estimated market value of $25.3 million, will be placed into the Company's lease fleet.\nConference Call and Webcast\nARI will host a webcast and conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 10:00 am (Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 12,991 $ 10,568 Income tax expense 4,472 6,793 Interest expense 5,340 5,531 Interest income (419 ) (373 ) Depreciation 14,931 13,873 EBITDA $ 37,315 $ 36,392 Income related to stock appreciation rights compensation (412 ) (247 ) Other income on short-term investment activity $ — (54 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,903 $ 36,091 EBITDA represents net earnings before income tax expense, interest expense (income) and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating ARI’s operating performance compared to that of other companies in the same industry. In addition, ARI’s management uses EBITDA to evaluate operating performance. The calculation of EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall operating performance of a company’s business. EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, when analyzing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The calculation of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before share-based compensation expense (income) related to stock appreciation rights (SARs) and other income related to our short-term investments. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, and therefore uses Adjusted EBITDA for that purpose. The Company’s SARs, which settle in cash, are revalued each period based primarily upon changes in ARI’s stock price. Management believes that eliminating the expense (income) associated with share-based compensation and income associated with short-term investments allows management and ARI’s investors to understand better the operating results independent of financial changes caused by the fluctuating price and value of the Company’s common stock and short-term investments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, when analyzing operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities or other statements of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES, INC.\n100 Clark Street, St. Charles, Missouri 63301\namericanrailcar.com\n636.940.6000\nSource:American Railcar Industries, Inc.",
