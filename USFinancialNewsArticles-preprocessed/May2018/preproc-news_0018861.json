    "text": "CNBC.com Kevin Mazur | MG18 | Getty Images Nick Jonas attends the Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7, 2018 in New York City.\nNick Jonas may be a Grammy nominated musician and actor , but the 25-year-old is still careful about his money.\nIn fact, Jonas didn't even spring for an Uber and took a $2.75 ride on New York City's public subway to attend the Met Gala, according to the star's Instagram.\nThe affordable transportation is in stark contrast to the extravagance of the Met Ball, an annual party to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. Every year, celebrities who attend show off outrageous fashion on the event's red carpet.\nThough Jonas' trip was cheap, the star was wearing a suit by Dolce & Gabbana. Men's suits by the designer can cost thousands of dollars, but stars are often gifted or allowed to borrow fashion for such big events. He was also sporting a golden cross to match the event's \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination\" theme. (In 2016, Jonas wore a more affordable $100 suit by Topman to the Met Ball.)\nVia an Instagram Story, Jonas documented his ride on the 6 train to 77th Street and Lexington Avenue, People reports. On Twitter, fans spotted Jonas hopping off the train. ",
