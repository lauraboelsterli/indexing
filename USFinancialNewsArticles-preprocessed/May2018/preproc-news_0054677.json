    "text": "MILAN, May 24 (Reuters) - Two people died and 18 were injured when a regional train crashed into a lorry in the northern Italian region of Piedmont, emergency services said on Thursday.\nThe five-carriage train smashed into the lorry late Wednesday after the heavy goods vehicle broke through a level crossing and got stuck on the tracks between the towns of Rodallo and Caluso, Italy’s state train company said.\nThe drivers of both the train and the lorry were killed.\nThe local train connects the regional capital of Turin with the northern city of Ivrea.\nIt was the latest in a series of deadly accidents on Italy’s rail network.\nIn January three people were killed when a train derailed along a busy commuter route near Milan. In 2016, 23 people died when two trains collided in the southern region of Puglia. (Reporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Crispian Balmer)\n ",
