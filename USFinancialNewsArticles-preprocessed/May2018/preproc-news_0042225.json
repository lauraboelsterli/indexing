    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 11:43 AM / Updated an hour ago New owner says will sustain legacy of Cambodian newspaper Prak Chan Thul 2 Min Read\nPHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The new owner of Cambodia’s Phnom Penh Post newspaper said on Friday he had saved the English-language daily from closure and rejected fears the sale threatened media freedom. Phnom Penh Post's new owner Sivakumar Ganapathy speaks during a news conference in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Samrang Pring\nAt a news conference in the capital Phnom Penh, Malaysian investor Sivakumar Ganapathy discussed his negotiations with the Post’s former owner, Australian businessman Bill Clough, and events after the sale.\nGanapathy said his media background made it possible to continue the Post’s legacy of “fair and balanced reporting and commentary in upholding true journalistic values”.

I’d rather state the facts. Our job is to state the facts.” Reporting by Prak Chan Thul; Additional reporting and writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Darren Schuettler",
