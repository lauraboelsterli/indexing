    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Colony NorthStar, Inc. (“Colony NorthStar” or the “Company”) (NYSE:CLNS) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Central District of California, and docketed under 18-cv-03520, is on behalf of a class consisting of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Colony NorthStar securities between February 28, 2017, through March 1, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Plaintiff seeks to recover compensable damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\nIf you are a shareholder who purchased Colony NorthStar securities between February 28, 2017, and March 1, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until June 5, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.

The Company invests in healthcare, industrial, and hospitality sectors, as well as offers equity and debt management services. Colony NorthStar serves customers globally. The Company resulted from the January 2017 merger between Colony Capital, Inc., NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Colony NorthStar’s Healthcare and Investment Management segments were performing worse than reported; and (ii) as a result, Colony NorthStar’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn March 1, 2018, Colony NorthStar reported its financial and operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, announcing a goodwill impairment of $375 million, attributable to the Company’s Healthcare and Investment Management segments.\nOn this news, Colony NorthStar’s share price fell $1.78, or 22.88%, to close at $6.00 on March 1, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
