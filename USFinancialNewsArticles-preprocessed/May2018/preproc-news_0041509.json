Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Sevilla vs Real Madrid - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - May 9, 2018 Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane before the match REUTERS/Jon Nazca\nFrenchman Zidane was expected to rest first-choice players in their last game before next Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool but fielded a full-strength side against Villarreal, with the exception of the 20-year-old goalkeeper.\nThe second oldest of Zinedine’s four sons, Luca had only played two friendly games for Madrid’s first team, pre-season matches against an MLS all-star team and Serie A side Fiorentina last August.\nThe former Real midfielder’s oldest son Enzo Fernandez made one appearance for the Spanish side in last season’s King’s Cup, scoring in a 6-1 win over Cultural Leonesa. He now plays for Lausanne Sport in Switzerland.\nZidane’s youngest two sons Theo and Elyaz are part of Real’s youth set-up, creating the possibility that all four children will follow their father in turning out for the club.\nThey might struggle, however, to have the same impact as their father, who inspired Real to the 2002 Champions League and is one game away from becoming the first coach to guide them to three successive European Cups.
