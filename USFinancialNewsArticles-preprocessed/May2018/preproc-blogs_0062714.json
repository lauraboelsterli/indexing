    "text": "1:22 PM ET Wed, 16 March 2016\nMore Americans are working from home than ever before , and the trend is radically transforming how workers make, spend and save their money.\nAccording to a Gallup poll, more than 43 percent of employed Americans spend some time working remotely . This share is likely to increase over time in part because of the ways in which it can save workers and employers money. Remote job site FlexJobs estimates that working from home can save workers as much as $4,668, while Quartz calculates that telecommuters can save $2,524 a year.\nNot only does working remotely help workers cut down on costs associated with things like transportation and food, but remote roles can also offer generous compensation.
