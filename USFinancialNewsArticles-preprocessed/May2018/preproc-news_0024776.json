    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Business Development Corporation of America (“BDCA”) announced that it priced $60 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and to institutional accredited investors under Regulation D under the Securities Act. The offering is expected to close on May 16, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will mature on May 30, 2023, unless repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per year payable semiannually in arrears on May 30 and November 30 of each year, beginning on November 30, 2018.\nThe Notes will be general unsecured obligations of BDCA that rank senior in right of payment to all of BDCA’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of BDCA’s existing and future senior liabilities that are not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of BDCA’s secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that BDCA later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness incurred by BDCA’s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nThe Notes will contain certain covenants, including a covenant requiring BDCA to comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, whether or not it is subject to those requirements. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, holders of the notes can require BDCA to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Notes will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and have no sinking fund provisions.\nBDCA estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $58.7 million, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discount and estimated offering expenses payable by BDCA. BDCA expects to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness, to make investments in portfolio companies in accordance with BDCA’s investment objectives and for general corporate purposes.\nSandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. acted as initial purchaser for the offering.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes and will not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the Notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.\nThe Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nAbout BDCA\nBDCA is a non-traded business development company that primarily invests in senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of private middle-market companies.
