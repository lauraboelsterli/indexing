    "text": "Vincent Sadusky, Former CEO of Media General, Named CEO\nRandy Falco to Retire Following Eight-Year Tenure\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Univision Communications Inc. (UCI), the leading media company serving Hispanic America, and the rising, diverse American mainstream, today announced that Randy Falco will retire from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer. He will remain an advisor to the Company through the end of 2018 to ensure a smooth transition. The Board of Directors has appointed Vincent Sadusky, former Chief Executive Officer of Media General, to succeed Falco as Chief Executive Officer, effective June 1, 2018. Sadusky will also become a member of the Univision Board of Directors.\nHaim Saban, Chairman of the Board of Directors of UCI, said, “Over the last eight years, Randy has led the transformation of UCI into a modern media organization with a diverse portfolio of assets, sterling brands and content that audiences and marketers want, backed by strong earnings growth, a significantly improved balance sheet and a team of motivated and purpose-driven employees. Randy has always recognized and embraced Univision as an incredibly unique company with a mission and vision that goes well beyond traditional media. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to thank Randy for his leadership, commitment and partnership, and congratulate him on his retirement.”\nFalco commented, “Leading UCI has been one of the most personally and professionally rewarding experiences of my life. So much has changed – and will continue to change – in the media landscape but through it all one thing remains true: no other media company serves and supports Hispanic America like UCI, something that is more important than ever in our world today. I believe wholeheartedly in UCI’s mission and vision and am confident that the Company will remain on a path for continued success with Vince leading the way.”\nSadusky, 53, brings to Univision a wealth of knowledge and experience in the media industry and a track record as an effective and innovative leader. He most recently served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Media General from 2014 to 2017, where he helped build a more comprehensive, integrated and competitive offering across all of its markets for the benefit of customers, advertisers and brands. Prior to that, Sadusky served as President and Chief Executive Officer of LIN Media where he helped improve ratings, enhanced LIN’s top-rated television station operations, drove digital and subscriber growth and oversaw the expansion of local news. Sadusky also played a critical role overseeing the LIN Media’s merger with Media General. Earlier in his career, Sadusky held several executive positions at Telemundo Communications, Inc., including Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nSaban continued, “Vince is distinctly qualified to lead UCI through the next phase of its growth, given his impressive track record of leadership, vision, deep industry experience and relationships. This is a unique moment for UCI, and we believe that we have the right strategy and team in place to execute on the opportunities in front of us. On behalf of the entire Board, we look forward to working with Vince to achieve great success for UCI.”\nSadusky commented, “It’s an honor and privilege to have the opportunity to serve as CEO of UCI, a company I have long admired for its important mission to serve as a lifeline and advocate for its community, and the strong bonds it has built with its audience. I am eager to work with UCI’s talented team to enhance the Company’s leadership position and underscore its crucial role as a source of news and information. Over the last few months, UCI has taken a number of steps to evolve and thrive in today’s rapidly changing media environment and I am committed to ensuring the Company is in the best position possible to serve its audiences for decades to come.”\nUnivision continues to hold its strong leadership position as it finished as the No. 1 Spanish-language network in primetime for the 26th consecutive year during May 2018 Sweep and the 2017-2018 broadcast season, outperforming Telemundo by double-digit audience advantages among Total Viewers 2+, Adults 18-49 and Adults 18-34. Univision also ranked as the No. 1 network during primetime, regardless of language, including NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox, among Hispanic Adults 18-49, Adults 18-34 and Total Viewers 2+. Additionally, Univision Deportes Network (UDN) remains the No. 1 Spanish-language cable sports network, delivering record-breaking ratings for May in primetime, up +86% since the same time period in 2015. UDN delivered two-times more viewers Adults 18-49 than Fox Deportes, ESPN Deportes, and beIN combined in May.\nSadusky has been an active participant in the media industry throughout his career, serving as a board member of Hemisphere Media Group, the National Association of Broadcasters and NBC Affiliates. Sadusky currently serves on the board of directors of International Game Technology. He received a Master of Business Administration from New York Institute of Technology and a Bachelor of Science in accounting from Pennsylvania State University, where he was a University Scholar.\nVisit corporate.univision.com for more information on UCI, and follow @UCIPRTeam on Twitter and Instagram .\nAbout Univision Communications Inc.\nUnivision Communications Inc.
