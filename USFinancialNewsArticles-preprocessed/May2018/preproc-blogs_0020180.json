Stock movements reflect premarket trading.\nCitigroup —Up 1.1% : Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP has built a roughly $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup, The Wall Street Journal reported. It’s a bet that the giant bank’s strength as a service provider to corporations will enable it to thrive in the post-crisis era and make up ground its shares have lost in recent years.\n21st Century Fox —Up 2.7% : Cable giant Comcast is getting the pieces in place to make a hostile bid for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets should it choose to do so, Reuters first reported late Monday. Fox agreed in December to sell the assets in question to Walt Disney for $52.4 billion in stock . Disney shares were down 1.3%, while Comcast shares declined 2%.\nAmazon.com —Down 0.2% : Amazon closed up 1.2% at $1,600.14 in a third straight session of gains Monday, giving the e-commerce giant its first all-time high in almost two months. The stock needs to gain an additional 3% and reach $1,648.71 to give Amazon a market value of $800 billion for the first time.\nSnap —Up 2.2% : The social-media firm said Chief Financial Officer Drew Vollero is stepping down , leaving the social-media company that has struggled since he helped take it public last year.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International —Up 11%: The drug company plans to change its name to Bausch Health Cos., as management takes another step toward remaking the company and distancing it from past controversies. The company also reported its first organic quarterly revenue growth since 2015.\nMacy's —Up 0.3% : Shares of the department store fell 3.8% Monday, their worst day in more than three months, after Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients it sees “limited upside” for department stores.\nDish Network —Down 1.2% : Dish said sales fell 6% in the first quarter, a slightly larger drop than analysts expected, while its Pay-TV subscribers declined from a year earlier.\nDean Foods —Up 5.5% : The milk company exceeded quarterly profit and income expectations after slashing costs, while maintaining its full-year 2018 guidance.\nHertz Global Holdings —Down 9.5% : Hertz reported a steeper-than-expected first-quarter loss, though the car-rental firm’s sales increased more than analysts projected.\nAMC Entertainment Holdings —Up 1.2% : The movie theater operator said revenue rose more than Wall Street expected in the first quarter after the market closed Monday. Shares closed up 5.5%. during the regular session.\nJacobs Engineering Group —Up 1.8% : Jacobs, a Dallas-based technical services company, boosted its full-year profit guidance after topping expectations in the most recent quarter.\nZillow Group —Down 6.6% : Zillow issued a weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, though the online real estate company exceeded profit and revenue expectations in the most recent quarter.\nCrocs —Up 7.6% : The shoe company beat on earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter and gave upbeat sales projections for the current quarter.\nThis is an expanded version of the “Stocks to Watch” section of our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter.
