    "text": "I asked Apple 's Siri assistant to tell me about WWDC, Apple's developer conference that starts on June 4, and it told me it's going to get an upgrade.\n\"I don't want to brag, but I'm getting a lot smarter,\" Siri told me. \"It must be all that late night studying I've been doing...\"\nHere's a screenshot:\nTodd Haselton | CNBC Siri says it's getting an upgrade soon, probably in iOS 12. Siri didn't explain what sort of upgrades will be implemented, but Apple has some catching up to do with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.\nSiri isn't as accurate in deciding what I'm asking when compared to other assistants, for example, and isn't as good at carrying an ongoing conversation. Also, Siri often offers to search the Web for me instead of giving a straight up answer.\nThe Apple Post asked the same question and Siri said it will get a new voice during the developer conference. After I asked several times, Siri told me the same thing.\nGoogle recently introduced six new voices for its assistant , though Apple currently has several including male and female voices with American, Australian and British accents.\nApple is expected to introduce iOS 12, the next big software update for iPhones and the iPad, in addition to a new version of macOS for Macs, tvOS for the Apple TV and watchOS for the Apple Watch. Siri exists in all of those operating systems, so her new smarts may improve voice search and commands across all of Apple's platforms.\nshow chapters What happens when you ask Alexa, Google and Siri if they are spying on you 4:35 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 00:53",
