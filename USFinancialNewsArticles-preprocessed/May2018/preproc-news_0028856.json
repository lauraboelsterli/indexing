    "text": "JERUSALEM, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Intec Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: NTEC) (TASE: NTEC) (\"Intec\" or \"the Company\") today announces financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provides a corporate update.\nHighlights of the first quarter 2018 and recent weeks include:\nPresented favorable data from two Phase 1 studies of the Accordion Pill√§ Carbidopa/Levodopa (AP-CD/LD) in a poster presentation titled, \" Optimizing Delivery of Carbidopa/Levodopa via the Accordion Pill: Comparative PK and Safety from 2 Randomized Crossover Studies in Healthy Volunteers,\" at the American Academy of Neurology 2018 Annual Meeting (AAN).\nRaised approximately $37.5 million in a public offering of 6.75 million ordinary shares and 400,000 ordinary shares following the exercise of part of the underwriters' over-allotment option.\nHosted a Key Opinion Leader event highlighting the treatment landscape in Parkinson's disease and rang the Nasdaq Capital Markets Closing Bell on World Parkinson's Disease Day.\nAppointed Roger J. Pomerantz, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Seres Therapeutics, Inc. and former Worldwide Head of Licensing & Acquisitions, Senior Vice President at Merck & Co., to the Company's Board of Directors.\nPartnered with LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG (\"LTS\"), the global leader in formulation and film technology manufacture, to establish commercial scale production capabilities for AP-CD/LD in LTS' U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compliant facility in Germany.\nManagement Commentary\n\"We continue to build on the momentum established in 2017 and are pleased with our continued growth in 2018 as we made meaningful progress advancing our clinical, commercial and corporate objectives. We are especially pleased by the developments in our Phase 3 program of AP-CD/LD as a treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. To date, we have enrolled more than 350 patients and remain on track to complete enrollment of this pivotal trial later this year, with top-line results expected in mid-2019. We continue to be encouraged by the number of patients entering the open label extension study, as more than 80% of patients who completed the double-blind portion of the study have opted into the extension study. In addition, we are nearing initiation of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of the 500 mg AP-CD/LD three times a day (TID) dose in order to demonstrate the PK profile of LD provided by AP-CD/LD. This dosing regimen is one frequently used in our ACCORDANCE study and we believe this important PK data will be of interest to potential partners and for commercialization. Finally, we were delighted to present Phase 1 PK data at AAN that are supportive of our clinical development program for AP-CD/LD and demonstrated that our technology provided more consistent LD plasma levels and less peak-trough fluctuation when compared to IR-CD/LD,\" stated Jeffrey A. Meckler, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Intec Pharma.\n\"We also made great inroads with our pre-commercial activities, particularly with regard to manufacturing where we have partnered for the commercial production of AP-CD/LD at LTS' cGMP facilities in Germany. We have invested in the build-out of the commercial scale machine and expect it to be ready for delivery to LTS in the third quarter. In the meantime, a dedicated Accordion Pill manufacturing area is under construction at LTS and the scale-up and commercial manufacturing project is underway.\n\"Following on favorable PK data from our Phase 1 study of AP-CBD/THC, which combined two key components of cannabis, we are moving forward with a series of Phase 1 PK studies of each of these components alone and in combination. We will initiate the AP-THC study in the second half of 2018. We believe that exploring the individual components of cannabis provides the potential to pursue additional opportunities in target pain indications.\n\"During the first quarter we enhanced our Board with the addition of Dr. Pomerantz, expanded our executive team with the addition of Michael Gendreau, M.D., Ph.D. as Chief Medical Officer and strengthened our balance sheet with the recent $37.5 million public offering. We now have the resources to support our objectives into 2020 and the team to lead us to achieve a number of key milestones that should significantly enhance shareholder value,\" concluded Mr. Meckler.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nResearch and Development expenses (R&D), net, for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $8.9 million, an increase of $ 5.0 million, or approximately 128%, compared to approximately $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the progression of our Phase 3 ACCORDANCE clinical trial for AP-CD/LD, expenses related to the establishment of the commercial scale production capabilities for AP-CD/LD and payroll and related expenses, mostly due to an increase in headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $1.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or approximately 90%, compared to approximately $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation to employees and payroll and related expenses primarily related to the hiring of personnel in the United States and expenses related to investor relations activities.\nComprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $10.7 million, an increase of $6.0 million, or approximately 128%, compared to the Company's comprehensive loss for the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $4.7 million.\nLoss per share attributed to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.40 compared with $0.41 for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of approximately $42.8 million compared with approximately $55.2 million at December 31, 2017. The Company used net cash of $12.4 million during the first quarter of 2018, primarily for the Phase 3 ACCORDANCE trial, the construction of a commercial-scale Accordion Pill production line and repayment of $2.3 million of the Israeli Innovation Authority grants, as previously reported.\nFollowing the close of the quarter, the Company raised approximately $37.5 million in gross proceeds from a public offering of 6.75 million ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market, together with the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 400,000 ordinary shares.\nAbout Intec Pharma Ltd.\nIntec Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs based on its proprietary Accordion Pill platform technology.
