Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan speaks during an interview with Reuters at Canary Wharf in London, Britain July 7, 2015. REUTERS/Neil Hall\nRBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan made the pledge on Tuesday in response to questions from lawmakers in London on the bank’s closures in Scotland, where it was established in 1727 and is still headquartered.\nMcEwan said RBS had to respond to the growing use of online banking and fewer people using its branches, but was now “comfortable” with the size of its network in Scotland,\n“Our branches do remain a core part of our service and we will not look at the size of the network again in Scotland until at least 2020,” he told the Scottish Affairs Committee.

REUTERS/Russell Cheyne/File Photo\nBanks are closing branches to cut costs and modernise as more nimble digital lenders grow in popularity.\nRBS has been feeling the heat from critics and postponed 10 of its planned closures in Scotland pending a review.\n“You’ve taken a public relations pounding on this,” committee chair Pete Wishart said, asking whether 9 million pounds ($12.16 million) savings from the closures was worth it.\nOther committee members raised concerns about vulnerable customers and those in rural areas that might not easily be able to access other face-to-face, online or mobile services.\nHowever McEwan said the British government, which owns 71 percent of the bank, had expressed no view on the cuts other than that it was a commercial matter for the bank.\nSo far, customers had not been leaving RBS in large numbers due to closures, Les Matheson, its chief executive of personal and business banking told the committee.\n(This story corrects date to 1727 from 1772, paragraph 2) Editing by Alexander Smith",
