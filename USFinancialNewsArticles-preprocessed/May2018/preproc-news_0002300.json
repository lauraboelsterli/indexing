    "text": "BOSTON, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Block & Leviton LLP ( www.blockesq.com ), a securities litigation firm representing investors nationwide, announces that a new class action lawsuit has been filed against Lending Club Corp. (\"Lending Club\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: LC) and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal and securities laws. Class members interested in serving as lead plaintiff are reminded of the July 2, 2018 lead plaintiff deadline.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (No. 3:18-cv-02599), alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements when they stated that Lending Club customers would receive a loan with \"no hidden fees.\" On April 25, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") filed a complaint alleging that Lending Club knowingly charged consumers hidden fees, contrary to their public disclosures.\nIf you purchased Lending Club stock between May 7, 2016 and April 25, 2018 and wish to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 2, 2018. As a member of the class, you may seek to file a motion to serve as a lead plaintiff or take no action and remain an absent class member.
