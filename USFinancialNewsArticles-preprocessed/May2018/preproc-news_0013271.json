FILE PHOTO: German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits the Merck Innovation Center during the celebrations of the 350th anniversary of German pharmaceuticals company Merck in Darmstadt, Germany, May 3 ,2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has proposed reforms such as turning Europe’s existing bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) and the euro zone having its own finance minister.\nGerman newspaper Handelsblatt has reported that top politicians from Merkel’s conservatives want to pass a resolution this week to reject any pooling of debts in Europe and any fiscal policy without national parliamentary controls. It said they also opposed European Commission plans for a European finance minister. Reporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Joseph Nasr",
