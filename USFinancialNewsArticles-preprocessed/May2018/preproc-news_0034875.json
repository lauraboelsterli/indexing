    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe , founder of The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC , announces that a federal class action lawsuit has been filed against LongFin Corp. (“LongFin” or “Company”) (NasdaqCM: LFIN) and several officers and directors for acts taken during the period of December 15, 2017 and April 2, 2018 (the “Class Period”).\nBased upon the allegations in the class action, the firm is investigating additional legal claims against the officers and Board of Directors of LongFin. If you are an affected LongFin shareholder and want to learn more about the lawsuit or join the action, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or call toll free at (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nAccording to the complaint, the defendants are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose the following: (i) LongFin had misrepresented material facts about its business and operations, including the extent of its capabilities at its New York offices and the identity and qualifications of key employees; (ii) Longfin had material weaknesses in its operations and internal controls over financial reporting; (iii) Longfin was ineligible for inclusion in the Russell Indices; (iv) Longfin's lack of profitability had imperiled its ability to continue as a going concern; and (v) as a result of the foregoing, Longfin's financial statements and Defendants’ statements about Longfin's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn March 26, 2018, Citron Research posted a tweet on Twitter.com accusing the Company of inaccuracies in its financial reporting and fraud. The same day, FTSE Russell issued a statement announcing that Longfin would be removed from its global indices after market close on March 28, 2018, approximately 12 days after being added. Then, on March 27, 2018, CNBC published an article entitled “Longfin loses more than a third of its value after the controversial cryptocurrency stock is booted from the Russell 2000 index.” In the article, Meenavalli stated that Longfin would be taking legal action against Citron for its negative comments. Following each of these announcements, the Company’s stock dropped significantly.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516005345/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC",
