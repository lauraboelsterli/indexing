May 12 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods vaulted onto the leaderboard with a seven-under-par 65 in the third round at the on Saturday.\nAfter making the cut with nothing to spare on Friday, Woods teed off trailing halfway leader Webb Simpson by 14 strokes on another perfect morning for scoring at TPC Sawgrass.\nSix birdies in a front nine 30 sent waves of excitement through the large gallery at the PGA Tour flagship event.\nHowever, the 14-times major champion could not sustain that hot start, picking up a lone bogey as well as two more birdies on the inward half.\nJordan Spieth also shot 65 â€” leaving the two Americans eight-under, at 208, through 54 holes.\nSimpson was due to tee off later at 15-under, with a five-shot advantage over his nearest rivals.
