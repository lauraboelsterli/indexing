    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TearLab Corporation (OTCQB:TEAR) (“TearLab” or the “Company”) today reported its consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. currency and results are reported in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles except where noted otherwise.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nFirst quarter revenue of $6.4 million Income from operations of $0.2 million, compared to operating loss of $3.4 million in first quarter 2017 Expanded the U.S. active device base to 4,713 TearLab Osmolarity Systems Received feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the 510(k) submission for Tearlab Discovery™ Platform; plans to submit response in Q3 Launched the TearLab Osmolarity System at the 2018 Simpósio Internacional Moacyr Álvaro (SIMASP) Annual Meeting in Brazil in collaboration with Brazilian commercial partner, Adapt Produtos Oftalmológicos Amended loan agreement with CRG to defer the cash interest payments for each quarter in fiscal year 2018 and reduce the minimum liquidity requirement from $5.0 million to $3.0 million. Entered into Restated License Agreement with UCSD to reduce royalty from 5.5% to 3%, retroactive to July 1, 2017 Cash position of $7.4 million as of March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, TearLab’s net revenues were $6.4 million, a decrease of 3.8% from $6.7 million for the same period in 2017. A net total of 155 TearLab Osmolarity® Systems were added in the first quarter of 2018, of which 51 were under the Company’s Flex program and 42 were purchased outside of the United States.\nThe following table sets out the estimated annualized revenue per U.S. device and account analysis for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nAnnualized Annualized Active Active Revenue Revenue Program Devices Accounts Per Device Per Account Purchased 969 841 $ 2,461 $ 2,836 Masters 1,714 211 $ 3,105 $ 25,220 Flex 2,030 747 $ 7,528 $ 20,457 Total 4,713 1,799 The Company’s reported net loss for the first quarter was approximately $0.9 million, or ($0.09) basic loss per share which included a pre-tax reduction of approximately $0.5 million in cost of goods sold related to the Restated License Agreement with UCSD. This compared to a reported net loss of approximately $4.4 million, or ($0.82) basic loss per share in the first quarter of 2017.\n“2018 is an important year for TearLab, as we work to achieve FDA clearance for the TearLab Discovery™ System in the U.S. and execute against our new business model,” said Seph Jensen, TearLab’s Chief Executive Officer. “In the first quarter of 2018, we grew our customer base while significantly reducing operating expenses, which demonstrates the health of our core business. In addition, we launched our Osmolarity System in Brazil, Latin America’s largest dry eye market, at the 2018 SIMASP Annual Meeting with the support of our commercial partner in Brazil, Adapt. Overall it was a very positive quarter and we believe our results demonstrate the growing awareness and importance of advanced diagnostics for ocular surface disease.”\nAbout TearLab Corporation\nTearLab Corporation ( www.tearlab.com ) develops and markets lab-on-a-chip technologies that enable eye care practitioners to improve standard of care by objectively and quantitatively testing for disease markers in tears at the point-of-care.
