    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: MXWL) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $28.4 million, compared with $30.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $26.7 million for the prior year quarter. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.2 million, compared with a net loss of $8.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $10.4 million for the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.8 million, compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $7.4 million for the prior year quarter. The Company reported $(6.9) million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $(4.7) million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $(7.0) million for the prior year quarter. The Company reported $(4.2) million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $(1.8) million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $(3.9) million for the prior year quarter.\nStrategic Business Highlights\nToday Maxwell announced a technology partnership with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (\"Geely\"), the parent company of leading brands such as Volvo and Geely Auto. The collaboration kicks off with the inclusion of Maxwell's ultracapacitor-based peak power subsystem in five mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles which will initially be available in North America and Europe. The production ramp for these vehicles is slated to begin in late 2019 and marks the most significant milestone in Maxwell's automotive market history. Today Maxwell renewed a $25 million revolving credit facility with its banking partner, East West Bank, for a 3-year term, providing Maxwell with further financial flexibility to operate its business and execute on strategic investments.\n\"While our energy storage product revenue exceeded expectations for the quarter, our first quarter revenue results reflect a shortfall in orders related to our high voltage capacitor products. We expect a recovery in the high voltage product line in the second half of 2018 and overall we are anticipating revenue growth in Q2,\" said Dr. Franz Fink, Maxwell's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We continue to make progress each quarter on our strategic objectives and to build momentum in the business. Today's announcement of the Geely design win and partnership represents a significant accomplishment for the team at Maxwell and validates that ultracapacitors are ideally suited to solve many of the challenges faced by the automotive industry as it readies for the coming global megatrend of the electrification of combustion engine vehicles.\"\nFinancial Results and Operating Metrics (1)\n(Unaudited; in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017 (2)\nMarch 31,\n2017 (2)\nTotal revenue\n$\n28,416\n$\n30,763\n$\n26,686\nEnergy Storage revenue\n$\n23,002\n$\n20,832\n$\n14,234\nHigh-Voltage revenue\n$\n5,414\n$\n9,931\n$\n12,452\nGross margin (2)\n20.0\n%\n23.8\n%\n22.9\n%\nNon-GAAP gross margin (2)\n21.5\n%\n25.4\n%\n23.6\n%\nLoss from operations (2)\n$\n(9,366)\n$\n(7,065)\n$\n(9,187)\nNon-GAAP loss from operations (2)\n$\n(6,419)\n$\n(4,057)\n$\n(6,197)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n993\n$\n1,043\n$\n63\nNon-GAAP interest expense, net\n$\n554\n$\n623\n$\n63\nNet loss\n$\n(9,205)\n$\n(8,752)\n$\n(10,399)\nNet loss per share\nBasic and diluted\n$\n(0.25)\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(0.32)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(4,205)\n$\n(1,790)\n$\n(3,894)\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(5,819)\n$\n(5,324)\n$\n(7,409)\nNon-GAAP net loss per share\nBasic and diluted\n$\n(0.16)\n$\n(0.14)\n$\n(0.23)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(11,211)\n$\n(6,230)\n$\n(3,825)\nCash purchases of property and equipment\n$\n3,918\n$\n2,502\n$\n945\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n40,103\n$\n50,122\n$\n20,894\n(1) For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the section entitled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included at the end of this release.\n(2) Historical amounts have been reclassified for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 which requires the non-service cost components of income and expense related to our defined benefit plans to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of loss from operations.\nDiscussion of Financial Results for the First Quarter\nRevenue and Gross Margin\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $28.4 million, compared with $30.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by a decrease in high voltage revenue partially offset by higher energy storage revenue. Energy storage revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.0 million, compared with $20.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, related to higher revenue in the grid, non-China bus and rail markets, offset by lower revenue in the seasonally soft wind market. High-voltage capacitor revenue was $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017; the shortfall is attributable to delays in the processing of Chinese tenders for infrastructure projects as well as delays in infrastructure investment by utilities caused by uncertainty from revisions to taxes and incentives introduced by U.S. tax reform and from potential increased tariffs on steel. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 20.0% compared with 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by decreased high-voltage capacitor product sales, which generally have higher gross margins than the corporate average. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 21.5% compared with 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and excludes acquisition related intangibles amortization and stock-based compensation expense.\nOperating Expense, Interest Expense, Net Loss & Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.0 million, compared with $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven primarily by higher payroll related expense, including the annual FICA tax reset, annual merit increases and higher vacation accrual, as well as lower expense reimbursement from funded R&D programs. Non-GAAP operating expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.5 million compared with $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and other non-recurring legal costs, offset by a credit for restructuring charges due to a change in estimate. Net interest expense was approximately $1.0 million for both the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes coupon interest and non-cash interest from amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts on convertible notes issued in 2017. Non-GAAP interest expense was approximately $0.6 million for both the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, and excludes the non-cash interest mentioned above. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.2 million, or $(0.25) per share, compared with a net loss of $8.8 million, or $(0.24) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.8 million compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $(4.2) million, compared with $(1.8) million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018 were $3.9 million, compared with $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were primarily related to the Switzerland manufacturing facility expansion and equipment upgrades, the Korea manufacturing facility expansion, ultracapacitor and lithium-ion capacitor production equipment and IT infrastructure upgrades.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $28 million to $33 million. Gross margin is expected to be 20.1%, plus or minus 150 basis points. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 21.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points. GAAP operating expense is expected to be in the range of $15.1 million to $15.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be in the range of $12.6 million to $13.0 million.\nThe Company has reconciled expected GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share at the midpoint of guidance. However, the Company is not able to estimate additional potentially excluded and reconciling amounts due to the substantial uncertainties involved. The effect of these excluded items may be significant. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP second quarter outlook is as follows (in millions, except for percentages and per share data):\nProjected at\nMidpoint of Guidance\nProjected at\nMidpoint of Guidance\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2018\nJune 30, 2018\nGross Margin Reconciliation:\nTotal Operating Expenses Reconciliation:\nGAAP gross margin\n20.1\n%\nGAAP total operating expenses\n$\n15.3\nStock-based compensation expense\n1.1\n%\nStock-based compensation expense\n(2.3)\nAmortization of intangible assets (1)\n0.3\n%\nAmortization of intangible assets (1)\n(0.2)\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n21.5\n%\nNon-GAAP total operating expenses\n$\n12.8\nNet Loss Reconciliation:\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(10.4)\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(10.4)\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.7\nNon-cash interest expense\n0.4\nNon-cash interest expense\n0.4\nInterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization\n3.5\nAmortization of intangible assets (1)\n0.3\nEBITDA\n(6.5)\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(7.0)\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(3.8)\nNet Loss per Share Reconciliation:\nGAAP net loss per diluted share\n$\n(0.27)\nExpenses excluded from GAAP\n0.09\nNon-GAAP net loss per diluted share\n$\n(0.18)\n(1)\nAmortization of intangible assets is partially recorded in operating expenses and partially recorded in cost of revenue.\nWebcast Information\nAs previously announced, Maxwell management will host a live webcast at approximately 5:00 p.m. EDT / 2:00 p.m. PDT today to discuss these results.

Information presented in this press release and in the attached financial tables includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, within the meaning of Item 10 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance or cash flows that (a) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, which are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows; or (b) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, which are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nThe Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release, in its earnings conference call and in its on-going evaluation of the business: (a) non-GAAP gross profit; (b) non-GAAP operating expense; (c) non-GAAP income (loss) from operations; (d) EBITDA; (e) adjusted EBITDA; (f) non-GAAP net income (loss); (g) non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and (h) non-GAAP gross margin.\nThe definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release are presented below:\nNon-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related expense. Non-GAAP operating expense excludes the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Non-GAAP loss from operations excludes the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange loss, other income, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related costs, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense, restructuring and related costs, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs.\nThe Company believes that these measures provide useful information to its management, board of directors and investors about its operating activities and business trends related to its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company's management and board of directors use these non-GAAP financial measures in developing operating budgets and in reviewing the Company's results of operations, as non-cash items, non-recurring items and items unrelated to ongoing operating results have limited impact on current and future operating decisions. Additionally, the Company believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with its past reports of financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures are intended to supplement GAAP financial information, and may be computed differently from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. However, investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release exclude the following non-cash items, non-recurring items or items unrelated to its ongoing operating results, as applicable:\nStock-based compensation expense consisting of non-cash charges for stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase plan awards and bonuses and director's fees expected to be settled with the Company's fully vested common stock. Amortization of intangibles consisting of non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in connection with the Company's acquisition of the assets, including the operating subsidiaries, of Nesscap Energy, Inc. Non-cash interest expense consisting of amortization of convertible debt discounts and amortization of convertible debt transaction costs. Restructuring and related costs including restructuring and exit costs incurred in connection with the Company's restructuring plans. Strategic equity transaction costs consisting of expenses incurred in connection with the Company's strategic equity investment agreement with China's SDIC Fund which was terminated in the third quarter of 2017. Acquisition related expense consisting of costs incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition of the assets, including the operating subsidiaries, of Nesscap Energy, Inc. which include transaction and integration expenses as well as the fair value adjustment for acquired inventory recorded in cost of revenue. Shareholder advisement and settlement costs which represent external advisor expenses incurred in connection with preparing for the Company's 2016 and 2017 shareholder proxy and annual meeting and shareholder settlement costs. SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs which represent external legal expenses and settlement expenses related to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years 2011 and 2012, as well as for ongoing legal matters related to previous Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the section entitled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included toward the end of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nMaxwell cautions you that statements included in this news release or made on the investor conference call referenced herein that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which, if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause Maxwell's results to differ materially from historical results or those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
