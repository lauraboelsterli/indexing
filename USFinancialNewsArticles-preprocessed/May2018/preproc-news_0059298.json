    "text": "NASHUA, N.H., May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dresner Advisory Services today published the 2018 Wisdom of Crowds ® Business Intelligence Market Study. The annual report is the company’s broad assessment of the business intelligence (BI) market, providing a comprehensive look at key user trends, attitudes, and intentions.\nFor each study, users contribute their opinion on topics related to their current and planned usage and are asked to prioritize technologies and initiatives strategic to BI. This year’s report adds Information Technology (IT) analytics, sales planning, and GDPR, bringing the total to 36 topics under study. The 2018 edition also features an expanded look at the chief data officer and chief analytics officer roles, new questions around business intelligence “achievements”, and a new section examining BI product/tool replacements.\n\"Better decision-making\" remains the top BI objective for 2018. A second tier of more quantifiable objectives including “improved operational efficiency” and “growth in revenues” have gained momentum. In addition, respondents indicated greater success, budgets, and adoption of BI with a chief data officer and/or a chief analytics officer in place.\n“The Wisdom of Crowds BI Market Study is the cornerstone of our annual research agenda, providing the most in-depth and data rich portrait of the state of the BI market,” said Howard Dresner, founder and chief research officer at Dresner Advisory Services. “Drawn from first person perspective of users throughout all industries, geographies, and organization sizes, who are involved in varying aspects of BI projects, our report provides a unique look at the drivers of and success with BI.”\nThe company also announced availability of the 2018 Buyers’ Guide Edition.
