FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the funds flagship Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur, in this March 1, 2015 file photo. REUTERS/Olivia Harris/File Photo\nThe report by the Malaysian auditor general was declassified on Tuesday. A summary that was made available at the time said senior officials at scandal-plagued 1MDB withheld information from its board and took some decisions without the board’s approval.
