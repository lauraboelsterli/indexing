    "text": "Completed Substantive Strategic Initiatives to Accelerate Transformation to a Commercial Company\nConference Call and Webcast Today, May 8th, at 4:30 p.m. ET\nWATERTOWN, Mass., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EyePoint Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:EYPT), a specialty biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products, today reported operating and financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and provided a company update.\n“The acquisition of Icon Bioscience, Inc. and its FDA approved product, DEXYCU™, significantly increases EyePoint Pharmaceuticals’ revenue potential and accelerates our planned transformation to a sustainable growth company,” said Nancy Lurker, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The combination of experienced executives leading our commercial team and the additional capital from EW Healthcare and SWK positions EyePoint to successfully execute on the launch of two new products in the first half of 2019, pending favorable regulatory review of YUTIQ™. In addition, we anticipate the annual revenue potential for DEXYCU to be $150 - $200 million by the end of the third year on the market.”\nKey Recent Accomplishments\nAcquired privately-held Icon Bioscience, Inc. and its FDA approved product, DEXYCU™.\nDEXYCU was approved by the FDA on February 9, 2018, for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and is administered as a single intraocular injection at the end of surgery.\nEyePoint has expanded the DEXYCU global IP portfolio with Notices of Allowance for two additional patents, including potential claims relating to a method of treating inflammation of an eye following cataract surgery by delivering extremely small (4-6µL) amounts of dexamethasone in acetyl triethyl citrate. These two additional patents, once allowed, will extend to 2032 and 2034.\nA New Drug Application (NDA) for YUTIQ™ (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.18 mg three-year treatment for noninfectious posterior segment uveitis was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January and was accepted for filing in March with a November 5, 2018 PDUFA date.\nEyePoint has enhanced the healthcare and capital markets expertise of the Board of Directors with the appointment of Ron Eastman, a Managing Director at EW Healthcare Partners with over 40 years of experience in building healthcare companies.\nEyePoint has hired experienced executives to lead the Company’s commercial team and to ensure successful execution of the launches of DEXYCU and YUTIQ\nEyePoint presented data on YUTIQ at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2018 Annual Meeting.\nEyePoint delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange effective as of May 7, 2018.\nStrengthened Balance Sheet\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $16.3 million at March 31, 2018 and, subject to stockholder approval at a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for June 22, 2018, has capital commitments of an additional $30.5 million from EW Healthcare, a third-party investor and SWK. Therefore, the Company is currently projecting a cash balance of approximately $38.0 million at June 30, 2018, the end of its current fiscal year.\nThe Company expects these proceeds will provide the financial resources to commence the launch of DEXYCU and YUTIQ.\nNear-Term Goals and Upcoming Milestones\nGain approval of the second tranche investment by EW Healthcare at the June 22, 2018 special meeting of stockholders.\nImplement the Company’s four-pillar commercialization plan:\n-- Complete the build out of the sales organization;\n-- Implement the marketing plan;\n-- Continue to progress market access programs; and\n-- Initiate medical education initiatives.\nSecure pass-through reimbursement for DEXYCU.\nReceive FDA approval for YUTIQ based on the PDUFA action date of November 5, 2018.\nPresent data at leading medical congresses, including for YUTIQ at the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) annual meeting being held in Vancouver from July 20-25.\nLaunch DEXYCU and YUTIQ (subject to FDA approval) in the first half of calendar 2019.\nFiscal Third Quarter and Nine-Month Results\nRevenue for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, totaled $928,000 compared to $590,000 for the prior year quarter. Revenues in both periods were derived from feasibility study agreements and royalty income. Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased slightly to $5.6 million from $5.8 million a year earlier, due primarily to lower clinical trial costs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher regulatory and clinical consulting services in support of YUTIQ and higher personnel and related expenses. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $7.0 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.15 per share, for the prior year quarter.\nRevenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $2.2 million compared to $6.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The prior year period included the recognition of deferred collaborative research and development revenue totaling $5.6 million resulting from the termination of the Pfizer collaboration agreement. Excluding Pfizer, revenues from feasibility study agreements and royalty income increased to $2.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.2 million in the prior year period. Operating expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $18.7 million compared to $19.3 million a year earlier. Net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $18.7 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to a net loss of $12.4 million, or $0.36 per share for the corresponding fiscal 2017 year-to-date period. There are currently 54,029,917 common shares outstanding.\nIn connection with the first tranche EW Healthcare investment, and subject to stockholder approval, the Company agreed to issue units to EW Healthcare and a participating third-party investor, with each unit consisting of the right to purchase (a) one share of Common Stock and (b) one warrant to purchase a share of Common Stock. The purchase price of the common stock and the exercise price of the warrant are both subject to price collars that provide for either a premium or discount to the original price paid in the first tranche investment by EW Healthcare. Because of the collar, the number of units to be issued will be subject to some variability. This second tranche investment will be voted upon at a special meeting of stockholders to be held on June 22, 2018. Accounting guidance required that the future obligation to issue units in the second tranche transaction be recorded as a derivative liability and to be re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet date. As a result of the initial re-measurement, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to non-operating expense of $2.3 million as change in fair value of derivative liability for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nThe conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 312-7507 from the U.S. and Canada, or (631) 813-4828 from international locations.

( www.eyepointpharma.com ), headquartered in Watertown, MA, is a specialty biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative ophthalmic products in indications with high unmet medical need to help improve the lives of patients with serious eye disorders. The Company has developed three of only four FDA-approved sustained-release treatments for back-of-the-eye diseases. In addition, DEXYCU™ was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2018. DEXYCU, administered as a single intraocular dose at the end of ocular surgery for the treatment of postoperative inflammation, is the first and only FDA-approved intraocular product with this indication. ILUVIEN ® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant), a micro-insert for diabetic macular edema, licensed to Alimera Sciences, is currently sold directly in the U.S. and several EU countries. Retisert ® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant), for posterior uveitis, is licensed to and sold by Bausch & Lomb. The New Drug Application (NDA) for EyePoint’s lead product candidate, YUTIQ™ for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye, has been accepted for filing by the FDA and is currently under standard review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of November 5, 2018. The Company's pre-clinical development program is focused on using its core Durasert platform technology to deliver drugs to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases. To learn more about the Company, please visit www.eyepointpharma.com and connect on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google+.\nAbout DEXYCU™\nDEXYCU (dexamethasone intraocular suspension) 9% is indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Increase in Intraocular Pressure - Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Delayed Healing - The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Exacerbation of Infection - The use of DEXYCU, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is not recommended in the presence of most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures. Use of a corticosteroid in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires caution and may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to coincidentally develop with long-term local steroid application and must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Cataract Progression – The use of corticosteroids in phakic individuals may promote the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. ADVERSE REACTIONS - The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurred in 5-15% of subjects and included increases in intraocular pressure, corneal edema and iritis. Please see full Prescribing Information.\nEyePoint expects DEXYCU to be granted pass-through status and receive separate payment from Medicare for a period of three years. If after this three-year period, payments for DEXYCU are bundled into the Medicare payment for cataract surgery, the annual revenues generated from DEXYCU would be materially reduced, but if Medicare reimbursement is extended beyond three years then the Company anticipates the revenue potential of DEXYCU could be higher.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995: Various statements made in this release are forward-looking, and are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions.
