    "text": "MELVILLE, N.Y., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (\"BioRestorative\" or the “Company\") (OTC:BRTX), a life sciences company focused on stem cell-based therapies, today announced that Wayne J. Olan, M.D. has been appointed as Clinical Director of the Company’s Regenerative Disc/Spine Program. Dr. Olan had been serving on the Company Scientific Advisory Board since 2014.\nDr. Olan, a board-certified interventional neuroradiologist, is the director of endovascular and minimally invasive image guided neurosurgery in Washington, D.C. at the George Washington University Medical Center. He is also an associate professor at The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. Dr. Olan serves as a consulting physician to the White House and Congressional medical staffs and to the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Olan was the director of interventional neuroradiology at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland from 1999 to 2010. He is a member of many professional societies including the Radiological Society of North America, American College of Radiology, American Medical Association, Medical Society of District of Columbia, American Society of Neuroradiology, and American Society of Spine Radiology. Dr. Olan has over 150 published papers, posters, abstracts and lectures on endovascular treatment of cerebrovascular disorders, including the treatment of cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and the treatment of stroke. A great deal of his research has covered the interventional treatment of spinal disorders. Dr. Olan received his M.D. degree from University of Health Science, the Chicago Medical School. He completed his training in radiology and fellowship training in neuroradiology with subspecialty training in interventional neuroradiology.\nDr. Olan commented, “I am excited to join BioRestorative in an operational capacity at this exciting time in the Company’s clinical development, having received authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to commence the Phase 2 clinical trial for BRTX-100 . More than 65 million Americans suffer from lower back pain annually, and there are no approved therapies that promote disc repair and possible regeneration. For this reason, I look forward to helping advance BRTX-100 through the clinical trials and into commercialization where I believe it has the potential to become standard of care.”\nMark Weinreb, Chief Executive Officer of BioRestorative Therapies, said, “We are honored to have a medical professional of Dr. Olan’s stature join our team. He brings extensive experience in the area of spinal disorders. Having served on our advisory board since 2014, he already has an intimate knowledge of our technology and we look forward to his further contributions as we advance our clinical trials.”\nAbout BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.\nBioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ( www.biorestorative.com ) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells. Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders:\n• Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC™): Our lead cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease. The BRTX-100 production process involves collecting a patient’s bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, BRTX-100 is to be injected by a physician into the patient’s damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs.\n• Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing a cell-based therapy to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in the body may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
