Results for periods prior to the Company's ownership have not been included in the Company's actual Consolidated Financial Statements and are included only for comparison purposes. Results included for periods prior to the Company's ownership are based on information from the prior owner of each hotel and have not been audited or adjusted.\nJustin Knight, President and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Hospitality REIT, commented, “The year is off to a solid start and performance across our portfolio was generally in line with our expectations for the first quarter. While the growth of leisure travel continued to outpace corporate travel during the quarter, we are seeing indications of increasing corporate demand in many of our markets and are optimistic those trends will strengthen throughout the year. Our highly diversified portfolio is well positioned to benefit from more favorable business travel trends which allow us to drive incremental efficiencies at the property level. We continue to be optimistic about the prospects for the year and remain confident in the fundamentals of our portfolio.”\nPortfolio Activity\nOn February 5, 2018, Apple Hospitality acquired an existing 119-room Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton® in Atlanta, Georgia, and an existing 144-room Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton® in Memphis, Tennessee, for a combined total purchase price of $63 million.\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company acquired the newly built 210-room Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton® in Phoenix, Arizona, for a total purchase price of approximately $44 million.\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a contract for the potential purchase of a planned dual-branded Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton® and Home2 Suites by Hilton® property in Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a combined total of 224 guest rooms. The purchase price is approximately $47 million, and the hotels are anticipated to open in 2020. There are many conditions to closing, and there can be no assurance the hotels will be acquired.\nCapital Improvements\nApple Hospitality consistently reinvests in its hotels to maintain and enhance each property’s relevance and competitive position within its respective market. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company invested approximately $18 million in capital expenditures. The Company plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels and anticipates investing an additional $50 million to $60 million in capital improvements during the remainder of 2018, which includes various scheduled renovation projects for approximately 25 to 30 properties.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Markets\nAs of March 31, 2018, Apple Hospitality had approximately $1.3 billion of total outstanding indebtedness with a current combined weighted-average interest rate of approximately 3.7 percent for the remainder of 2018. Excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, the Company’s total outstanding indebtedness is comprised of approximately $499 million in property-level debt secured by 31 hotels and $831 million outstanding on its unsecured credit facilities. Apple Hospitality’s undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities at March 31, 2018, was approximately $369 million. The Company’s total debt to total capitalization at March 31, 2018, was approximately 25 percent, which provides Apple Hospitality with financial flexibility to fund capital requirements and pursue opportunities in the marketplace.\nShareholder Distributions\nApple Hospitality paid distributions of $0.30 per common share during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. Based on the Company’s common share closing price of $18.07 on May 3, 2018, the annualized distribution rate of $1.20 per common share represents an annual yield of approximately 6.6 percent. The Company’s Board of Directors, in consultation with management, will continue to regularly monitor the Company’s distribution rate relative to the performance of its hotels, capital improvement needs, varying economic cycles, acquisitions and dispositions. At its discretion, the Company’s Board of Directors may make adjustments as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company.\n2018 Outlook\nApple Hospitality is providing its operational and financial outlook for 2018. This outlook, which is based on management’s current view of both operating and economic fundamentals of the Company’s existing portfolio of hotels, does not take into account any unanticipated developments in its business or changes in its operating environment, nor does it take into account any unannounced hotel acquisitions or dispositions. Comparable Hotels RevPAR Growth and Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % guidance include properties acquired, as if the hotels were owned as of January 1, 2017, and exclude completed dispositions since January 1, 2017.

For more information, please visit www.applehospitalityreit.com .\nApple Hospitality REIT Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations (“FFO”); Modified FFO (“MFFO”); Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”); Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”); and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA (“Adjusted Hotel EBITDA”). These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations, or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company’s results between periods and with other REITs. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income (loss) are provided in the following pages.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\nCertain statements contained in this press release, other than historical facts, may be considered .

The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\nThe Company considers the exclusion of certain additional items from EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) useful, including (i) the exclusion of transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements), gains or losses from sales of real estate, and the loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets, as these items do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels.\nThe Company further excludes actual corporate-level general and administrative expense for the Company from Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Hotel EBITDA) to isolate property-level operational performance over which the Company’s hotel operators have direct control. The Company believes Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company’s hotels and effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA on a quarterly basis from June 30, 2016 through March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended 6/30/2016 9/30/2016 12/31/2016 3/31/2017 6/30/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Net income (loss) $ 54,718 $ 13,694 $ 41,554 $ 34,365 $ 87,606 $ 62,824 $ (2,303 ) $ 42,182 Depreciation 33,824 37,343 43,512 43,767 43,893 44,110 44,729 44,840 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 119 132 161 165 168 165 165 206 Interest and other expense, net 9,560 10,156 11,507 11,717 11,849 12,024 11,753 11,919 Income tax (benefit) expense 360 (7 ) (185 ) 250 259 203 135 163 EBITDA 98,581 61,318 96,549 90,264 143,775 119,326 54,479 99,310 Transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements) 1,116 36,452 (2,872 ) - (2,586 ) - - - (Gain) Loss on sale of real estate - - 153 - (16,140 ) 157 (312 ) - Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets - 5,471 - 7,875 - - 38,000 - Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 817 843 940 939 938 917 906 904 Adjusted EBITDA $ 100,514 $ 104,084 $ 94,770 $ 99,078 $ 125,987 $ 120,400 $ 93,073 $ 100,214 General and administrative expense 5,060 2,623 4,521 6,754 6,151 5,350 8,086 6,877 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 105,574 $ 106,707 $ 99,291 $ 105,832 $ 132,138 $ 125,750 $ 101,159 $ 107,091 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\nReconciliation of Net Income to FFO and MFFO\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), which defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the Nareit definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO (MFFO) for the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 42,182 $ 34,365 Depreciation of real estate owned 44,610 43,537 Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets - 7,875 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 206 165 Funds from operations 86,998 85,942 Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 904 939 Modified funds from operations $ 87,902 $ 86,881 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\n2018 Guidance Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThe guidance of net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that the expectations will be achieved or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in political, economic, competitive and specific market conditions; the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties; the level of capital expenditures may change significantly, which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense, interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of debt repayments may change significantly based on market conditions, which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving the Company's common stock may change based on market conditions; and other associated with the Company's business described herein and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income guidance to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nYear Ending December 31, 2018 Low-End High-End Net income $ 197,500 $ 221,100 Depreciation 183,000 181,000 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 650 650 Interest and other expense, net 51,500 49,500 Income tax expense 800 1,200 EBITDA 433,450 453,450 Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 3,550 3,550 Adjusted EBITDA $ 437,000 $ 457,000 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.
