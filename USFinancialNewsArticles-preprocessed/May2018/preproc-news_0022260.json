(NASDAQ:WMGI) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended April 1, 2018 and reaffirmed its 2018 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all net sales growth rates in this release are stated on a constant currency basis.\nNet sales from continuing operations totaled $198.5 million during the first quarter ended April 1, 2018, representing 12.0% as reported and 9.2% constant currency growth, an estimated 250 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2017 when taking into consideration the benefit from the extra four business selling days. Gross margins from continuing operations grew to 79.3% during the quarter ended April 1, 2018 and were 79.7% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the attached financial tables.\nRobert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, \"We delivered strong results across the board in the first quarter, including over 9% constant currency net sales growth, an estimated 250 basis point increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017, and we exited the quarter on a strong, positive trajectory, which we expect to continue throughout 2018. These results represent another outstanding performance in our U.S. upper extremities business, which grew 21% in the first quarter, driven by 23.5% growth in our U.S. shoulder business. We anticipate that our SIMPLICITI shoulder, our ongoing PERFORM Reversed launch and accelerating adoption of our BLUEPRINT enabling technology will continue to drive outstanding shoulder sales growth in 2018.\"\nPalmisano further commented, \"After two quarters of relatively flat to down sales versus the prior year, our U.S. lower extremities growth rate accelerated to 2.5% in the first quarter, driven by approximately 14% growth in total ankle and a return to growth in our core lower extremities business as we exited the quarter. In addition, we continued to make strong progress in our ORTHOLOC ankle and small bone fracture product launches. Most importantly, we saw an increased benefit from the sales force expansion and maturation as evidenced by the return to growth in our core lower extremities business. While we are not ready to declare victory, this positive progress and our current trajectory are very encouraging.\"\nNet loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $19.9 million, or $(0.19) per diluted share.\nThe company's net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 included an unrealized gain of $3.9 million related to mark-to-market adjustments on contingent value rights (CVRs) issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition, non-cash interest expense of $12.0 million related to its convertible notes, an unrealized loss of $1.7 million related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, $0.9 million of transaction and transition costs associated with non-cash inventory provisions, and non-cash foreign currency translation charges of $0.8 million.\nThe company's first quarter 2018 non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations, as adjusted for the above items, was $8.2 million. The company's first quarter 2018 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as defined in the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, was $26.7 million. The attached financial tables include reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $138.1 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nUpdate on U.K. Insurance Dispute\nIn September 2015, the third insurance carrier in the policy year applicable to titanium modular neck fracture claims denied coverage under its $25 million excess liability policy. The company disputed the carrier's position and, in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the policy, initiated an arbitration proceeding in London. The arbitration was completed on February 15, 2018. On April 11, 2018, the arbitration tribunal issued its ruling. Thereafter, we and the insurance carrier agreed to resolve the entire matter in exchange for a single lump sum payment by the carrier to the company in the amount of $30.75 million, representing the full policy limits of $25 million plus an additional $5.75 million for costs and interest. The company received this payment from the carrier on May 8, 2018. This insurance recovery will be reflected within the company's results of discontinued operations for the quarter ended July 1, 2018.\nUpdate on Financing\nThe company announced today that it has recently secured an additional $40 million of capacity under its existing loan agreement. Lance Berry, chief financial officer, commented, \"Earlier in the year we indicated that we would be evaluating our options for opportunistically enhancing our liquidity. The $30.75 million of proceeds from the U.K. insurance settlement, combined with the additional $40 million of loan capacity, provides us with adequate financial flexibility, and we have no further need for additional capital at this time.\"\nOutlook\nPalmisano stated, \"Overall, first quarter net sales growth improved significantly as compared to recent quarters, and we also delivered EBITDA margin expansion of 310 basis points, both of which we believe put us on a strong pathway for the remainder of the year and right on track to achieve our previously stated goal of adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% by the end of 2019. While our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, we are not ready to increase guidance at this time and are reiterating our full-year guidance, which calls for annual constant currency net sales growth of 9% to 11%, excluding the impact of the four fewer selling days in fourth quarter of 2018. I believe that we are set up well for 2018. Our end markets remain healthy and fast growing, our gross margins are outstanding, and our new product pipeline is full of innovative and commercially impactful products across all parts of our business.\"\nThe company continues to anticipate net sales for full-year 2018 of approximately $800 million to $812 million. This guidance range has approximately 1% cushion from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to current rates. In addition, this range implies full-year 2018 constant currency net sales growth of 9% to 11%, excluding the estimated $9 million impact of the four fewer selling days in fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe company continues to anticipate full-year 2018 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as described in the non-GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, to be in the range of $104 million to $111 million.\nThe company continues to expect its non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, including share-based compensation, as described in the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, for full-year 2018 to be a loss of $0.16 to $0.23 per diluted share.\nThe company estimates approximately 106.5 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for fiscal year 2018.\nThe company's non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations target is measured by adding back to net loss from continuing operations charges for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-operating income and expense. Additionally, the company's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations target excludes possible future acquisitions; other material future business developments; and due diligence, transaction and transition costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe company's non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations target is measured by adding back to net loss from continuing operations non-cash interest expense associated with the convertible notes; due diligence, transaction and transition costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures; mark-to-market adjustments to CVRs; non-cash mark-to-market derivative adjustments; non-cash gains and losses associated with foreign currency translation of balances denominated in foreign currencies; and charges for non-cash amortization expenses, net of taxes. Note that as a result of the company's relatively low effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance impacting a substantial portion of the company's income/loss, the company is currently estimating the tax effect on amortization expense at 0%. Further, this adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations target excludes possible future acquisitions and other material future business developments.\nAll of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With respect to the company's 2018 financial guidance regarding non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, however, the company cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to its inability to make accurate projections and estimates related to certain information needed to calculate some of the adjustments as described above, including the foreign currency fluctuations and market driven fair value adjustments to CVRs and derivatives. The anticipated differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are described above qualitatively.\nThe company's anticipated ranges for net sales from continuing operations, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are forward-looking statements, as are any other statements that anticipate or aspire to future events or performance. They are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated targets. The anticipated targets are not predictions of the company's actual performance.

All other trademarks and trade names referred to in this release are the property of their respective owners.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in tables later in this release. Wright's non-GAAP financial measures include net sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency; net income, as adjusted; EBITDA, as adjusted; gross margin, as adjusted; earnings, as adjusted; and earnings, as adjusted, per diluted share, in each case, from continuing operations. The company's management believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. These measures may assist investors in evaluating the company's operations, period over period. Wright's non-GAAP financial measures exclude such items as non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible notes, transaction and transition costs, net gains and losses on mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs and derivative assets and liabilities, net non-cash gains and losses on foreign currency translation all of which may be highly variable, difficult to predict and of a size that could have substantial impact on the company's reported results of operations for a period. It is for this reason that the company cannot provide without unreasonable effort a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for its 2018 financial guidance regarding non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Management uses the non-GAAP measures in this release internally for evaluation of the performance of the business, including the allocation of resources and the evaluation of results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release includes forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
