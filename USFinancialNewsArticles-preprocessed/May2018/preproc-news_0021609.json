Employee compensation and benefits expenses were $637 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared with $582 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily a result of the growth in revenues for the fiscal year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses were $721 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 9% when compared with $662 million in adjusted operating expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expenses were $612 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared with $556 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase in adjusted employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily a result of the growth in revenues for the fiscal year. This resulted in an adjusted compensation ratio of 63.5% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, versus 63.8% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-compensation expenses were $112 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared with $108 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Non-compensation expenses increased primarily as a result of higher general operating expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted non-compensation expenses were $109 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared with $106 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

The significant decrease in the effective tax rate was a result of (i) the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the \"Tax Act\") that was enacted into law in December 2017 that resulted in a lower effective federal tax rate; the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new tax rate; a one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, among other discrete items and (ii) the positive difference between the price of the stock at the time of vesting in October 2017 (accelerated from April/May 2018) and our stock price at the time of grant for the shares that vested. The adjusted provision for income taxes was $85 million, representing an adjusted effective tax rate of 35% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared with $81 million, representing an adjusted effective tax rate of 39% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was a result of a lower statutory federal tax rate per the Tax Act.\nTotal operating expenses were $185 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of 7% when compared with $200 million in operating expenses for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. Employee compensation and benefits expenses were $156 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $171 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily a result of (i) the decline in revenues and (ii) a lower compensation ratio in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with the same period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses were $181 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of 5% when compared with $191 million in adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expenses were $153 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $164 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in adjusted employee compensation and benefits expenses was primarily a result of the decline in revenues for the quarter. This resulted in an adjusted compensation ratio of 62.6% for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, versus 63.7% for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-compensation expenses were $29 million for both the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. Non-compensation expenses remained flat primarily due to increases in general operating expenses that were offset by a decline in costs related to the Company's completed secondary stock offerings quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted non-compensation expenses were $28 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $27 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. The slight increase in adjusted non-compensation expenses was primarily a result of higher general operating expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nThe provision/(benefit) for income taxes was $23 million, representing an effective tax rate of 37% for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $22 million, representing an effective tax rate of 40% for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017.

The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was a result of a lower statutory federal tax rate per the Tax Act.\nSegment Reporting for the Fourth Quarter\nFor the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, Corporate Finance revenue grew 13% to $130 million, compared with $115 million during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. The growth in revenues was driven by an increase in the average transaction fee per closed transaction offset by a decline in the number of closed transactions. CF closed 56 transactions in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, versus 62 transactions in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. Segment profit equaled $48 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $28 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017. Segment profitability increased primarily as a result of lower employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues when compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Twelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Corporate Finance Revenues $129,820 $115,075 $528,643 $434,558 Segment Profit¹ 47,886 28,222 177,575 119,739 # of MDs 92 87 92 87 # of Closed Transactions 56 62 226 216 For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2018, Financial Restructuring revenue decreased 25% to $78 million, compared with $104 million during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2017.
