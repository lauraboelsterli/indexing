    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN) today announced the appointment of Franck Risler as a Senior Managing Director in the Economic Consulting segment, enhancing the firm’s financial markets expertise. He will be based in New York.\nMr. Risler has more than 20 years of experience innovating and driving development in trading, investment and risk management across various asset classes. He has a deep and advanced knowledge of financial institutions and banking, financial risk-management and commodity trading. At FTI Consulting, he will join a dedicated structured advisory team that offers integrated and executable strategies for trading and investment firms and financial services clients more broadly in a wide range of areas, including transactions (M&A/MBOs/IPOs), transformation and business improvement, risk advisory and quantitative solutions and special situations (restructuring, disputes, litigations and arbitrations).\n“Franck has a proven track record of partnering with senior management teams to build successful managed risk-controlled investment businesses and develop cutting-edge infrastructures to support the investment process,” said Chris Osborne , Global Leader of the Economic Consulting segment at FTI Consulting. “His derivatives and commodity trading industry expertise and risk management capabilities will be a significant benefit to our clients as we continue to enhance our strength in financial services.”\nMr. Risler joins FTI Consulting from Laplace Capital Partners, a derivatives-focused multi-asset alternative investment manager where he was the Founder and Chief Investment Officer. He co-developed Laplace’s formal investment process, which prioritizes proprietary risk-management methodologies and risk-focused investment strategies.\nBefore founding Laplace in 2009, he held several roles at CIBC World Markets, including Global Head of Interest-Rate Trading, Global Head of Macro Trading, Global Head of Hybrid and Equity Structured Derivatives and Co-Head of Global Commodity Trading. A primary focus for Mr. Risler at CIBC World Markets was the control and design of all derivatives modeling and trading technology undertaken by the bank in every asset class and location, leading to the merging of all pricing and risk management onto a single firmwide infrastructure. The cutting-edge trading system — xTrader — that Mr. Risler developed at CIBC became and still is the trading and risk-management system in place for all derivatives businesses for all asset classes globally at the bank.\n“I have had the pleasure to work with FTI Consulting’s Economic Consulting and Corporate Finance professionals on numerous engagements, and I have been impressed by the depth and strength of talent in the organization; they are one of the leading teams in the world,” Mr. Risler said. “I am excited by the opportunity to join the team and advise global financial institutions and trading firms on some of the most complex risk-management and trading challenges, as well as designing and implementing fully thought-out executable solutions and innovative strategies for our clients.”\nMr. Risler earned his Ph.D. in numerical mathematics from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay and a master’s of science in management from ESSEC Business School in France. Mr. Risler has published several papers on numerical algorithms in international scientific journals (including “Contemporary Mathematics” and “Numerical Algorithms,” among others) and was awarded the Seymour Cray Prize of France in 1997 for his work in the field of Numerical Mathematics and High-Performance Computing.\nAbout FTI Consulting\nFTI Consulting, Inc. is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political & regulatory, reputational and transactional.
