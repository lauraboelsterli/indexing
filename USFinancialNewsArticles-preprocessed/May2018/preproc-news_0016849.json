    "text": "NEW YORK, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sutherland Asset Management Corporation (\"Sutherland\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SLD) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nNet income of $18.5 million, or $0.56 per share of common stock Core earnings of $15.5 million, or $0.47 per share of common stock Adjusted net book value of $16.88 per share of common stock as of March 31, 2018 Originated $211.6 million of small balance commercial (\"SBC\") loans Originated $48.3 million of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") under its Section 7(a) loan program Originated $439.0 million of residential mortgage loans Acquired $142.2 million of SBC loans\nHighlights Subsequent to Quarter End:\nIssued $50.0 million in aggregate principal of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2021\nA summary of Sutherland's operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 is presented below. Sutherland reported U.S. GAAP net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $18.5 million, or $0.56 per share of common stock, and Core Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $15.5 million, or $0.47 per share of common stock.\nThomas Capasse, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"We are pleased with our team's ability to deploy capital by growing new loan originations and identifying accretive portfolio acquisition opportunities with the potential to generate outsized returns, which we benefitted from this quarter. As a result, our quarterly per share earnings increased by $0.18 per share over the fourth quarter. As we move further into 2018, we continue to be focused on growing our core origination platform while sourcing opportunistic acquisitions.\"\nThe Company issued a full detailed presentation of its first quarter 2018 results, which can be viewed in the investor relations section at www.sutherlandam.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release includes Core Earnings which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Core Earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized or realized gains (losses) related to certain mortgage backed securities, unrealized gains (losses) related to residential mortgage servicing rights, and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains or merger related expenses.\nThe Company believes that providing investors with this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because Core Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Core Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\n(In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet Income\n$\n18,518\nReconciling items:\nUnrealized loss on mortgage-backed securities\n79\nUnrealized (gain) on mortgage servicing rights\n(4,155)\nTotal reconciling items\n$\n(4,076)\nCore earnings before income taxes\n$\n14,442\nIncome tax adjustments\n1,047\nCore earnings\n$\n15,489\nWebcast and Earnings Conference Call\nManagement will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 8:30 am ET to provide a general business update and discuss the financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
