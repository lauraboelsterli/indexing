    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 5:44 AM / Updated 9 hours ago NFL notebook: Texans' Watson 'on schedule' for training camp Reuters Staff 4 Min Read\nDeshaun Watson is progressing well in his rehab from major knee surgery, prompting Houston Texans coach Bill O’Brien to declare the quarterback is on schedule to be ready for training camp in late July. Dec 10, 2017; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson (4) talks with San Francisco 49ers quarterback C.J. Beathard (3) after a game at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\nWatson was experiencing a stellar rookie campaign before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a practice on Nov. 2.\nO’Brien told the NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football” on Monday that the budding star has repeatedly made big strides while rehabbing the knee.\n“He’s doing a good job in his rehab,” O’Brien said. “I think he’s on schedule to be able to participate in training camp. We’re excited about that.”\n—Washington Redskins defensive back DeAngelo Hall is retiring after 14 NFL seasons, telling reporters, “I’m done. ... “I’m not playing,” and that he is considering offers to join a front office or work in television.\nHall, 34, was the eighth overall pick by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2004 NFL Draft. He played his first four seasons for the Falcons, intercepting 17 passes. Hall was traded to the Oakland Raiders in 2008 for a second-round pick and agreed to a seven-year, $70 million contract with $24.5 million guaranteed.\nHowever, he was released on Nov. 5 of that year after playing just eight games for the Raiders, though he did intercept three passes. Hall signed a one-year contract with the Redskins three days later. Hall went on to play 10 seasons for Washington, intercepting 23 passes in 106 games and transitioning to free safety during the 2015 season.\n—Hue Jackson plans to pay up on his leap of faith in the Cleveland Browns by taking a plunge in Lake Erie.\nJackson said he would jump in the lake if the Browns went 1-15 again after finishing with that record in 2016. Then the Browns went 0-16, and before new general manager John Dorsey assured Jackson he would return, the coach said he would make good on his promise.\nPrior to Monday, no date was set, but the Browns are making the private, fundraising event happen June 1. Jackson said the swim will benefit The Hue Jackson Foundation to end human trafficking in the Cleveland area.\n—After an offseason of trade rumors, an agent change and a minicamp no-show, New York Giants offensive lineman Ereck Flowers has reportedly returned to the club.\nAccording to multiple reports, Flowers arrived at the team’s facility Monday, his first appearance during the offseason program of new Giants coach Pat Shurmur.\nThe Giants also announced six players were signed and six waived on Monday. Among those signed were offensive lineman Chris Scott, who has played in 45 games, and cornerback Chris Lewis-Harris, who has appeared in 33 games. Both veterans were out of the league last season after playing in 2016.\n—Denver Broncos running back De’Angelo Henderson was briefly hospitalized after an auto accident on Saturday night, he disclosed on his Instagram account.\nHenderson’s Jeep was one of several vehicles struck by a driver attempting to elude police after the vehicle was reported as stolen earlier in the day. Henderson was transported to a hospital and was treated and released. He sustained scrapes and bruises. Henderson expressed thanks to rescue personnel, police and others in his social media post on Monday.\n—Field Level Media",
