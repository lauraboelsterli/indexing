    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 3:41 PM / Updated an hour ago Ecuador's Carapaz goes solo to win Giro stage as Yates stays in pink Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Ecuador’s Richard Carapaz went solo in the finale to claim the Giro d’Italia eighth stage, a 208-km ride from Praia a Mare, as Briton Simon Yates retained the overall lead on Saturday.\nMovistar rider Carapaz jumped away from the main group some 2km from the finish in a steep final ascent and whizzed past breakaway rider Koen Bouwman.\nHe crossed the line seven seconds ahead of Italian Davide Formolo, in second, and overall contender Thibaut Pinot of France, who collected four seconds in time bonuses when he took third place.\nYates of the Mitchelton-Scott team was never bothered as he rode safely in the main pack to stand 16 seconds ahead of defending champion Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands in the general classification.\nBritain’s four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome fell off his bike in the final climb but did not appear to sustain any injury.
