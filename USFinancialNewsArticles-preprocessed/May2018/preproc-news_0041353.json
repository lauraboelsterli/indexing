    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 6:17 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Luxembourg seeks Malaysia talks over frozen 1MDB cash -sources Michele Sinner 2 Min Read\nLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Authorities in Luxembourg hope Malaysia’s new government may offer new information on some $100 million (£74.2 million) from investment fund 1MDB that Luxembourg froze two years ago in a money-laundering probe, judicial sources told Reuters.

REUTERS/Olivia Harris/File Photo\nConfirming for the first time on Friday that such a sum had been blocked in the Grand Duchy after Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild was fined one year ago over money-laundering, the sources said that Luxembourg was keen to pursue inquiries now the new government is looking into troubles at the state fund.\nDays after the electoral downfall of Malaysia’s long-time ruling coalition and of premier Najib Razak, new prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has pushed an investigation into scandal-plagued 1Malaysia Development Berhad, amid accusations Najib benefited from money from a former entity of 1MDB.\nNajib denies wrongdoing.\nIn June 2017, Edmond de Rothschild and Luxembourg officials said the bank was fined nearly 9 million euros (£7.8 million)for shortcomings in money-laundering controls. On Friday, the Luxembourg sources said that authorities froze $100 million in the case a year earlier but had not until now been able to determine what to do with the funds due to a lack of information from Malaysia.
