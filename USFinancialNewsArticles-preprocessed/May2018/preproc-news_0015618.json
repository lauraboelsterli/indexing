    "text": "Published: May 7, 2018 8:32 p.m. ET Share\nTrump’s legal team has undergone a makeover over the past two months, with Rudy Giuliani now assuming the dominant public role Reuters Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said, “every day we swing a little different” on whether to advise President Donald Trump to talk to special counsel Robert Mueller.\nBy Peter Nicholas\nLawyers advising President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation hope to decide whether he should testify by May 17, the one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday.\nTrump’s legal team has long been divided on whether he should agree to a sit-down interview with Mueller, a decision that exposes him to legal perils but also could hasten the end of an investigation that has shadowed his presidency.\nIn an interview, Giuliani said, “every day we swing a little different” on whether to advise Trump to talk to Mueller, though he suggested that recent developments in the probe have made him more leery.\nThe president’s initial position was “what do I have to lose? I’m telling the truth,” Giuliani said. But Trump has also promised to weigh his lawyers’ advice.\nIn a tweet on Monday, Trump made clear his displeasure with the prosecutors running the Russia probe, describing them as “13 Angry Democrats.” He went on to suggest he might raise an issue with the courts about “unrevealed conflicts of interest” inside the Mueller team. The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018\nMueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential race. He is also examining whether Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI Director James Comey a year ago. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction, while Russia has denied interfering in the election. ",
