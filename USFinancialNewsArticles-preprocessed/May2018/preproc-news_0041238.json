    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Prosper, a leading peer-to-peer lending platform connecting borrowers and investors, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Loan originations increased 27% year-over-year to $744 million, driven by strong demand for the company’s personal loan product and stable funding.\nFinancial highlights include:\nTotal Net Revenue, which includes the non-cash impact related to warrants to purchase preferred stock, was flat year-over-year at $30.5 million in Q1 2018 compared to $30.8 million in Q1 2017. Core Revenue (1) , which excludes the non-cash impact related to warrants to purchase preferred stock, increased $11.6 million or 34% year-over-year to $45.7 million in Q1 2018 compared to $34.2 million in Q1 2017. Net Loss decreased by $12.6 million to ($11.4) million in Q1 2018 compared to a Net Loss of ($24.0) million in Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased $13.6 million to $4.5 million in Q1 2018 compared to ($9.0) million in Q1 2017, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA (1) generated by Prosper.\nDuring the quarter, Prosper continued to further diversify its funding sources. The company closed its fourth and largest securitization to date from the Prosper Marketplace Issuance Trust, Series 2018-1 (PMIT). With the closing of this approximately $650 million transaction that featured a pre-funding account, Prosper has now co-sponsored over $2 billion in securitizations across four transactions with over 50 unique participating investors. Prosper also closed its first $100 million committed revolving warehouse facility, allowing the company to invest in loans originated through the Prosper platform alongside our investors.\n“We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we balanced strong growth with a continued emphasis on driving efficiencies across the business, diversifying our investor base and continuously improving the customer experience,” said David Kimball, CEO, Prosper Marketplace. “The consumer credit sector continues to present attractive opportunities for us to grow and invest in our personal loan business and also launch new products over time.”\nThe following table summarizes the financial highlights from the quarter:\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics (Unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Loan Originations $ 744,127 $ 585,590 Transaction Fees, Net 31,354 26,869 Servicing Fees, Net 7,184 6,154 Total Net Revenue 30,450 30,845 Core Revenue (1) 45,729 34,152 Net Loss (11,401 ) (24,021 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) 4,520 (9,039 ) (1) Core Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.
