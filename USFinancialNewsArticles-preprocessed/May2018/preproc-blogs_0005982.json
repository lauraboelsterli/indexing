    "text": "Spotify is on pace for its worst day since going public last month â€” dropping more than 10 percent the day after its first earnings report .\nShares opened at $154.12 after closing Wednesday at $170.\nThe music streaming service reported better-than-expected earnings but seemed to lose investors on lighter guidance.\nSpotify went public last month with its unconventional direct listing, offering the public its first look at the company's subscriber base and ad revenue.\nIt cautioned Wednesday during the earnings report that growth could slow in subsequent quarters.\nAs of Thursday's open, the stock was down 7 percent from its debut trade of $165.90.",
