    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Entravision Communications Corporation (NYSE: EVC) today reported financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nHistorical results, which are attached, are in thousands of U.S. dollars (except share and per share data). This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each of these non-GAAP financial measures, and a table reconciling each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included beginning on page 9. Unaudited financial highlights are as follows:\nThree-Month Period\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nNet revenue\n$\n66,838\n$\n57,510\n16\n%\nCost of revenue - digital media (1)\n10,625\n1,752\n506\n%\nOperating expenses (2)\n44,327\n38,292\n16\n%\nCorporate expenses (3)\n5,975\n5,867\n2\n%\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA (4)\n6,937\n12,570\n(45)\n%\nFree cash flow (5)\n$\n1,590\n$\n7,265\n(78)\n%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(1,808)\n$\n2,618\n*\nNet income per share, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.02)\n$\n0.03\n*\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding, basic\n90,319,092\n90,236,476\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding, diluted\n90,319,092\n91,760,531\n(1)\nCost of revenue â€“ digital media consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. Media cost is classified as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized.\n(2)\nOperating expenses include direct operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in operating expenses are $0.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Operating expenses do not include corporate expenses, foreign currency (gain) loss, depreciation and amortization, impairment charge, gain (loss) on sale of assets, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, other income (loss) and change in fair value of contingent consideration.\n(3)\nCorporate expenses include $1.0 million and $0.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(4)\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA means net income (loss) plus gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses, net interest expense, other income (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments, revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings. We use the term consolidated adjusted EBITDA because that measure is defined in the agreement governing our current credit facility (\"the 2017 Credit Facility\") and does not include gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation, net interest expense, other income (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments, revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings.\n(5)\nFree cash flow is defined as consolidated adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for income taxes, net interest expense, and capital expenditures plus dividend income and revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related cash expenses. Net interest expense is defined as interest expense, less non-cash interest expense relating to amortization of debt finance costs, and less interest income.\nCommenting on the Company's earnings results, Walter F. Ulloa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"During the first quarter, we achieved revenue growth driven by increases in our digital media segment attributable to the acquisition of Headway. This growth in our digital media segment offsets decreases in both our television and radio segments, which were affected by decreases in local and national advertising revenue compared to 2017. We continued to build our digital footprint, while undertaking an extensive review of our business in order to more efficiently align operations and reduce costs. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to build on our success in further attracting Latino and other audiences worldwide, and expanding our advertiser base to the benefit of our shareholders.\"\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Company announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.05 per share of the Company's Class A, Class B and Class U common stock, in an aggregate amount of approximately $4.5 million. The quarterly dividend will be payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 14, 2018, and the common stock will trade ex-dividend on June 13, 2018. As previously announced, the Company currently anticipates that future cash dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis; however, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be subject to approval by the Board.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the extension of its share repurchase program announced in August 2017 with a repurchase authorization of up to an additional $15 million of the Company's common stock, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $30 million. Under the new share repurchase program, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or negotiated purchases, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nFinancial Results\nThree-Month Period Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\nThree-Month Period\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nNet revenue\n$\n66,838\n$\n57,510\n16\n%\nCost of revenue - digital media (1)\n10,625\n1,752\n506\n%\nOperating expenses (1)\n44,327\n38,292\n16\n%\nCorporate expenses (1)\n5,975\n5,867\n2\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,939\n3,546\n11\n%\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\n2,100\n-\n*\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n213\n-\n*\nOperating income (loss)\n(341)\n8,053\n*\nInterest expense, net\n(2,485)\n(3,536)\n(30)\n%\nDividend income\n128\n-\n*\nOther income (loss)\n22\n-\n*\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(2,676)\n4,517\n*\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n930\n(1,899)\n*\nNet income (loss) before equity in net income\n(loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n(1,746)\n2,618\n*\nEquity in net income (loss) of\nnonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax\n(62)\n-\n*\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(1,808)\n$\n2,618\n*\n(1)\nCost of revenue, operating expenses and corporate expenses are defined on page 1.\nNet revenue increased to $66.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $57.5 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $9.3 million. Of the overall increase, approximately $14.2 million was attributable to our digital segment and was primarily due to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to our results of operations in the prior year period. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our television segment of approximately $3.2 million primarily due to decreases in national and local advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in retransmission consent revenue and an increase in political advertising revenue, which was not material in 2017. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our radio segment of approximately $1.6 million primarily due to decreases in local and national advertising revenue.\nCost of revenue in our digital media segment increased to $10.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $1.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $8.8 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to cost of revenue in the prior year period.\nOperating expenses increased to $44.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $38.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $6.0 million. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Headway in our digital segment during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to operating expenses in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in salary expense and an increase in expenses related to the acquisition of station KMIR-TV in the fourth quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to operating expenses in the prior year period.\nCorporate expenses increased to $6.0 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $5.9 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.1 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nSegment Results\nThe following represents selected unaudited segment information:\nThree-Month Period\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nNet Revenue\nTelevision\n$\n34,491\n$\n37,710\n(9)\n%\nRadio\n14,103\n15,719\n(10)\n%\nDigital\n18,244\n4,081\n347\n%\nTotal\n$\n66,838\n$\n57,510\n16\n%\nCost of Revenue - digital media (1)\nDigital\n$\n10,625\n$\n1,752\n506\n%\nOperating Expenses (1)\nTelevision\n21,522\n20,205\n7\n%\nRadio\n15,280\n15,721\n(3)\n%\nDigital\n7,525\n2,366\n218\n%\nTotal\n$\n44,327\n$\n38,292\n16\n%\nCorporate Expenses (1)\n$\n5,975\n$\n5,867\n2\n%\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n6,937\n$\n12,570\n(45)\n%\n(1)\nCost of revenue, operating expenses, corporate expenses, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA are defined on page 1.\nEntravision Communications Corporation will hold a conference call to discuss its 2018 first quarter results on May 8, 2018 at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.
