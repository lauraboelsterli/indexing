    "text": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EnviroStar, Inc. (NYSE American:EVI) reported record results for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018. Record revenues of $44 million and $106 million during the three and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018, respectively, reflect revenues generated by recently acquired businesses as well as revenue growth from historical operations.\nIn addition to these results, during the third fiscal quarter, EVI continued to execute its buy and build growth strategy through the addition of AAdvantage Laundry Systems and Sky-Rent LP. The effective execution of EVI’s buy-and-build growth strategy has led to growth in the Company’s operations and market capitalization, which has required the Company to invest and incur expenses in certain areas that support this and future growth. More notably, EVI believes that its growth and execution has won the confidence of many entrepreneurs with businesses in and around the commercial laundry industry, resulting in increased acquisition and other growth opportunities for the Company.\nThird Quarter Results\nRevenue increased 77% to a record $44 million Gross Margins increased from 23% to a record 26% Operating Income increased 26% to $1.9 million Net Income increased 28% to $1.1 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 45% to $2.8 million or 6.3%\nNine Month Results\nRevenue increased 57% to a record $106 million Gross Margins increased from 22% to 24% Operating Income increased 17% to a record $5.1 million Net Income increased 25% to a record $3.2 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 47% to $7.3 million or 6.9%\nHenry M. Nahmad, EVI’s Chairman and CEO, stated, “EVI delivered another record quarter with strong revenues, increased gross margins, and the addition of two high-quality companies. While we continue to aggressively pursue the addition of new businesses to the EVI Family, our team of successful entrepreneurs is focused on creating growth for EVI and each of our businesses.”\nIt is important to note that the timing of revenue recognition related to the sale and installation of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products is occasionally impacted by delays related to installation schedules.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn this release, EVI discloses the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which EVI defines as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and amortization of share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and amortization of share-based compensation to net income, as shown in the attached Condensed Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Amortization of Share-based Compensation). EVI considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of its operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings, and the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flow, derived in accordance with GAAP, or to any other method of analyzing EVI’s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, EVI’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to definitions of Adjusted EBITDA or other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAbout EnviroStar\nEnviroStar, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, distributes commercial, industrial and vended laundry and dry cleaning equipment and steam and hot water boilers manufactured by others, supplies related replacement parts and accessories, provides installation and maintenance services to its customers, and designs and plans turn-key laundry, dry cleaning and boiler systems for its customers, which include institutional, retail, industrial, commercial and government customers.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nExcept for the historical matters contained herein, statements in this press release are forward-looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
