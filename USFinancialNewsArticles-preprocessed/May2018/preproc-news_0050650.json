    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 10:36 AM / Updated 20 minutes ago British court dismisses charges against Barclays over 2008 capital raise Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - A British court has dismissed charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) against Barclays ( BARC.L ) over its 2008 capital raising, Barclays said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Barclays bank is seen on glass lamps outside of a branch of the bank in the City of London financial district in London September 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nAs part of the fundraising the bank was alleged to have given Qatari investors an illegal loan which was then used to prop up its shares during the banking crisis.\nCharges against Barclays and its operating subsidiary were dismissed but the SFO is likely to try and reinstate them by applying to the High Court, Barclays said.\nSeparately four former Barclays bankers face charges brought by the SFO over the same matter.
