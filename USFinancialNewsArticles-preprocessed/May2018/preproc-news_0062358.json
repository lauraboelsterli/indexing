    "text": "LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - British supermarkets were boosted by the royal wedding and warm weather in the 12 weeks to May 20, industry data showed on Wednesday, with third and fourth placed Asda and Morrisons outperforming their bigger rivals.\nKantar Worldpanel said the country’s second biggest grocer Sainsbury’s posted the lowest sales growth and continued to lose market share.\nSainsbury’s, which last month announced plans to acquire no.3 Asda, posted sales growth of 1 percent in the period, behind market growth of 2.7 percent, and its market share dropped 0.2 percentage points to 15.7 percent, according to the Kantar Worldpanel data.\nThe country’s biggest grocer Tesco posted sales growth of 2.2 percent, with sales at Walmart-owned Asda up 2.8 percent, and no.4 player Morrisons posting a 2.9 percent rise.\n“The sun shone on the grocery market over the past month with record-breaking temperatures, a bank holiday weekend and Royal Wedding fever all contributing to a bumper period,” Kantar’s consumer specialist Chris Hayward said on Wednesday.\nSales of BBQ-related foods like sausages and burgers soared, as did demand for sun cream, Kantar said.\nReporting by Sarah Young, editing by Paul Sandle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
