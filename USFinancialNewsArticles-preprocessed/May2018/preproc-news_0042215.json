    "text": "Rick Horrow digs into David Tepper’s deal to buy the Carolina Panthers but on the more genteel side of sports, Octagon entertainment’s Andy Bush says a field of increasingly demanding sponsors means deal-making is tougher than ever.\nRick Horrow is the CEO of Horrow Sports. As an attorney and consultant, he has been the architect of 100+ deals worth more than $20 billion in sports, performing arts, and other urban infrastructure projects. Horrow pioneered the public/private partnership and infrastructure branding concepts that, to date, have enticed more than $4 billion in corporate funding to cities and development projects. The opinions expressed here and in videos and podcasts hosted by Rick are his alone and do not represent the views of Reuters.\n ",
