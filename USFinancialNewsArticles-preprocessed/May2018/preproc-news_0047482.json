    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 10:21 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Real as hungry as ever, Zidane warns Liverpool Joseph Casinelli 2 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has warned Liverpool that his side are as hungry as ever to win the Champions League, rejecting claims that the Spanish giants might have lost their edge ahead of Saturday’s final in Kiev. Soccer Football - Champions League - Real Madrid Training - Real Madrid City, Madrid, Spain - May 22, 2018 Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane during training REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nThere have been some suggestions that Real, having won the past two finals, might not be as motivated as Liverpool, with the English club not having tasted European glory since 2005.\n“I can’t talk for the opponents, but we always have the same desire as we always do and nobody can say we don’t,” Zidane told a news conference.\n“We’re in a third final and we have the chance to do something historic and win it three times in a row. You can’t say Liverpool have more hunger than us; it simply isn’t true.\n“Nobody can take our hunger away from us. We’re Real Madrid ... We always want more and will always give our all to get more.”\nThe Frenchman also said that his side’s experience of playing in and winning three finals in the past four years will have no bearing on the outcome. By comparison, no player in the Liverpool squad has reached this stage of the competition before. Related Coverage",
