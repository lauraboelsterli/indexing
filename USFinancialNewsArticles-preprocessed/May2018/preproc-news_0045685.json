    "text": "BRISTOL, Tenn., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Contura Energy, Inc., a leading U.S. coal supplier, today reported results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nHighlights include:\nNet Income from continuing operations of $58 million for the first quarter 2018 compared with $31 million in the same period last year (1) Adjusted EBITDA of $99 million for the quarter compared with $119 million in the same period last year (1) Announced all-stock transaction with ANR, Inc. and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. (together, \"Alpha\") on April 30, 2018 In conjunction with the Alpha transaction closing, Contura expects to list its common shares on the NYSE\n(millions, except per share)\nFirst Quarter\n2018 (1)\nFirst Quarter\n2017 (1)\nCoal revenues (2)\n$402.7\n$413.0\nNet Income from continuing operations\n$58.3\n$31.0\nNet Income per diluted share\n$5.66\n$2.89\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)\n$99.0\n$119.4\nOperating cash flow (4)\n($30.3)\n$142.2\nCapital expenditures\n$19.4\n$11.8\nTons of coal sold\n3.8\n4.3\n1. Excludes discontinued operations.\n2. Excludes the freight and handling portion of coal revenues.\n3. These are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA is included in tables accompanying the financial schedules. Contura's Adjusted EBITDA calculation has been modified to add back non-cash stock compensation expense to align with industry peer group methodology.\n4. Includes discontinued operations.\n\"Despite encountering weather-related transportation delays at the port and by rail, continued strong performance across our organization resulted in another solid quarter for our company,\" said Kevin Crutchfield, chief executive officer. \"We followed that performance with an important merger announcement with Alpha to create a premier, U.S.-based metallurgical coal supplier with both organic growth potential and immediate global reach. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Contura.\"\nFinancial Performance\nCoal revenues in the first quarter were $402.7 million, with Central Appalachia (CAPP) metallurgical coal revenues accounting for $134.6 million and Trading and Logistics (T&L) accounting for $206.7 million. On the thermal side, Northern Appalachia (NAPP) coal revenues totaled $61.5 million. Comparatively, in the first quarter 2017, CAPP revenues were $148.7 million and T&L revenues were $166.7 million with NAPP accounting for $97.7 million of the $413.0 million in total coal revenues. The above coal revenues exclude the freight and handling portion of coal revenues.\nFreight and handling revenues and other revenues were $75.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in the first quarter 2018 compared with $60.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in the prior year period.\nCAPP coal shipments for the first quarter 2018 were 1.0 million tons at an average per-ton realization of $141.06, compared to 1.1 million tons at $140.58 per ton in the prior year first quarter. Contura shipped 1.4 million tons of NAPP coal during the quarter at an average per-ton realization of $43.46, down from 2.2 million tons at $44.39 per ton in the first quarter 2017. NAPP volumes were impacted by a longwall move in February and inclement weather during the first quarter 2018. In the Trading and Logistics segment, the volume increased from 1.1 million tons in the prior year period to 1.4 million tons in the first quarter 2018, while the average Trading and Logistics realization decreased from $158.57 per ton to $142.63 per ton during the same period.\nTotal costs and expenses during the first quarter were $414.5 million and cost of coal sales was $297.5 million, compared with $383.5 million and $284.4 million, respectively, in the same period a year ago. The cost of coal sales in CAPP for the quarter averaged $82.04 per ton, up from $74.75 in the prior year period. The CAPP cost includes $2.32 per ton in idle costs. Increased costs in the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year period were associated with CAPP having a significant amount of higher-cost purchased coal activity in the quarter, increasing costs by approximately $4.00 per ton. The remaining variance was mainly driven by company-wide wage adjustments enacted in the second quarter 2017 due to labor pressures related to the robust metallurgical coal market. In addition, a qualified non-elective 401(k) contribution was made to employees in the first quarter of 2018. NAPP costs at $38.72 per ton were impacted by a longwall move and inclement weather during the quarter. NAPP costs included idle costs of $0.94 per ton. In the year ago period, NAPP cost of coal sales averaged $29.54 per ton. In the Trading and Logistics segment, the cost of coal sales during the first quarter was $113.54 per ton, improved from $133.99 per ton in the first quarter 2017. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter were $19.2 million, which includes approximately $4.5 million in non-cash stock compensation and $2.4 million related to incentive bonus plans. In addition, the first quarter SG&A includes $2.7 million in management restructuring costs and the qualified non-elective 401(k) contribution of $0.5 million. In the year ago period, SG&A was $13.8 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was $11.6 million during the first quarter and amortization of acquired intangibles was $10.2 million, compared with $8.8 million and $19.7 million respectively, in the same period last year, excluding discontinued operations. Contura reported net income from continuing operations of $58.3 million, or $5.66 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2018. In the first quarter 2017 the company had net income from continuing operations of $31.0 million or $2.89 per share. Total adjusted EBITDA was $99.0 million for the first quarter, compared with $119.4 million in the prior year quarter, adjusted to remove impact of discontinued operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash used in operating activities, including discontinued operations, for the first quarter 2018 was $30.3 million and capital expenditures for the first quarter were $19.4 million. Working capital, including a $100.1 million increase in accounts receivable and a $27.1 million increase in inventories, offset by $10.2 million provided by accounts payable, was the driving factor for the use of cash during the quarter. A 24% increase in the Trading and Logistics revenues in the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period last year and transportation delays were the main contributing factors for the inventory and accounts receivable build. We anticipate the majority of working capital build to reverse in the second quarter as Trading and Logistics activity normalizes and transportation returns to normal status. In the prior year period, the cash provided by operating activities was $142.2 million and capital expenditures were $11.8 million. Capital expenditures of $1.0 million from discontinued operations is excluded from the prior year total.\nAt the end of March, Contura had $72.1 million in unrestricted cash. Total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt as of March 31, 2018, was approximately $372.0 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had total liquidity of $185.8 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $72.1 million and $113.7 million of unused commitments available under the Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility.\nAll-Stock Transaction with Alpha\nOn April 30, 2018, the company jointly announced a definitive merger agreement with ANR, Inc. and Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. (together, \"Alpha\"), which is expected to create the largest metallurgical coal supplier in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement providing for the all-stock transaction, Alpha shareholders will receive 0.4071 Contura common shares for each ANR, Inc. Class C-1 share or Alpha Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. common share they own, representing 46.5% ownership in the merged entity.\nConcurrent with the transaction, Contura is expected to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe combined entity, which will continue operating under the Contura name, will be led by Contura's existing management team and the board of directors is expected to be composed of the five current Contura board members and four current Alpha board members. The transaction is expected to generate synergies in the range of $30 million to $50 million annually and to close in the third quarter of 2018.\n2018 Full-Year Guidance\nNone of the guidance ranges described herein include any potential effects of the transaction with Alpha, which is expected to close some time in the third quarter of this year.\nThe company is increasing its shipment guidance for 2018 and now expects total coal shipments to be in the range of 15.8 million to 17.2 million tons, up from the previously announced 15.0 million to 16.8 million tons. CAPP metallurgical coal guidance remains at 3.7 million to 4.1 million tons, while guidance for the Trading and Logistics segment is increased from a range of 4.2 million to 5.0 million tons up to a range of 5.0 million to 5.6 million tons. NAPP shipments, sold primarily into thermal markets, are now anticipated to be between 7.1 million and 7.5 million tons in 2018, compared with the previously announced 7.1 million to 7.7 million tons.\nAs of May 8, 2018, 49% of the midpoint of anticipated 2018 CAPP coal shipments were committed and priced at an average expected per-ton realization of $128.20, with an additional 32% committed and either unpriced or priced based on various indices. Based on the midpoint of guidance, 83% of anticipated 2018 NAPP coal shipments were committed and priced at an average expected per-ton realization of $41.84. NAPP committed and priced tons are adjusted to reflect the expected outcome of a May 18, 2018 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Ohio by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) and certain subsidiaries to reject a coal supply contract between Contura Coal Sales, LLC and FES' subsidiary, FirstEnergy Generation, LLC.\nContura is increasing its 2018 CAPP cost of coal sales per ton from a range of $68.00 to $73.00 to a range of $70.00 to $75.00 to reflect the expected strength in the met coal markets through the balance of the year, which will result in increased sales-related costs such as third-party royalties and severance taxes. In addition, the company expects to engage in increased purchased coal activity for the remainder of 2018. NAPP cost estimates are projected to be between $29.00 to $33.00 per ton. Additionally, costs related to the company's idle operations are expected to be between $10 million and $12 million for full-year 2018.\nThe margin from Contura's Trading and Logistics platform is expected to average $9 to $15 per ton for the full-year 2018.\nContura's capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $64 million to $74 million, while SG&A guidance is estimated at $32 million to $36 million, excluding one-time and non-recurring items, annual incentive bonus and stock compensation. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for 2018 is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The company expects 2018 cash interest expense to be between $25 million and $27 million.\nin millions of tons\nLow\nHigh\nCAPP\n3.7\n4.1\nNAPP\n7.1\n7.5\nTotal Production\n10.8\n11.6\nContura Trading & Logistics\n5.0\n5.6\nTotal Shipments\n15.8\n17.2\nCommitted/Priced 1,2,3\nCommitted\nAverage Price\nCAPP 4\n49%\n$128.20\nNAPP\n83%\n$41.84\nCommitted/Unpriced 1,3\nCommitted\nCAPP 4\n32%\nCosts per ton\nLow\nHigh\nCAPP\n$70.00\n$75.00\nNAPP\n$29.00\n$33.00\nMargin per ton\nLow\nHigh\nContura Trading & Logistics\n$9\n$15\nIn millions (except taxes)\nLow\nHigh\nSG&A 5\n$32\n$36\nIdle Operations Expense\n$10\n$12\nCash Interest Expense\n$25\n$27\nDD&A\n$40\n$50\nCapital Expenditures\n$64\n$74\nTax Rate\n0%\n5%\nNotes:\nBased on committed and priced coal shipments as of May 8, 2018, with NAPP Committed/Priced tons adjusted to reflect the expected outcome of a May 18, 2018 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Ohio by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.

Committed percentage based on the midpoint of shipment guidance range. Actual average per-ton realizations on committed and priced tons recognized in future periods may vary based on actual freight expense in future periods relative to assumed freight expense embedded in projected average per-ton realizations. Includes estimates of future coal shipments based upon contract terms and anticipated delivery schedules. Actual coal shipments may vary from these estimates. CAPP committed tons and price information represent captive Contura production and does not include Trading and Logistics.

The company uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operating performance of its segments and allocate resources to the segments. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes various items detailed in the attached reconciliation tables.\nThe definition of this non-GAAP measure may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends. This measure is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, it is presented as a supplemental measure of the company's performance that management finds useful in assessing the company's financial performance and believes is useful to securities analysts, investors and others in assessing the company's performance over time. Moreover, this measure is not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nCONTURA ENERGY, INC.
