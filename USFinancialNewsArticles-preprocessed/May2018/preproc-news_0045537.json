    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 9:41 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Commentary: Hedge funds exit crude oil but stay bullish on fuels John Kemp 4 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - For all the bullish commentary about oil prices at the moment, hedge fund managers have continued to take profits after the recent rally and are trimming their net long positions rather than adding to them. A crude oil terminal under construction is pictured off Ningbo Zhoushan port in Zhejiang province, China January 6, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer\nFocusing on what people do rather than what they say is one of the most important lessons for any good analyst (actions always speak louder than words).\nHedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 16 million barrels in the week to May 15.\n(Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Li5RO7 )\nFund managers have cut their net long position in the petroleum complex in each of the last four weeks by a total of 71 million barrels, according to records published by regulators and exchanges.\nLiquidation has been concentrated in crude oil, where the net long position in Brent and WTI has been reduced by a total of 124 million barrels over the last four weeks.\nNet long positions in Brent have fallen by 84 million barrels over five consecutive weeks, while net length in NYMEX and ICE WTI has dropped by 53 million over four weeks.\nBut, while portfolio managers have been reducing their bullish exposure to crude, they have been boosting their net long positions in refined fuels.\nNet length in refined fuels has risen by 53 million barrels since the middle of April, with increases in U.S. gasoline (+26 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+24 million) and European gasoil (+2 million).\nPortfolio managers have accumulated record net positions of 124 million barrels in U.S. gasoline and 160 million barrels in European gasoil, as well as a near-record 86 million barrels in U.S. heating oil.\nThe rotation of positions from crude to fuels reflects strong consumer demand and shrinking inventories of products, coupled with profit-taking in crude oil after a strong rally since the end of June 2017.\nThe rotation away from crude also likely explains the weakening of the nearby calendar spreads in Brent in recent trading sessions.\nThe first three contract months nearest to expiry account for more than 42 percent of all open contracts in Brent futures and options, according to the Intercontinental Exchange.\nAssuming hedge fund positions are distributed in the same proportion, then the liquidation of hedge fund positions will have been concentrated in nearby months.\nIn fact, hedge funds tend to focus disproportionately on nearby contracts, where liquidity and turnover is greatest, so the impact of hedge fund selling on nearby months will have been magnified.\nMomentum-following funds are especially likely to focus on nearby contract months because of the greater liquidity.\nAs hedge funds accumulated a record long position in Brent and WTI between June 2017 and the first three months of 2018, the concentration of buying nearby helped push futures prices deeper into backwardation.\nBut as fund managers trim those positions, it has removed much of the support for nearby prices, and caused the backwardation to narrow sharply.\nJohn Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.\nRelated columns:",
