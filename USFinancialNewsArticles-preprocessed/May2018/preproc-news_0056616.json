Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nHeadlines\nU.S. lawmakers vote to give regulatory relief to smaller banks on.ft.com/2s3EVcT\nAmazon under fire over facial recognition software on.ft.com/2s1c6h4\nDonald Trump casts doubt on summit with Kim Jong Un on.ft.com/2rZvon8\nOverview\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed on Tuesday bipartisan legislation that would ease bank rules introduced in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, giving President Donald Trump a major legislative victory.\nU.S. civil liberties groups on Tuesday called on Amazon.com Inc to stop offering facial recognition services to governments, warning that the software could be used to target immigrants and people of colour unfairly.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was a “substantial chance” his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons.
