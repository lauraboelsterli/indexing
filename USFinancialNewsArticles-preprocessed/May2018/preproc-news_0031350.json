    "text": "May 15 (Reuters) - Blue Sky Alternative Investments on Tuesday said it expected its full-year net profit after tax to fall by about A$7 million ($5.3 million), following a review of its asset valuations in the wake of damaging allegations by a shortseller.\nBlue Sky completed the first phase of an independent review of its asset valuations it announced last week, resulting in certain assets reducing in value, it said in a statement.\nThis comes after the asset manager pulled its guidance last week as it looks to regain shareholders’ trust following the allegations.\nBlue Sky has seen over A$600 million knocked off its market capitalisation since U.S.-based Glaucus Research Group alleged in March it had overstated its size, exaggerated its performance and over-valued assets.
