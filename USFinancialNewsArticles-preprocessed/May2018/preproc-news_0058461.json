Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 28, 2018 Paraguay's Veronica Cepede Royg during her first round match against Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nThe Czech, who suffered career-threatening injuries on her playing left hand after being attacked in her home by a knife-wielding intruder in December 2016, arrived in Paris on the back of an 11-match winning streak.\nBut Cepede Royg came close to snapping that run as she edged 5-4 and 0-15 ahead on Kvitova’s serve in the third set. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 28, 2018 Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova in action during her first round match against Paraguay's Veronica Cepede Royg REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nBut the woman who proved even her surgeon wrong by coming back to play top left tennis just five months after the attack unleashed three successive aces to survive that scare.\nShe was soon saluting the crowd with a raised clenched-fist as she broke in the next game before wrapping up victory to set up a second-round meeting with Spain’s Lara Arruabarrena.
