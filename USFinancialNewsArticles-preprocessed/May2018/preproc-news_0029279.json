    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 7:36 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago European shares weighed by BT, utilities, but banks gain Danilo Masoni 3 Min Read\nMILAN (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Thursday as a flurry of company results rolled in with losses in BT following a disappointing update and weighed down further by a weakness among utilities stocks. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Tilman Blasshofer\nGains in RBS ( RBS.L ) following a multi-billion deal to settle a U.S. investigation of the bank’s bond sales, and a solid update from Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) buoyed the banking sector, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 steady by 0748 GMT.\nBT ( BT.L ) shares fell 7.1 percent after saying it was cutting 13,000 jobs, the latest attempt by Britain’s biggest telecoms group to rebuild after an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading.\nTraders said its latest update showed a disappointing guidance, while Jefferies analysts highlighted that the company missed on the opportunity of announcing a bolder mover of fiber roll out while job cuts were bigger then expected.\n“No evidence of inflection in results or mindset,” said Jefferies.\nRBS rallied 5.5 percent after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities.\nAnalysts, who had estimated the U.S. could impose a fine of up to $12 billion, said the bank could reinstate a dividend.\nGains in RBS helped the UK's FTSE .FTSE edge ahead 0.2 percent, outperforming other European bourses ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting expected to keep interest rates on hold.\nStill in banks, UniCredit rose 2.7 percent after it posted its best first-quarter result since 2007, topping forecasts with a 1.1 billion euro net profit thanks to lower-than-expected loan losses.\nItaly's FTSE MIB .FTMIB fell as much as 0.7 percent, as bond yields jumped on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties will take power. The index however recovered ground and was up 0.2 percent.\nTop movers on the STOXX also included precious metals miner Randgold ( RRS.L ), down 6.6 percent after its quarterly profit fell, while Next ( NXT.L ) rose 5.7 percent after a strong outlook and trading update.\nUtilities were a weak spot, down 0.8 percent to lead sectoral losers in Europe, weighed by a disappointing update at Italy’s Enel ( RRS.L ) Reporting by Danilo Masoni, editing by Larry King and Richard Balmforth",
