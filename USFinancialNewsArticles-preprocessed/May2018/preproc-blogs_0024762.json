Where students choose to begin these lives is one of the biggest decisions they can make.\nLinkedIn analyzed their job postings and found that 10 cities stood out for recruiting and hiring the most entry-level professionals. They further assessed their data to determine the companies in those cities that hired the most recent graduates in 2017 as well as the industries leading this demand.\nWhen it comes down to it, the number one thing that college graduates are looking for is employment, and these are the places new grads are most likely to find it.\nCheck out the 10 cities with the most entry-level jobs:\nBill Hinton | Getty Images Seattle, Washington 10.

Financial services companies like EY, PwC and Goldman Sachs were among the biggest employers of young people in the city that never sleeps.\nAccording to LinkedIn, San Francisco has the second most jobs for entry-level workers, thanks to companies like Google, Salesforce and Apple.\nThe information technology and services industry is driving significant demand for recent grads in cities across the country. Seven of the 10 cities with the most entry-level jobs had major IT sectors.\nGiven trends like these, it is no wonder that students are beginning to gravitate towards business and tech-centered areas of study. Across the country, the most popular major is business , with over 364,000 business majors graduating in 2015.\nColleges are also currently witnessing a boom in the number of computer science majors. However, this uptick has not been enough to keep up with industry demand for recent college grads with computer science skills, so if students want a job at one of these hubs for young professionals, they should start studying tech now.\nLike this story?
