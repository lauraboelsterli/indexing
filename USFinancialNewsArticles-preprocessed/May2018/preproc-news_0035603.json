SANUWAVE executives were able to divide and conquer around the globe to ensure the display of the dermaPACE ® System at all four critical exhibitions.\n“We are elated and humbled by the outpouring of interest, support for the dermaPACE ® System,” stated Kevin A. Richardson II, Chief Executive Officer of SANUWAVE. “SANUWAVE met with hundreds of doctors, nurses and global healthcare professionals while receiving over four hundred leads for interest in device leasing, ownership and continued clinical study work. Our global objective of Healing Today, Curing Tomorrow may yield results sooner than we think.”\n4 conferences in attendance:\n2018 SAWC (Symposium on Advanced Wound Care) Conference in Charlotte, NC on April 25 – 29. In addition to the exhibitor’s session, SANUWAVE was selected to present the dermaPACE ® System at the new product showcase.\n2018 CAET (Canadian Association for Enterostomal Therapy) 37th National Conference Educational Program “Turn Knowledge into Action” on May 3 – 6, 2018 in Victoria, British Columbia.

Revenues resulted primarily from sales in the United States and Europe of our dermaPACE ® and orthoPACE ® devices and related applicators. The increase in revenues for 2018 was due to first sale of dermaPACE ® devices and applicators in the United States after obtaining FDA approval and slight increase in refurbishment applicator sales.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1,300,066, compared to $718,064 for the prior period, an increase of $582,002. Research and development expenses increased by $89,106, as a result of hiring of a full-time software engineer, accrual of bonus for 2018 and a grant given to a university for clinical work to be performed. General and administrative expenses increased by $497,000, due to hiring of a human resources director, higher travel costs, accrual of bonus for 2018, recruiting fees for open positions, higher legal and accounting fees related to SEC filings and higher consultant fees related to the commercialization of dermaPACE ® .\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5,856,655, or ($0.04) per share, compared with a net loss of $493,532, or ($0.00) per share for the same period in 2017, which is an increase in the net loss of $5,363,123. The increase in the net loss for 2018 was a result of higher interest expense related to convertible promissory notes, an increased loss on warrant valuation, and increase in operating expenses discussed above.\nOn March 31, 2018, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of $154,205 compared to $730,184 as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of $575,979. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash used by operating activities was $1,848,553 and $114,884 respectively, primarily consisting of compensation costs, research and development activities and general corporate operations. The increase in the use of cash for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period for 2017, of $1,733,669 was primarily due to the increased operating expenses and decreased payables in 2018. Net cash used by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 consisted of purchase of property and equipment of $7,720. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,279,371 which consisted of $1,159,785 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, $94,058 net from note payable, product, $13,528 from the exercise of warrants and $12,000 from the advances from related parties for exercise of warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $77,066 from exercise of warrants.\n“The first quarter reflects the beginning of our investment in the future with new hires and increase in exposure on a world wide basis with our participation in multiple tradeshows,” stated Kevin A. Richardson II, Chairman of the Board of SANUWAVE. “We expect continued growth over last year as we continue to market our products both domestically and abroad,” concluded Mr. Richardson.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, beginning at 9:00AM Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter financial results, provide a business update and answer questions.\nShareholders and other interested parties can participate in the conference call by dialing 877-407-8033 (U.S.) or 201-689-8033 (international) or via webcast at http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/29632 .\nA replay of the conference call will be available beginning two hours after its completion through May 30, 2018, by dialing 877-481-4010 (U.S.) or 919-882-2331 (international) and entering Conference ID 29632 and a replay of the webcast will be available at http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/27265 until August 16, 2018.\nAbout SANUWAVE Health, Inc.\nSANUWAVE Health, Inc.
