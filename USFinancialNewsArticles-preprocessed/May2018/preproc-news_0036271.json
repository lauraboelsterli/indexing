    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 10:26 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Singapore Airlines beats expectations with highest profit in seven years Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd on Thursday topped market expectations by reporting a 148 percent rise in full-year net profit to the highest level since 2011, as passenger and cargo revenue rose and it benefited from a transformation programme. A Singapore Airlines (SIA) Airbus A350-900 passenger aircraft taxis to a gate at Changi Airport in Singapore April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Tim Chong/Files\nThe carrier, a benchmark for Asiaâ€™s premium airlines, made S$893 million ($665.62 million) in the year ended March, up from S$360 million a year ago and 28 percent higher than the S$697 million average forecast from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe airline, like Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, has undertaken a three-year transformation programme designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers.\n($1 = 1.3416 Singapore dollars)",
