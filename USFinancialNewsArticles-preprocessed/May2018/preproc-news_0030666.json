In addition, the firm offers physician concierge support, as well as optimization services and outsourced build services.\nThe transaction expands Cumberland’s managed services capabilities for providers and strengthens its core EHR application support offering with the addition of a dedicated support call center with deep Epic knowledge and expertise. The firm is currently offering support for Cerner applications and has plans to further extend its core EHR application support services to include a number of other leading applications.\n“Managed services is a natural extension of our core advisory consulting and professional services for providers, and the partnership with LinkEHR supports our efforts to continue to grow our capabilities in that area,” said Brian Cahill , Cumberland CEO. “We are now able to deliver solutions to our provider clients across the full service continuum, including system selection, planning, implementation and optimization, as well as application support and legacy system support.”\nLinkEHR’s Madison office will be maintained and will serve as the base for Cumberland’s newly formed Provider Managed Services Practice.
