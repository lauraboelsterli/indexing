    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: XHR) (\"Xenia\" or the \"Company\") today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Income: Net income attributable to common stockholders was $55.7 million and net income per diluted share was $0.52, including a $42.3 million gain on sale of investment properties. Same-Property RevPAR: Same-Property RevPAR decreased 2.8% compared to the first quarter of 2017 to $159.47, as occupancy decreased 60 basis points and ADR decreased 2.0%. The Company estimates disruption due to renovations negatively impacted Same-Property RevPAR by approximately 215 basis points during the first quarter. Same-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin: Same-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin was 29.9%, a decrease of 73 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total Portfolio RevPAR: Total Portfolio RevPAR was $158.81, 7.9% higher than of 2017 due to improvements in portfolio composition. Adjusted EBITDAre: Adjusted EBITDAre increased $14.6 million to $73.7 million, an increase of 24.7% compared to the first quarter of 2017, due largely to portfolio acquisitions and corresponding seasonality changes. Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share: Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.53, an increase of 20.5% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Disposition Activity: As previously announced, the Company completed the sale of the leasehold interest in Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for $200 million, resulting in a gain of $42.3 million. Financing Activity: The Company amended, restated, and upsized its senior unsecured revolving credit facility and obtained a new $65 million mortgage loan. Dividends: The Company declared its first quarter dividend of $0.275 per share to common stockholders of record on March 30, 2018.\n\"Our first quarter performance exceeded our outlook as results in March were stronger than anticipated,\" commented Marcel Verbaas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xenia. \"Given the fact that seven hotels, representing nearly 15% of our total room count, were impacted by significant renovations during the quarter, we were pleased with our modest Same-Property RevPAR decline of 2.8% and Same-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin decrease of 73 basis points, particularly in light of the lingering impact of the natural disasters in Key West, Napa and Santa Barbara, and a difficult comparison to the first quarter of last year.\"\n\"It should be noted that our current Same-Property Portfolio performed exceedingly well during the first quarter in 2017 as RevPAR increased by 4.3% and Hotel EBITDA Margin increased by 156 basis points last year, aided by non-recurring events such as the Super Bowl in Houston and the presidential inauguration. While results in markets like Houston, Washington, D.C., and several smaller markets were challenged as a result of these factors, we were pleased with our performance in markets that did not suffer from these temporary anomalies, with our hotels in Orlando, Phoenix, Boston, Santa Clara, Atlanta, Philadelphia, San Diego, and Salt Lake City performing particularly well. Additionally, our portfolio performance in April was encouraging, as Same-Property RevPAR for the month increased approximately 6%.\"\n\"We remain excited about the results of our portfolio improvements, a process we continued during the quarter through the completion of a number of impactful rooms and food and beverage outlet renovations, and the closing of the sale of Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel,\" Mr. Verbaas continued. \"Our Total Portfolio RevPAR was 7.9% higher than during the same period last year, a clear indication of the quality improvement we have been able to achieve within the portfolio while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. While the renovations we completed during and subsequent to the first quarter impacted our results during this period, we have positioned our portfolio well for future growth.\"\nOperating Results\nThe Company's results include the following:\n 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\n($ amounts in thousands, except hotel statistics and per\nshare amounts)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n55,656\n$\n8,113\n586.0\n%\nNet income per share available to common stockholders\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.07\n642.9\n%\nSame-Property Number of Hotels\n38\n38\n—\nSame-Property Number of Rooms\n10,852\n10,896\n(44)\nSame-Property Occupancy (1)\n74.1\n%\n74.7\n%\n(60)\nbps\nSame-Property Average Daily Rate (1)\n$\n215.24\n$\n219.55\n(2.0)\n%\nSame-Property RevPAR (1)\n$\n159.47\n$\n164.06\n(2.8)\n%\nSame-Property Hotel EBITDA (1)(2)\n$\n76,760\n$\n80,280\n(4.4)\n%\nSame-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin (1)(2)\n29.9\n%\n30.7\n%\n(73)\nbps\nTotal Portfolio Number of Hotels (3)\n38\n42\n(4)\nTotal Portfolio Number of Rooms (3)\n10,852\n10,902\n(50)\nTotal Portfolio RevPAR (4)\n$\n158.81\n$\n147.14\n7.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDAre (2)\n$\n73,735\n$\n59,107\n24.7\n%\nAdjusted FFO (2)\n$\n56,187\n$\n47,603\n18.0\n%\nAdjusted FFO per diluted share\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.44\n20.5\n%\n(1)\n\"Same-Property\" includes all hotels owned as of March 31, 2018. \"Same-Property\" includes periods prior to the Company's ownership of Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress, Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Gainey Ranch, Royal Palms Resort & Spa, and The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City, and excludes the NOI guaranty payment at Andaz San Diego. \"Same-Property\" also includes renovation disruption for multiple capital projects during the periods presented.

The Credit Facility was increased from $400 million to $500 million and the maturity was extended three years to February 2022, with two additional six-month extension options. The Credit Facility's interest rate is now based on a pricing grid with a range of 150 to 225 basis points over LIBOR as determined by the Company's leverage ratio, a reduction from the previous pricing grid which ranged from 150 to 245 basis points over LIBOR.\nAdditionally during the quarter, the Company obtained a new $65 million mortgage loan collateralized by The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City. The loan bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 210 basis points and matures in January 2025. The Company used a portion of the loan proceeds to pay off the $18 million mortgage loan collateralized by Hotel Monaco Chicago.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total outstanding debt of $1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.83%, with over 70% of its debt fixed or hedged to fixed. In addition, the Company had $255.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, and full availability on its Credit Facility. Total net debt to trailing twelve month Corporate EBITDA (as defined in Section 1.01 of the Company's unsecured credit facility) was 3.7x.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company paid off the $21.5 million mortgage loan collateralized by Andaz Savannah and the $41.0 million mortgage loan collateralized by Hotel Monaco Denver.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company invested $24 million in its portfolio. The majority of these projects were complete renovations of guestrooms, guest corridors, and bathrooms including the conversion of a large number of bathtubs to walk-in showers in order to improve each hotel's competitive position within its market.\nIn a typical guestroom and guest corridor renovation, the Company replaces carpet and base, wall vinyl and paint, window treatments, artwork and mirrors, and decorative lighting. Additionally, the Company replaces or refinishes upholstered seating, headboards, nightstands, desks, consoles and dressers, and tables. In a typical guest bathroom renovation, the Company replaces vanities, wall coverings, mirrors, sliding door systems, and accessories and amenities.\nThe following renovations were completed or substantially completed during the quarter:\nLorien Hotel & Spa - Renovation of all guestrooms and guest corridors, including new mattresses.

This project is expected to conclude in May.\n\"We are pleased with the renovation progress we have made across the portfolio this year and look forward to completing the remainder of our scheduled projects as the year progresses. Our guestroom renovations at Marriott Dallas City Center and Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress are on-track to begin this summer, and we have made substantial progress in the planning and design of the new ballroom at Grand Cypress as well. We remain confident that we made a prudent decision to accelerate several renovation projects into 2017 and 2018,\" commented Mr. Verbaas. \"We strongly believe each of these strategic renovations will position our hotels to combat new supply and compete very effectively in their respective markets. We anticipate significant performance improvements from our guestroom renovations in particular and anticipate differentiated growth in 2019 and beyond.\"\nCapital Markets\nDuring the quarter, the Company entered into an \"At the Market\" (\"ATM\") program pursuant to an Equity Distribution Agreement (\"ATM Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Jefferies LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., and Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure as prescribed per GAAP.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes (including income taxes applicable to sale of assets) and depreciation and amortization, as well as similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor regarding results of operations, in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from operating results, even though EBITDA does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common stockholders. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions and along with FFO and Adjusted FFO, it is used by management in the annual budget process for compensation programs.\nWe then calculate EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\"), which we adopted on January 1, 2018. Nareit defines EBITDAre as EBITDA plus or minus losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, including gains/losses on change of control, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of the depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe further adjust EBITDAre to exclude the non-controlling interest in consolidated entities other than our Operating Partnership units because our Operating Partnership units may be redeemed for common stock. We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand Adjusted EBITDAre attributable to all common stock and Operating Partnership unit holders. We also adjust EBITDAre for certain additional items such as hotel property acquisitions and pursuit costs, amortization of share-based compensation, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and other costs it believes do not represent recurring operations and are not indicative of the performance of its underlying hotel property entities. We believe Adjusted EBITDAre attributable to common stock and units holders provides investors with another financial measure in evaluating and facilitating comparison of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures.\nPrior to the adoption of EBITDAre on January 1, 2018, we historically presented EBITDA attributable to common stock and unit holders, which excluded depreciation expense related to corporate level assets and the allocation of EBITDA to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated investments in real estate entities. In order to calculate EBITDAre in accordance with Nareit's definition, these adjustments are now made to derive Adjusted EBITDAre. Therefore, there were no retrospective changes to Adjusted EBITDA as historically presented upon conversion to Adjusted EBITDAre.\nSame-Property Hotel EBITDA and Same-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin\nSame-Property hotel data includes the actual operating results for all hotels owned as of the end of the reporting period. We then adjust the Same-Property hotel data for comparability purposes by including pre-acquisition operating results of asset(s) acquired during the period, which provides the investor a basis for understanding the acquisition(s) historical operating trends and seasonality. The pre-acquisition operating results for the comparable period are obtained from the seller and/or manager of the hotels during the acquisition due diligence process and have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. We further adjust the Same-Property hotel data to remove dispositions during the respective reporting periods, and, in certain cases, hotels that are not fully open due to renovation, re-positioning, or disruption or whose room counts have materially changed during either the current or prior year as these historical operating results are not indicative of or expected to be comparable to the operating performance of our hotel portfolio on a prospective basis.\nSame-Property Hotel EBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) corporate-level costs and expenses, (5) hotel acquisition costs, and (6) certain state and local excise taxes resulting from our ownership structure. We believe that Same-Property Hotel EBITDA provides our investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), income taxes, and our corporate-level expenses (corporate expenses and hotel acquisition costs). We believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of our third-party management companies that operate our business on a property-level basis. Same-Property Hotel EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Same-Property Hotel EBITDA by Same-Property Total Revenues.\nAs a result of these adjustments the Same-Property hotel data we present does not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWe include Same-Property hotel data as supplemental information for investors. Management believes that providing Same-Property hotel data is useful to investors because it represents comparable operations for our portfolio as it exists at the end of the respective reporting periods presented, which allows investors and management to evaluate the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at Same-Property hotels or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions.\nFFO and Adjusted FFO\nThe Company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation, amortization and impairments, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, and items classified by GAAP as extraordinary. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (losses) from sales for real estate, impairments of real estate assets, extraordinary items and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs, even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common stockholders. The calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the Nareit definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with Nareit guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing Xenia to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common stock and unit holders, which includes its Operating Partnership units because its Operating Partnership units may be redeemed for common stock. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common stock and Operating Partnership units.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO for certain additional items that are not in Nareit's definition of FFO such as hotel property acquisition and pursuit costs, amortization of debt origination costs and share-based compensation, and other expenses it believes do not represent recurring operations. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO provides investors with useful supplemental information that may facilitate comparisons of ongoing operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO and is beneficial to investors' complete understanding of operating performance.\nAdjusted FFO per diluted share\nThe Company calculates Adjusted FFO per diluted share by dividing the Adjusted FFO for the respective period by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock for the corresponding period. The Company's diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is calculated by taking the weighted average of the common stock outstanding for the respective period plus the effect of any dilutive securities. Any anti-dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted earnings per-share calculation.\nXenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and

Pre-acquisition operating results for periods prior to the Company's ownership have not been included in the Company's actual consolidated financial statements and are included only in \"Same-Property\" for comparison purposes.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xenia-hotels--resorts-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641451.html\nSOURCE Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",
