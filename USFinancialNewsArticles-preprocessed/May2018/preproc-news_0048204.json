May 29, 2018, Paris, France: Serena Williams (USA) celebrates having recorded match point during her match against Kristyna Pliskova (CZE) on day three of the 2018 French Open at Stade Roland Garros.Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports\nWilliams recovered from 3-0 down in the tiebreak to claim an intense opening set before converting three break points in the second to seal the victory.\nThe 36-year-old American was competing in her first major since lifting her 23rd Grand Slam title at the 2017 Australian Open, having given birth to her daughter last September.\nWilliams will next face Australia’s Ashleigh Barty, seeded 17th, in the second round.\nTwice champion Maria Sharapova overcame a mid-match blip to secure a 6-1 4-6 6-3 win over Dutch qualifier Richel Hogenkamp.\nThird seed Garbine Muguruza also progressed, beating Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6(0) 6-2 in a clash of former champions.\nIn the men’s draw, defending champion and top seed Rafa Nadal began his campaign with a rain-delayed 6-4 6-3 7-6(9) victory over Italian Simone Bolelli.\nResuming 3-0 down in the third set, the Spaniard roared back to force a tiebreak before wrapping up the win in damp conditions.\nEarlier on Tuesday, third seed Marin Cilic looked in fine form as he eased past Australian James Duckworth 6-3 7-5 7-6(4).\nHighlights from day three of the French Open tennis championships on Tuesday (all times GMT): 1900 PLAY SUSPENDED\nPlay was suspended due to an incoming storm, with Frenchman Jeremy Chardy leading 7-6(5) 7-6(8) 1-1 against Czech Tomas Berdych on Court Philippe-Chatrier. 1845 DEL POTRO PREVAILS\nFifth seed Juan Martin del Potro, a semi-finalist in 2009, recovered from a slow start to beat Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 1-6 6-1 6-2 6-4. 1730 WAIT CONTINUES FOR HALEP\nWomen’s top seed Simona Halep will have to wait for another day to get on court after her first round match against American Alison Riske was postponed on Tuesday.\nThe rain delays over the last two days have resulted in several first round matches being rescheduled at Roland Garros. 1615 SERENA RETURNS IN STYLE\nFormer world number one Serena Williams, competing in her first Grand Slam since winning the 2017 Australian Open, looked in fine form as she defeated Czech Kristyna Pliskova 7-6(4) 6-4.\n“Two years has been a really long time since my last match on clay but I feel good,” Williams said. “I trained hard. I’m just happy to have a won match here. I take it one day at a time.” 1600 HOME FAVOURITE GARCIA STROLLS INTO SECOND ROUND\nWorld number seven Caroline Garcia produced a stellar display to beat China’s Duan Yingying 6-1 6-0 in 58 minutes. Garcia became the fourth Frenchwoman into this year’s Roland Garros second round.

It’s not easy.”\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov said he was forced to take more chances with the new balls to tackle slower court conditions.\n“The court was getting pretty heavy, but the balls especially, they were getting really fluffy and heavy,” he told reporters.\n“But, you know, at the same time I felt like I played really well... really tried to dictate the first couple of games when they came out.” 1445 EDMUND EASES INTO ROUND TWO\nBritish number one Kyle Edmund booked a place in the second round with a 6-2 6-4 6-3 victory over Australian’s Alex de Minaur.\n1430 SHARAPOVA SURVIVES OPENING-ROUND SCARE\nFormer world number one Maria Sharapova won the last six games in the final set to beat Richel Hogenkamp 6-1 4-6 6-3 in just under two hours.\nThe two-time French Open champion will meet Croatia’s Donna Vekic in the second round. 1410 NADAL OVERCOMES TRICKY TEST\nTop seed Rafa Nadal, chasing a record-extending 11th French Open title, saved four set points in the third set to beat Italian Simone Bolelli 6-4 6-3 7-6(9) in the opening round.\nThe Spaniard recorded his sixth consecutive win in as many meetings with Bolelli. It was Nadal’s 80th win at Roland Garros and 105th in best-of-five matches on clay. 1235 CILIC IN CRUISE CONTROL\nThird seed Marin Cilic backed his aggressive style of play to beat Australia’s James Duckworth 6-3 7-5 7-6(4) on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\nCilic, who reached the quarter-finals last year, struck 47 winners to seal the victory in two hours and 13 minutes. 1230 MUGURUZA BATTLES PAST KUZNETSOVA\nWorld number three Garbine Muguruza recorded a convincing 7-6(0) 6-2 victory over Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in a battle of former French Open champions. 1220 SHAPOVALOV STORMS INTO ROUND TWO\nCanadian teenage sensation Denis Shapovalov hit 32 winners to collect his first main draw win at Roland Garros, defeating John Millman of Australia 7-5 6-4 6-2.
