Our value creation approach to investing in both near-term and long-term opportunities keeps us focused on finding the right opportunities for Osisko and its shareholders.\nOsisko is in an excellent position to continue to invest in the opportunities that present themselves in the current market environment. We have nearly a billion dollars of available financial capacity to deploy into new investments and are actively reviewing new opportunities.\nIn addition to our financial capacity, we are continuously discussing with other capital providers within the global metals and mining sector to develop strategic relationships and alliances to further increase our capacity, enhance our suites of financial products and offer complete financing solutions to our mining partners”, said Sean Roosen, Chair and Chief Executive Officer.\nQ1 2018 Results Conference Call\nOsisko will host a conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 10:00 EDT to review and discuss its Q1 2018 results.\nThose interested in participating in the conference call should dial in at 1-(647) 788-4922 (international), or 1‑(877) 223-4471 (North American toll free).

(514) 940-0670 Tel. (514) 940-0670 vmetcalfe@osiskogr.com jdelaplante@osiskogr.com Notes:\n(1) GEOs are calculated on a quarterly basis and include royalties, streams and offtakes. Silver earned from royalty and stream agreements was converted to gold equivalent ounces by multiplying the silver ounces by the average silver price for the period and dividing by the average gold price for the period. Diamonds, other metals and cash royalties were converted into gold equivalent ounces by dividing the associated revenue by the average gold price for the period. Offtake agreements were converted using the financial settlement equivalent divided by the average gold price for the period.\nAverage Metal Prices and Exchange Rate\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Gold (1) $1,329 $1,219 Silver (2) $17 $17 Exchange rate (US$/Can$) (3) 1.2647 1.3238 (1) The London Bullion Market Association’s pm price in U.S. dollars (2) The London Bullion Market Association’s price in U.S. dollars (3) Bank of Canada daily rate (2) Cash operating margin, which represents revenues less cost of sales, is not a recognized measure under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The Company believes that this non-IFRS generally accepted industry measure provides a realistic indication of operating performance and provides a useful comparison with its peers. The following table reconciles the cash margin to the revenues and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of income and related notes:\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 $ $ Revenues 125,614 17,126 Less: Revenues from offtake interests (93,029 ) - Revenues from royalty and stream interests 32,585 17,126 Cost of sales (93,667 ) (102 ) Less: Cost of sales of offtake interests (90,604 ) - Cost of sales of royalty and stream interests (3,063 ) (102 ) Revenues from royalty and stream interests 32,585 17,126 Less: Cost of sales of royalty and stream interests (3,063 ) (102 ) Cash margin from royalty and stream interests 29,522 17,024 91 % 99 % Revenues from offtake interests 93,029 - Less: Cost of sales of offtake interests (90,604 ) - Cash margin from offtake interests 2,425 - 3 % - (3) The cash gain or loss is calculated by subtracting the cash cost from the cash proceeds on the sale of an investment. The cash cost of an investment is a non-IFRS measure representing the cash paid of an investment on the acquisition date.\n(4) Represents the estimated fair value based on the Quote: d prices of the investments in a recognized stock exchange as at April 30, 2018.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (together, \"forward‑looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements in this release, other than statements of historical fact, that address future events, developments or performance that Osisko expects to occur including management’s expectations regarding Osisko’s growth, results of operations, estimated future revenue, requirements for additional capital, production estimates, production costs and revenue, business prospects and opportunities are forward-looking statements. In addition, statements relating to gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") are forward‑looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the GEOs will be realized. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words \"expects\", \"is expected\" \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"potential\", \"scheduled\" and similar expressions or variations (including negative variations of such words and phrases), or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions, events or conditions \"will\", \"would\", \"may\", \"could\" or \"should\" occur including, without limitation, the performance of the assets of Osisko, the realization of the anticipated benefits deriving from Osisko’s investments and transactions and the estimate of GEOs to be received in 2018. Although Osisko believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may accordingly differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the actual results deriving from Osisko’s royalties, streams and other interests to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include, without limitation: influence of political or economic factors including fluctuations in the prices of the commodities and in value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, continued availability of capital and financing and general economic, market or business conditions; regulations and regulatory changes in national and local government, including permitting and licensing regimes and taxation policies; whether or not Osisko is determined to have “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) status as defined in Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; potential changes in Canadian tax treatments of offshore streams or other interests, litigation, title, permit or license disputes; risks and hazards associated with the business of exploring, development and mining on the properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest including, but not limited to development, permitting, infrastructure, operating or technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological and metallurgical conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters or civil unrest, rate, grade and timing of production differences from mineral resource estimates or production forecasts or other uninsured risks; risk related to business opportunities that become available to, or are pursued by Osisko. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation: the ongoing operation of the properties in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest by the owners or operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures made by the owners or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse change in the market price of the commodities that underlie the asset portfolio; Osisko’s ongoing income and assets relating to the determination of its PFIC status, no material changes to existing tax treatments; no adverse development in respect of any significant property in which Osisko holds a royalty, stream or other interest; the accuracy of publicly disclosed expectations for the development of underlying properties that are not yet in production; and the absence of any other factors that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. However, there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Osisko cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, see the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the most recent Annual Information Form of Osisko which is filed with the Canadian securities commissions and available electronically under Osisko's issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov . The forward-looking information set forth herein reflects Osisko’s expectations as at the date of this press release and is subject to change after such date. Osisko disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nOsisko Gold Royalties Ltd Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) (tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 $ $ Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 332,617 333,705 Short-term investments 500 - Accounts receivable 8,718 8,385 Inventories 9,962 9,859 Other assets 910 984 352,707 352,933 Non-current assets Investments in associates 257,878 257,433 Other investments 84,288 115,133 Royalty, stream and other interests 1,592,240 1,575,772 Exploration and evaluation 102,346 102,182 Goodwill 111,204 111,204 Deferred income taxes - - Other assets 1,570 1,686 2,502,233 2,516,343 Liabilities Current liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 14,308 15,310 Dividends payable 7,811 7,890 Provisions and other liabilities 5,382 5,632 27,501 28,832 Non-current liabilities Long-term debt 467,483 464,308 Provisions and other liabilities 2,181 2,036 Deferred income taxes 126,663 126,762 623,828 621,938 Equity attributable to Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd shareholders Share capital 1,621,867 1,633,013 Warrants 30,901 30,901 Equity reserve 990 - Contributed surplus 14,029 13,265 Equity component of convertible debentures 17,601 17,601 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (9,025 ) (2,878 ) Retained earnings 202,042 202,503 1,878,405 1,894,405 2,502,233 2,516,343\nOsisko Gold Royalties Ltd Consolidated Statements of Income For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (Unaudited) (tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 $ $ Revenues 125,614 17,126 Cost of sales (93,667 ) (102 ) Depletion of royalty, stream and other interests (13,230 ) (3,319 ) Gross profit 18,717 13,705 Other operating expenses General and administrative (4,382 ) (5,651 ) Business development (1,192 ) (1,779 ) Exploration and evaluation, net of tax credits (44 ) (42 ) Operating income 13,099 6,233 Interest income 1,492 1,278 Finance costs (6,634 ) (949 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss) 187 (1,420 ) Share of loss of associates (1,397 ) (1,445 ) Other gains (losses), net (2,581 ) 2,024 Earnings before income taxes 4,166 5,721 Income tax expense (1,856 ) (1,721 ) Net earnings 2,310 4,000 Net earnings attributable to: Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd’s shareholders 2,310 4,076 Non-controlling interests - (76 ) Net earnings (loss) per share attributable to Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd’s shareholders Basic 0.01 0.04 Diluted 0.01 0.04\nOsisko Gold Royalties Ltd Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (Unaudited) (tabular amounts expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 $ $ Operating activities Net earnings 2,310 4,000 Adjustments for: Share-based compensation 673 2,662 Depletion and amortization 13,272 3,352 Finance costs 1,618 345 Share of loss of associates 1,397 1,445 Net loss (gain) on acquisition of investments (1,908 ) 2,598 Net gain on dilution of investments in associates - (4,833 ) 4,489 211 Deferred income tax expense 1,667 1,721 Foreign exchange loss 898 1,415 Other 46 105 Net cash flows provided by operating activities\nbefore changes in non-cash working capital items 24,462 13,021 Changes in non-cash working capital items (1,159 ) (1,008 ) Net cash flows provided by operating activities 23,303 12,013 Investing activities Net increase in short-term investments (500 ) (500 ) Acquisition of investments (13,629 ) (62,819 ) Proceeds on disposal of investments 25,578 22,512 Acquisition of royalty and stream interests (9,970 ) (42,928 ) Property and equipment (18 ) (44 ) Exploration and evaluation tax credits, net of expenses 1,094 1,242 Net cash flows provided by (used) in investing activities 2,555 (82,537 ) Financing activities Issuance of common shares 114 869 Issue expenses (186 ) (41 ) Financing fees (379 ) - Investments from non-controlling interests - 1,333 Normal course issuer bid purchase of common shares (20,333 ) (1,822 ) Dividends paid (7,547 ) (4,082 ) Net cash flows used in financing activities (28,331 ) (3,743 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents before effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2,473 ) (74,267 ) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,385 (1,415 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1,088 ) (75,682 ) Cash and cash equivalents – beginning of period 333,705 499,249 Cash and cash equivalents – end of period 332,617 423,567\nSource: Redevances Aurifères Osisko Ltée",
