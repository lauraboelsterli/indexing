    "text": "SHENZHEN, China, May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (\"Lexin\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: LX), a leading online consumer finance platform for educated young adults in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational Highlights:\nTotal loan originations in the first quarter of 2018 reached RMB14.8 billion, representing an increase of 98.3% from RMB7.5 billion in the first quarter of 2017.

Financial services income reached RMB998 million, representing an increase of 56.7% from the first quarter of 2017. Loan facilitation and servicing fees reached RMB164 million, representing an increase of 204% from the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit reached RMB412 million, representing an increase of 52.2% from the first quarter of 2017. Net income was RMB146 million, representing an increase of 160% from the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EBIT was RMB211 million, an increase of 66.8% from the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was RMB174 million, representing an increase of 88.3% from the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Our consistent regulatory compliance and our investment in financial technology have enabled us to strengthen our competitive advantages and fuel our growth,\" said Mr. Jay Wenjie Xiao, Lexin's chairman and chief executive officer. \"Nearly a third of Lexin's operating expenses went into financial technology research and development in the past year, which resulted in higher operating efficiency and greater profitability as we scale up our business.\"\n\"Our technology capabilities, including our Hawkeye risk-management engine and Wormhole fund-matching system, have helped us to gain the trust of additional partners. We believe that our cooperation with various financial institutions will create even more value and contribute to Lexin's continued growth in the future,\" continued Mr. Xiao.\n\"We saw continued growth in our business in the first quarter,\" said Mr. Craig Yan Zeng, Lexin's chief financial officer. \"In the first quarter of 2018 Lexin's gross profit reached RMB412 million and non-GAAP EBIT reached RMB211 million, representing an increase of 52.2% and 66.8% from the same period in 2017. Our adjusted net income also increased by 88.3% to RMB174 million.\"\n\"Our strong profit growth reflects increasing operating leverage, which is enabling us to scale up our business with higher operating efficiency,\" continued Mr. Zeng. \"We hope to continue this momentum as we continue to invest in our technology.\"\n\"As a result of our continuous work on our technology and Hawkeye AI engine, our credit quality continues to be stable and our performance continues to be strong,\" said Mr. Ryan Huanian Liu, Lexin's chief risk officer. \"Our M6+ charge-off rate 4 continues to be approximately 2.0%. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, our 90 day+ delinquency rate was 1.44%.\"\n4 \"M6+ charge-off rate\" refers to, with respect to on- and off-balance sheet loans originated during a specified time period, which we\nrefer to as a vintage, the total outstanding principal balance of the loans that become over six months delinquent during a specified period,\ndivided by the total initial principal of the loans originated in such vintage.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nOperating revenue increased from RMB1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the substantial increase in financial services income.\nFinancial services income increased by 56.7% from RMB637 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB998 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans, which was in turn driven by increases in the number of active customers and the average outstanding principal balance of loans per customer.\nLoan facilitation and servicing fees increased by 204% from RMB54.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB164 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the significant increase in off-balance sheet loans.\nFunding cost increased by 46.1% from RMB176 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB257 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our funding debts to fund on-balance sheet loans originated on our platform.\nProcessing and servicing cost increased by 49.4% from RMB44.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB65.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in fees to third-party payment platforms and an increase in salaries and personnel related costs.\nProvision for credit losses increased by 135% from RMB122 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB287 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans. In addition, as we had continued to improve our credit assessment and risk management capabilities as well as to enhance our collection efforts, we gradually expanded our customer base to improve our profit, while maintaining credit risks at a reasonable level.\nGross profit increased by 52.2% from RMB271 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB412 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 17.5% from RMB86.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB102 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses and an increase in online promotional fees and advertising costs.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 54.0% from RMB44.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB68.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses, an increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to research and development expenses, and an increase in rental and depreciation expenses allocated to research and development expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 36.6% from RMB42.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 to RMB58.6 million in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expenses allocated to general and administrative expenses and an increase in payroll expenses. In addition, we incurred an increase in professional service fees and rental expenses.\nIncome tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB33.4 million, compared to income tax expense of RMB33.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease of the annualized effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the change of our cost structure and lower enacted tax rate for certain qualified entities. The Company's subsidiaries completed 2017 annual tax filings with relevant tax authorities in May 2018, which may result in a favorable change of tax positions in recognizing deferred tax assets.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB146 million, representing an increase of 160% compared to RMB56.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB174 million, representing an increase of 88.3% from RMB92.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPlease click here to view our vintage curve: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/694073/vintage_1.jpg\nOutlook\nLexin expects the total loan origination for fiscal year 2018 to be RMB80 billion.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses and interest expense associated with convertible loans, and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net income excluding income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses and interest expense, net.\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures because it is used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and interest expense associated with convertible loans. Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses and interest expense, net. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate investors' assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible loans, income tax expense, and interest expense, net have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nExchange Rate Information Statement\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (\"US$\") at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board on March 30, 2018.
