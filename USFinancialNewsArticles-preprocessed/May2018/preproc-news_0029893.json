    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Olympia Financial Group Inc. (“Olympia”) (TSX:OLY) announced today its operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements and notes, as well as management’s discussion and analysis, are now available on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ).\nResults from operations, include the following (compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017):\nEarnings before income tax increased 60% to $2.95 million from $1.84 million. Total revenue, including interest earned as trustee and interest, increased 17% to $12.38 million from $10.57 million due to an increase in service revenue in the Foreign Exchange division and interest earned as trustee in the Registered Plans division. Service revenue increased 12% to $9.80 million from $8.73 million due to an increase in trade volume and transaction sizes in the Foreign Exchange division. Interest revenue on monies held in trust and interest on Olympia’s own cash increased 40% to $2.58 million from $1.84 million as a result of an increase in off-balance sheet arrangements under administration and increases in the Canadian prime rate. Direct and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization), increased 7% to $9.02 million from $8.45 million due to an increase in bonuses and commissions paid in the Foreign Exchange division.\nOlympia also announced today that its board of directors has approved a 17.64% increase to its monthly cash dividend from $0.17 to $0.20 per common share.
