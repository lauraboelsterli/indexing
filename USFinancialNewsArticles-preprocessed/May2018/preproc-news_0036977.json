(TSX-V:KNT) (OTCQX:KNTNF) (the “ Company ” or “ K92 ”) is pleased to announce first quarter financial results and provide 2018 production guidance.\nFor complete details of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and associated management's discussion and analysis, please refer to the Company's filings on SEDAR. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nOther Highlights\nAn updated resource for Kora North, comprising a Measured Resource of 33,200 tonnes @ 10.3 g/t Au, 31 g/t Ag and 1.2% Cu; an Indicated Resource of 103,500 tonnes @ 12.7 g/t Au, 30 g/t Ag and 1.3% Cu and an Inferred Resources of 183,500 tonnes @ 14.4 g/t Au, 27 g/t Ag and 0.9% Cu announced. A contract for the installation of a gold gravity recovery circuit and a new flotation cleaner circuit awarded to Mincore Pty Ltd. Additional underground mobile fleet purchased, including Volvo A30F haul truck, Cat R1300G and 1700G LHD loaders, Sandvik DD420-60 twin boom jumbo and Qasar single boom jumbo. Underground exploration program commenced targeting an area immediately up dip, down dip and along strike from the initial Kora North resource. Exploration field work identifies a new highly prospective porphyry target, Blue Lake, containing gold/silver/copper mineralization and hydrothermal alteration typical of that encountered in high sulphidation epithermal systems.\nJohn Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, states, “The first Quarter of 2018 marks a major step for our Company with the declaration of commercial production on the Kora deposit on February 1, 2018, just four months after mining the first bulk sample. The Quarter also saw the Company report an initial net income in excess of US$3 million including a gross margin in excess of US$4.7 million from just the first two months following the declaration of commercial production. Production for the first three months of the year was just over 9,700 gold equivalent ozs, approximately 80% of design. Importantly, although not at design production levels, cash costs were extremely low at US$532/gold oz, while all-in sustaining costs were just US$726/gold oz.”\nMINE OPERATING ACTIVITIES Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nOperating data Head grade (Au g/t) 16.95 Gold Recovery (%) 91.7 Gold ounces produced 9,324 Gold ounces equivalent produced (1) 9,729 Pounds of copper produced 165,976 Silver ounces produced 2,752 Financial data (in thousands of dollars) February 1, 2018 – March 31, 2018 Revenues -- gold sales $8,526 Mine operating expenses ($3,223) Depreciation and depletion ($526) Statistics (in dollars) Average realized selling price (per ounce) $1,327 Cash cost (per ounce) (1) $532 All-in sustaining cost (per ounce) (1) $726 Review of financial results\nNet income\nThe Company's net income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, totalled $3,317,070 or income per share of two cents compared with net loss of $5,637,593 or a loss per share of five cents for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nNotes\nThe Company provides some non-international financial reporting standard measures as supplementary information that management believes may be useful to investors to explain the Company's financial results. Please refer to non-IFRS financial performance measures of the Company's management's discussion and analysis dated May 17, 2018, available on SEDAR for reconciliation of these measures.\nK92 has not based its production decisions on mineral reserve estimates or feasibility studies, and historically such projects have increased uncertainty and risk of failure. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nQualified Person\nK92 mine geology manager and mine exploration manager, Andrew Kohler, PGeo, a qualified person under the meaning of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects has reviewed and is responsible for the technical content of this news release. Data verification by Mr. Kohler includes significant time onsite reviewing drill core, face sampling, underground workings, and discussing work programs and results with geology and mining personnel.\nFor further information regarding the Kainantu gold mine, please refer to the technical report dated March 2, 2017, and entitled \"Independent Technical Report, Mineral Resource Update and Preliminary Economic Assessment of Irumafimpa and Kora Gold Deposits, Kainantu Project, Papua New Guinea,\" available on SEDAR.\nOn Behalf of the Company,\nJohn Lewins, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nFor further information, please contact the Company at +1-604-687-7130.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION: This news release includes certain “forward-looking statements” under applicable Canadian securities legislation.
