    "text": "122 COMMENTS DALLAS—When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week convenes the first of his planned roundtable discussions to come up with laws to protect people from gun violence, it could mark a turning point for the state.\nTexas has some of the most lenient gun laws in the country. A shooting at a small Texas church in November that killed 26 and injured 20 others didn’t prompt changes in state legislature or public rhetoric. And the school shooting in Parkland , Fla., in February that killed 17 and brought gun-control measures to the forefront elsewhere also didn’t lead to changes here. Earlier this month, Dallas hosted the largest National Rifle Association annual convention ever, and Mr. Abbott was among the speakers.\nMore\nLives Lost in Three Decades of School Shootings Texas School Shooting Victims Remembered at Church Service Father of Accused Texas Shooter Believes Bullying Was Behind Rampage ‘Don’t Scream’: How the Texas School Shooting Unfolded Texas Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Exchange Student, Substitute Teachers Texas School-Shooting Suspect Showed Few Red Flags Ten Killed in Texas School Shooting But since Friday’s shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston that left 10 dead and 13 injured, Mr. Abbott and other high-level officials have spoken out and taken to social media to talk about gun control.\n“We need to do more than just pray for the victims and their families,” Mr. Abbott said shortly after the shooting in Santa Fe, unlike after the church shooting, when he called for a day of prayer.\nU.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, noting the Santa Fe suspect’s age of 17 and reports that the guns used in the shooting belonged to his father, on Friday voiced a willingness to hold parents and others legally accountable for not securing firearms.\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo voiced frustration in a Facebook post, saying he has “ hit rock bottom ” on gun-rights arguments. “Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do,” he wrote.\nSheriff Ed Gonzalez of Harris County, where Houston is located, agreed with Mr. Acevedo in a tweet: “ Something needs to change , we can/must do better,” he wrote.\nSpokespeople for the officials declined to comment or didn’t return calls.\nA shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Friday morning left at least 10 dead and others injured.

Texas has expanded gun rights in recent years by making it easier and cheaper to get licensed. It legalized the open carrying of handguns by licensed owners and it permits people to carry concealed guns at public institutions of higher education . Texas school districts also allow trained teachers to carry guns to protect children.\nLori Simmons of Santa Fe, Texas, prays at a makeshift memorial for victims killed in last Friday’s shooting at Santa Fe High School. Photo: jonathan bachman/Reuters Democratic State Sen. José Rodríguez of El Paso said he has failed to get any traction on bills he introduced that aimed to keep firearms away from dangerous people. He sponsored a bill in 2017 that would establish a process for law enforcement and family members of gun owners to petition a court to temporarily confiscate firearms from someone deemed a physical threat to themselves or others. It never had a hearing or a vote, he said.\n“The state leadership has not been receptive to this common-sense legislation,” said Mr. Rodríguez, a former local prosecutor.\nSome Republicans in the state have suggested other ways to address school safety without restricting guns, such as beefed-up security measures or limiting entry points into school buildings.\nEven as Mr. Abbott called for a renewed conversation on gun violence, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, called on Friday not for stricter gun laws but for school campuses to have safer designs.\n“There are too many entrances and too many exits” to the state’s schools, he said.\nLives Lost Over Three Decades VIEW Interactive\nMr. Abbott’s roundtable discussions, meanwhile, are meant to involve parents, students, educators, concerned citizens and Second Amendment firearms-rights advocates, among others. He said the goal is “putting together laws that will protect Second Amendment rights but at the same time ensure that our communities and especially our schools are safer places.”\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew White, who hopes to take on Mr. Abbott in the November election, said political leaders aren’t doing enough. He wants to consider measures such as banning militarized weapons with high-capacity magazines.\n—Dan Frosch in Santa Fe, Texas, contributed to this article.\nWrite to Tawnell D.
