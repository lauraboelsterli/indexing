    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan said on Wednesday it has pushed back rate hike expectations from March 2019 to June 2019 after a business survey showed that euro zone economic growth slowed much more sharply than expected this month.\nFILE PHOTO: A sign outside the headquarters of JP Morgan Chase & Co in New York, U.S., September 19, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), considered a gauge of economic health, slowed in May to an 18-month low of 54.1 from 55.1, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll, which predicted a reading of 55.0.\nJPMorgan said it has also cut its growth forecast for the second quarter of 2018 to 2.5 percent from 3 percent previously.\n“The level is still consistent with growth a tick above a 2 percent pace, which is in line with the latest ECB staff forecast. But, the trajectory remains a concern,” analysts for the bank said in a note.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, editing by Karin Strohecker\n ",
