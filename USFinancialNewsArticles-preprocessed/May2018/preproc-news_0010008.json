    "text": "- APL-2 in Geographic Atrophy (GA) and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) On Track to Advance into Phase 3 Trials in 2H18 -\n- Cash Position of $152.9 Million at Quarter-End; April 2018 Public Offering Raised Additional $131.3 Million in Net Proceeds To Support Advancing APL-2 Into Phase 3 Programs in GA and PNH -\nCRESTWOOD, Ky. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:APLS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutic compounds to treat disease through the inhibition of the complement system, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results and business highlights.\n“The first quarter of 2018 set the foundation for advancement across our clinical programs, and was marked by the positive 18-month results of the Phase 2 FILLY trial of APL-2 in patients with GA. Shortly after quarter end, we announced encouraging interim results of APL-2 in patients with PNH naïve to eculizumab, showing a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase, an increase in hemoglobin levels and improvements in other markers for anemia,” said Cedric Francois, MD, PhD, founder and chief executive officer of Apellis. “The 18-month FILLY trial results and interim data from the Phase 1b PADDOCK trial increase our confidence in the potential for APL-2 to treat a variety of complement-mediated conditions and we look forward to initiating Phase 3 trials in both GA and PNH in the second half of this year. The recently completed financing supports advancing APL-2 into both Phase 3 programs and provides the capital necessary to further advance our pipeline in multiple indications.”\nBusiness Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:\nAPL-2 in Geographic Atrophy\nReported 18-month data on its Phase 2 FILLY trial of APL-2 in patients with GA in February 2018. The Phase 3 trial of APL-2 in GA remains on track to begin in the second half of 2018.\nAPL-2 in PNH\nRecently reported interim data from its Phase 1b PADDOCK trial in patients with PNH. The interim data showed APL-2 has generally been well-tolerated to date, reduced lactate dehydrogenase, increased hemoglobin levels and also showed substantial improvements in other biomarkers of anemia in patients not previously treated with eculizumab (Soliris). The Phase 3 trial of APL-2 in PNH remains on track to begin in the second half of 2018.\nAPL-2 In Other Indications\nThe Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) monotherapy data for APL-2 in AIHA remains on track for the first half of 2018. The Phase 2 POC monotherapy data for APL-2 in four types of complement-dependent nephropathies, including IgA nephropathy, C3 glomerulonephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis, are expected in the second half of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results :\nAs of March 31, 2018, Apellis had $152.9 million in cash , compared to $175.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In April 2018, the Company completed a public offering of 5.5 million shares of common stock at $25.50 per share, raising net proceeds of $131.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nApellis reported a net loss of $21.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $9.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of operations and activities necessary to advance the Company’s two lead programs into Phase 3 trials during 2018.\nResearch and development expenses were $17.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases of $4.4 million in clinical trial costs, $3.3 million in manufacturing expenses, $1.3 million in employee related costs primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel, $0.6 million in research and development supporting activities, $0.4 million in device development expenses and $0.2 million in pre-clinical study expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.9 million in employee related costs, $0.4 million in director stock option compensation, $0.4 million in office, travel and related costs, $0.3 million in professional and consulting fees and $0.2 million in insurance costs.\nAbout Apellis\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of a broad range of life-threatening or debilitating autoimmune diseases based upon complement immunotherapy through the inhibition of the complement system at the level of C3.
