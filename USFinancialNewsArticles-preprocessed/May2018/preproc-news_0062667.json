    "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s consumer prices rose in May at their fastest pace since April 2017, topping the European Central Bank’s target level as fuel costs increased having fallen a year earlier.\nEU-harmonised prices rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year, Wednesday’s flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed, compared with a consensus forecast of 1.7 percent and a April reading of 1.1 percent.\nSpain is the first large euro zone economy to report consumer prices for May. Germany will also publish figures on Wednesday that expected to show a jump to 2 percent.\nWeak inflation across the euro zone has encouraged the central bank to keep interest rates at record lows.\nHeadline consumer prices are expected to be above the ECB’s target of just below 2 percent this summer, but the bank’s preferred measure is the core rate, which strips out volatile oil and food prices and has been consistently lower.\nInflation expectations together with economic growth, which has turned more sluggish, are also variables in the ECB’s plans for its bond-buying scheme, which it is expected to end later this year.\nSpain’s national consumer price index rose by 2.0 percent, INE said, up from 1.1 percent in April, also the highest since April last year.\nReporting by Paul Day; editing by John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
