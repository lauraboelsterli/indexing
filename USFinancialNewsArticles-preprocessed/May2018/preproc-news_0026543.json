(TSX:SMT)(BVL:SMT)(NYSE American:SMTS) (\"Sierra Metals\" or the \"Company\") today reported revenue of $61.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $27.4 million on throughput of 557,710 tonnes and metal production of 4.4 million silver equivalent ounces, 23.4 million copper equivalent pounds, and 47.2 million zinc equivalent pounds for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company achieved record quarterly throughput from both the Yauricocha and Bolivar Mines, continuing the successful production increases realized during 2017. Consolidated production of copper increased 11%, silver decreased 15%, lead decreased 31%, zinc was flat, and gold increased 10% compared to Q1 2017.\nThe Company continues to see positive gains and momentum from the progress of the operational turnaround program implemented in Mexico during the second half of 2017, to modernize operations, improve production, and lower costs. The Company has already realized a 14% increase in throughput at Bolivar and a 66% increase at Cusi in Q1 2018 compared to Q4 2017, and further throughput increases are expected to continue during the rest of the year. Copper equivalent production at Bolivar increased 16%, and silver equivalent production at Cusi increased 12% in Q1 2018 compared to Q4 2017.\nIgor Gonzales, President and CEO of Sierra Metals stated: \"Q1 2018 represents an inflection point for the Company as we begin to realize returns on our capital investments and operational improvement efforts with improving operating performance in addition to the production of higher value ore, strengthening our asset base, and continuing to increase the mineral reserves and resources at each of our mines.\nYauricocha continues to perform with record throughput in the first quarter as the Company continues to reap the benefits of a successful operational improvements program. Additionally, improved realized metal prices contributed to higher revenue and improved net production revenue per tonne demonstrating the successful capital investments made. At Bolivar, the effects of the Mexico turn-around program are very noticeable, and we are hitting our production targets and realized record throughput. We also had lower all-in sustaining costs which were below guidance. At Cusi, we continue to ramp up tonnage and realize quarter over quarter improvements. We are continuing to campaign development ore from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone with increasing throughput rates, while selectively mining structures in the older part of the mine. The Company expects to reach the existing mill's capacity of 650 tonnes per day in Q2-2018. The addition of another ball mill in the second half of 2018 will see the capacity increase to approximately 1,200 tonnes per day in early 2019.\"\nHe concluded, \"Sierra Metals continues to have a very solid balance sheet, and strong liquidity, to meet its operational and growth expenditure requirements. Management continues to be very optimistic for the remainder of the year as the groundwork for continued improvements, through the modernizing and implementation of best operational practices has been set. Our ongoing, aggressive and lower-risk brownfield exploration programs at all three mines should also lead to further significant growth in mineral reserves and resources and add to the value of our assets during the year ahead.\"\nThe following table displays selected financial and operational information for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThree Months Ended\n(In thousands of dollars, except per share and cash cost amounts, consolidated\nfigures unless noted otherwise)\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nOperating\nOre Processed / Tonnes Milled\n557,710\n529,695\nSilver Ounces Produced (000's)\n594\n698\nCopper Pounds Produced (000's)\n8,090\n7,290\nLead Pounds Produced (000's)\n6,312\n9,143\nZinc Pounds Produced (000's)\n18,214\n18,137\nGold Ounces Produced\n1,952\n1,777\nCopper Equivalent Pounds Produced (000's) 1\n23,445\n25,126\nZinc Equivalent Pounds Produced (000's) 1\n47,209\n52,231\nSilver Equivalent Ounces Produced (000's) 1\n4,394\n3,746\nCash Cost per Tonne Processed\n$\n46.66\n$\n39.84\nCost of sales per AgEqOz\n$\n7.15\n$\n7.09\nCash Cost per AgEqOz 2\n$\n6.77\n$\n6.69\nAISC per AgEqOz 2\n$\n9.85\n$\n10.44\nCost of sales per CuEqLb 2\n$\n1.34\n$\n1.06\nCash Cost per CuEqLb 2\n$\n1.27\n$\n1.00\nAISC per CuEqLb 2\n$\n1.85\n$\n1.56\nCost of sales per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n0.67\n$\n0.51\nCash Cost per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.48\nAISC per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n0.92\n$\n0.75\nCash Cost per ZnEqLb (Yauricocha) 2\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.42\nAISC per ZnEqLb (Yauricocha) 2\n$\n0.82\n$\n0.61\nCash Cost per CuEqLb (Bolivar) 2\n$\n1.29\n$\n1.20\nAISC per CuEqLb (Bolivar) 2\n$\n1.94\n$\n1.98\nCash Cost per AgEqOz (Cusi) 2\n$\n18.34\n$\n9.78\nAISC per AgEqOz (Cusi) 2\n$\n28.33\n$\n20.55\nFinancial\nRevenues\n$\n61,675\n$\n54,518\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$\n27,403\n$\n25,361\nOperating cash flows before movements in working capital\n$\n27,348\n$\n23,707\nAdjusted net income attributable to shareholders 2\n$\n11,187\n$\n10,990\nNet income attributable to shareholders\n$\n8,703\n$\n2,558\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n25,514\n$\n37,959\nWorking capital\n$\n(1,576)\n$\n12,442\n(1) Silver equivalent ounces, Copper equivalent pounds, and Zinc equivalent pounds for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au. Silver equivalent ounces, Copper equivalent pounds, and Zinc equivalent pounds for Q1 2017 were calculated using the following realized prices: $17.71/oz Ag, $2.64/lb Cu, $1.04/lb Pb, $1.27/lb Zn, $1,231/oz Au.\n(2) This is a non-IFRS performance measure, see Non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the MD&A.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue from metals payable of $61.7 million in Q1 2018 increased by 13% from $54.5 million in Q1 2017. Higher revenues are primarily attributable to the 5% increase in throughput, the increase in copper, and gold head grades, and higher recoveries for copper at Yauricocha; and the increase in the prices of copper (19%), lead (11%), zinc (23%), and gold (8%) in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017; this was partially offset by a 22% decrease in throughput and lower head grades and recoveries for all metals, except lead recoveries, at Cusi; while the 6% increase in throughput, higher silver head grades, silver and gold recoveries, and the higher copper price resulted in Bolivar's revenues being consistent with Q1 2017.\nYauricocha's cash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound was $0.57 (Q1 2017 - $0.42), and AISC per zinc equivalent payable pound of $0.82 (Q1 2017 - $0.61). The increase in the AISC per zinc equivalent payable pound for Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 were a result of fewer zinc equivalent pounds sold, despite higher throughput due to lower head grades; as well as slight increases to administrative costs and operating costs which included infill drilling and drift development costs that will be utilized within one year, and thus are included in opex.\nBolivar's cash cost per copper equivalent payable pound was $1.29 (Q1 2017 - $1.20), and AISC per copper equivalent payable pound was $1.94 (Q1 2017 - $1.98) for Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017. The decrease in the AISC per copper equivalent payable pound during Q1 2018 was due to a decrease in sustaining capital expenditures, as there were additional mine development costs, and various equipment purchases made by the Company during the Q1 2017 in an effort to improve equipment availability and increase tonnage.\nCusi's cash cost per silver equivalent payable ounce was $18.34 (Q1 2017 - $9.78), and AISC per silver equivalent payable ounce was $28.33 (Q1 2017 - $20.55) for Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017. AISC per silver equivalent payable ounce increased due to the decline in throughput which resulted in fewer silver equivalent payable ounces as the Company continued its refocused efforts on completing access, development and production from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone which contains wider structures and higher silver grades.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) of $27.4 million for Q1 2018 increased 8% compared to $25.4 million in Q1 2017. The increase in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 was primarily due to the $8.1 million increase in revenues at Yauricocha, discussed previously.\nCash flow generated from operations before movements in working capital of $27.3 million for Q1 2018 increased 15% compared to $23.7 million in Q1 2017. The increase in operating cash flow is mainly the result of higher revenues generated and higher gross margins realized.\nCash and cash equivalents of $25.5 million and working capital of $(1.6) million as at March 31, 2018 compared to $23.9 million and $(6.8) million, respectively, at the end of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents have increased by $1.6 million during Q1 2018 due to $11.5 million of operating cash flows, and $5.0 million drawn down from a short term revolving line of credit, being offset by capital expenditures incurred in Mexico and Peru of $(9.7) million, repayment of loans, credit facilities and interest of $(4.2) million, dividends paid to non-controlling interest shareholders of $(1.1) million. Included in the $11.5 million of operating cash flows were negative changes in non-cash working capital items of $3.5 million due to the decrease in income tax payable as at March 31, 2018.\n(1) This is a non-IFRS performance measure, see Non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the MD&A.\nProject Development\nThe Company will provide an updated Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimate for the Company's Bolivar Mine on May 22, 2018. The NI 43-101 Technical Report will be filed on SEDAR within 45 days of the Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimate press release and will be prepared by SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc.\nMine development at Bolívar during Q1 2018 totaled 1,177 meters. Most of these meters (650) were developed to prepare stopes for mine production. The remainder of the meters (466) were related to the deepening of ramps and developing service ramps to be used for ventilation and pumping, and 61 meters of raises; and\nDuring Q1 2018, at the Cusi property, mine development totaled 676 meters, and 1,448 meters of infill drilling was carried out inside the Mine, and 7,398 meters drilled from surface.\nExploration Update\nYauricocha\nDuring Q1 2018, the Company drilled 66 holes totaling 6,919 meters at Yauricocha. The drilling included the following:\nExploration Drilling:\nContacto Sur Medio (Level 1070): 6 holes totaling 1,548 meters have intercepted the mineralized structure as we explore the continuity of this high-grade orebody at depth; Contacto Sur Medio Oeste (Level 1070 Central Mine Zone): 2 horizontal holes totaling 286 meters to explore possible mineralize orebodies; Gallito (Level 1070 Central Mine Zone): 5 holes totaling 637 meters with the objective of exploring and verifying the continuity of mineralization in the Gallito orebody; the holes from the 920 level to the 1070 level intercepted stretches of lead and zinc sulphides; Esperanza - Cuye (Level 1070 Central Mine Zone): 1 hole totaling 612 meters with the objective of exploring the area between Cuye and Esperanza, an area which has the potential of more mineral resources; drilling will continue in this area;\nDefinition Drilling:\nAntacaca (Level 920): 6 holes totaling 273 meters to define the orebody between the 1020 and 1070 levels, floor 16; Antacaca (Level 920): 7 holes to define the continuity of mineralization of the orebody; which were executed from floors 16 and 8 of the 970 level; Catas (Levels 1020 & 1070): 15 holes totaling 1,139 meters to further define the orebody; Contacto Occidental (970 Level): 7 holes totaling 330 meters to further define the orebody, which intercepted polymetallic mineral and lead oxide mineral with silver; Esperanza Brecha (820 Level): 8 holes totaling 684 meters to further define the orebody; Mascota (1170 Level): 9 holes totaling 1,410 meters in the polymetallic area of the orebody to further define it; these holes intercepted stretches of economic mineral;\nDuring Q1 2018, surface exploration was continued in the southern end of the Central Mine Zone, mainly in the areas of the Chonta Fault (Yauricocha II), where diamond drilling will be carried out.\nBolivar\nAt Bolívar during Q1 2018, 6,281 meters were drilled from surface as well as diamond drilling within the mine. 1,601 meters were drilled within the mine in the El Gallo zone, 4,680 meters within Bolivar Northwest and Bolivar West areas exploring the extension of the orebody to the North and West, exploring the skarn orebody with semi-massive magnetite, and disseminated nodules of chalcopyrite. This area will continue to be explored during the rest of 2018.\nCusi:\nDuring Q1 2018, the Company drilled 1,448 meters inside the mines to verify the continuity of the orebodies and support development work on the various veins and 7,398 meters on surface.\nConference Call Webcast\nSierra Metals' senior management will host a conference call on Friday May 11, 2018 at 10:30 AM (EDT) to discuss the Company's financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nVia Webcast:\nA live audio webcast of the meeting will be available on the Company's website:\nhttps://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1627974/61D76E33DC48C22ECB595CC82024F168\nThe webcast along with presentation slides will be archived for 180 days on www.sierrametals.com .\nVia phone:\nFor those who prefer to listen by phone, dial-in instructions are below.
