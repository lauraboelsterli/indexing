    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C., May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ:BDSI) today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with existing institutional and other accredited investors to purchase an aggregate of approximately $50 million worth of BDSI’s newly designated Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Stock) in a registered direct offering.\nThe Series B Stock is being sold for $10,000 per share, and each share of Series B Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of BDSI common stock determined by dividing $10,000 by $1.80. Although BDSI will receive the proceeds of the offering at closing, the Series B Stock will not be convertible into common stock until BDSI receives stockholder approval of the transaction for Nasdaq Stock Market purposes as well as stockholder approval of an increase in BDSI’s authorized shares of common stock.\nThe offering is expected to yield total gross proceeds of $50 million to BDSI, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses. The closing of the offering is expected to take place on or about May 21, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary and other negotiated closing conditions described in the prospectus supplement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the offering.\nWilliam Blair & Company, L.L.C. is acting as the sole placement agent for the offering.\nThis registered offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (No. 333-205483) previously filed with and declared effective by the SEC. A prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus describing the terms of the offering will be filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov . Alternatively, you may request the prospectus supplement, when available, from William Blair & Company, L.L.C., by calling toll-free 1(800) 621-0687.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout BioDelivery Sciences International\nBioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.
