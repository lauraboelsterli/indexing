    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- For the second year in a row, Kia has been acknowledged as one of the most trusted non-luxury automotive brands in the annual Trusted Automotive Brands Study (TABS) conducted by AMCI Global. Trust is one of the key factors leading to brand loyalty and a customer's decision to repurchase that brand's products. Now in its second year, TABS again shows that trust accounts for more than 50 percent of a consumer's decision to recommend or repurchase a vehicle from an automotive brand.\n\"Building trust is never easy. It takes years of delivering great vehicles and standing behind those vehicles with an industry-leading warranty 1 and a dealer network that's devoted to customer service,\" said William (Bill) Peffer, vice president, sales operations, Kia Motors America. \"It's an honor for Kia to have ranked as one of the most trusted non-luxury automotive brands two years running.\"\nIn January 2018, AMCI conducted its second annual TAB Study. A nationally representative sample of 2,500 owners across 34 brands participated in the study. \"For both years of our study, Kia dealers have earned very high levels of trust from their customers,\" noted Ian Beavis, chief strategy officer, AMCI Global. \"This, combined with strong OEM trust, puts them solidly in the top tier of the industry in terms of trust.\"\nAbout Kia Motors America\nHeadquartered in Irvine, California, Kia Motors America continues to top quality surveys and is recognized as one of the 100 Best Global Brands and 50 Best Global Green Brands by Interbrand. Kia serves as the \"Official Automotive Partner\" of the NBA and LPGA and offers a complete range of vehicles sold through a network of nearly 800 dealers in the U.S., including cars and SUVs proudly built in West Point, Georgia.*\nFor media information, including photography, visit www.kiamedia.com .
