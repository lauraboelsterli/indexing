The effective rate of return is around 5.3 percent,” the official said.\n“It was a good offer. The loan has a three-year grace period. Then in the next five years, the government will be repaying $100 million biannually.”\nAnother ministry official confirmed the deal.\nThe new borrowing comes after Sri Lanka raised a record $2.5 billion via two tranches of sovereign bonds last month.\nThe government is also preparing to refinance big debts that fall due up to 2022, with the start this year of repayments on expensive infrastructure foreign loans.\nThe government has blamed “colossal borrowing” by the previous government for the spike in debt servicing.\nFinance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said last week the debt crisis would further worsen next year, when $4.3 billion has to be paid for debt servicing in 2019. Some 77 percent of the next year repayments are for debts obtained by the previous government, he said.\nSri Lanka, which has a $87 billion economy, expects foreign currency outflows of $6.35 billion in the next 12 months including loans, securities, and deposits, compared with the current $9.1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, according to the latest official central bank data.\nThe cabinet has approved plans to borrow some $5 billion in 2018 to refinance the debts due this year.\nThe island nation plans overall net foreign borrowing of 300 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($1.90 billion) this year, 9.1 percent lower than 2017, budget data showed.
