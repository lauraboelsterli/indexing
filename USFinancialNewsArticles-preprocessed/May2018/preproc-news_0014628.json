    "text": "CINCINNATI, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP) today reported solid operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and provided an update on its comprehensive performance-improvement plan, which is gaining significant momentum toward creating meaningful value for its shareholders in the near- and long-term.\nFor the quarter, total revenue was $254 million compared to $198 million in first-quarter 2017.\nFor the quarter, loss from continuing operations was $8.6 million or 10 cents per share. In the prior-year quarter, loss from continuing operations was $2.7 million or 3 cents per share. The current-year quarter included $3.8 million of restructuring charges, which increased the loss from continuing operations by $2.8 million or 3 cents per share.\nBusiness highlights\nIn the Local Media segment, the number of subscribers to over-the-top services in Scripps markets grew to 350,000 by year end, driving retransmission revenue by adding to our traditional cable and satellite subscriber counts, which remained stable through the end of the year.\nThe Emmy Award-nominated daytime talker \"Pickler & Ben\" has cleared 150 markets for its second season, up from 38 in season one. Audiences in Boston, Atlanta, Seattle, Minneapolis and other cities outside Scripps' footprint will enjoy the show for the first time this September.\nThe National Media segment marked its second consecutive quarter of profitability, with $2 million in segment profit in the first quarter.\nThe Katz networks continue to expand their national footprints, with each of the four networks now reaching over 90 percent of the U.S.: Bounce reaches 91 percent of U.S. households while Grit reaches 90 percent and Laff and Escape each reach 93 percent.\nRevenue at Newsy more than tripled from the prior-year period, driven primarily by over-the-top advertising. Continuing to grow its cable distribution, Newsy is on track toward its goal of signing contracts covering 40 million cable and satellite households by the end of 2018.\nIn March, Marvel released its \"Wolverine: The Long Night\" podcast exclusively on Stitcher Premium. Midroll also has announced a new partnership with Freakonomics author Stephen J. Dubner to co-produce his popular, long-running Freakonomics podcast and help him expand the Freakonomics brand in the Stitcher network.\nOn March 26, shareholders received a dividend of 5 cents per share. This marked Scripps' first regular dividend in 10 years and a continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\nThe company remains on track to grow cash flow from operations by more than 40 percent from 2016 levels by 2020, improve margins by 400 basis points between 2018 and 2020 and realize costs savings of $10 million in 2018 and $30 million starting in 2019.\nCommenting on the business highlights, Scripps President and CEO Adam Symson said:\n\"During the first quarter, we continued to see the tangible impact of our plan that improves our short-term performance and positions the company for long-term growth. We began the execution of our cost-cutting initiatives, are exploring potential television station swap opportunities and are divesting our radio stations. The aggressive plan we outlined in September is specific and actionable and will drive meaningful margin and cash-flow improvement.\n\"In our Local Media segment, we saw nice growth in our over-the-top service subscribers and stabilization in our legacy contracts. We remain on track to meet our full-year retransmission revenue expectations.\n\"In the National Media division, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of positive segment profit, bolstered by the Katz networks. Their newly expanded reach combined with audience growth allow these audience-targeted networks to capture more premium advertising dollars and grow their contribution.\n\"Our next-generation national news network Newsy continues to expand its distribution across cable and over-the-top. A recent partnership with PolitiFact is one of several we expect will bring Newsy additional visibility, brand recognition and loyal followers. We continue to invest in Newsy and Midroll to capture the greatest long-term growth.\n\"On the capital allocation front, shareholders received their first regular quarterly dividend, allowing them to share in the immediate benefits of our company growth plans.\"\nFirst-quarter operating results\nRevenue was $254 million, an increase of 28 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Revenue from the Katz networks, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017, was $42.7 million.\nCosts and expenses for segments, shared services and corporate were $235 million, up from $184 million in the year-ago period, primarily driven by higher network programming fees and the acquisition of Katz.\nFirst-quarter results by segment compared to prior-period amounts were:\nLocal Media\nIn the first quarter of 2018, revenue from the Local Media group was $192 million, up 2.7 percent from the prior-year quarter.\nRetransmission revenue increased 6.9 percent to $70.8 million. Retransmission revenue was affected by a one-time refund of $2.1 million to an MVPD that mistakenly overpaid us over several quarters in 2016 and 2017 on out-of-market subscribers.\nCore advertising increased 0.2 percent.\nTotal segment expenses increased 3.7 percent to $160 million, primarily driven by increases in programming fees tied to network affiliation agreements.\nFirst-quarter segment profit was $31.6 million, compared to $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter.\nNational Media\nIn the first quarter of 2018, revenue from the National Media division was $60.7 million, up from $9.7 million in the prior-year period. Revenue from Katz was $42.7 million. Excluding the impact of Katz, revenue increased 87 percent.\nExpenses for National Media were $58.7 million, up from $13.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Katz networks, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst-quarter segment profit was $2 million, compared to a loss of $4 million in the 2017 quarter.\nFinancial condition\nAt the end of 2017, radio operations were classified as held for sale. The radio segment results are included in discontinued operations. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. Discontinued operations include a $20 million non-cash charge to write down the assets of our radio business to fair value.\nOn March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $130 million while total debt was $693 million.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 285,000 shares for $4.4 million. In November 2016, the board of directors authorized a $100 million share repurchase program that expires at the end of 2018. The company also made dividend payments totaling $4.1 million.\nLooking ahead\nComparisons are to the same periods of 2017.\nSecond-quarter 2018\nLocal Media revenue\nUp mid-single-digits\nRetransmission revenue\nUp about 10 percent\nLocal Media expense\nUp high single digits\nNational Media revenue\nIn the low-to-mid $60 million range\nNational Media expense\nIn the low-to-mid $60 million range\nShared services and\nCorporate\nAbout $14 million\nInterest expense\nConsistent with prior quarters\nPension expense\nConsistent with prior quarters\nCapex\nMid-to-high single-digit millions\nDepreciation & amortization\nAbout $15 million\nConference call\nThe senior management of The E.W.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe determine our business segments based upon our management and internal reporting structures, as well as the basis that our chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions.\nEffective December 31, 2017, we realigned our businesses into a new internal organization and began reporting to reflect this new structure. Under the new structure, we have the following reportable segments: Local Media, National Media and Other. We have recast the operating results for all periods to reflect this change.\nOur Local Media segment includes our local broadcast stations and their related digital operations. It is comprised of fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, one independent station and three Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. Our Local Media segment earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to local, national and political advertisers and retransmission fees received from cable operators, telecommunications companies and satellite carriers. We also receive retransmission fees from over-the-top virtual MVPDs such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue.\nOur National Media segment includes our collection of national brands. Our national brands are Katz, Midroll, Newsy and other national brands. These operations earn revenue primarily through the sale of advertising.\nWe allocate a portion of certain corporate costs and expenses, including information technology, certain employee benefits and shared services, to our business segments. The allocations are generally amounts agreed upon by management, which may differ from an arms-length amount. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, property and equipment primarily used for corporate purposes and deferred income taxes.\nOur chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to our business segments using a measure called segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, defined benefit pension plan expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income (loss) determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nInformation regarding the operating results of our business segments is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nLocal Media\n$\n192,059\n$\n187,064\n2.7%\nNational Media\n60,721\n9,687\nOther\n1,411\n1,724\n(18.2)%\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n254,191\n$\n198,475\n28.1%\nSegment profit (loss):\nLocal Media\n$\n31,619\n$\n32,351\n(2.3)%\nNational Media\n2,035\n(3,957)\nOther\n(251)\n249\nShared services and corporate\n(14,087)\n(14,582)\n(3.4)%\nRestructuring costs\n(3,807)\n—\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n(15,420)\n(13,861)\nGains (losses), net on disposal of property and equipment\n(717)\n(47)\nInterest expense\n(8,759)\n(4,195)\nDefined benefit pension plan expense\n(1,388)\n(3,467)\nMiscellaneous, net\n167\n(879)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n(10,608)\n$\n(8,388)\nOperating results for our Local Media segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nCore advertising\n$\n116,010\n$\n115,733\n0.2%\nPolitical\n2,584\n1,041\nRetransmission\n70,791\n66,211\n6.9%\nOther\n2,674\n4,079\n(34.4)%\nTotal operating revenues\n192,059\n187,064\n2.7%\nSegment costs and expenses:\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n74,182\n73,453\n1.0%\nProgramming\n53,145\n44,935\n18.3%\nOther expenses\n33,113\n36,325\n(8.8)%\nTotal costs and expenses\n160,440\n154,713\n3.7%\nSegment profit\n$\n31,619\n$\n32,351\n(2.3)%\nOperating results for our National Media segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nKatz\n$\n42,650\n$\n—\nMidroll\n10,985\n6,513\n68.7%\nNewsy\n3,657\n1,202\nOther\n3,429\n1,972\n73.9%\nTotal operating revenues\n60,721\n9,687\nSegment costs and expenses:\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n12,719\n6,505\n95.5%\nProgramming\n30,218\n3,788\nOther expenses\n15,749\n3,351\nTotal costs and expenses\n58,686\n13,644\nSegment profit\n$\n2,035\n$\n(3,957)\n2.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (\"EPS\")\nUnvested awards of share-based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our RSUs, are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating EPS. Under the two-class method, we allocate a portion of net income to these participating securities and, therefore, exclude that income from the calculation of EPS for common stock. We do not allocate losses to the participating securities.\nThe following table presents information about basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNumerator (for basic and diluted earnings per share)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n$\n(8,577)\n$\n(2,733)\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n632\n—\nNumerator for basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to the\nshareholders of The E.W.
