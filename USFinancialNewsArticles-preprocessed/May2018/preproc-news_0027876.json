    "text": "TORONTO, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (TSX:DPM) (the “ Company ”) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (“ TSX ”) accepted its notice of intention to renew its normal course issuer bid (the “ New Bid ”) to repurchase certain of its common shares (“ Shares ”) through the facilities of the TSX. The Company commenced a normal course issuer bid (the “ Current Bid ”) on May 16, 2017, which is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2018. Under the Current Bid, the Company sought and obtained approval to purchase up to 8.9 million Shares.\nThe number of Shares that can be purchased during the period of the New Bid, which commences on May 16, 2018 and terminates on May 15, 2019, will not exceed 8.9 million Shares, being approximately 5% of the 178,492,566 outstanding Shares as of May 3, 2018. All purchases made pursuant to the New Bid will be made through the facilities of the TSX or other alternative trading systems in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws and Shares repurchased pursuant to the New Bid will be cancelled. Pursuant to the terms of the New Bid, the Company will not acquire on any given trading day more than 43,244 Shares, representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of Shares for the most recently completed six month period, being 172,979 Shares, other than block purchase exceptions.\nThe actual timing and number of Shares that may be purchased pursuant to the New Bid will be subject to the Company’s ongoing capital requirements and management’s view that, from time to time, the Company’s Shares trade at prices well below the underlying value of the Company and during these periods the repurchase of Shares represents an excellent opportunity to enhance shareholder value.\nThe Company has re-appointed RBC Capital Markets to make any purchases under the New Bid on its behalf. Under the Current Bid, the Company sought and obtained approval to purchase up to 8.9 million Shares but did not purchase any Shares under the Current Bid.\nAbout Dundee Precious Metals Inc.\nDundee Precious Metals Inc. is a Canadian based, international gold mining company engaged in the acquisition of mineral properties, exploration, development, mining and processing of precious metals.
