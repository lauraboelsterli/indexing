    "text": "WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Securities and commercial litigator Eric A. Kuwana has joined Cooley as a partner. Based in Washington, DC, and New York, Kuwana joins from Katten Muchin Rosenman, where he was partner and co-chair of the firm’s securities litigation and enforcement practice.\n“Eric is a highly sought after first-chair trial lawyer who advocates vigorously for his clients,” said Michael Attanasio, chair of Cooley’s global litigation department. “Eric fits perfectly into our culture of premier courtroom advocacy, and he will play a critical role for Cooley’s clients as a trusted adviser and trial lawyer. We are pleased to welcome him to our market-leading securities litigation group.”\nKuwana is an experienced litigator who regularly represents companies, their officers, directors and board committees in complex shareholder, securities, derivative, SEC enforcement matters and internal and government investigations. He is also a nationally recognized first-chair trial lawyer who regularly tries high-exposure corporate cases, real estate and finance disputes, product liability, business torts and sensitive government and political matters.\nHe has represented a wide range of publicly traded and privately held companies in the technology, education, banking, real estate finance, life sciences, manufacturing, food and beverage, insurance and financial services industries. In 2015, Kuwana was recognized by the National Law Journal as one of the top trial lawyers in the country for his successful defense of a real estate finance client in a federal trial where his client was awarded a nine-figure judgment against the plaintiff.\n“Cooley’s bench of experienced trial lawyers around the world has become an increasingly formidable practice,” Kuwana said. “I look forward to working with this remarkable team and further establishing Cooley as the go-to litigation firm for the world’s leading companies and innovators.”\nBefore entering private practice, Kuwana served under President George H. W. Bush in the White House Office of Counsel to the President. He also served as an attorney in the US Department of Transportation. Prior to his multiple leadership roles at Katten Muchin Rosenman, he was a practice and department leader at Patton Boggs. He received his JD from the University of Kansas.\nEarlier this year, The American Lawyer recognized Cooley’s exceptional litigation and trial practice with an honorable mention in its biennial Litigation Department of the Year contest. Other publications have also lauded the meteoric rise of Cooley’s litigation practice. BTI Consulting Group named Cooley a Litigation Powerhouse in five categories, and The Lawyer again recognized Cooley’s litigation growth and outstanding advocacy in its annual Global Litigation 50 report. Law360 has heralded Cooley as a “go-to” firm for its litigation work, ranking it among the elite US law firms on its Litigation Powerhouse list.\nAbout Cooley LLP\nClients partner with Cooley on transformative deals, complex IP and regulatory matters, and high-stakes litigation, where innovation meets the law.\nCooley has 900+ lawyers across 13 offices in the United States, China and Europe.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005278/en/\nCooley\nAndrea Orzehoski, 212-479-6732\nAorzehoski@cooley.com\nSource: Cooley LLP",
