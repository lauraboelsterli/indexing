    "text": "Published: May 24, 2018 6:52 p.m. ET Share\n46% spike in home runs in last four years Reuters/USA Today Sports Players like the Washington Nationals’ Bryce Harper aren’t complaining about the surge in home runs.\nBy Jared Diamond\nMajor League Baseball finally acknowledged on Thursday what had long been suspected. The baseball themselves are, at least in part, responsible for the increase in home runs across the sport dating back to the 2015 season. But the committee of 10 scientists MLB assembled to conduct a study into this power surge couldn’t answer one crucial question: What changed?\nMLB’s study concluded that the balls have become more aerodynamic, flying farther through the air with less resistance. That isn’t due to any meaningful difference in the size, weight or seam height of the balls. The balls aren’t any bouncier off the bat. A visit to the plant in Costa Rica where baseballs are made was fruitless. In fact, the researchers could find nothing in the manufacturing process or materials used that would account for the nearly 46% spike in homers from 2014 to 2017.\nNonetheless, fly balls are traveling greater distances than they once did, a phenomenon affecting all batters, regardless of their home run-hitting ability. Alan Nathan, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Illinois and the study’s chairman, admitted that he still doesn’t know why.\nThe researchers ruled out factors like the weather, pitching strategies or a widespread change in hitting approach. It is true that MLB’s official specifications for baseball manufacturing are broad — a ball made on one end of the allowable spectrum can theoretically travel nearly 36 feet farther than a ball on the other. The study, however, found that Rawlings, the company that manufactures the balls, has achieved far greater precision in practice. Nathan called for further research into the surface roughness of the current baseballs, as well as studying the location of the “pills”—the core of the ball. The researchers theorized that a more properly centered pill could result in improved aerodynamic properties, though they were unable to reach a conclusion on the issue with the tools available to them for this study.
