    "text": "PHOENIX, May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bollente Companies, Inc. (OTCQB: BOLC) released its earnings report for Q1 2018, touting a company record 268% year-over-year increase in sales and a fourth consecutive quarter of increasing gross margins. These gains are attributable to accelerated demand for its trutankless line of smart water heaters, meteoric growth in channel sales, a continued focus on customer experience and the company's recently improved cost structure.\n\"2018 is proving itself to be a breakout year for trutankless,\" said Michael Stebbins, president of trutankless. \"Our record first quarter results continue the trends of prior quarters, we're still gaining momentum, and we're on pace to increase production three-fold over the next twelve months.\"\n\"In the past, electric tankless water heaters didn't work well and didn't last; the technology wasn't there,\" commented Troy Koopman, General Manager of Horizon Plumbing in Arlington, Texas. \"It wasn't really an option for us, but now it is with the trutankless products.\"\nAs a testament to the company's focus on service, Houzz.com awarded trutankless its fourth consecutive \"Best of Houzz\" designation for achieving the highest level of client satisfaction in January 2018.\n\"Our sales team strives for exceptional service with every customer, from the first contact through installation and beyond,\" said Stebbins. \"Our perfect reviews on Houzz.com are well-earned.\"\nBollente Companies launched its trutankless water heater line in 2014. It was named \"Best Home Technology Product\" and received the Governor's Award of Merit for Energy and Technology Innovation at Arizona Forward's Environmental Excellence Awards. Since then, the product has garnered a multitude of accolades for its smart home technology and energy efficiency, as well as being featured as a water saving device in Consumer Reports' Top 5 Remodeling Trends for 2016 write-up.
