    "text": "Sam Gaviglio pitched six strong innings, Justin Smoak hit a two-run homer and the visiting Toronto Blue Jays held on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 Friday night at Citizens Bank Park.\nThe Phillies had home runs from starting pitcher Zach Eflin and Carlos Santana in the opener of a three-game interleague series.\nGaviglio (2-0) allowed three runs, three hits (including two home runs), and two walks while striking out six in his second start since being recalled from Triple-A Buffalo. The right hander’s other Toronto win was in relief.\nRyan Tepera picked up his first save of the season despite allowing one run, a single, a double, two walks and a wild pitch in a hairy ninth inning.\nEflin (1-1) allowed six runs (five earned), nine hits and one walk in 4 2/3 innings. The right-hander struck out seven.\nThe Blue Jays scored three runs in the first inning. Josh Donaldson doubled with one out, took third on Smoak’s groundout and scored on Teoscar Hernandez’s infield single to shortstop. Yangervis Solarte and Kevin Pillar followed with RBI doubles.\nSolarte has an extra-base hit in five straight games.\nAfter Gaviglio doubled for his first major league extra-base hit in the second inning, Eflin hit his first career homer with two outs in the third.\nThe Blue Jays increased their lead to 6-1 in the fifth. Curtis Granderson singled to lead off and one out later Smoak hit his seventh homer of the season. Solarte singled with two outs, took second on a passed ball and moved to third on a throwing error by third baseman Maikel Franco on Pillar’s grounder. Victor Arano replaced Eflin and Russell Martin hit an RBI single.\nThe Phillies scored twice in the bottom of the sixth. Odubel Herrera doubled with two out and Santana hit his ninth homer of the season.\nToronto reliever Seunghwan Oh pitched around a leadoff walk in the bottom of the seventh.\nPhillies left-hander Adam Morgan survived a leadoff infield single in the seventh and pitched a perfect eighth.\nCesar Hernandez led off the bottom of the eighth with a double against Tyler Clippard to reach base for the 28th straight game. Rhys Hoskins followed with an RBI double.\nThe Phillies rallied again in the final inning as Jorge Alfaro singled with one out, took third on Pedro Florimon’s double and scored on Tepera’s wild pitch. Hernandez walked to load the bases. After a mound meeting, Hoskins struck out looking and Herrera grounded out to second to end the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
