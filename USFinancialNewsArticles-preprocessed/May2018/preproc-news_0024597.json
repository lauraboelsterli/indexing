    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChromaDex Corporation (NASDAQ:CDXC), a science-based, integrated nutraceutical company devoted to improving the way people age, announced today first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights vs. First Quarter 2017\nNet sales up 95%, fueled by growth of TRU NIAGEN®; Gross profit as a percentage of net sales flat at approximately 48%, which includes certain charges; Excluding charges, gross profit was 52.5%; NIAGEN®-related sales at 65% of total sales, up from 29%; TRU NIAGEN sales at 71% of NIAGEN-related sales, up from 1%; Appointed Nobel Laureate, Sir John Walker, Emeritus Director and Professor at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit at Cambridge to the Scientific Advisory Board; and 18 human studies in various stages of completion.\n“The growth of TRU NIAGEN continues to exceed our expectations,” said Rob Fried, President and Chief Operating Officer. “Sales are growing at very strong pace, and we are continuing to pursue strategic partnerships in several new markets.”\nFrank Jaksch, Jr., CEO and co-founder of ChromaDex commented: “ChromaDex has been built on a foundation of solid science, and that foundation continues to strengthen. The total number of research collaborations signed with prestigious universities and research institutions for NIAGEN continues to grow. This, along with the work of our in-house team of scientists and PhDs, leaves us confident this research will expand the growing body of evidence demonstrating the importance of NIAGEN.”\nResults of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”), ChromaDex reported net sales of $6.6 million, up 95% compared to $3.4 million from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2017 (\"Q1 2017\"). The increase in first quarter revenues was driven by growth in sales of TRU NIAGEN.\nGross margin as a percentage of sales was roughly flat at 48% for both periods. Excluding a write-off related to the purchase of private label consumer products inventory from certain NIAGEN resellers which are no longer distributors of our product, adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP measure, as a percentage of net sales, was 52.5% for Q1 2018 as compared to 48.0% for the same period in 2017. We experienced better margins due to the positive impact of TRU NIAGEN consumer product sales, which we anticipate will continue.\nOperating expenses were $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.4 million from continuing operations in the same period for 2017. The increase of $8.1 million in operating expenses for first quarter was the result of the Company’s strategic decision to invest $2.6 million in advertising and marketing to build out the TRU NIAGEN brand, higher R&D expenses of $0.8 million as well as legal costs of $2.4 million, and higher stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million. Excluding incremental legal expenses and equity-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses were $3.6 million, which were up by $1.3 million as compared to the prior year.\nThe net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.4 million or ($0.15) per share as compared to a net loss of $1.9 million or ($0.05) per share for Q1 2017. The higher losses in the first quarter were the result of the strategic decision to invest ahead of growth including higher stock-based compensation expense related to the hiring of senior executives, and higher legal fees, partially offset by higher sales volume and gross profits.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the reported loss was negatively impacted by a non-cash charge of $1.3 million related to stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was ($7.0) million for Q1 2018, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($1.4) million for Q1 2017. ChromaDex defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax, interest, depreciation, amortization and non-cash stock compensation costs. The Basic and Diluted Adjusted EBITDA per share for Q1 2018 was ($0.13) versus ($0.04) for Q1 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the net cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million versus $51,000 in the prior year. We ended the first quarter of 2018 with a cash of $41.0 million.\nOutlook\nFor 2018, the Company expects to realize continued growth in TRU NIAGEN sales driven by our U.S. ecommerce and Watsons’ international business, as well as the launch of TRU NIAGEN in certain new international markets. The growth is expected to be concentrated in the second half of the year. The Company will continue to invest in marketing expenditures to build out the TRU NIAGEN brand, infrastructure, and new capabilities to support growth.\nInvestor Conference Call\nChromaDex management will host an investor conference call to discuss the year end results and provide a general business update on Thurs., May 10, at 4:30pm ET.\nParticipants should call in at least 10 minutes prior to the call.
