FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - West Ham United vs Everton - London Stadium, London, Britain - May 13, 2018 West Ham United manager David Moyes during a lap of honour after the match REUTERS/Eddie Keogh\nA statement on West Ham’s website confirming Moyes’s departure said the club wanted to take a “different direction”.\nMoyes took charge with West Ham in 18th place after a dismal start to the season under Bilic in which they won two of their first 11 league games.\nFormer Everton and Manchester United manager Moyes managed to steady the ship and Sunday’s victory over the Toffees meant they finished the season in 13th place.\nHe won nine of his 31 games in charge.\nWednesday’s statement said Moyes’s assistants Alan Irvine, Stuart Pearce and Billy McKinlay had also departed.

He, Alan, Stuart and Billy accepted the challenge and attacked it head on, turning around a difficult situation.\n“They deserve great respect for the job they have done and they leave the club with our best wishes.”\nMoyes had to work in a difficult atmosphere at the London Stadium, West Ham’s unpopular new home since they left Upton Park in 2016. Fans have been increasingly disenchanted with the club’s owners and protested at some home games. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThings reached a head in March when supporters invaded the pitch during the 3-0 home defeat by Burnley which left West Ham in 16th place, three points above the relegation zone.\nWest Ham crucially beat Southampton and eeked out a draw with Chelsea and ensured survival with a win at Leicester City with two games to spare.\nDespite keeping West Ham safe, Sullivan said Moyes was only regarded as a short-term fix.\n“When David and his team arrived, it was the wish of both parties that the focus be only on the six months until the end of the season, at which point a decision would be made with regards to the future,” he said.\n“Having taken stock of the situation and reflected now the campaign is complete, we feel that it is right to move in a different direction.”\nThe club said they would seek to recruit a “high-calibre” manager within the next 10 days.\nFormer Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is one of the names in the frame for the job as is Shakhtar Donetsk’s Portuguese manager Paulo Fonseca.
