    "text": "Distinction Based on Feedback and Ratings from End-User Professionals Who Have Experience Purchasing, Implementing and/or Using the Product or Service\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- McAfee, the device-to-cloud cybersecurity company, today announced it was named a 2018 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Cloud Access Security Brokers. Gartner defines the cloud access security brokers ( CASB ) market as products and services that provide visibility into general cloud application usage, data protection and governance for enterprise-sanctioned cloud applications. This technology is the result of the need to secure the significantly increased adoption of cloud services and access to them from users both within and outside of the traditional enterprise perimeter.\n“We take great pride in being named a 2018 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Cloud Access Security Brokers,” said Rajiv Gupta, senior vice president of the Cloud Security Business Unit at McAfee. “McAfee/Skyhigh was the first cloud access security broker provider to secure corporate data in the cloud by delivering a cloud-native security solution. It is our customer satisfaction and feedback that continues to drive our innovation and shape our products and services. We are grateful for this feedback and recognition.”\n“The Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice is a recognition of vendors in this market by verified end-user professionals, taking into account both the number of reviews and the overall user ratings.” To ensure fair evaluation, Gartner maintains rigorous criteria for recognizing vendors with a high customer satisfaction rate. For this distinction, a vendor must have a minimum of 50 published reviews with an average overall rating of 4.2 stars or higher. McAfee received 102 reviews , more than twice the next vendor in the CASB category, and an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 for McAfee Skyhigh Security Cloud as of May 15, 2018.\nAdditional Resources:\nVisit the McAfee cloud security blog for excerpts from customers that contributed to the distinction Read the Gartner Peer Insights’ Customers’ Choice announcement\nAbout Peer Insights:\nPeer Insights is an online platform of ratings and reviews of IT software and services that are written and read by IT professionals and technology decision-makers.
