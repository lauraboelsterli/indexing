    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - More than half of Lebanon’s MPs nominated Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri as prime minister on Thursday during consultations with President Michel Aoun, al-Jadeed TV reported, confirming that he is set to be designated premier for a third time.\nAoun is obliged to designate the candidate with the greatest support among the 128 members of parliament. Hariri was widely expected to be designated prime minister as Lebanon’s leading Sunni politician. The post is reserved for a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system.\nThe consultations continue into the afternoon.\nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
