    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ideal Power Inc. (NASDAQ:IPWR), an innovative power conversion technology company, reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey First Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Highlights:\nCompleted executive management team changes and corporate restructuring to support recent progress with PPSA™ and B-TRAN™ technologies and the following executive management changes were made: Chairman of the Board, Dr. Lon E Bell, appointed Chief Executive Officer and President. Former Chief Executive Officer Dan Brdar appointed Chief Commercial Officer of B-TRAN™ division. Chief Financial Officer Tim Burns will manage Power Conversion Systems business development, purchasing and customer support functions in addition to his continued role as Chief Financial Officer. Vice President of Engineering Uwe Uhmeyer will manage Power Conversion Systems R&D and product development activities. Power electronics thought leader Ted Lesster appointed to the company’s board of directors.\nPower Conversion Systems Division\nReceived a 1.1-megawatt purchase order for SunDial™ Plus inverters from NEXTracker for one of the largest solar + storage installations in Iowa. Received a two-megawatt purchase order for SunDial™ Plus inverters for large-scale deployment of advanced solar + storage solution in China. Signed a master purchase agreement with Bosch, a leading global technology and services provider, to provide Stabiliti™ power conversion systems for Bosch’s high-efficiency building solutions. Completed 750-Kilowatt purchase order with JLM Energy for Stabiliti™ series products. PPSA™ Patent Estate: Currently have 43 issued PPSA™ patents with 5 of those patents issued outside the United States, including coverage in China and Europe. In addition, our pending PPSA™ patent portfolio will potentially provide coverage in India.\nB-TRAN™ Division\nCompleted successful proof of concept testing of Bi-directional bi-polar junction TRANsistor (B-TRAN™) prototypes with test results supporting third-party simulations. B-TRAN™ Patent Estate: Currently have 38 issued B-TRAN™ patents with 8 of those patents issued outside the United States in China, Europe and Australia. Our pending B-TRAN™ patent portfolio includes approximately 40 patent filings and will potentially provide coverage in Japan, South Korea and India.\nManagement Commentary\n\"The first quarter of 2018 was highlighted with progress in our target markets as evidenced by wins with Brantingham & Carroll International (BCI), JLM Energy and Bosch,” said Ideal Power CEO Dr. Lon Bell. “Most importantly, the BCI win represents our first large scale deployment for a solar + storage solution in the Chinese market and we are encouraged to see a large international market such as China embracing solutions utilizing solar + storage. Excitingly, our B-TRAN™ division made notable progress during the quarter as we completed a successful proof of concept testing of B-TRAN™ prototypes with test results supporting third-party simulations. We expect to have engineering samples for potential customers and partners later this year,” continued Bell.\n“Subsequent to the closing of the first quarter of 2018, we announced new executive management team changes as part of a strategic restructuring to support operational progress with our two primary technologies: PPSA™, a power conversion technology, and B-TRAN™, a solid-state switch technology. These two separate operating divisions, Power Conversion Systems and B-TRAN™, each have their own proprietary technologies, time-to-market, paths-to-market and manpower skill sets for successful commercialization. This strategic approach will not only leverage our time, resources and critical human capital, but also provide optionality for strategic partners.\n“As we enter the midpoint of the second quarter of 2018, the recent growth in our order backlog and sales pipeline is an encouraging sign for the Power Conversion Systems division. Moreover, we recently announced our first material purchase order from NEXTracker for one of the largest solar-and-storage installations in Iowa that also represents NEXTracker’s first large-scale installation of the NX Flow solution,” concluded Bell.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nQ1 2018 product revenue totalled $0.2 million versus $0.3 million in Q1 2017. Q1 2018 gross margins were negative 84% compared to negative 158% in Q1 2017. Gross margins were negatively impacted by warranty reserve adjustments related primarily to our discontinued first-generation IBC-30 product. Q1 2018 net loss was $2.1 million compared to Q1 2017 net loss of $3.1 million. Q1 2018 cash used in operating and investing activities was $1.9 million compared to $2.5 million in Q1 2017. Cash and cash equivalents totalled $8.2 million as of March 31, 2018, with no long-term debt outstanding.\n“Although Q1 2018 product revenue was muted, based upon our current backlog, we are confident second quarter product revenue will be in excess of $500,000 with continued progress in sequential quarters,” said Tim Burns, Chief Financial Officer. “On the cash management side, we continue to maintain our quarterly cash burn in the range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million with Q1 being slightly higher than this baseline due to unfavorable balance sheet timing, which is typical for us in the first quarter of the year.”\nConference Call Details\nIdeal Power Chairman, CEO and President Dr. Lon Bell, CFO Tim Burns and B-TRAN Chief Commercial Officer Dan Brdar will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer period.\nTo access the call, please use the following information:\nDate: Thursday, May 10, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. ET, 1:30 p.m. PT\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-800-289-0438\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-794-2423\nConference ID: 4731445\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

While management has based any included in this release on its current expectations, the information on which such expectations were based may change. These rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of our control that could cause actual results to materially differ from such statements. Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to, market acceptance of our products in the solar + storage market, the success of our B-TRAN technology, whether the patents for our technology provide adequate protection and whether we can be successful in maintaining, enforcing and defending our patents, the timing and impact of regulatory developments affecting the markets for our products, our inability to predict with precision or certainty the pace of development and commercialization of our advanced technologies, unanticipated costs in connection with the discontinuation our legacy product families, the uncertainty of whether the demand for energy storage products will grow at a pace consistent with our expectations, whether our backlog will translate into revenue in future periods, whether demand for our products will develop, and whether we can compete successfully with other manufacturers and suppliers of power conversion products, both now and in the future, as new products are developed and marketed, whether our cost reduction efforts will be successful and other risks and uncertainties set forth in our quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment where new and unanticipated risks may arise. The availability and amount of government incentive programs affect our customers spending patterns, and adverse changes or developments in such programs – such as the SGIP in California – have materially and adversely affected our orders, net sales, gross profit and net income, and may do so again in the future.
