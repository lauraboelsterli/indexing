    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Versartis, Inc . (Nasdaq:VSAR), an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We have undertaken additional efforts to aggressively manage our cash as we work diligently to complete our strategic review process,” said Jay Shepard, President and CEO of Versartis, Inc. “We acknowledge the patience our shareholders have shown during this process and we are committed to providing an update as soon as we can.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, Versartis reported a net loss of approximately $9.0 million, or $0.25 per share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $29.7 million, or $0.85 per share, basic and diluted.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $8.5 million compared to $29.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $3.6 million, compared to $22.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to the termination of clinical and manufacturing related contracts that supported the company’s Phase 3 clinical trials for somavaratan following the Phase 3 VELOCITY trial failing to meet its primary endpoint.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $7.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to the reduction in workforce and our continued efforts to reduce consulting and professional services expenses following the Phase 3 VELOCITY trial failing to meet its primary endpoint.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million compared to $3.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $74.7 million as of March 31, 2018.\nContacts:\nKevin Haas\nVP, Finance\n(650) 963-8595\nkhaas@versartis.com\nVersartis, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating expenses Research and development $ 3,600 $ 22,004 General and administrative 4,917 7,656 Total operating expenses 8,517 29,660 Loss from operations (8,517 ) (29,660 ) Interest income 193 199 Other income (expense), net (657 ) (261 ) Net loss (8,981 ) (29,722 ) Net loss per share- basic and diluted $ (0.25 ) $ (0.85 ) Weighted-average common shares used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share 36,019 35,004 Versartis, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 74,686 $ 81,146 Other assets 3,594 3,743 Build-to-suit lease asset 8,829 8,888 Total assets $ 87,109 $ 93,777 Liabilities and stockholders' equity: Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 3,535 $ 5,593 Build-to-suit lease obligation 6,944 5,428 Total liabilities 10,479 11,021 Total stockholders' equity 76,630 82,756 Total liabilities and stockholders ’ equity $ 87,109 $ 93,777\nSource:Versartis, Inc.",
