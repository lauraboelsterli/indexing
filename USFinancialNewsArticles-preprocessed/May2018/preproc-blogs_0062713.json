    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning from the WSJ City desks in London. WSJ City is the app that delivers concise, smart news on business and finance for mobile. Download for iPhone or Android . Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nThe Trump administration, unable to win concessions from European Union counterparts ahead of a Friday deadline, is planning to make good on its threat to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminium, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe Federal Reserve has proposed easing a rule designed to curb risky trading in the wake of the financial crisis, one of the most significant deregulatory measures for banks since President Donald Trump took office.\nHow risky is Italy? Pretty risky according to one key measure of the bond market. Investors were demanding more risk premium for holding short term debt than long term. That’s highly unusual for a sovereign state borrower.\nThe situation in Italy today is very different from the crises that engulfed the eurozone between 2010 and 2015. It is at the same time both potentially more serious and yet more easily resolved, writes WSJ’s chief European commentator Simon Nixon.\nThe unthinkable has happened: Not everyone is overly bullish on big Chinese internet and tech stocks anymore.\nOne of the currencies left most bruised by the dollar’s resurgence has arrested its decline and is clawing back lost ground. Turkey’s lira has recovered around 9% since plumbing a record low on May 23.\nShort sellers looking for an easy life are learning not to pick on well-defended Chinese stocks. Whether that is a good sign for the broader Hong Kong market is highly debatable, writes Jacky Wong for Heard on the Street.\nIN THE PAPERS\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo opened two days of high-level talks with a senior North Korean official, as the Trump administration tries to establish whether there is enough common ground to proceed with a summit in Singapore next month. WSJ\nBrussels is to propose a €30 billion loan plan for countries hit by economic shocks, as it responds to French calls for a eurozone crisis-fighting budget. FT (£)\nFrance is blocking Britain’s attempt to remain part of a European Union security system that helps to identify foreign criminals and is designed to keep the public safe. The Times (£)\nEurope’s biggest industrial companies have warned Theresa May that they will not invest in Britain as long as there is uncertainty over the terms of its departure from the EU. FT (£)\nThe world’s deepest-pocketed investors are starting to take climate change seriously, according to Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg (£)\nMARKETS TODAY\nGlobal stocks continued to regain their composure after Tuesday’s Italian ructions, and were not rattled by news that the US plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU.\nEuropean stocks opened slightly higher, led by miners and pharmaceutical giants. Still, the Stoxx Europe 600 remained almost 1.5% lower over the course of the week, and banking shares on the index have shed more than 4%.\nUS stocks bounced on Wednesday and futures suggested they would hold their ground today. Asian shares enjoyed sizeable gains overnight, except for those in Indonesia after the central bank raised rates to halt the run on the rupiah.\nCurrency markets were quiet, oil futures edged down again and 10-year Treasury yields wavered around 2.87% – well below recent highs – ahead of inflation data due on Friday.\nCOMING UP\nEurozone flash inflation estimate; Nationwide house price index; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visits North Korea; speeches by the Fed’s James Bullard, Raphael Bostic.\nShare this: Previous Citigroup: Big Bank, Big Spender on Tech Next WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Global Growth, Cryptocurrency, Upscale Stadium Food",
