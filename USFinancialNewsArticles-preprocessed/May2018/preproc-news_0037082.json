    "text": "Teachers are public employees and generally receive pension and insurance benefits (medical, dental, vision) that cover themselves and their families. But are these benefits overly generous? Do the benefits make up for lower pay?\n\"I wouldn't necessarily say it's generous, it's way better than having nothing,\" said Tyson Gardin of Fort Mill, S.C., a physical education health teacher. \"It's not something I can complain about because there are people that don't have anything.\"\n\"You get a state plan but it comes out of your check, it's not something that's free,\" he added.\nMore from USA Today:\nWhat is the average teacher pension in my state?\nDefined benefit plans vs. Defined contribution plans",
