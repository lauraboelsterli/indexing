(NASDAQ:RPD), a leading provider of analytics solutions for security and IT operations, today announced its the first quarter of 2018.\n“Rapid7 had a strong start to 2018, putting us in a great position to achieve our 2018 goals, our long term aspirations and our overall SecOps vision,\" said Corey Thomas, President and CEO of Rapid7. \"Enterprises are prioritizing cyber security in their IT budgets, and products that provide visibility, analytics and automation continue to outgrow the overall market for security software. With a broad set of solutions, our SecOps portfolio and platform are resonating with our customers and the broader market.\"\n\"The highlight of our first quarter was our Annualized Recurring Revenue, which accelerated to 38% year over year growth, which is evidence that our shift to subscription is gaining traction. Based on the strength of our business so far this year, we are raising our guidance for growth in both ARR and revenue for 2018, maintaining our guidance for 2018 non-GAAP operating loss, as we continue to invest in the business to drive meaningful growth, and reiterating our goal of achieving non-GAAP profitability in 2019.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results (under ASC 606)\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $54.5 million.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP loss from operations was $(16.6) million and non-GAAP loss from operations was $(8.9) million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net loss was $(16.4) million or a GAAP loss per share of $(0.36) and non-GAAP net loss was $(8.6) million or a non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.19).\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenue from North America was $46.4 million and comprised 85% of total revenue. Total revenue from international was $8.1 million and comprised 15% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018.\nCash provided by operating activities was $7.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results (under ASC 605)\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $58.2 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP loss from operations was $(14.6) million, compared to GAAP loss from operations of $(10.5) million in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP loss from operations was $(6.9) million, compared to non-GAAP loss from operations of $(5.7) million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(5.4) million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $(4.6) million in in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net loss was $(14.4) million or a GAAP loss per share of $(0.32), compared to a GAAP net loss of $(10.5) million or a GAAP loss per share of $(0.25) for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, non-GAAP net loss was $(6.7) million or a non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.15), compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $(5.8) million or a non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.14) for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenue from North America increased 30% year-over-year to $49.3 million and comprised 85% of total revenue. Total revenue from international increased 22% year-over-year to $8.9 million and comprised 15% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2018.\nCash provided by operating activities was $7.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we recognized revenue under ASC 606. For the first quarter of 2017, however, we recognized revenue under ASC 605. Therefore, the periods are not directly comparable. In addition, since we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, we have presented in the table below, for the first quarter of 2018, a summary of certain consolidated financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASC 606 with a comparison of these line items to ASC 605.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Under ASC 606 Under ASC 605 Difference (in thousands)\nProducts $ 35,279 $ 37,766 $ (2,487 ) Maintenance and support 10,753 11,682 (929 ) Professional services 8,483 8,753 (270 ) Total revenue 54,515 58,201 (3,686 ) Cost of revenue - GAAP 16,594 16,616 (22 ) Gross margin - GAAP 70.0 % 71.4 % Cost of revenue - non-GAAP 15,312 15,334 (22 ) Gross margin - non-GAAP 71.9 % 73.7 % Sales and marketing - GAAP 29,052 30,743 (1,691 ) Sales and marketing - non-GAAP 27,450 29,141 (1,691 ) GAAP loss from operations (16,585 ) (14,612 ) (1,973 ) Non-GAAP loss from operations (8,872 ) (6,899 ) (1,973 ) Deferred revenue, current portion 140,448 152,336 (11,888 ) Deferred revenue, non-current portion 78,450 61,730 16,720 Total deferred revenue 218,898 214,066 4,832 Recent Business Metrics and Highlights\nAnnualized recurring revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $177.8 million, an increase of 38% year-over-year.\nIn March, InsightVM was recognized by Forrester Research, Inc. as a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Vulnerability Risk Management, Q1 2018 report. Among the vendors included in the report, Rapid7 received the highest scores in both the “Strategy” and “Current Offering” categories. “Rapid7 has already implemented what VRM will look like in the future,” wrote Forrester report author Josh Zelonis. The report also states: “Rapid7 leverages the same agent for endpoint detection and response as well as VRM to ease deployment, management, and, most importantly, to marry all your endpoint data at the point of collection.”\nOur renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018, which includes upsells and cross-sells of additional products and services, was 120%. The expiring renewal rate, which excludes upsells and cross-sells of additional products and services, was 89% in the first quarter of 2018.\n77% (under ASC 606) and 75% (under ASC 605) of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was recurring revenue, which is comprised of content subscriptions, maintenance and support, cloud-based subscriptions, managed services subscriptions, and term licenses, up from 69% in the first quarter of 2017.\n85% (under ASC 606) and 89% (under ASC 605) of total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 came from deferred revenue on the balance sheet at the beginning of the quarter.\nEnded the first quarter of 2018 with over 7,100 customers, an increase of 12% year-over-year.\nCalculated billings were $48.0 million (under ASC 606) and $47.8 million (under ASC 605) for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Growth in calculated billings was depressed by an anticipated decrease in weighted average contract lengths from 23 months to 18 months year-over-year as we shift the business towards ARR, and a decrease in professional services growth. As we transition to a more subscription-based model, we believe calculated billings will be a less meaningful metric for our operations.\nOn January 30, 2018, we closed on a public offering of 5.95 million shares, of which 1.5 million were sold by us, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $30.9 million. On March 15, 2018, we closed on a public offering of 2.0 million shares, all which were sold by certain existing stockholders. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.\nPlease see investors.rapid7.com for our Financial Metrics spreadsheet.\nFor additional details on the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures and certain other business metrics to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the accompanying financial data tables posted in this press release.\nSecond Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Guidance\nRapid7 anticipates total revenue, non-GAAP loss from operations, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the following ranges:\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share data) Impact of Adoption Under ASC 606 Under ASC 605 of ASC 606 Revenue $ 54.3 to $ 55.7 $ 57.6 to $ 59.0 $ (3.3 ) to $ (3.3 ) Year-over-year growth 21 % to 24 % Non-GAAP loss from operations $ (9.8 ) to $ (8.4 ) $ (8.7 ) to $ (7.8 ) $ (1.1 ) to $ (0.6 ) Non-GAAP net loss per share $ (0.21 ) to $ (0.18 ) Weighted average shares outstanding 46.5 Full-Year 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share data) Impact of Adoption Under ASC 606 Under ASC 605 of ASC 606 Revenue $ 231.0 to $ 236.5 $ 244.5 to $ 249.0 $ (13.5 ) to $ (12.5 ) Year-over-year growth 22 % to 24 % Non-GAAP loss from operations $ (26.0 ) to $ (20.0 ) $ (25.0 ) to $ (21.0 ) $ (1.0 ) to $ 1.0 Non-GAAP net loss per share $ (0.55 ) to $ (0.42 ) Weighted average shares outstanding 46.7 Guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018 does not include any potential impact of foreign exchange gains or losses.\nNon-GAAP guidance excludes estimates for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and certain non-recurring items. Rapid7 has provided a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nRapid7 will host a conference call today, May 8, 2018, to discuss its results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA . We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) interest income (expense), net, (2) other income (expense), net, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation expense, (5) amortization of intangible assets, (6) stock-based compensation expense, and (7) certain non-recurring items. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using this non-GAAP financial measure, including that other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, that it does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital and excludes some items that are cash based.\nWe also monitor operating measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and certain non-recurring items such as secondary public offering costs and litigation-related expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) . ARR is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the annual value of all recurring revenue related contracts in place at the end of the quarter. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items.\nCalculated Billings (non-GAAP) . Calculated billings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as total revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. Historically, we have considered calculated billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measure of total revenue, because billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of trends in our business. With the expansion of our subscription, cloud-based product offerings (InsightVM, InsightIDR, InsightAppSec, and InsightOps) on the Insight platform, the shift of our other products to subscription pricing, and the shift of our sales compensation plans to Annualized Recurring Revenue, we believe calculated billings will be a less meaningful metric for our operations. Our use of calculated billings has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue recognition or revenue measurement, or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Also, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use calculated billings as a measure of their business, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of calculated billings as a comparative measure.\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, many of these costs and expenses that we may incur in the future, we have provided a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical facts, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity, demand for our product and service offerings, expectations regarding our reoccurring revenue and our future financial and business performance for the second quarter and full-year 2018, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks related to our rapid growth and ability to sustain our revenue growth rate, the ability of our products and professional services to correctly detect vulnerabilities, competition in the markets in which we operate, market growth, our ability to innovate and manage our growth, our ability to operate in compliance with applicable laws as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2018, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nInvestor contact:\nJeff Bray, CFA\nVice President, Investor Relations\ninvestors@rapid7.com\n(857) 990-4074\nPress contact:\nCaitlin Doherty\npress@rapid7.com\n(857) 990-4136\nRAPID7, INC.
