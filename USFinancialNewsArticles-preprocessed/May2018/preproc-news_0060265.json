When industrial air journey was growing, Branson mentioned, “it value a [relatively] related sum of cash to ship rich individuals throughout the Atlantic [Ocean]. … And over time the value got here all the way down to a degree the place monumental portions of individuals have been capable of go.”\nVirgin Galactic can be “making an attempt to get to a degree the place we’re fully environmentally impartial,” Branson mentioned. He defined that he doesn’t need Virgin Galactic to be contributing extra hurt to the Earth than it provides again, even because it helps unlock new discoveries for humanity.\n“Therefore individuals can go to house with out damaging the atmosphere and actually benefit from the great overview that has meant a lot to the individuals who have already been to house,” Branson mentioned.
