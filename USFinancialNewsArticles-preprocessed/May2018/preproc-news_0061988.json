    "text": "Reports Record Revenue of $990 million and EPS Growth of 23 Percent\nSANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: KEYS) today reported second fiscal quarter of 2018 ended April 30, 2018.\n“Building on our outstanding start to the year, we delivered another excellent quarter with strong order growth and record revenue and we are raising our core revenue outlook for the year. Total revenue growth of 31 percent and 18 percent growth on a core basis was driven by broad-based core order strength as customers accelerate development in our key focus areas including 5G, automotive & energy and aerospace and defense,” said Ron Nersesian, Keysight president and CEO.\nSecond Quarter Financial Summary\nGAAP revenue grew 31 percent to reach $990 million, when compared with $753 million last year. Non-GAAP revenue, which excludes the impact of fair value adjustments to acquisition-related deferred revenue balances, grew 32 percent to reach $999 million. Non-GAAP core revenue, which also excludes the impact of foreign currency changes and revenue associated with businesses acquired within the last twelve months, increased 18 percent. GAAP net income was $64 million, or $0.34 per share, compared with $49 million, or $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $158 million, or $0.83 per share using 190 million weighted average shares, compared with $114 million, or $0.64 per share using 179 million weighted average shares in the second quarter of 2017. As of April 30, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $784 million.\nFirst Half of Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Summary\nGAAP revenue grew 24 percent to reach $1,827 million, when compared with $1,479 million last year. Non-GAAP revenue grew 25 percent to reach $1,855 million and non-GAAP core revenue increased 8 percent. GAAP net income was $158 million, or $0.83 per share, compared with $158 million, or $0.90 per share last year. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million, or $1.34 per share using 190 million weighted average shares, compared with $212 million, or $1.20 per share using 176 million weighted average shares in the 2017 period. Cash flow from operations was $282 million. Deployed capital by repaying $260 million of pre-payable debt and repurchasing 770,000 shares for $40 million under the $350 million share repurchase program authorization.\nReporting Segments\nCommunications Solutions Group (CSG)\nCSG revenue grew 27 percent in the second quarter and 11 percent in the first half of fiscal year 2018. CSG reported second quarter revenue of $536 million, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400G and PAM-4 network test and strong 27 percent year-over-year growth in the aerospace, defense and government end market.\nElectronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG)\nEISG revenue grew 16 percent in the second quarter and 11 percent in the first half of fiscal year 2018. EISG reported second quarter revenue of $255 million, driven by strong growth for automotive and energy and general electronics measurement solutions.\nIxia Solutions Group (ISG)\nISG revenue was $90 million in the second quarter and $217 million in the first half of fiscal year 2018. ISG market conditions remained consistent with the prior quarter; however, second quarter ISG results were impacted by extensive integration efforts in the quarter. Many of these integration issues are now resolved and the expected annual cost synergies are ramping as planned.\nServices Solutions Group (SSG)\nSSG revenue grew 15 percent in the second quarter and 11 percent in the first half of fiscal year 2018. SSG reported record revenue of $118 million in the second quarter, driven by double-digit growth for our calibration, remarketed and repair services and solutions.\nOutlook\nKeysight’s third fiscal quarter of 2018 GAAP revenue is expected to be in the range of $937 million to $967 million and non-GAAP revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2018 is expected to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter of 2018 are expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82, which exclude items that pertain to future events and are not currently estimable with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Further information is discussed in the section titled “Non-GAAP Measures” below.\nWebcast\nKeysight’s management will present more details about its second quarter FY2018 financial results and its third quarter FY2018 outlook on a conference call with investors today at 1:30 p.m. PT.

Page 8\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and assess the overall performance of the business, to make operating decisions and to forecast and plan for future periods. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes of management” in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information enhances investors’ understanding of the continuing performance of our business and facilitates comparison of performance to our historical and future periods.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, including industry peer companies, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The discussion below presents information about each of the non-GAAP financial measures and the company’s reasons for including or excluding certain categories of income or expenses from our non-GAAP results. In future periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, adjustments for these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nNon-GAAP Revenue includes recognition of acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting. Management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and business trends.\nNon-GAAP Core Revenue is non-GAAP revenue (see Non-GAAP Revenue above) excluding the impact of foreign currency changes and revenue associated with businesses acquired within the last twelve months We exclude the impact of foreign currency changes as currency rates can fluctuate based on factors that are not within our control and can obscure revenue growth trends. As the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary significantly from period to period and as compared to our peers, we exclude revenue associated with recently acquired businesses to facilitate comparisons of revenue growth and analysis of underlying business trends.\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS may include the following types of adjustments:\nShare-based Compensation Expense: We exclude share-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures because share-based compensation expense can vary significantly from period to period based on the company’s share price, as well as the timing, size and nature of equity awards granted. Management believes the exclusion of this expense facilitates the ability of investors to compare the company’s operating results with those of other companies, many of which also exclude share-based compensation expense in determining their non-GAAP financial measures. Acquisition-related Items: We exclude the impact of certain items recorded in connection with business combinations from our non-GAAP financial measures that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts and lack of predictability as to occurrence or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and amortization of items associated with fair value purchase accounting adjustments, including recognition of acquired deferred revenue (see Non-GAAP Revenue above). We also exclude transaction and certain other cash costs associated with business acquisitions that are not normal recurring operating expenses, including amortization of amounts paid to redeem acquires’ unvested stock-based compensation awards, and legal, accounting and due diligence costs. We exclude these charges to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Separation and Related Costs: We exclude all incremental expenses incurred to effect the separation of Keysight from Agilent. We exclude expenses that would not have been incurred if we had no plan to spin-off including, among other things, branding, legal, accounting and advisory fees, costs to resize and optimize our infrastructure and other costs to separate and transition from Agilent. We believe that these costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s current operating performance or comparisons to our operating performance in other periods. Restructuring and Related Costs: We exclude incremental expenses associated with restructuring initiatives, usually aimed at material changes in the business or cost structure. Such costs may include employee separation costs, asset impairments, facility-related costs, contract termination fees, and costs to move operations from one location to another. These activities can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing, size and nature of restructuring plans; therefore, we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses. We believe that these costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s current operating performance or comparisons to our operating performance in other periods. Northern California wildfire-related costs and Other Items: We exclude certain other significant income or expense items that may occur occasionally and are not normal, recurring, cash operating from our non-GAAP financial measures. Such items are evaluated on an individual basis based on both quantitative and qualitative factors and generally represent items that we would not anticipate occurring as part of our normal business on a regular basis. While not all-inclusive, examples of certain other significant items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures would be: costs related to unusual disaster like Northern California wildfires, significant realized gains or losses associated with our employee benefit plans, gain on sale of assets and small divestitures etc. Estimated Tax Rate: We utilize a consistent methodology for long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate. When projecting this long-term rate, we exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Additionally, we evaluate our current long-term projections, current tax structure and other factors, such as existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key tax holidays in major jurisdictions where Keysight operates. This tax rate could change in the future for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to significant changes in geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where Keysight operates. The above reasons also limit our ability to reasonably estimate the future GAAP tax rate and provide a reconciliation of the expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter of 2018 to the GAAP equivalent.\nManagement recognizes these items can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements, including our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded costs are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.\nPage 9\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530006368/en/\nEDITORIAL CONTACT:\nKeysight Technologies, Inc.\nDenise Idone\n+ 1 631-849-3500\ndenise.idone@keysight.com\nor\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nKeysight Technologies, Inc.\nJason Kary\n+1 707-577-6916\njason.kary@keysight.com\nSource: Keysight Technologies, Inc.",
