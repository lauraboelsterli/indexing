    "text": "- Net Sales of $85.9 million, Reflecting a Comparable Sales Decrease of 2.6% -\n- Gross Margin Rate Decreased 270 basis points -\n- Selling, General & Administrative Expenses Decreased by $1.2 million -\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Christopher & Banks Corporation (NYSE:CBK), a specialty women’s apparel retailer, today reported results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018.\nKeri Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our first quarter financial results did not meet our expectations due in part to underperformance in woven jackets and bottoms, and unseasonable weather, particularly in our Midwest and Northeast regions. However, we saw momentum continue in our eCommerce business as well as in our outlet stores, both of which delivered positive sales comps in the quarter. Sales performance improved as the weather became more seasonal during the latter part of the quarter as customers responded favorably to our product offering. This sales momentum continued into May, resulting in positive comparable sales in the low single digits quarter-to-date.”\nMs. Jones continued, “Looking ahead, my key near term priorities will be to enhance her shopping experience with a well-curated merchandise offering; deliver compelling promotions that support our financial goals; leverage our omni-channel capabilities, and attract new customers. We also are continuing to focus on reducing our cost structure. We believe that executing these key priorities will drive comparable sales, improved financial performance and positive cash flow in fiscal 2018. I will also be working with my management team to develop a multi-year strategic plan. Overall, I look forward to leveraging my background in transforming both growth and challenged businesses to support sustainable long term profitable growth.”\nResults for the First Quarter Ended May 5, 2018\nNet sales totaled $85.9 million, a decrease of 3.0%, while operating on average 462 stores. This compares to $88.6 million in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while operating on average 479 stores. Comparable sales decreased 2.6% following an 8.9% decrease in the same period last year. This included eCommerce sales growth of 7.8% following a 14.7% increase in the same period last year. Gross margin rate decreased 270 basis points to 31.8% compared to the same period last year, driven by increased product costs, which have been corrected for the balance of the year, and additional markdowns due to lower than anticipated sales. Selling, general & administrative expenses (“SG&A”) decreased by $1.2 million as compared to the first quarter last year, driven by lower store operating expenses, insurance and tax expenses, and net employee compensation expenses, partially offset by increases in professional services and marketing expenses. Net loss totaled $5.3 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to a net loss for the prior year period of $3.7 million, or $ 0.10 per share. Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, was $(2.2) million, compared to $(0.2) million for the same period last year.\nBalance Sheet Highlights and Capital Expenditures\nCash and cash-equivalents totaled $18.1 million as of May 5, 2018. Total inventory was $46.4 million at the end of the first quarter as compared to $42.1 million at the end of the first quarter last year, an increase of 10.2%. The inventory increase was primarily the result of higher inventory receipts compared to last year to return to more normalized levels, as well as the result of lower than expected sales.\nDuring the quarter the Company completed the sale of and entered into an agreement to leaseback its corporate facility in Plymouth, MN. The purchase price was $13.7 million and the lease of the facility is for a 15-year period.\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $1.0 million compared to $2.1 million in last year’s first quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter this year primarily reflected investments in stores and technology associated with the Company’s omni-channel capabilities. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will discuss its first quarter results in a conference call scheduled for today, May 31, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call will be simultaneously broadcast live over the Internet at http://www.christopherandbanks.com .

The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is not in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for net income or net loss, or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes the inclusion of this non-GAAP measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the Company’s business operations, especially when comparing such results to previous periods. This non-GAAP measure is not an alternative for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure as provided in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss), adjusted for Income tax provision (benefit); Other income; Interest expense, net; Depreciation and Amortization; Impairment of long-lived assets; and certain discretionary items. Please see “Non-GAAP Measure” above and the reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure that follows in the table below.\nAbout Christopher & Banks\nChristopher & Banks Corporation is a Minneapolis-based national specialty retailer featuring exclusively designed privately branded women’s apparel and accessories.
