    "text": "Marcus Semien had a two-run home run and three RBIs, Daniel Mengden pitched seven scoreless innings and the visiting Oakland Athletics defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 9-2 on Sunday to complete a four-game series sweep.\nThe Athletics took advantage of four Toronto errors and other miscues to score five unearned runs.\nOakland finished a 10-game road trip 7-3 to move three games over .500 for the first time this season at 25-22. The Blue Jays fell to three games below .500 for the first time this season at 22-25.\nToronto starter Joe Biagini (0-3) allowed four runs (three earned), six hits and two walks while striking out two in four-plus innings.\nMengden (4-4) allowed two hits and one walk and struck out two in winning his second straight start.\nToronto designated hitter Kendrys Morales, who had two of his team’s four hits, pitched the ninth and allowed only a walk in his first major-league mound appearance. Morales also struck out in the bottom of the ninth to end the game.\nYangervis Solarte hit a two-run homer for Toronto.\nThe Athletics scored an unearned run in the second inning. Matt Chapman doubled with two out, took third on a wild pitch and ran home on an error by third baseman Josh Donaldson on a groundball hit by Stephen Piscotty.\nOakland scored four runs in the fifth inning. Piscotty led off with a walk, Jonathan Lucroy beat out an infield single to third base, and Chad Pinder lashed what was scored an RBI single past Donaldson.\nDanny Barnes replaced Biagini and Dustin Fowler grounded to second to drive in a run. Semien followed with his fifth homer of the season and Oakland led 5-0.\nOakland added four unearned runs in the fifth. Chapman led off the sixth with a single against Jake Petricka and went to second on shortstop Richard Urena’s error on Piscotty’s grounder. Chapman came around to score on Lucroy’s infield single to second. The Blue Jays failed to turn a double play on Pinder’s grounder to shortstop, settling for the force out at second.\nAaron Loup replaced Petricka and right fielder Teoscar Hernandez was charged with a three-base error on Fowler’s fly ball. Semien hit a sacrifice fly.\nOakland reliever Chris Hatcher pitched around a single and a walk in the eighth and Wilmer Font allowed Solarte’s 10th homer of the season and two walks in the ninth.\nOakland DH Khris Davis suffered a groin strain while hitting into a double play in the fourth inning and was replaced by Matt Joyce.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
