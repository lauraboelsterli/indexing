    "text": "By Kirsten Korosec 12:51 PM EDT\nRoseanne Barr, star of the rebooted ABC sitcom Roseanne , apologized to former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett for a racist and since deleted tweet that alleged a connection to the Muslim Brotherhood.\nBarr, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet, “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.” The initials “vj” are a reference to Jarrett’s initials. Barr’s tweet was a reply to a tweet that accused Jarrett of helping to cover up alleged misdeeds by the Obama administration.\nUsers commented that the tweet seemed racist. “Muslims r NOT a race,” Barr replied. Barr did delete the tweet. In a subsequent tweet, Barr said it was a joke.\nThe comedian and TV star pivoted again and did apologize. I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 29, 2018\nAbout five minutes later, Barr posted another tweet announcing she was leaving Twitter. I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 29, 2018\nWhat “leaving Twitter” means is unclear. Barr’s Twitter account was still active as of noon ET on Tuesday.\nThe apology and deleted tweet weren’t enough to stem the damage. A few hours after Barr’s tweet, Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer on the Roseanne show, tweeted she will not be returning. I will not be returning to @RoseanneOnABC .\n— Wanda Sykes (@iamwandasykes) May 29, 2018 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
