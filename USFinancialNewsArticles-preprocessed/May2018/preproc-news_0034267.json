    "text": "ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla., Creative Learning Corporation (OTCPK: CLCN)\nCreative Learning Corporation recorded a net profit of $39,000 in the second quarter of the 2018. This is an improvement of $198,000 from the same quarter in 2017. The results were due to higher revenue and lower professional fees, primarily lower legal expense. The Company reported revenues of $608,000 during the quarter compared to $582,000 in the same quarter of 2017 due to an increase in initial franchise sales.\nChristian Miller, COO and CFO of the Company stated, \"We believe we are beginning to see the results of the changes we have made in various segments of the business. We further believe there is room for continued reduction of expenses including professional fees. We hope to begin selling Sew Fun Studio franchises in June 2018 and we are on schedule with the release of our new Franchise Management Tool and Academic Enrichment Project. We are pleased with the progress we have made in these business segments.\"\nThe Company will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. EDT on May 22, 2018 to discuss these results.\nConference Call\nShareholders and interested participants may listen to a live broadcast of the conference call by dialing 1 (669) 224-3412 and referencing participant code 686-018-861 or join the call at https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/686018861 approximately 10 minutes prior to the call.
