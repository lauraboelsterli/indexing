However, subdued inflation this side of the Atlantic along with redemptions and other technical factors should stabilise European government bonds, they added.\nThe gap between 10-year German and U.S. bond yields was at 240 basis points, less than a basis point off the widest level since March 1989 hit last week.\nThough this spread does not account for the different valuations of the currencies of either region, it is still an indication of how differently investors view the two regions in terms of how far central banks they have to go in removing post-crisis stimulus.\nThe ECB still buys 30 billion euros of bonds a month as part of its stimulus programme and rate hikes are still far away by investors’ reckoning, whereas the Fed is already in the process of running down its quantitative easing scheme.\nIn addition, the spread between U.S. and UK 10-year borrowing costs is now at its widest level since August 1984 at 153 basis points.\nBanks have pushed out their predictions for when the Bank of England will raise interest rates after data last week showed a sharp and unexpected slowdown in Britain’s economic growth.\nMost euro zone bonds were roughly unchanged on the day, Italian yields rose a touch, having jumped 3-5 basis points across the curve on Monday on political jitters.\nOn Tuesday, the Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread reached its widest level in two weeks at 123 basis points following Tuesday’s headlines that raised the possibility of an early election.\n5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio called for early elections in June, saying efforts to form a coalition after last month’s inconclusive vote had got nowhere.
