    "text": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Emera (TSX: EMA) reported net income of $271 million, compared with net income of $312 million in Q1 2017. Adjusted net income was $202 million in the first quarter of 2018 versus $152 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 33 per cent.\nQ1 2018 Highlights:\nReported Net Income\nReported Q1 2018 net income was $271 million, compared with net income of $312 million in Q1 2017. Reported Q1 2018 earnings per common share were $1.17, compared with $1.48 per common share in Q1 2017.\nAdjusted Net Income (1)\nAdjusted Q1 2018 net income was $202 million, compared with $152 million in Q1 2017. Adjusted Q1 2018 earnings per common share were $0.87, compared with $0.72 in Q1 2017.\nCash Flow\nOperating cash flow (before changes in working capital) increased $96 million, or 28 per cent, to $444 million in Q1 2018, compared with $348 million in Q1 2017.\n(1) See “Non-GAAP Measures” noted below.\n“Our higher adjusted first quarter net income reflects the growth opportunity in our business now that it includes TECO as well as the benefits of our diversified portfolio,” said Scott Balfour, President and CEO of Emera Inc. “Our unregulated businesses capitalized on the weather-driven opportunities and benefited from higher capacity prices while our Florida utilities continued to show strong growth. The Maritime Link was placed into service on January 15, 2018, connecting the island of Newfoundland to the North American energy grid for the first time in history, and is also contributing to our 21 per cent overall increase in adjusted EPS.”\nFinancial Highlights:\nFor the Three months ended March 31 millions of Canadian dollars (except per share amounts) 2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 271 $ 312 After-tax mark-to-market gain (loss) 69 $ 160 Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (1)(2) $ 202 $ 152 Earnings per common share – basic $ 1.17 $ 1.48 Adjusted earnings per common share – basic (1)(2) $ 0.87 $ 0.72 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding - basic (millions of shares) 231 212 (1) See “Non-GAAP Measures” noted below.\n(2) Adjusted net income (1) and Adjusted earnings per common share (1) exclude the effect of mark-to-market adjustments.\nAfter-tax mark-to-market gains decreased $91 million to $69 million in 2018 compared to a $160 million gain for the same period in 2017. The decrease, related to Emera Energy, is due to changes in existing positions on long-term natural gas contracts in the first quarter of 2017 and a larger reversal of mark-to-market losses in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2018, partially offset by lower amortization of gas transportation assets in 2018.\nConsolidated Financial Review:\nThe following table highlights significant changes in adjusted net income from 2017 to 2018 in the first quarter.\nFor the Three months ended millions of Canadian dollars March 31 Adjusted net income – 2017 (1)(2) $ 152 Emera Energy 45 Emera Florida and New Mexico 11 NSPML and LIL equity earnings 9 NSPI (5) Other (10) Adjusted net income – 2018 (1)(2) $ 202 (1) See “Non-GAAP Measures” noted below.\n(2) Excludes the effect of mark-to-market adjustments.\nSegmented Results:\nEmera reports its results in six operating segments: Emera Florida and New Mexico, Nova Scotia Power Inc. (“NSPI”), Emera Maine, Emera Caribbean, Emera Energy, and Corporate & Other.\nFor the Three months ended March 31 millions of Canadian dollars (except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Adjusted net income Emera Florida and New Mexico $ 90 $ 79 NSPI 65 70 Emera Maine 10 13 Emera Caribbean (2) 5 7 Emera Energy (2) 55 10 Corporate & Other (23) (27) Adjusted net income (1) $ 202 $ 152 After-tax mark-to-market gain (loss) 69 160 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 271 $ 312 EPS (basic) $ 1.17 $ 1.48 Adjusted EPS (basic) (1)(2) $ 0.87 $ 0.72 (1) See “Non-GAAP Measures” noted below.\n(2) Excludes the effect of mark-to-market adjustments.\nEmera Florida and New Mexico’s net income was $90 million in Q1 2018 compared to $79 million in Q1 2017. Increased earnings were driven by more favourable weather, higher base rates related to the Polk Power Station expansion, and decreased income tax expense, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and a stronger Canadian dollar.\nNSPI’s net income was $65 million in Q1 2018 compared to $70 million in Q1 2017. The $5 million decrease was primarily due to higher OM&G expense related to storm costs in the period, and higher interest and income tax expenses, partially offset by higher electricity sales due to load growth. Q1 shortfall versus prior year is expected to reverse over the balance of the year and NSPI is expected to achieve annual earnings modestly higher than 2017.\nEmera Maine’s net income was $10 million in Q1 2018 compared to net income of $13 million in Q1 2017. Results in Q1 2018 were driven by higher OM&G due to higher storm costs and lower capitalized overheads as a result of lower capital spending and higher medical costs, partially offset by lower income tax expense as a result of US tax reform.\nEmera Caribbean’s net income, adjusted to exclude mark-to-market losses, of $5 million in Q1 2018 represents a decrease of $2 million compared to Q1 2017 net income of $7 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes at Domlec reflecting the impact of Hurricane Maria.\nEmera Energy’s net income, adjusted to exclude mark-to-market gains, was $55 million in Q1 2018 compared to $10 million in Q1 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to the favourable impact of cold weather in early 2018 in several of Emera Energy Services key market areas and higher capacity prices that came into effect in New England in June 2017. The cold weather resulted in high gas pricing and volatility that led to higher natural gas margins.\nCorporate & Other’s net loss was $23 million in Q1 2018 compared to $27 million in Q1 2017. The decreased loss was primarily due to higher equity earnings from NSP Maritime Link (“NSPML”) and Labrador Island Link (“LIL”) and lower deferred compensation costs, partially offset by the effects of US tax reform.\nThe Maritime Link went into service on January 15, 2018. Cash earnings from NSPML were $15 million in Q1 2018 compared with $7 million of AFUDC earnings in Q1 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEmera uses financial measures that do not have standardized meaning under USGAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.
