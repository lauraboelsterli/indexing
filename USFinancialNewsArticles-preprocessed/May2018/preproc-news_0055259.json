    "text": "May 28, 2018 / 11:01 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago China rejects US charge of 'forced technology transfer' at WTO Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nGENEVA (Reuters) - China told the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement body on Monday that U.S. accusations that Beijing forced companies to hand over technology as a cost of doing business in China were groundless. FILE PHOTO: Xiangchen Zhang, Chinese Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) attends an interview with Reuters in Geneva, Switzerland March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n“According to the U.S.’s view, China forces the U.S. companies to transfer technologies by imposing joint venture requirements, foreign equity limitations and administrative licensing procedures,” Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen said.\n“But the fact is, nothing in these regulatory measures requires technology transfer from foreign companies.” Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Catherine Evans",
