    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CEMATRIX Corporation (TSXV:CVX) (the “ Corporation ” or the “ Company ” or “ CEMATRIX ”) announces the release of its consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nThe acquisition of MixOnSite USA Inc. (“MOS”), a growing profitable cellular concrete producer based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, will close on May 31, 2018.\nLafarge has re-affirmed a strengthened commitment to CEMATRIX including additional support for the hiring of independent experienced sales professionals for the development of new regional markets in Canada, including the Prairie Region, which commenced in 2017.\nRevenue was lower by $1,051,003 and the loss attributable to common shareholders was higher by $264,383, as compared to the same period in 2017. In 2017, there was a large tunnel project in Western Canada, with no comparable sale in the same period of 2018. For 2018, the majority of the significant contracted tunnel projects are scheduled to commence at the end May or early June.\nThe Company announced the appointment of James Chong to the position of chief financial officer of the Company effective April 27, 2018. Bruce McNaught, former chief financial officer of the Company, will retire on June 30, 2018.\nOn April 30, 2018 the Company completed the first tranche of the $2,000,000 non-brokered private placement for 3,203,600 units (each, a “Unit”) at a price of $0.20 per Unit for gross proceeds of $640,720 (the “Private Placement”).\nFirst Quarter Results\nSelected financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Change Revenue $ 1,476,468 $ 2,527,471 $ (1,051,003 ) Gross margin $ 172,135 $ 534,685 $ (362,550 ) Operating expenses (512,819 ) (523,676 ) 10,857 Operating income (loss) (340,684 ) 11,009 (351,693 ) Non-cash stock based compensation (5,366 ) (28,409 ) 23,043 Finance costs (53,056 ) (50,521 ) (2,535 ) Other income (expenses) (2,484 ) 1,887 (4,371 ) Loss before income taxes (401,590 ) (66,034 ) (335,556 ) Provision of deferred taxes 84,812 13,639 71,173 Loss attributable to the common shareholders (316,778 ) (52,395 ) (264,383 ) Unrealized foreign exchange gain on translation of foreign subsidiary 2,403 536 1,867 Total comprehensive loss for period $ (314,375 ) $ (51,859 ) $ (262,516 ) Loss per common share $ (0.009 ) $ - $ (0.009 ) “The first quarter sales and results were a return to what we would consider normal for our seasonal construction related business,” stated Jeff Kendrick, President and CEO of CEMATRIX. “The big news for CEMATRIX and its shareholders is the acquisition of MOS which is now scheduled to be closed on May 31, 2018. The MOS acquisition will position CEMATRIX for further growth in the United States and will provide both trained operation staff and additional equipment to meet the growing North American demand for cellular concrete. Each company has technologies that can make both companies stronger players in their respective markets and their combined sales will provide the growing working capital to support this expected growth. If CEMATRIX and MOS had been combined at the beginning of 2018 the combined contracted and verbally awarded projects would be in excess of $33.5 million, $5.2 million of which is scheduled for 2019. Since CEMATRIX will only be recording 7 months of the MOS sales in its 2018 results, this will amount to approximately $27.5 million in CEMATRIX consolidated sales for 2018 and a $5.2 million carryover to 2019.”\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, both of which can be found on SEDAR.\nCEMATRIX is an Alberta corporation with its head offices in Calgary, Alberta. The Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is a rapidly growing, cash flow positive company that manufactures and supplies technologically advanced cellular concrete products developed from proprietary formulations. This unique cement based material with superior thermal protection delivers a cost-effective, innovative solution to a broad range of problems facing the infrastructure, industrial (including oil and gas) and commercial construction markets.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFor further information, please contact:\nJeff Kendrick - President and Chief Executive Officer\nPhone: (403) 219-0484\nJeff Walker, The Howard Group – Investor Relations\nPhone: (888) 221-0915 or (403) 221-0915\njeff@howardgroupinc.com\nForward-looking information: This news release contains certain information that is forward looking and is subject to important risks and uncertainties (such statements are usually accompanied by words such as “anticipate”, expect”, “would’ or other similar words).
