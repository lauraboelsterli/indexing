    "text": "Tenured Enterprise Technology Executive to Lead Market Strategy, Product Success, & Corporate Development\nLEXINGTON, Mass., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mimecast Limited (NASDAQ:MIME), a leading email and data security company, today announced Christina Van Houten has joined the leadership team as the new Chief Strategy Officer. In this role, Christina will drive corporate development, product management and market strategy as part of building out Mimecast’s leading email security, archive, and cyber resilience cloud platform.\n“Almost every organization is struggling to build truly sustainable cyber resilience. Maintaining security, governance and operational resilience across an evolving IT estate is expensive and often inconvenient. At the same time attackers, technical failures and human errors work against IT and security teams that are already battling to attract and retain skilled personnel to do the job. Yet, too often these teams are drowning in complexity - complexity compounded by well-intentioned, but narrowly focused vendors solving individual issues,” said Peter Bauer, chief executive officer at Mimecast. “Mimecast aims to help customers by delivering solutions that help make cyber resilience for email much easier and more affordable with our unique platform, MimeOS. Christina’s experience in driving innovation on a consistent large scale technology platform, delivering a rich integrated suite, and solving emerging customer problems is invaluable to us in this new role.”\nChristina is a veteran of the enterprise technology industry, bringing more than two decades of experience with some of the world’s largest firms including Oracle, IBM and Infor Global Solutions, as well as Netezza and ProfitLogic, the entrepreneurial companies that were acquired by them. Prior to evolving into the technology sector, Christina was focused on public interest work with The John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, DC City Government, US Treasury Department and several political campaigns.\nChristina’s hire marks the most recent addition to the leadership team. Recently, Mimecast also welcomed Marc French as its chief trust officer and data protection officer heading up GDPR initiatives, as well as Janet Levesque, senior vice president of systems, risk and security for global oversite of the internal technology application, security, infrastructure and risk teams.\nAdditional Resource:\nMeet Mimecast’s Leadership team .\nAbout Mimecast\nMimecast (NASDAQ:MIME) makes business email and data safer for thousands of customers and their millions of employees worldwide. Founded in 2003, the company's next-generation cloud-based security, archiving and continuity services protect email and deliver comprehensive email risk management.\nMimecast Social Media Resources\nLinkedIn: Mimecast\nFacebook: Mimecast\nTwitter: @Mimecast\nBlog: Challenging Complexity\nPress Contact\nAlison Raymond Walsh\nPress@Mimecast.com\n617-393-7126\nInvestor Contact\nRobert Sanders\nInvestors@Mimecast.com\n617-393-7074\nSource:Mimecast Limited",
