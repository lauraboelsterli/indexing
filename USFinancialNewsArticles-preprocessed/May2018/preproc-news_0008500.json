    "text": "U.S. employers hired more people in April than last year, according to the LinkedIn Workforce Report, a monthly analysis of employment trends.\nHiring across the U.S. was 19.8 percent higher last month than a year earlier, the LinkedIn data showed. Compared with March, the seasonally adjusted hiring figure was 2.1 percent higher.\nThe sectors with the biggest year-over-year increases were aerospace, automotive and transportation, 23.3 percent higher; financial services and insurance, up 22.2 percent; and manufacturing and industrial, 17.3 percent higher.\nThe report noted that the U.S. is in need of people with marketing skills.\n\"Small businesses may not have resources for a full-time marketing hire, but they still need these skills â€” which range from social media and digital marketing to market research and branding,\" LinkedIn said.\nLinkedIn's report is compiled from its 146 million user profiles in the U.S and 20,000 company profiles. LinkedIn has more than 11 million active job listings globally and has more than 3 million new job listings added in the U.S. every month.\nThe hiring rate is the percentage of members who changed the name of their new employer on their profile the same month they began their new job, divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in the U.S., according to the company.\nThe report comes one day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its closely watched monthly employment data. Nonfarm jobs grew less than expected in March, but the rise in average hourly earnings exceeded forecasts.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
