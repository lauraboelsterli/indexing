    "text": "6 Hours Ago | 06:04\nPayments firm Square 's stock erased its earlier losses Friday, after slipping as much as 3 percent the day after news of a PayPal-iZettle tie-up .\nShares hit a low of $53 per share but recovered to $55.04 by the end of the day.\nThe $2.2 billion merger will launch U.S. fintech giant PayPal into hundreds of thousands of brick-and-mortar retailers around the world through iZettle's mobile card readers. That's a threat to Square, which markets its high-tech registers to small businesses.",
