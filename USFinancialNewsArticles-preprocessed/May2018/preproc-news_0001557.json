A group of tourists travel by elephant along a main road, as the Sigiriya rock fortress is seen in the background in Dambulla, Sri Lanka August 19, 2017. REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/Files\nTourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga said on Tuesday that 2.5 million arrivals were expected, down from an earlier estimate of 3 million, generating revenue of $4 billion.\nHe said a case of sexual assault against Dutch tourists in April in the town of Mirissa had also harmed the country’s image abroad, though he could not quantify the impact of the incident in terms of visitor numbers.\nIn March, the government declared week-long a state of emergency in the central district of Kandy after rioting in which mosques and Muslim homes and businesses were destroyed.\nTravel warnings for dengue are still in effect for Sri Lanka after an outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus killed more than 300 people there last year.\n“When these things happen our targets get shifted... but we are working hard to attract more tourists,” Amaratunga said.\nTourism accounts for nearly 5 percent of the $87 billion economy and is a key main foreign exchange earner, along with the garment and tea industries, and remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.\nYear on year, tourist arrivals rose 24.1 percent in March and by 17.1 percent in the first quarter, according to government data.\nArrivals hit a record high of 2.1 million in 2017, and revenue from tourism an all-time peak of $3.63 billion.\nMirissa is a tourist hotspot in southern Sri Lanka famous for whale watching.
