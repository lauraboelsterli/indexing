    "text": "PRAGUE, May 28 (Reuters) - Here are news stories, press reports and events to watch which may affect Czech financial markets on Monday. ALL TIMES GMT (Czech Republic: GMT + 2 hours) ECONOMIC DATA Real-time economic data releases Summary of economic data and forecasts Recently released economic data Previous stories on Czech data **For a schedule of corporate and economic events: here #/2E/events-overview NEWS/EVENTS CENBANK: The Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Jiri Rusnok believes the crown will return to appreciation in the coming weeks backed by economic fundamentals and lack of reasons to follow the Turkish lira or other emerging markets, he told Reuters on Friday. CEFC: Czech financial firm J&T said on Friday it had struck a deal with Chinese state conglomerate CITIC Group to settle debts owed by troubled Chinese company CEFC, ending a dispute. UNIPETROL: Refiner Unipetrol board decided not to propose a dividend for 2017 earnings. KVITOVA: Petra Kvitova said it was \"great news\" that a suspect had reportedly been held in custody in connection with the 2016 stabbing that left her with career-threatening injuries. CEE MARKETS: The crown trimmed its losses against the euro on Friday after Czech Central Bank (CNB) Governor Jiri Rusnok said its weakness may bring forward the next interest rate hike. PRESS DIGEST MOBILE: Prime Minister Andrej Babis said it was \"unacceptable\" to have such high mobile data costs in the Czech Republic and that competition needs to rise in the market. Babis met the head of operator O2 Czech Republic last week and will also meet the country heads of T-Mobile and Vodafone. Hospodarske Noviny, page 4 BEER: Pilsner Urquell will be one of the key export brands for owner Asahi Breweries Europe and will only be produced in its home of Plzen. Hospodarske Noviny, page 12 FLATS: The average price of existing apartments in Prague rose 11.3 percent y/y in the first quarter to 82,710 crowns per square meter.
