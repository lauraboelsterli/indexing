    "text": "SAO PAULO, May 30 (Reuters) - Coffee exports from Brazil, the world’s largest producer, in May are likely to be 900,000 60-kg bags less than expected due to a nationwide truckers protest that hampered transport to ports, exporters association Cecafé said on Wednesday.\nThe group said in a statement that the protests caused financial losses estimated at 560 million reais ($149.99 million) in lost export sales and additional port costs. Protests appeared to be winding down on Wednesday, but movement in the main port of Santos remained sluggish.\n$1 = 3.7335 reais Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
