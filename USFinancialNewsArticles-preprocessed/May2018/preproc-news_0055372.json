    "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization is cautiously optimistic about the progress of the Ebola response in Democratic Republic of Congo after 90 percent of people at risk in the city of Mbandaka were vaccinated, a senior WHO official said on Tuesday.\nA Congolese health worker records medical data of passengers at the airport in Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 19, 2018. REUTERS/Kenny Katombe Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response, said more than 400 potential Ebola contacts had been vaccinated.\nAlthough he could not say for certain the city had been safeguarded, he was cautiously optimistic, and there had been no explosive increase in cases.\nHe also said he hoped to get government approval within days to use five experimental drugs to treat Ebola patients, in a clinical trial which could lay the groundwork for more rapid treatments in future outbreaks.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
