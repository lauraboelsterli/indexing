FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Ireland Press Conference - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - March 16, 2018 Ireland's Rory Best during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge\nBest, who led Ireland to a Six Nations grand slam this year, will be replaced by Munster hooker Niall Scannell in an otherwise near full-strength touring squad.\nScannell, who has won seven caps for his country, will compete with the similarly internationally inexperienced Rob Herring of Ulster for the number two jersey, while Johnny Sexton and Peter O’Mahoney will share captaincy duties.\nSexton’s understudy at flyhalf, Joey Carbery, also announced on Thursday that he will join Munster from rival Irish province Leinster.\nCarbery’s future has been up in the air since Ireland coach Joe Schmidt asked the 22-year-old whether he would consider a move to another Irish province to get more game time at number 10 ahead of next year’s World Cup.\nCarbery has featured more often at fullback for the European champions with fellow Leinster youngster Ross Byrne, in line for an international debut against the Wallabies, favoured at flyhalf whenever Sexton was missing.\nWorld number two Ireland open the series on June 9 hoping for their first win in Australia since 1979.
