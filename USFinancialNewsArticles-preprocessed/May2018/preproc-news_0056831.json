    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP (NYSE: KRP) (\"Kimbell\" or the \"Company\"), a leading owner of oil and gas mineral and royalty interests across 20 states, today announced that it has agreed to acquire the mineral and royalty interests held by Houston-based Haymaker Minerals & Royalties, LLC and Haymaker Resources, LP (collectively, \"Haymaker\") in a transaction valued at approximately $404 million. The purchase price for the acquisition is comprised of $210 million in cash and 10 million common units of Kimbell, valued at approximately $194 million. 1 Kimbell will raise the cash portion of the purchase price through a private placement of 7.00% Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units (\"Series A Preferred Units\") to an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") for gross proceeds of $110 million and through borrowings of $114 2 million under a new $200 million revolving credit facility. The Boards of Kimbell and Haymaker have unanimously approved the acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The effective date of the acquisition is April 1, 2018.\nFollowing the closing of the acquisition, Haymaker's private equity sponsors, KKR & Co. L.P. (\"KKR\") and Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P. (\"Kayne\"), along with Haymaker management, will collectively own approximately 37% of the then outstanding common units of Kimbell.\nBob Ravnaas, Chairman and CEO of Kimbell, said, \"This is a transformative acquisition for our company which we expect to deliver significant value and benefits through both increased scale and significant operating leverage that will drive improved profitability. Through this combination of highly complementary minerals portfolios, Kimbell is uniquely positioned to be a major participant in the best-performing, highest-growth oil and gas basins in the Lower 48. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit and look forward to continued successes in this new and exciting chapter for Kimbell.\"\nKarl Brensike, CEO of Haymaker, said, \"We are extremely proud of the Haymaker team for assembling this world-class portfolio. Diversified minerals and royalties are just starting to get the recognition they deserve as a lower risk strategy to capitalize on the tremendous advancements being made in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. We believe this acquisition will kick off a new phase of consolidation across the sector, as private equity looks to divest their mineral interests to longer term holders. Kimbell's diversified asset base and access to capital through their proposed tax structure will position them to continue to make accretive acquisitions over the coming years.\"\nAcquisition Highlights 3\nPro forma free cash flow yield 4 of 12% drives accretion to distributable cash flow per unit of >20% based on first quarter 2018 results and using run-rate G&A Increases average daily net production per Kimbell unit for first quarter 2018 by more than 50% on pro forma basis Highly complementary Haymaker acreage increases Kimbell's net royalty acres per unit by 10% on a pro forma basis 52% of the combined net royalty acreage is in the high growth Permian and Mid-Continent areas Conservatively financed with estimated pro forma net debt to EBITDA below 2.0x 5 and ample liquidity under new revolving credit facility\nCreating a Leading Energy Yield Company\nFollowing the closing, Kimbell will have an 11.1 million gross acre position with a total of 73 active rigs on its properties, which represents 7% of total active rigs in the U.S. In addition, 95% of all rigs in the Lower 48 are located in counties where Kimbell will hold mineral interest positions. The acquisition further solidifies Kimbell's position in the Permian by adding mineral interests in the Midland Basin and further bolstering its Mid-Continent position, which includes the SCOOP / STACK. Going forward, Kimbell will remain a liquids-focused company with oil and NGLs accounting for approximately 67% of estimated pro forma 1Q 2018 production.\nEstimated pro forma net debt / EBITDA will be below 2.0x5 at the closing of the acquisition, with a prudent hedging program in place that will target between 30% and 40% of production on a rolling two-year basis to protect cash flows.\nKimbell's management team, led by Kimbell CEO Bob Ravnaas, will operate the combined company following the closing.\nSeries A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units\nKimbell signed a purchase agreement with Apollo for $110 million of the Series A Preferred Units. The private placement of the Series A Preferred Units will close at the same time as the closing of the acquisition.\nSummary terms of the Series A Preferred Units include:\nDistributions of 7.00% per annum, paid quarterly in arrears Kimbell may redeem the Series A Preferred Units at any time for cash Beginning on the second anniversary of the closing date, Apollo may elect to convert some or all of the Series A Preferred Units if the common unit price is at a 30% premium to the issue price Voting rights on an as-converted basis with common units\nNew Revolving Credit Facility\nIn conjunction with the closing of the acquisition, Kimbell has received commitments for a fully-underwritten $200 million revolving credit facility with Frost Bank, Wells Fargo Bank and Credit Suisse AG. The borrowing base of Kimbell's current revolving credit facility is $100 million which will increase to $200 million upon closing of the acquisition. At the closing, the Company will have approximately $64 million of availability under its new revolving credit facility, providing for significant liquidity.\nProposed Election to Change Tax Status\nKimbell believes that the conversion to a taxable entity will enable it to target a significantly larger investor base both domestic and international, increase its liquidity and support its continued growth and consolidation strategy. KKR and Kayne, together with Haymaker management, as well as Apollo have agreed to vote in favor of the Company's proposed election to change to a taxable entity, with the precise structure to be determined by the Board of Directors of Kimbell. Upon consummation of the acquisition and the Series A Preferred Units offering, KKR, Kayne, Haymaker management and Apollo, together with outstanding common units that are controlled by Kimbell's management and Board of Directors, will constitute the requisite majority of unitholders necessary to approve the tax election. The Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") an information statement regarding the approval of the tax election and distribute that information statement to its other unitholders.\nAdvisors\nCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor and sole placement agent on the Series A Preferred Units to Kimbell and Baker Botts L.L.P. acted as legal counsel to Kimbell. UBS Investment Bank acted as exclusive capital markets advisor to Kimbell in connection with the election to change to a taxable entity.
