We fully covered our dividend and improved our portfolio yield during the quarter, while managing portfolio risk both during and after quarter end through opportunistic sales of lower-yielding assets.”\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a distribution for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 of $0.25 per share, payable on July 5, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018. This represents a 12.5% yield on the Company’s $8.00 share price as of the close on May 7, 2018. Distributions may include net investment income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The tax status of distributions will be determined at the end of the taxable year.\nPortfolio and Investment Activities\nDuring the quarter, the Company made investments in one new portfolio company and three existing portfolio companies. These four investments totaled $50.6mm at cost and were made at a weighted average yield of 9.68%. The Company also realized $43.6mm of repayments, sales, and amortization, primarily related to the repayments of American Gaming Systems Inc., FPC Holdings, Inc. and Medical Solutions LLC. Realized and unrealized gains accounted for an increase in the Company’s net investments of approximately $0.4mm, or $0.03 per share. The total net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter was $4.1mm, or $0.30 per share.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s investment portfolio consisted of investments in 24 portfolio companies, of which 48.3% were first lien investments, 42.4% were second lien investments, 0.3% were in unsecured debt investments, 4.2% were unitranche loans, and 4.8% were in equities, warrants and other positions. The Company’s debt portfolio consisted of 97.4% floating rate investments.

Under the discretionary repurchase program, the Company may, but is not obligated to, repurchase its outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market provided that the Company complies with the prohibitions under its insider trading policies and procedures and the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, any repurchases will be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act.\nThe timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions and alternative investment opportunities and no assurances can be given that any common stock, or any particular amount, will be purchased. We will retire immediately all shares of common stock that we purchase in connection with the share repurchase program.\nReduction in Asset Coverage Ratio Effective May 2, 2019\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act.
