    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. business inventories were unexpectedly flat in March as the biggest drop in stocks at retailers in six months offset increases in inventories at wholesalers and manufacturers.\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday the unchanged reading in business inventories followed a 0.6 percent increase in February.\nEconomists had forecast inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product, ticking up 0.1 percent in March. Retail inventories fell 0.5 percent in March instead of decreasing 0.4 percent as reported in an advance estimate published last month.\nRetail inventories rose 0.4 percent in February.\nMotor vehicle inventories declined 1.1 percent in March instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent drop. Auto inventories rose 0.8 percent in February.\nRetail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, slipped 0.1 percent as reported last month. They gained 0.2 percent in February.\nWholesale inventories rose 0.3 percent in March and stocks at manufacturers also rose 0.3 percent.\nThe government reported last month in its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP that inventory investment added 0.43 percentage point to the economy’s 2.3 percent annualized growth pace during that period.\nBusiness sales rose 0.5 percent in March after a similar gain in February. At March’s sales pace, it would take 1.34 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.35 months in February.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani Editing by Paul Simao\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
