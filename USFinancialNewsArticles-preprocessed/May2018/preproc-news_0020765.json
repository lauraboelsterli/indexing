(NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced first quarter 2018 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2017:\nDiluted Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per share (EPS 1 ) increased 49% to $0.76 Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders increased 45% to $136 million Operating Income increased 32% to $193 million Revenues increased 20% to $1.9 billion Net Revenues 2 increased 21% to $636 million Airfreight tonnage volume and ocean container volume both increased 5%\n“Building from a strong second half of 2017, we continued to execute well across all of our services during the quarter,” commented Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We added profitable growth from new and existing customers and benefitted from favorable buying opportunities in certain markets. All across our global network, our people exercised pricing discipline while securing capacity to deliver the services and solutions our customers need. All told, this quarter showcases the best of our Company’s capabilities and our relentless drive for excellence.\"\n“Compared with the robust volume growth in the first quarter a year ago,” Mr. Musser continued, “this quarter’s volume increases and financial performance track more in line with our historical performance and demonstrates our ability to execute and generate profitable growth. Demand has remained strong and we have continued to invest in people, processes and technology to efficiently handle the increased volumes across all products.”\nBradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “These investments, including investments in facilities and equipment, will enhance our efficiencies. While investing for growth, we remain deliberate in how we commit resources and once again realized our target 30% operating efficiency (operating income as a percentage of net revenue) during the quarter.” Mr. Powell further commented that the Company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%, compared to 37.3% a year ago. He also reiterated that the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods will largely depend on the mix of pretax earnings that are generated in its U.S. and foreign operations, as well as further interpretation of and guidance to be issued on the new tax law.\nExpeditors is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator must consider the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenues are one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.\nThree months ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 1,854,262 $ 1,545,132 Expenses: Airfreight services 513,504 443,404 Ocean freight and ocean services 379,418 366,063 Customs brokerage and other services 325,502 208,060 Net revenues $ 635,838 $ 527,605\nCONTACTS :\nJeffrey S.
