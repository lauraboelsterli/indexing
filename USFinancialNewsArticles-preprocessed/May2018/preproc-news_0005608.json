    "text": "ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYR Group Inc. (“MYR”) (NASDAQ:MYRG), a holding company of leading specialty contractors serving the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets in the United States and western Canada, today announced its first-quarter 2018 financial results.\nHighlights\nFirst quarter revenues of $345.6 million, a 15.2% increase year over year First quarter net income of $5.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share Backlog of $958.5 million, an all-time high\nManagement Comments\nRick Swartz, MYR’s President and CEO, said, “We are pleased with our first-quarter 2018 financial results, which included increases in revenues, gross profit, earnings per share, net income and EBITDA as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Our backlog in the first quarter reached $958.5 million, a record high consisting of both short and long-term projects with varying construction start dates. We believe our strong market position and active bidding climates in both our T&D and C&I markets should continue to support efficiencies in our operations.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nMYR reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $345.6 million, an increase of $45.5 million, or 15.2 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Specifically, the T&D segment reported revenues of $216.4 million, an increase of $20.7 million, or 10.6 percent, from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in distribution revenue. The C&I segment reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $129.2 million, an increase of $24.8 million, or 23.8 percent, from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased spending from new and existing customers and increased volume on certain organic expansion locations.\nConsolidated gross profit increased to $35.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenues and increased margins. Gross margin increased to 10.3 percent for the first quarter of 2018 from 8.6 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin was largely due to improvements in efficiency from the prior year, which was significantly impacted by inclement weather and a high mix of smaller, shorter duration work. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in a gross margin decrease of 0.1 percent for the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin increased 0.4 percent due to changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects for the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased to $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $25.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher bonus and profit sharing costs. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 8.2 percent for the first quarter of 2018 from 8.6 percent for the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, with an effective tax rate of 28.9 percent. For the first quarter of 2017 we had an income tax benefit of $0.4 million, which represented 42.7 percent of pretax income. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 benefited from the enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. The tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017 was caused by excess tax benefits pertaining to the vesting of stock awards and the exercise of stock options related to the Company’s stock compensation program.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net income was $5.6 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the same period of 2017. First-quarter 2018 EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $18.0 million, or 5.2 percent of revenues, compared to $11.1 million, or 3.7 percent of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017.\nBacklog\nAs of March 31, 2018, MYR's backlog was $958.5 million, which represented an increase of $279.4 million, or 41.1 percent, compared to December 31, 2017. Specifically, in the same period, T&D backlog increased $101.2 million, or 30.4 percent, to $434.3 million while C&I backlog increased $178.2 million, or 51.5 percent, to $524.2. Total backlog at March 31, 2018 increased $297.6 million, or 45.0 percent, from the $660.9 million reported at March 31, 2017. The increase in backlog was primarily due to the addition of the previously announced Denver Central 70 Project and various small and mid-sized T&D projects.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, MYR had $162.0 million of borrowing availability under its credit facility.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement MYR’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), MYR uses certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found at the end of this release. MYR’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nMYR believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they (i) provide both management and investors meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results, (ii) permit investors to view MYR’s performance using the same tools that management uses to evaluate MYR’s past performance, reportable business segments and prospects for future performance, (iii) publicly disclose results that are relevant to financial covenants included in MYR’s credit facility and (iv) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating MYR.\nConference Call\nMYR will host a conference call to discuss its first-quarter 2018 results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central time.

(3) These financial performance measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial statements. These measures are used by management to evaluate our past performance, our prospects for future performance and our ability to comply with certain material covenants as defined within our credit agreement, and to compare our results with those of our peers. In addition, we believe that certain of the measures, such as book value, tangible book value, free cash flow, asset turnover, return on equity and debt leverage are measures that are monitored by sureties, lenders, lessors, suppliers and certain investors. Our calculation of each measure is described in the following notes; our calculation may not be the same as the calculations made by other companies. (4) EBIT, net of taxes is defined as net income plus net interest, less the tax impact of net interest. The tax impact of net interest is computed by multiplying net interest by the effective tax rate. Management uses EBIT, net of taxes, to measure our results exclusive of the impact of financing costs. (5) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is a component of the debt to EBITDA covenant, as defined in our credit agreement, which we must comply with to avoid potential immediate repayment of amounts borrowed or additional fees to seek relief from our lenders. In addition, management considers EBITDA a useful measure because it eliminates differences which are caused by different capital structures as well as different tax rates and depreciation schedules when comparing our measures to our peers’ measures. (6) EBITDA per diluted share is calculated by dividing EBITDA by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. EBITDA per diluted share is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income per diluted share. (7) Free cash flow, which is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities minus cash flow used in purchasing property and equipment, is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or the change in cash on the balance sheet. Management views free cash flow as a measure of operational performance, liquidity and financial health. (8) Book value per period end share is calculated by dividing total stockholders’ equity at the end of the period by the period end shares outstanding. (9) Tangible book value is calculated by subtracting goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at the end of the period from stockholders’ equity outstanding at the end of the period. Tangible book value is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to book value or stockholders’ equity. (10) Tangible book value per period end share is calculated by dividing tangible book value at the end of the period by the period end number of shares outstanding. Tangible book value per period end share is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income per diluted share. (11) The funded debt to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total funded debt at the end of the period by total stockholders’ equity at the end of the period. (12) Asset turnover is calculated by dividing the current period revenue by total assets at the beginning of the period. (13) Return on assets is calculated by dividing net income for the period by total assets at the beginning of the period. (14) Return on equity is calculated by dividing net income for the period by total stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the period. (15) Period end shares is calculated by adding average common stock equivalents for the quarter to the period end balance of common stock outstanding. Period end shares is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to diluted shares. Management views period end shares as a better measure of shares outstanding as of the end of the period. (16) Invested capital is calculated by adding net funded debt (total funded debt less cash and marketable securities) to total stockholders’ equity. (17) Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing EBIT, net of taxes, less any dividends, by invested capital at the beginning of the period. Return on invested capital is not recognized under GAAP, and is a key metric used by management to determine our executive compensation.\nSource:MYR Group, Inc.",
