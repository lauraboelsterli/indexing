Soccer Football - International Friendly - Poland vs South Korea - Silesian Stadium, Chorzow, Poland - March 27, 2018 Poland coach Adam Nawalka REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\nThe golden era for Poland, which saw them take third place at the 1974 and 1982 tournaments, ended when Brazil beat Poland 4-0 in the last 16 at the 1986 finals in Mexico.\nZbigniew Boniek, former Poland great and now FA president, famously said after the defeat that he had hoped the national team would qualify for the next four tournaments in a row.\nHis words were later dubbed ‘Boniek’s Curse’ as the Poles had to wait 16 years for another World Cup appearance.\nThey have played at only two finals this century and finished bottom of their group in 2002 and 2006.\nHowever, at the 2016 European Championship they reached the quarter-finals to emulate their past success.\nThe nation is hoping that Adam Nawalka’s team can now reach the knockout phase on the world stage, although they have been drawn against Senegal, Columbia and Japan in a tricky Group H.\n“The team is more experienced but can’t be overconfident,” goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, who has 60 caps including two at the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, told Reuters.\n“However, going into another round should be a realistic goal, albeit the group is very equal and we’re not used to games against such unusual opposition.

It’s not like we’ve got hammered in 2016 and now everyone awaits another hammering. It’s important from the team’s mental point of view.”\nThe good news for Poland is that Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik has returned from a second serious knee injury ahead of the tournament, which gives the manager more options up front.\nHis presence in the team also takes some of the pressure off their Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski, by far the most important player in Nawalka’s World Cup plans.
