    "text": "Highlights:\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues of $329.4 million, up 13.5% compared to prior year First quarter 2018 net income of $5.5 million and EBITDA, as adjusted, of $20.2 million Record client assets of $166.2 billion at March 31, 2018, including advisory assets under management of $73.6 billion and cash balances of $4.6 billion Recurring revenue of 79.4% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2018 in independent advisory and brokerage services segment Shareholders’ equity of $390.2 million at March 31, 2018\nMIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nDr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very encouraged by our first quarter 2018 results which exhibited robust growth in revenues, profitability and client assets. Favorable market conditions and an increasing interest rate environment, coupled with solid execution by our management team, contributed to our strong performance. We remain laser-focused on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.”\nRichard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All of Ladenburg’s businesses performed well in the first quarter, with revenues of $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from the prior year period, and a 169.2% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $20.2 million. The continued growth in our nationwide network of independent financial advisors to over 4,300 reflects our success in recruiting talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $166.2 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $73.6 billion, up 15.2% and 22.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to drive further margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.”\nAdoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (\"ASC 606\"). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Table 3). For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $31.1 million, a decrease in total expenses of $34.4 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $1.7 million, and no change to diluted loss per common share of $0.02.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from revenues of $290.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 25.6% to $163.3 million from $130.1 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity and mutual fund products and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 9.9% to $114.4 million from $127.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 154.1% to $16.5 million from $6.5 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to improved market conditions. Also, service fees revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 34.2% to $24.9 million from $18.6 million, due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs.\nNet income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.5 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $3.0 million or ($0.02) per basic and diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $11.6 million or ($0.06) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The first quarter 2018 results included $2.2 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.2 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $1.9 million of interest expense. The first quarter 2017 results included $0.8 million of income tax benefit, $8.9 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.6 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense.\nRecurring Revenues\nFor the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.4% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment.\nEBITDA, as adjusted\nEBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.2 million, an increase of 169.2% from $7.5 million in the comparable 2017 period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue. Also, our Ladenburg segment EBITDA, as adjusted, was higher as a result of increased investment banking revenues.\nClient Assets\nAt March 31, 2018, total client assets under administration were $166.2 billion, a 15.2% increase from $144.3 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.6 billion, including approximately $4.2 billion participating in our cash sweep programs.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 534,697 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 285,400 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.23. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $58.1 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.14. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,864,385 shares under its current repurchase plan.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.\nAbout Ladenburg\nLadenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc.
