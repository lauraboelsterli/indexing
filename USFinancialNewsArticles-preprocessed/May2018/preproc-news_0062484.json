    "text": "Luis Valbuena homered twice, and Ian Kinsler and Martin Maldonado also went deep as the visiting Los Angeles Angels pounded the Detroit Tigers 9-2 on Tuesday.\nThe Angels’ Mike Scioscia collected his 1,600th career managerial victory. He passed former Los Angeles Dodgers manager and mentor Tommy Lasorda for 20th on the all-time managerial wins list.\nValbuena and Kinsler each had three hits, three runs and three RBIs. Maldonado had two hits and drove in three runs.\nWinning pitcher Nick Tropeano (3-3) gave up two runs on seven hits while striking out five and walking none in 5 1/3 innings.\nJaCoby Jones and Jeimer Candelario homered for the Tigers. Michael Fulmer (2-4) gave up five runs on six hits and four walks in 3 1/3 innings. He struck out one.\nFulmer retired the side in order in the first, but the second inning was a different story. Albert Pujols led off with a single, advanced on a walk and scored on Valbuena’s single. Kinsler then battled through an eight-pitch at-bat before depositing the ball over the left field wall for a 4-0 Angels lead.\nThe Angels squandered an opportunity the next inning. With runners on first and second and no outs, Pujols singled to left. Mike Trout was held at third, but Justin Upton got caught between second and third and was tagged out. Andrelton Simmons then hit into a double play.\nFulmer’s night ended soon after Valbuena drilled his homer over the right-center-field wall in the fourth.\nJones put the Tigers on the board with his homer to left in the fifth, cutting the deficit to 5-1. Leonys Martin just missed a homer later in the inning, sending right fielder Kole Calhoun to the wall in right-center.\nLos Angeles scratched out a run in the sixth when Kinsler reached on infield single and advanced to second on a throwing error. Maldonado knocked him in with a single.\nCandelario’s solo blast in the bottom of the inning made it 6-2. The Tigers loaded the bases with two outs against Noe Ramirez, but Jose Iglesias popped out on a 3-1 pitch.\nHomers by Valbuena and Maldonado in the eighth increased the Angels’ lead to 9-2.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
