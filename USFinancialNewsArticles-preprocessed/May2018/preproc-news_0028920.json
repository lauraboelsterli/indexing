(NYSE:RCUS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating innovative cancer immunotherapies, today announced financial results and recent corporate updates for the first quarter .\n“The first quarter of 2018 was another exciting period for the Company, as our immuno-oncology pipeline continues to advance,” said Terry Rosen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Arcus. “We have submitted regulatory filings to initiate our first combination trials of AB928, our internally discovered dual adenosine receptor antagonist, with other anti-cancer agents, including our anti-PD-1 antibody, AB122, and expect to initiate dosing in patients in mid-2018. We are also on track to submit regulatory filings for our next two product candidates, AB154 and AB680 in the third quarter, and to end the year with four product candidates in clinical development.”\nPipeline Updates and Upcoming Milestones\nAB928 (dual A 2 R receptor antagonist)\nInitiated the submission of regulatory filings for three Phase 1/1b trials to evaluate AB928 in combination with AB122 or chemotherapy. Each trial will evaluate AB928 in combination with AB122 and/or chemotherapy in selected tumor types and will be conducted in both Australia and the U.S. The trial protocols were designed to allow for the addition of other AB928 combinations over time, including triple combinations. There will be a dose-escalation portion which will be followed by dose-expansion cohorts once the recommended dose of AB928 for each combination has been selected. In both the dose-escalation portion and expansion cohorts, the Company will conduct significant biomarker analysis, designed to inform patient selection in future trials. Data from the dose-escalation portion of these trials will be presented in the first half of 2019. The three trials will evaluate AB928 combinations in the following tumor types:\n-- Gastrointestinal malignancies (initially colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers)\n-- Breast and gynecological (initially ovarian) malignancies\n-- Non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma Completed dosing in the ongoing Phase 1 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers in April. Final results from this trial, including pharmacodynamic data for the 200 mg QD dosing cohort, is expected to be released in mid-2018. Presented initial data from the Phase 1 trial in a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting in April. Data showed AB928 is safe and well tolerated at all doses evaluated (up to 200 mg QD) and achieves near complete inhibition of adenosine 2a receptor (A 2a R) activation. Presented preclinical data in a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting in April. Data demonstrated that AB928 in combination with doxorubicin or oxaliplatin results in greater immune activation and tumor control than that of chemotherapy alone in two different tumor models.\nAB122 (anti-PD-1 antibody)\nInitiated dosing of a third cohort in the ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in cancer patients in Australia. The Company plans to present safety, pharmacokinetic, receptor occupancy and clinical activity data from this trial in the second half of 2018. Presented preclinical data in a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting in April. Data demonstrated that AB122 is similar to nivolumab in terms of binding affinity, selectivity and anti-tumor activity in an animal model.\nAB154 (anti-TIGIT antibody)\nContinued to advance CMC activities and GLP toxicology studies. These studies are being conducted in preparation for the first regulatory submission for AB154 expected in mid-2018.\nAB680 (small molecule CD73 inhibitor)\nPresented preclinical discovery and characterization data in a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting in April. Data demonstrated that AB680 significantly enhanced the activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies (AB122 and AB154, respectively) in immune function assays demonstrating the potential of triple combination therapy. This drug has a predicted half-life in humans of several days, which should allow for a dosing regimen of every two or three weeks. Preparing to submit the first regulatory filing to initiate a Phase 1 trial to evaluate AB680 in healthy volunteers. This trial, which is expected to start in the third quarter of 2018, is designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of AB680 in healthy volunteers. Clinical testing of AB680 in cancer patients is expected to begin in the first half of 2019.\nCorporate Updates\nThe Company completed an initial public offering in March, raising approximately $124.7 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriter discounts and other offering-related costs through the sale of 9,200,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share. Proceeds from this offering are currently expected to fund the company into at least 2020.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results:\nAt March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $290.8 million, compared to $175.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the receipt of $124.7 million in net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering, which was completed in March. Collaboration and license revenue for the first quarter was $1.3 million, compared to no revenue for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenue was entirely due to revenue recognized from the Option and License Agreement the Company entered into with Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in September 2017. Research and development expenses for the first quarter were $11.7 million, compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $5.9 million was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing and clinical costs to support our ongoing AB928 and AB122 clinical trials and an increase in R&D headcount to support the Company’s other programs. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter were $2.9 million, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $1.4 million was primarily due to higher legal and accounting fees and additional staff in key areas required to support a public company infrastructure, as well as increased facilities and office expenses related to our expanded facility in Hayward. Net loss for the first quarter was $13.0 million, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses noted above.\nAbout Arcus Biosciences\nArcus Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating innovative cancer immunotherapies.
