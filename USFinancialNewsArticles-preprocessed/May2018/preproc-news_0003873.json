    "text": "MANCHESTER, Conn., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LYDALL, INC. (NYSE:LDL) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS - Q1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nGAAP Financials\nNet sales of $191.7 million, up $26.2 million, or 15.8% Increased tooling sales of $10.3 million, or 6.3% Favorable foreign currency translation of $9.7 million, or 5.8% Gross margin of 20.6%, down 390 basis points Operating margin of 7.3%, down 190 basis points Earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.64, down 5.9%, from $0.68\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures*\nOrganic sales growth of 4.2% Adjusted gross margin of 20.8%, down 420 basis points Adjusted operating margin of 7.7%, down 240 basis points Adjusted EPS of $0.67, down 9.5%, from adjusted $0.74 per share Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%, down 250 basis points\n*Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to Lydall’s GAAP financial results are included at the end of this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nDale G. Barnhart, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Lydall delivered solid organic sales growth of 4.2%, across all segments, led by the Technical Nonwovens segment at 7.8% and continued above-market volume growth in our Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment. As expected, consolidated gross margin was lower than the first quarter of 2017 as the Company was impacted by a continuing trend of increased commodity costs and lower customer pricing on certain applications in the Thermal Acoustical Solutions segment. This segment also saw a sharp increase in demand on key platforms in North America, and coupled with equipment downtime and other inefficiencies, resulted in excessive manufacturing and freight costs to meet customer delivery schedules. Partially offsetting lower gross margin was improved consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales by 200 basis points primarily from leveraging increased sales across the Company.\"\nQ1 2018 Results\nNet sales increased by $26.2 million, or 15.8%, to $191.7 million, compared to $165.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Technical Nonwovens (\"TNW\") segment reported organic sales growth of 7.8%, led by improved demand for industrial filtration products outside the U.S., and to a lesser extent, increased advanced materials sales in North America. The Thermal Acoustical Solutions (\"TAS\") segment reported organic sales growth of 3.6%, with growth in Asia contributing approximately 25% of this increase. Net sales from tooling increased $10.3 million due to new platform launches and timing of revenue recognition from a new accounting standard which increased tooling net sales by $6.2 million. The Performance Materials (\"PM\") segment reported organic sales growth of 1.3% led by improved filtration demand in the fluid power market. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by $9.7 million, or 5.8%, in the first quarter of 2018.\nGross margin was 20.6%, compared to 24.5% in the first quarter of 2017, with the reduction principally driven by the TAS segment, impacting consolidated gross margin by approximately 290 basis points, and to a lesser extent the TNW and PM segments. The TAS segment was impacted by increased aluminum costs, reduced customer pricing on certain parts and unfavorable tooling mix which contributed to lower gross margin. Also, expedited freight expenses (approximately 70 basis points) and excessive overtime and scrap expenses from equipment downtime and other inefficiencies, including interruptions in production associated with pre-launch activities and prototypes, resulted in lower TAS segment gross margin. The reduction in TNW segment gross margin was primarily due to restructuring-related expenses of $0.4 million as well as unfavorable product mix. Gross margin performance in the PM segment was impacted by unfavorable cost absorption.\nOperating margin was 7.3%, down 190 basis points, or 240 basis points on an adjusted basis, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Lower gross margin was partially offset by 200 basis points, or 180 basis points on an adjusted basis, from a reduction in selling, product development and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily due to managed spending coupled with sales growth. An asset impairment charge in the first quarter of 2017 impacted operating margin by 50 basis points.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 16.1% compared to 17.6% in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted by U.S. tax law changes that lowered the statutory U.S. tax rate to 21%, and to a lesser extent, tax benefits from stock vesting and the geographical mix of earnings. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by 11.4% due to stock vesting and the geographical mix of earnings. The Company now projects its ordinary effective tax rate in 2018 to be in the range of 18.0% - 20.0%.\nNet income was $11.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.67, compared to $0.74 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity\nCash was $49.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $59.9 million at December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operations was $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net cash provided by operations of $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in cash from operations was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable from greater quarter-on-quarter net sales. Availability under the Company's domestic credit facility was $94.5 million at March 31, 2018, which provides additional capacity to support organic growth programs and operational improvements, fund capital investments and pursue attractive acquisitions. The Company's net leverage ratio (debt less cash divided by trailing twelve months EBITDA) was approximately 0.3 times at March 31, 2018.\nOutlook\nMr. Barnhart concluded, “Looking forward in the second quarter of 2018, we expect robust backlog and order activity to continue across all segments and overall organic growth to be in a range consistent with the first quarter of 2018. The TAS segment expects commodity inflation and reduced customer pricing on certain applications to continue. Meaningful improvements are being made to address TAS manufacturing processes and equipment efficiency to reduce excessive manufacturing costs and improve gross margins. Overall, we expect quarterly sequential improvement in consolidated gross margin in the second quarter, but we do expect consolidated gross margin to be lower than the same period last year. We remain focused on executing the Technical Nonwovens' restructuring plan that is expected to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency. The Company will also continue to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities to drive profitable growth.\"\nConference Call\nLydall will host a conference call on May 2, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 as well as general matters related to its businesses and markets.

The attached financial tables address the non-GAAP measures used in this press release and reconcile non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps investors gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the Company's performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the corresponding GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” within the Private 1995.

Management believes that the presentation of organic sales change is useful to investors because it enables them to assess, on a consistent basis, sales trends related to the Company selling products to customers, without the impact of foreign currency rate changes that are not under management's control and do not reflect the performance of the Company and management. Tooling sales are excluded because tooling revenue is not generated from selling the Company's products to customers, but rather is reimbursement from our customers for the design and production of tools used by the Company in our manufacturing processes. Tooling sales can be sporadic and may mask underlying business conditions and obscure business trends.\nSource:Lydall, Inc.",
