    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 11:43 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Cricket-South Africa's De Villiers quits international cricket Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nCAPE TOWN, May 23 (Reuters) - South African talisman AB de Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket on Wednesday, saying he was tired and wanted to step out while still at the top.\n“After 114 test matches, 228 one day internationals and 78 T20 internationals it is time for others to take over. I’ve had my turn and to be honest I’m tired,” he said in a video message on Twitter and in a statement.\n“This is a tough decision, I have thought long and hard about it and I’d like to retire while still playing decent cricket. After the fantastic series wins against India and Australia, now feels like the right time to step aside.\n“It would not be right for me to pick and choose where, when and in what format I play for the Proteas. For me, in the green and gold, it must be everything or nothing,” he added. (Reporting by Mark Gleeson; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",
