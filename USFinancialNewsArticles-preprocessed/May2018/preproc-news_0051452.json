    "text": "BANGKOK, May 22 (Reuters) - Thailand will use a state oil fund to support domestic retail fuel prices to help consumers cope with rising global oil prices, the energy minister said on Tuesday.\nThe fund of about 30 billion baht ($936.9 million) will absorb 50 percent of any increase in retail prices, Energy Minister Siri Jirapongphan told reporters.\n“If retail oil prices rise 1 baht, the fund will help 0.50 baht,” Siri said.\n“This will help ease the impact from oil prices, which could rise to over $80 per barrel,” he added.\nThe government aims to keep the domestic retail diesel price at 30 baht per litre, Siri said, as the price had risen by 3 baht per litre to about 29.8 baht over the past two months.\nThe subsidy plan will need approval from the Energy Policy and Planning Office, which will meet this week.
