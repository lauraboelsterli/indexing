    "text": "Gold prices rebounded on Friday, as the U.S. dollar eased after Italian political tension sparked a sell-off in the country's bond markets and investors sought a safe haven in bullion.\nSpot gold gained 0.2 percent at $1,292.12 per ounce 27 in the previous session at $1,285.41. The metal was heading for its biggest weekly decline since early December, down nearly 2 percent versus last week. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $1.90, or 0.2 percent, at $1,291.30 per ounce.\n\"Gold got stronger off Italian geopolitics and the sell-off in Italian bond markets,\" said Josh Graves, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.\nThe demands of populist parties likely to form Italy's next government, which promised to ramp up spending, caused Italian investors to flee bond markets and purchase gold.\n\"A debt crisis in Italy would have a far bigger impact than one in Greece. Gold would profit as a result,\" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\nThis caused more volatility in global equities, which also provided gold support, Graves added.\nEarlier, the sentiment index in gold was indicating it was strongly oversold while the dollar was heavily overbought as U.S. inflation measures were rising, said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, partner at consultancy T-Commodity in Milan.\nThursday data showed a tightening U.S. labor market and mid-Atlantic factory activity picking up, bolstering expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.\n\"We think there is room for a strong rally into the summer and we have a gold target of $1,430 by August,\" Torlizzi said.\nThe dollar index earlier rose to a fresh five-month peak as the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield hit the highest in nearly seven years. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for users of other currencies, while higher U.S. yields dampen the appeal of non-yielding bullion.\nSpot gold is still expected to hit $1,302 per ounce as it has stabilized around a support at $1,287, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.",
