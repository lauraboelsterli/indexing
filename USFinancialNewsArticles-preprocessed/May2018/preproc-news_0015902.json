Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, estimates, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different.\nSuch factors include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to achieve and effectively manage growth, including our ability to integrate our recent acquisitions and consummate and integrate future acquisitions; our ability to pay our debt; our ability to maintain and expand our products and services; our ability to expand or retain our customer base; our ability to grow or sustain revenue from individual customers; our ability to attract and retain a professional staff of research analysts and consultants as well as experienced sales personnel upon whom we are dependent; our ability to achieve continued customer renewals and achieve new contract value, backlog and deferred revenue growth in light of competitive pressures; our ability to carry out our strategic initiatives and manage associated costs; our ability to successfully compete with existing competitors and potential new competitors; our ability to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights; additional risks associated with international operations including foreign currency fluctuations; the impact of restructuring and other charges on our businesses and operations; general economic conditions; risks associated with the creditworthiness and budget cuts of governments and agencies; the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and other factors described under “Risk Factors” contained in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which can be found on Gartner’s website at www.investor.gartner.com and the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nForward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and Gartner disclaims any obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nCertain financial measures used in this Press Release are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and as such are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and as a result may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:\nAdjusted Revenue : Represents GAAP revenue plus, as applicable (i) revenue for pre-acquisition period(s) from CEB, as applicable; and (ii) the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues. The majority of the non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the underlying revenue contract. We believe Adjusted Revenue is an important measure of our recurring operations as it provides a more accurate period-over-period comparison of trends in revenues, on both a consolidated and segment results basis.\nAdjusted Contribution and Adjusted Contribution Margin : Adjusted Contribution represents GAAP contribution plus (i) the contribution for pre-acquisition period(s) from CEB, as applicable; and (ii) the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues. The Adjusted Contribution Margin represents the contribution margin on Adjusted revenue. We believe Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted Contribution Margin are important measures of our recurring operations as they provide a more accurate and consistent period-over-period comparison of our segment results.\nAdjusted EBITDA : Represents GAAP net (loss) income plus (i) stock-based compensation expense; depreciation, amortization, and accretion on excess facilities obligations; the amortization of non-cash fair adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues; acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items; (ii) the Adjusted EBITDA related to pre-acquisition periods for CEB, as applicable. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items not representative of our core operating results.\nAdjusted Net Income : Represents GAAP net (loss) income adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items; (iii) the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues; (iv) the non-recurring impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and (v) certain other non-recurring items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items not indicative of our core operating results.\nAdjusted EPS : Represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.\nFree Cash Flow : Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP as follows: (i) plus payments for acquisition and integration items directly-related to our acquisitions and certain other non-recurring items; (ii) less payments for capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\nNon-GAAP Metrics excluding Held-for-Sale Operations : Represents the non-GAAP metrics defined above excluding the results of our operations that are classified as held-for-sale, which are provided for Adjusted revenue, Adjusted contribution, Adjusted contribution margin, and Adjusted EBITDA.\nForeign Currency Neutral (FX Neutral) : We provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our contract values and revenues and certain expenses. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. We calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into U.S. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of certain Non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release with the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
