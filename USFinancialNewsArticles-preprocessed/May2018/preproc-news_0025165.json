    "text": "May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached agreement in principle with the Royal Bank of Scotland on settlement of potential civil claims stemming from mortgage-backed securities issued from 2005 to 2008, the company and the U.S. attorney’s office in Massachusetts said on Wednesday. The bank said in a statement that under terms of the proposed settlement, it has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $4.9 billion. The attorney’s office said: “Further details remain to be negotiated, however, before a formal agreement can be reached.” (Reporting by Nate Raymond and Eric Walsh; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n ",
