Soccer Football - League One - Doncaster Rovers vs Wigan Athletic - Keepmoat Stadium, Doncaster, Britain - May 5, 2018 Wigan Athletic players celebrate with the trophy after winning League One Action Images/John Clifton\nWigan chairman David Sharpe said the agreement to sell the club’s majority stake to International Entertainment Corporation (IEC) is now subject to approval from the English Football League and the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nIEC confirmed in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday that the 22 million pounds deal includes a majority shareholding in Wigan’s DW Stadium and the training grounds.
