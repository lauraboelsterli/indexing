    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACM Research, Inc. (“ACM Research” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ACMR), a provider of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment used by manufacturers of advanced semiconductors, today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nACM Research’s President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. David Wang commented, “We continued to execute against key initiatives across our business, delivering solid results in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew over 70%, and gross margin expanded by over 10 percentage points. Additionally, we established an R&D facility in Bundang, Korea to further expand our R&D capability and build our engineering talent pool in the region.”\nDr. Wang continued, “We remain committed to developing high-performance products to meet our customer needs and strengthen our competitive position globally. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and confident that our differentiated technology and geographic focus positions us for profitable growth.”\nFirst Quarter Operating Highlights\nSAPS III Cleaning Tool Used in Mass Production. The Company’s latest SAPS wafer cleaning tool, SAPS III, is being used in mass production in a key customer’s manufacturing line. The SAPS III tool is ideally suited for existing wafer fabs that intend to migrate to next-generation technology node and require more cleaning process steps and limited clean room floor space. The SAPS III tool is equipped with 8 chambers, which enable high throughput, along with a 40% reduction in footprint. ACM Korea R&D and Service Support Center. The Company established the ACM Korea R&D and Service Support Centers to further strengthen its R&D and service support capabilities. The R&D Center in Bundang will enable the Company to recruit engineering talent locally to implement new R&D programs. The support facility in Icheon will enable ACM to better support customers in the region. Multiple Orders for SAPS tools . The Company received multiple orders from existing customers for SAPS-based cleaning equipment and advanced packaging tools. ACM expects to ship all of the ordered tools by the third quarter of 2018, and anticipates acceptance and revenue recognition in 2018.\nFinancial Summary\nAll figures refer to the first quarter of 2018, unless noted otherwise. All comparisons are with the first quarter of 2017, unless otherwise noted.\nQuarter/Year to Date Three Months March 31, GAAP Non-GAAP(1) 2018 2017 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 9,743 $ 5,660 $ 9,743 $ 5,660 Gross margin(2) 52.57 % 42.44 % 52.65 % 42.44 % Income (loss) from operations(2) $ (1,904 ) $ (1,553 ) $ 271 $ (718 ) Net loss attributable to ACM Research, Inc.(2) $ (2,780 ) $ (2,089 ) $ (605 ) $ (1,254 ) Basic EPS $ (0.18 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (0.04 ) $ (0.26 ) Diluted EPS $ (0.18 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (0.04 ) $ (0.26 ) Shares included in the basic EPS 15,383 4,818 15,383 4,818 Shares included in the diluted EPS 15,383 4,818 15,383 4,818\n(1) Reconciliations to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures from non-GAAP financial measures are presented below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(2) Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation.\nRevenue. Revenue increased 72.1% to $9.7 million, due to higher selling prices associated with the higher value of the equipment sold.\nGross Margin. Gross margin was 52.6%, compared to 42.4% in the first quarter of 2017. The strong gross margin performance was due to sales of higher value products in the quarter. Gross margin was above the range of 40.0% to 45.0% generally anticipated by the Company for the foreseeable future. Gross margin may vary from period to period due to the mix between higher-margin products and relatively lower-margin products.\nOperating Expenses . Operating expenses were $7.0 million. Non-GAAP operating expense, which removes stock-based compensation, was $4.8 million, up 55%. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased, as planned, due to the Company’s disciplined budgeting process.\nNet l oss attributable to ACM Research. Net loss was $2.8 million. Non-GAAP net loss was $0.6 million, a substantial improvement from the non-GAAP net loss of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Position. The Company held $15.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, down from $17.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The decline in cash balance reflected an increase in purchase orders for parts and components associated with the assembly of products expected to be shipped in the second and third quarters.\nOutlook\nACM is reiterating its full year 2018 revenue guidance of $65 million. The Company’s confidence in this outlook was strengthened by the recent receipt of several orders that are expected to ship and be recognized within the year. ACM now has a backlog more than $50 million in orders, most of which are expected to be delivered to customers by the third quarter. A very high proportion of the shipments are expected to be accepted and revenue recognized before year-end.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss results will be held today at 8:00 a.m. U.S Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. China Time). Dial-in details for the call are as follows.

These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM Research does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures.”\nACM Research believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM Research uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM Research also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM Research to provide this non-GAAP information.\nWhile ACM Research believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM Research’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nInformation presented above under “Financial Summary—Gross Margin” with respect to the expected range of gross margin for the foreseeable future and under “Fiscal 2018 Revenue Outlook” contains for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may vary significantly from ACM Research’s expectations based on a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following: anticipated customer orders or identified market opportunities may not grow or develop as anticipated; customer orders already received may be postponed or canceled; suppliers may not be able to meet ACM Research’s demands on a timely basis; volatile global economic, market, industry and other conditions could result in sharply lower demand for products containing semiconductors and for the company's products and in disruption of capital and credit markets; ACM Research’s failure to successfully manage its operations; and trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and war may materially adversely affect ACM Research due to its substantial non-U.S. customer and supplier base and its substantial non-U.S. manufacturing operations. ACM Research cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. ACM Research expressly disclaims any obligation to update after the date of this press release.\nAbout ACM Research, Inc.\nACM Research develops, manufactures and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which semiconductor manufacturers can use in numerous manufacturing steps to remove particles, contaminants and other random defects, and thereby improve product yield, in fabricating advanced integrated circuits.\n© ACM Research, Inc.
