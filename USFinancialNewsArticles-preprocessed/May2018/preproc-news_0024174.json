FILE PHOTO: Anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio speaks following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi/File Photo\nThe far-right League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement are holding talks in a bid to form a coalition government some nine weeks after a national election ended with a hung parliament.\n“It’s being called a populist government. Some have said it’s a threat to the people,” Di Maio told reporters shortly after meeting League leader Matteo Salvini. “Some say it’s a threat to Europe. Whoever sees this government as a threat to Europe perhaps sees their job in jeopardy, but it’s not Europe that’s threatened.” Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Crispian Balmer",
