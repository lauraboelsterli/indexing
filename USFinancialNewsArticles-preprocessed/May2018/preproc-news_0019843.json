    "text": "Good morning. The Wall Street Journal’s The Future Of Everything Festival kicks off in New York City this morning, where top doers and thinkers from the worlds of design, fashion, artificial intelligence and more will discuss the changes transforming our world. Over on the West Coast, the Google I/O developer conference will be held in Mountain View, Calif., where attendees will be given a look at the future of Android, Google Home and a host of other products. One expects discussions around privacy may be on the agenda, too, as we count down to GDPR Day. The Verge has you covered on what to expect .\nHostile Territory The giant global media industry three-dimensional chess match has taken another twist. As Reuters first reported, Comcast is lining up a $60 billion financing facility so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. As WSJ reports, Comcast hasn’t decided yet whether to go ahead with a hostile bid . Fox, citing regulatory concerns, previously turned down a Comcast stock offer in the low-$60-billion range before going with Disney, people familiar with the matter have said. June 12 will be crucial to Comcast’s next move. That’s the date set for the ruling in the government’s case against AT&T and Time Warner’s proposed merger. If the judge rules in the companies’ favor, most media-industry observers think it could spark a deal-making spree across the sector. Disney reports earnings later Tuesday, so expect questions from analysts on the call about the escalating battle for the Fox assets. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)\n–Blue Sky Thinking–\nAdded to the mix is the race for full control of European pay TV operator Sky. As WSJ reports, Comcast’s financing would allow it to pursue a bid for the Fox assets and consolidate 100% ownership of Sky. European antitrust regulators said Tuesday that they will rule on Comcast’s £12.50-a-share bid for Sky by June 15 . You’ll remember Fox’s 2016 £10.75-a-share bid for the 61% of Sky shares it doesn’t already own has been held up by British antitrust regulators, concerned such a deal would give the Murdoch family too much influence in U.K. media. Next month is set to be busy for the world’s biggest media owners, and that’s all before we even think about jetting off to Cannes.\nDedicated Follower of Fashion Like many fashion retailers, H&M largely relied on a team of human tastemakers to predict what consumers will want to buy. Now, hoping to turn around 10 straight quarters of same-store-sales slumps, H&M is turning to algorithms , too, WSJ reports. H&M is analyzing data from blog posts, search engines and other sources to detect fashion trends in advance. The fast-fashion giant also is looking at historical sales of individual products to calculate unique sales predictions and price elasticity per product and store. The granular data analysis has led to some stores being overhauled to stock more higher-priced items that sold unexpectedly well. The algorithms still need some human oversight: Late last year, they suggested H&M promote reindeer-printed sweaters in January. (Or maybe the algorithms know something we don’t?!) H&M’s new model to tailor merchandise in each of its 4,000-plus stores is largely untested in the retail industry, however, and analysts are skeptical the new approach will lead to a swift recovery for the brand.\nStop Right Now, Thank You Very Much The topic of viewability in the Facebook news feed is a sore point for some ad buyers. Some users have become accustomed to zipping through their news feeds, meaning they may not stick around long enough on the ads to meet the generally accepted industry viewability standards. Adidas has reportedly put its Facebook video ad spending on pause while it reviews whether to stop buying there altogether, according to three agency executives Digiday spoke to. One of those executives said up to 30% of the budget Adidas spends on Facebook could be wasted, owing to low viewability and retention rates. Another issue: Adidas reportedly is unhappy with the level of data Facebook shares with advertisers to help them measure the efficacy of their ads on the platform. Now that Adidas has put its money where its mouth is, will Facebook’s hand be forced? Given the recent scrutiny over Facebook’s data-sharing practices elsewhere, it’s doubtful. I’d imagine Facebook is encouraging Adidas not to get too hung up on the viewability numbers and instead look at whether its ads are leading to positive business outcomes. (Remember, Facebook is also currently going through a Media Rating Council audit for its viewability metrics.)\nBest of the rest Pharmaceutical and consumer-health giant GSK has launched a global media review.
