FILE PHOTO: Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco speaks during a meeting in Rome, Italy, October 31, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli\nIgnazio Visco, speaking to the bank’s annual meeting, made the comments as Italy heads back to snap elections where the issue is likely to be the country’s role in the European Union and its membership of the euro zone.\nThe two anti-establishment parties, which tried and failed to form a government after inconclusive March elections, are promising to ramp up public spending, seek changes to EU fiscal rules and roll back pension and labour reforms.
