(“Birch”), issuing approximately 50 million shares to Birch’s selling shareholders at $5.78 per share, and retiring $444 million of Birch’s prior outstanding indebtedness, for a total Enterprise Value of approximately $600 million\nClosed $680 million of new Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Facilities”), consisting of First and Second Lien Term Loans and including a $40 million Revolving Credit Facility that is currently undrawn, and retired Fusion’s prior outstanding indebtedness\nRaised an additional $10 million of debt through the issuance of a subordinated note to Holcombe Green, Fusion’s Vice Chairman and largest shareholder, with the same terms as Fusion’s new Second Lien Term Loan\nClosed a $15 million private placement of non-convertible preferred shares that are redeemable by Fusion at any time, in a transaction led by Holcombe Green\nCompleted an $8 million private placement of Fusion's common stock priced at $5.25 per share, led by a fund managed by Morgan Stanley which, together with the other purchasers of the shares, also participated in the Facilities\nCompleted the spin-off of Fusion’s remaining interests in its Carrier Services business as well as Birch’s consumer and single-line business customer base, leaving Fusion’s focus on the cloud services market\nRetired all of Fusion’s Series A-1, A-2 and A-4 and Series B-2 Preferred Stock with a total stated value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, of $18.9 million, through the issuance of 1.3 million shares of Fusion common stock\nSigned a definitive agreement to acquire MegaPath Holding Corporation (“MegaPath”) for total consideration of $71.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments\nChanged the Company’s corporate name to Fusion Connect, Inc., which better reflects its focus on the cloud services market\nEstablished new intermediate-term financial objectives of $750 million in annualized revenue and $185 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA\nManagement Commentary\n“Our performance in the first quarter of 2018 was solid, as we delivered another quarter of year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions,” said Matthew Rosen, Fusion’s Chairman and CEO. “We also achieved a number of important milestones during the first quarter, which helped set the stage for the even more transformational accomplishments that followed.\n“Now that the Birch acquisition has closed, and with the expected close of the MegaPath acquisition on the horizon, I’m very excited by Fusion’s opportunity to be a disruptive force in the cloud services industry,” Mr. Rosen continued. “We believe strongly that our unique strategy, the strength of our operating model, and the power of our platform to drive significant levels of free cash flow will greatly benefit our customers and partners, our employees, and our shareholders.”\n“As a result, today we are establishing our next set of intermediate-term financial objectives of $750 million in annualized revenue and $185 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA,” Mr. Rosen concluded.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in Q1 2018 was $29.0 million, compared to $28.5 million in Q1 2017. Consolidated gross margin was 55.5% in Q1 2018, as compared to 57.4% in Q1 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from customers acquired during the first half of 2017 which carried a lower gross margin.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders from continuing operations in Q1 2018 was $4.2 million, or $0.20 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a net loss in Q1 2017 of $4.4 million, or $0.32 per share on a basic and diluted basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 2% in Q1 2018 to $3.7 million, compared to $3.6 million in Q1 2017 (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below). Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 million in Q1 2018, or 3.4% of total revenue.\nTotal cash and equivalents at March 31, 2018 was $31.0 million, compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2017. On February 5, 2018, Fusion completed a follow-on offering of 8,625,000 shares of its common stock for net proceeds before offering expenses of $38.7 million. Additionally during the first quarter, Fusion made $6.6 million of debt pay downs of its then-outstanding senior secured term loan.\nFurther details about the Company’s financial results are available in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be available in the investor relations section of the Company’s website at ir.fusionconnect.com .\nConference Call Information\nFusion Chairman and CEO Matthew Rosen and CFO Kevin Dotts will host a conference call today to discuss the Company’s financial results, followed by a question and answer period.

Adjusted EBITDA provides an adjusted view of EBITDA that takes into account certain significant non-recurring transactions, if any, such as impairment losses and expenses associated with pending acquisitions, which vary significantly between periods and are not recurring in nature, as well as certain recurring non-cash charges such as changes in fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities and stock-based compensation. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a measure of the Company’s operational and financial progress that corresponds with the measurements used by management as a basis for allocating resources and making other operating decisions. Although the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of several financial measures to assess its operating performance, its use is limited as it excludes certain significant operating expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In accordance with SEC Regulation G, the non-GAAP measurements in this press release have been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measurement, which can be viewed under the heading “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA,” immediately following the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this press release.\nFUSION CONNECT, INC.
