    "text": "DALLAS, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE: EAT) today announced results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 28, 2018.\nHighlights include the following:\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $1.02 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 representing an 18.6 percent increase from $0.86 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, were $1.08 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 representing a 14.9 percent increase from $0.94 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) Brinker International's total revenues were $812.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increasing 0.2 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and company sales were $790.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 which were flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Chili's company-owned comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.4 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Chili's U.S. franchise comparable restaurant sales decreased 3.2 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Chili's international franchise comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.2 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Maggiano's comparable restaurant sales increased 0.5 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 Operating income, as a percent of total revenues, was 8.9 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 9.0 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 representing a decrease of approximately 10 basis points Restaurant operating margin, as a percent of company sales, was 16.1 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 17.0 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) For the first thirty-nine weeks of fiscal 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $237.7 million and capital expenditures totaled $69.5 million. Free cash flow was $168.2 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) The Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on the common stock of the Company. The dividend will be payable June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 8, 2018 Brinker has entered into the first Chili's franchise partnership in China, which will cover the Shanghai region.\n\"Brinker continued to gain momentum during the third quarter, especially related to our foundational strategy to drive positive traffic at Chili's,\" said Wyman Roberts, Chief Executive Officer and President. \"Our investments into our food, our value equation and our curbside To Go offering are working and creating a more compelling guest experience.\"\nQuarterly Operating Performance\nCHILI'S company sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 0.1 percent to $688.9 million from $689.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to a decline in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by an increase in capacity in the United States. As compared to the prior year, Chili's restaurant operating margin 1 declined. Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, increased compared to the prior year due to food investments into beef and chicken and our promotional activities. These investments were partially offset by increased menu pricing. Restaurant labor, as a percent of company sales, increased compared to the prior year due to higher wage rates and employee health insurance expenses, partially offset by lower incentive bonuses. Restaurant expenses, as a percent of company sales, decreased due to lower technology-related operating lease expenses and lower loyalty program related expenses, partially offset by increased repairs and maintenance expenses.\nMAGGIANO'S company sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 0.6 percent to $101.6 million from $101.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in comparable restaurant sales. As compared to the prior year, Maggiano's restaurant operating margin 1 improved. Restaurant labor, as a percent of company sales, decreased compared to the prior year due to sales leverage and labor efficiencies, partially offset by higher wage rates. Restaurant expenses, as a percent of company sales, decreased primarily due to sales leverage, lower property taxes, and lower restaurant opening expenses, partially offset by increased repairs and maintenance expenses. Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, was positively impacted by favorable menu item mix and increased menu pricing, partially offset by unfavorable commodity pricing.\n1\nRestaurant operating margin is defined as Company sales less Cost of sales, Restaurant labor and Restaurant expenses and excludes Depreciation and amortization expenses (see non-GAAP reconciliation below).\nFRANCHISE AND OTHER revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 10.1 percent to $22.0 million from $20.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher gift card-related revenues and development fees. Brinker franchisees generated approximately $337.0 million in sales 2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\n2\nRoyalty revenues are recognized based on the sales generated and reported to the Company by franchisees.\nOther\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $1.8 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in fully-depreciated assets and restaurant closures, partially offset by depreciation on asset replacements, new restaurant openings and new technology-related capital lease depreciation.\nGeneral and administrative expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.7 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher performance-based compensation expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 lowered federal statutory tax rates. Brinker's federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 decreased to 28.1 percent, representing a blended tax rate for the current fiscal year based on the number of days in the fiscal year before and after the effective date of the Tax Act. For subsequent years, our federal statutory tax rate will be 21.0 percent under the Tax Act.\nOn a GAAP basis, the effective income tax rate decreased to 20.4 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 28.9 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This decrease was driven primarily by the positive impact of the lower federal statutory tax rate. Excluding the impact of special items (see non-GAAP reconciliation below for details), the effective income tax rate decreased to 19.6 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 29.9 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook Update\nRevenues for fiscal 2018 are now estimated to be flat to down 0.5 percent compared to fiscal 2017. Comparable restaurant sales for fiscal 2018 are estimated to be down 0.5 percent to down 1.0 percent. In addition, restaurant operating margin is now estimated to be down approximately 65-75 basis points on a year-over-year basis.\nGuidance Policy\nBrinker provides annual guidance as it relates to comparable restaurant sales, earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, and other key line items in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will only provide updates if there is a material change versus the original guidance. We are unable to reliably forecast special items such as restaurant impairments, restaurant closures, reorganization charges and legal settlements without unreasonable effort. As such, we do not present a reconciliation of forecasted non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures. If special items are reported in the remainder of fiscal 2018, reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measures will be provided.\nTable 1: Q3 Comparable Restaurant Sales 1\nCompany-owned, reported brands and franchise; percentage\nQ3 18\nQ3 17\nBrinker International\n(0.3)\n(2.2)\nChili's Company-Owned\nComparable Restaurant Sales\n(0.4)\n(2.3)\nPricing Impact\n1.1\n2.9\nMix-Shift 2\n0.6\n1.0\nTraffic\n(2.1)\n(6.2)\nMaggiano's\nComparable Restaurant Sales\n0.5\n(1.6)\nPricing Impact\n1.3\n2.4\nMix-Shift 2\n0.6\n1.4\nTraffic\n(1.4)\n(5.4)\nChili's Franchise 3\n(2.1)\n(2.5)\nU.S. Comparable Restaurant Sales\n(3.2)\n0.3\nInternational Comparable Restaurant Sales\n(0.2)\n(7.1)\nChili's Domestic 4\n(1.1)\n(1.7)\nSystem-wide 5\n(0.8)\n(2.3)\n1\nComparable restaurant sales includes all restaurants that have been in operation for more than 18 months\n2\nMix-shift is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in company sales resulting from the change in menu items ordered by guests\n3\nRevenues generated by franchisees are not included in revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income; however, we generate royalty revenue and advertising fees based on franchisee revenues, where applicable. We believe including franchise comparable restaurant sales provides investors information regarding brand performance that is relevant to current operations and may impact future restaurant development\n4\nChili's Domestic comparable restaurant sales percentages are derived from sales generated by company-owned and franchise-operated Chili's restaurants in the United States\n5\nSystem-wide comparable restaurant sales are derived from sales generated by company-owned Chili's and Maggiano's restaurants in addition to the sales generated at franchise-operated Chili's restaurants\nNon-GAAP Measures\nBrinker management uses certain non-GAAP measures in analyzing operating performance and believes that the presentation of these measures in this release provides investors with information that is beneficial to gaining an understanding of the Company's financial results. Non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are included in the tables below.\nTable 2: Reconciliation of Net Income Excluding Special Items\nQ3 18 and Q3 17; $ millions and $ per diluted share\nBrinker believes excluding special items from its financial results provides investors with a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results.\nQ3 18\nEPS Q3 18\nQ3 17\nEPS Q3 17\nNet income\n$\n46.9\n$\n1.02\n$\n42.4\n$\n0.86\nSpecial items 1\n2.8\n0.06\n6.6\n0.13\nIncome tax effect related to special items 2\n(0.9)\n(0.02)\n(2.6)\n(0.05)\nSpecial items, net of taxes\n1.9\n0.04\n4.0\n0.08\nAdjustment for special tax items 3\n0.8\n0.02\n—\n—\nNet income excluding special items\n$\n49.6\n$\n1.08\n$\n46.4\n$\n0.94\n1\nSee footnote \"2\" to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for additional details on the composition of these amounts.\n2\nThe income tax effect related to special items is based on the statutory tax rate in effect at the end of each quarter presented. The tax rate used for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 is based on the tax rate stipulated by the Tax Act.\n3\nAmount primarily relates to deferred taxes pursuant to prior year tax return adjustments.\nTable 3: Reconciliation of Restaurant Operating Margin\nQ3 18 and Q3 17; $ millions\nRestaurant operating margin is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of financial performance. Restaurant operating margin is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance of ongoing restaurant-level operations. This non-GAAP measure is not indicative of overall company performance and profitability in that this measure does not directly accrue benefit to the shareholders due to the nature of costs excluded. We define restaurant operating margin as Company sales less Company restaurant expenses, including Cost of sales, Restaurant labor and Restaurant expenses. Restaurant expenses includes advertising expense. We believe this metric provides a more useful comparison between periods and enables investors to focus on the performance of restaurant-level operations by excluding revenues not related to food and beverage sales at company-owned restaurants, corporate General and administrative expense, Depreciation and amortization, and Other gains and charges.\nRestaurant operating margin excludes Franchise and other revenues which are earned primarily from franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams such as banquet service charges, digital entertainment revenues and gift card breakage. Depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, is excluded because such expense represents historical costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants. General and administrative expense includes primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of the restaurants and other activities at our corporate offices and is therefore excluded. We believe that excluding special items, included within Other gains and charges, from restaurant operating margin provides investors with a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant operating margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry.\nQ3 18\nQ3 17\nOperating income - GAAP\n$\n72.7\n$\n72.9\nOperating income as a percent of total revenue\n8.9%\n9.0%\nOperating income\n72.7\n72.9\nLess: Franchise and other revenue\n(22.0)\n(20.0)\nPlus: Depreciation and amortization\n37.6\n39.3\nGeneral and administrative\n36.6\n35.9\nOther gains and charges\n2.8\n6.6\nRestaurant operating margin - non-GAAP\n$\n127.7\n$\n134.7\nRestaurant operating margin as a percent of company sales\n16.1%\n17.0%\nTable 4: Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow\nQ3 18; $ millions\nBrinker believes presenting free cash flow provides a useful measure to evaluate the cash flow available for reinvestment after considering the capital requirements of our business operations.\nThirty-Nine Week\nPeriod Ended\nMar. 28, 2018\nCash flows provided by operating activities - GAAP\n$\n237.7\nCapital expenditures\n(69.5)\nFree cash flow - non-GAAP\n$\n168.2\nWebcast Information\nInvestors and interested parties are invited to listen to today's conference call, as management will provide further details of the quarter.
