    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE: WCG) (\"WellCare\") today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. As determined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income for 2018 was $101.7 million, or $2.25 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for 2018 was $111.8 million, or $2.47 per diluted share.\n\"We entered 2018 with strong momentum, and our 2018 first quarter results reflect continued strong execution,\" said Ken Burdick, WellCare's chief executive officer. \"All lines of business produced strong earnings results during the quarter. In addition, we are pleased that we were selected to continue serving Medicaid members in Florida, Arizona and Hawaii. As a result of our first quarter performance, we are revising our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $10.00 to $10.30.\"\nKey Metrics\n1Q18\n1Q17\nEarnings per diluted share (EPS) (GAAP)\n$2.25\n$1.50\nAdjusted EPS (1)\n$2.47\n$1.61\nNet income margin (GAAP)\n2.2%\n1.7%\nAdjusted net income margin (1)\n2.5%\n1.8%\nTotal Premium Revenue (GAAP) ($ millions)\n$4,626.3\n$3,947.0\nAdjusted Premium Revenue (1) ($ millions)\n$4,529.5\n$3,917.1\nSegment Premium Revenue ($ millions):\nMedicaid Health Plans (GAAP)\n$2,809.9\n$2,584.2\nAdjusted Medicaid Health Plans (1)\n$2,713.1\n$2,554.3\nMedicare Health Plans\n$1,556.5\n$1,094.7\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP)\n$259.9\n$268.1\nSegment Medical Benefits Ratios (MBR):\nMedicaid Health Plans (GAAP)\n86.3%\n89.4%\nAdjusted Medicaid Health Plans (1)\n89.4%\n90.5%\nMedicare Health Plans\n84.0%\n83.0%\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP)\n88.7%\n96.9%\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Ratio (GAAP)\n7.7%\n7.7%\nAdjusted SG&A Ratio (1)\n7.8%\n7.6%\n(1)\nRefer to the Basis of Presentation for a discussion of these adjusted (non-GAAP) financial measures\nKey Highlights\nGAAP and adjusted total premium revenue of $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion for 2018 increased 17.2 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. GAAP and adjusted Medicaid Health Plans premium revenue of $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion for 2018 increased 8.7 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. Medicare Health Plans premium revenue of $1.6 billion for 2018 increased 42.2 percent compared with 2017. GAAP and adjusted Medicaid Health Plans MBR for 2018 decreased 310 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively, compared with 2017. GAAP and adjusted net income margin for 2018 increased approximately 50 basis points to 2.2 percent and approximately 70 basis points to 2.5 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. On April 24, 2018, WellCare of Florida, Inc., a subsidiary of WellCare and known as Staywell Health Plan, received a Notice of Agency Decision from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that it intends to award Staywell a new five-year contract to provide managed care services to Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries, including Managed Medical Assistance and Long-Term Care in 10 of 11 regions and Serious Mental Illness Specialty Plan services statewide. The new Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program is expected to begin no earlier than October 1, 2018. As previously announced on March 13, 2018, Care1st Arizona, a subsidiary of WellCare, was selected to enter a contract with the state of Arizona's Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) to coordinate the provision of physical and behavioral services in the Central and North geographic service areas (GSAs). Services under the new contract are expected to begin on October 1, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, unregulated cash and investments were approximately $561.3 million.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nWellCare is increasing its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.00 to $10.30 from its previous guidance range of $9.55 to $9.85 per diluted share. Refer to the Appendix included in this news release for specific 2018 guidance metrics, related footnotes and basis of presentation.\nConsolidated Operations Results\nGAAP net income for 2018 was $101.7 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income of $67.3 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for 2017. Adjusted net income for 2018 was $111.8 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $72.0 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for 2017. The year-over-year increases in GAAP and adjusted net income are primarily the result of improved Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare PDP segment MBRs as well as the acquisition in 2017 of Universal American Corp. (\"Universal American\"). The year-over-year increases are also due to the effect of the lower federal effective tax rate, which was a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective January 1, 2018. The increases were partially offset by the return of the ACA Health Insurer Fee (HIF), which is nondeductible for tax purposes.\nGAAP net income margin for 2018 was 2.2 percent compared with 1.7 percent for 2017. Adjusted net income margin for 2018 was 2.5 percent compared with 1.8 percent for 2017.\nGAAP and adjusted total premium revenue of $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion for 2018 increased 17.2 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. The year-over-year increases in GAAP and adjusted total premium revenue were primarily the result of net organic growth and the company's acquisition of Universal American.\nGAAP SG&A expense was $355.9 million for 2018 compared with $302.4 million for 2017. Adjusted SG&A expense was $353.1 million for 2018 compared with $298.2 million for 2017. The year-over-year increases in GAAP and adjusted SG&A expense were primarily the result of the company's growth. The GAAP SG&A expense ratio of 7.7 percent in 2018 was flat compared with 2017. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 7.8 percent in 2018 compared with 7.6 percent in 2017.\nMedicaid Health Plans Segment Results\nMedicaid Health Plans membership was 2.7 million as of March 31, 2018, and increased by more than 82,000 members, or 3.1 percent, compared with March 31, 2017. The increase in membership was primarily driven by the addition of new members as a result of the 2017 statewide expansion of the Missouri Medicaid program and the 2017 acquisition of certain assets of Phoenix Health Plans. This increase was partially offset by membership declines in Georgia due to the addition of a fourth managed care organization, effective July 1, 2017. Sequentially, Medicaid membership at March 31, 2018 decreased slightly from December 31, 2017.\nGAAP and adjusted Medicaid Health Plans premium revenue was $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, for 2018, an increase of 8.7 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, compared with 2017. The increases in GAAP and adjusted premium revenue were primarily the result of the membership drivers discussed above. In addition, the reinstatement of the ACA HIF in 2018 and associated Medicaid ACA HIF reimbursement also contributed to the year-over-year increase in GAAP Medicaid premium revenue.\nThe GAAP Medicaid Health Plans MBR was 86.3 percent for 2018 compared with 89.4 percent for 2017. The adjusted Medicaid Health Plans MBR was 89.4 percent for 2018 compared with 90.5 percent for 2017. The decreases in GAAP and adjusted Medicaid Health Plans MBR were primarily the result of continued operational execution. In addition, the reinstatement of the Medicaid ACA HIF reimbursement in 2018 also contributed to the year-over-year decrease in the GAAP Medicaid Health Plan MBR.\nMedicare Health Plans Segment Results\nMedicare Health Plans membership was 506,000 members as of March 31, 2018 and increased by 150,000 members, or 42.1 percent, compared with March 31, 2017. The increase was a result of the company's 2017 acquisition of Universal American and organic growth.\nMedicare Health Plans premium revenue of $1.6 billion for 2018 increased 42.2 percent compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to the company's 2017 acquisition of Universal American as well as year-over-year organic membership growth.\nThe Medicare Health Plans MBR for 2018 was 84.0 percent compared with 83.0 percent for 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Universal American and the company's 2018 bid strategy.\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) Segment Results\nMedicare PDP membership was approximately 1.1 million as of March 31, 2018, and decreased by approximately 26,000 members, or 2.4 percent, compared with March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of the company's 2018 bid positioning.\nMedicare PDP premium revenue of $259.9 million for 2018 decreased by 3.1 percent compared with 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the company's 2018 bid positioning.\nThe Medicare PDP segment MBR for 2017 was 88.7 percent compared with 96.9 percent for 2017. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of continued operational execution and the company's 2018 bid strategy.\nOperating Cash Flow and Financial Condition\nNet cash generated by operating activities was $445.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with net cash generated by operating activities of $361.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, unregulated cash and investments were approximately $561.3 million compared with $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2017. Sequentially, unregulated cash and investment decreased $55.7 million from $617.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDays in claims payable (DCP) was 50.2 days as of March 31, 2018 compared with 46.2 days as of March 31, 2017 and 51.9 days as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA discussion of WellCare's first quarter 2018 results will be available via a conference call and live webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\nThe conference call will be webcast live from the company's website and will be available at the following link: https://services.choruscall.com/links/wcg180501.html .

(NYSE: WCG) focuses exclusively on providing government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. The company served approximately 4.3 million members nationwide as of March 31, 2018. For more information about WellCare, please visit the company's website at www.wellcare.com .\nBasis of Presentation\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn 2016, Universal American, a subsidiary of WellCare, completed the sale of its life insurance business while retaining ownership of the life insurance subsidiary. Universal American entered into a 100% quota-share reinsurance treaty with the buyer, which, among other treaties, resulted in the reinsurance of all of the life insurance policies underwritten by the retained subsidiary. Accordingly, the discontinued business did not materially affect WellCare's results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 19–Discontinued Operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results determined under GAAP, WellCare provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful in assessing the company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company has provided a reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings per share, net income and, as noted below, other specific operating and financial measures have been adjusted for the effect of certain expenses, and as appropriate, the related tax effect, related to previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs (\"investigation costs\"); amortization expense associated with acquisitions (\"acquisition-related amortization expenses\"); and certain one-time transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Universal American (\"transaction and integration costs\").\nAlthough the excluded items may recur, WellCare believes that by providing non-GAAP measures exclusive of these items, it facilitates period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity about events and trends affecting its core operating performance, as well as providing comparability to competitor results. The investigation costs are related to a discrete incident which management does not expect to reoccur. WellCare has adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expenses as these transactions do not directly relate to the servicing of products for our customers and are not directly related to the core performance of its business operations. The transaction and integrations costs are related to a specific 2017 event, which does not reflect the underlying ongoing performance of the business.\nIn addition, because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and the ACA HIF are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, the company excludes these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as the company believes that these components are not indicative of operating performance.\nThe company is not able to project at the time of this news release the amount of expenses associated with investigation costs, transaction and integration costs and, therefore, cannot reconcile projected non-GAAP measures affected by these items to projected GAAP measures.\nFollowing is a description of the adjustments made to GAAP measures used to calculate the non-GAAP measures used in this news release.\nAdjusted premium revenue (non-GAAP) = Total premium revenue (GAAP) less Medicaid premium taxes revenue and Medicaid reimbursements of the ACA HIF. The company's adjusted Medicaid Health Plans segment premium revenue uses this non-GAAP definition of adjusted premium revenue.\nMBR (GAAP) = medical benefits expense divided by total premium revenue (GAAP).\nAdjusted MBR (non-GAAP) = medical benefits expense divided by adjusted premium revenue. The company's adjusted Medicaid Health Plans segment MBR uses this non-GAAP definition of adjusted MBR.\nSG&A expense ratio (GAAP) = SG&A expense (GAAP) divided by total premium revenue (GAAP).\nAdjusted SG&A expense (non-GAAP) = SG&A expense (GAAP) less investigation costs and transaction and integration costs.\nAdjusted SG&A ratio (non-GAAP) = adjusted SG&A expense divided by adjusted premium revenue.\nAdjusted depreciation & amortization (non-GAAP) = depreciation & amortization expense (GAAP) less acquisition-related amortization expenses.\nAdjusted income before taxes (non-GAAP) = income before income taxes (GAAP) less investigation costs, acquisition-related amortization expenses, and transaction and integration costs.\nAdjusted income tax expense (non-GAAP) = income tax associated with the applicable adjusted income before taxes, based on the applicable effective income tax rate.\nAdjusted effective income tax rate (non-GAAP) = adjusted income tax expense divided by adjusted income before taxes.\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) = adjusted income before taxes less adjusted income tax expense.\nNet income margin (GAAP) = net income (GAAP) divided by total premium revenue (GAAP).\nAdjusted net income margin (non-GAAP) = adjusted net income divided by adjusted premium revenue.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (non-GAAP) = Adjusted net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking\" statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
