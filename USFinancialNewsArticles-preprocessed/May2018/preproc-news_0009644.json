Oil pumps are seen at sunset outside Vaudoy-en-Brie, near Paris, France April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery CLc1 was up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $68.68 a barrel by 0114 GMT, after settling up 47 cents on Monday.\nLondon Brent crude LCOc1 for new July delivery was up 11 cents at $74.80. The June contract expired on Monday, settling up 53 cents at $75.17.\nOil prices jumped on Monday, reversing earlier losses, after Netanyahu said Israel has evidence that Iran lied about its nuclear programme after signing the 2015 agreement with global powers. Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s accusations, calling them “propaganda”.\nTrump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on key oil-producer Iran that were lifted after the international agreement.\nOil prices rose to the highest since November, 2014 in late April, driven by concern over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows. Analysts said the market is extremely sensitive to any developments on the nuclear deal and sanctions.\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude production jumped 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.26 million bpd in February, the highest on record, the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday.\nTrade was quiet in Asia as many markets including China, India and Singapore were closed on Tuesday for public holidays.
