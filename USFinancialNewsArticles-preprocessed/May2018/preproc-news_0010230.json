Management is looking forward to seeing healthy growth of our new licensed games and expecting to have a long-term profitability.\nFirst Quarter Overview\nOperating revenue increased by $0.2 million or 6.5% in quarter-on-quarter comparison, mainly due to a new game launched in December 2017. Total assets amounted to $65.6 million,decreased from $66.4 million at the end of the last quarter, mainly due to the net loss incurred in this quarter.\nUnaudited Consolidated Financial Results\nGigaMedia Limited is a diversified provider of digital entertainment services. GigaMedia's digital entertainment service business FunTown develops and operates a suite of digital entertainments in Taiwan and Hong Kong, with focus on browser/mobile games and casual games. Unaudited consolidated results of GigaMedia are summarized in the table below.\nFor the First Quarter\nGIGAMEDIA 1Q1 8 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\n(unaudited, all figures in US$ thousands, except per share\namounts)\n1Q18\n4Q17\nChange\n(%)\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\n(%)\nRevenues\n2,160\n2,028\n6.5%\n2,160\n4,147\n(47.9)%\nGross Profit\n1,214\n1,007\n20.6%\n1,214\n2,282\n(46.8)%\nIncome (Loss ) from Operations\n(975)\n988\nNM\n(975)\n(429)\nNM\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to GigaMedia\n(853)\n1,070\nNM\n(853)\n(760)\nNM\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to\nGigaMedia, Diluted\n(0.08)\n0.10\nNM\n(0.08)\n(0.07)\nNM\nEBITDA (A)\n(1,104)\n(785)\nNM\n(1,104)\n(821)\nNM\nCash and Marketable Securities-Current\n62,111\n63,670\n(2.4)%\n62,111\n65,354\n(5.0)%\nNM= Not Meaningful\n(A) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is provided as a supplement to results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). (See, \"Use of Non-GAAP Measures,\" for more details.)\nFirst -Quarter Financial Results\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 6.5% quarter-on-quarter to $2.2 million from $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, but decreased by 47.9% year-over-year from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-on-quarter increase reflected the growth of the new licensed game launched in December 2017, while the year-over-year decrease was due to declined performance in the licensed games Dragon, which was newly launched in December 2016 and had dwindled from its peak in the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated gross profit increased 20.6% from $1.0 million to $1.2 million quarter-on-quarter, but decreased by 46.8% from $2.3 million to $1.2 million year-over-year. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. An increase by $2.2 million quarter-on-quarter and a decrease of $0.5 million from $2.7 million to $2.2 million year-over-year. The quarter-on-quarter change was mainly resulted from the reclassification from non-operating income of the ArcheAge income in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the increased marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 for the newly launched game Akaseka, while the year-over-year change was due to less marketing expenses in promoting Akaseka, compared to the marketing expenses for Dragon in the same period last year. Income (Loss) from operation of the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $1.0 million, reduced by approximately $2.0 million from an income of $1.0 million last quarter, mainly due to the reclassification of the ArcheAge income in the fourth quarter of 2017. An increase of loss by $0.5 million from a loss of $0.4 million was also seen in the year-over-year comparison. Net income (loss) of the first quarter of 2018 was a net loss of $0.9 million, deteriorated by approximately$1.9 million from a net income of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, mainly due to the reversal of income tax liabilities of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash and marketable securities-current at the first quarter-end of 2018 accounted for $62.0 million, decreased by $1.5 million from the fourth quarter-end of 2017.\nFinancial Position\nAs of March 31, 2018, GigaMedia had $62.6 million in cash and restricted cash, approximately $5.7 per share, compared to $65.9 million, or $6.0 per share, at the end of the first quarter of 2017. The decrease mostly reflected the net cash used in operating activities and the fully repayment of short-term debt, which amounted to $2.6 million as of a year ago.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect GigaMedia's expectations as of May 2, 2018. Given potential changes in economic conditions and consumer spending, the evolving nature of online games, and various other risk factors, including those discussed in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as referenced below, actual results may differ materially.\nGigaMedia CEO James Huang stated: \"We have launched one more female-oriented game 'Akaseka' in December 2017, which contributed stably. We will keep looking for more female-oriented games to enhance revenue stability healthy margin. And with smart spending on commercial advertisements to achieve high efficiency on marketing expense, improvements in revenues will accompany with operating profits of more robustness.\nManagement will continually search for high gross profit games to maintain a stable and increased level of profitability by introducing more quality games in the coming quarters.\nTo look over the past two years, the management has been clearing up assets, trying to keep more cash on hand. We are persistently and prudently searching for investment targets with high potentials to expand our business and drive higher return for our shareholders.\"\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement GigaMedia's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company uses the following measure defined as non-GAAP by the SEC: EBITDA. Management believes that EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a useful supplemental measure of performance because it excludes certain non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and that EBITDA is a measure of performance used by some investors, equity analysts and others to make informed investment decisions. EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure under GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning. Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of using EBITDA is that it does not include all items that impact the company's net income for the period. Reconciliations to the GAAP equivalents of the non-GAAP financial measures are provided on the attached unaudited financial statements.\nAbout the Numbers in This Release\nQuarterly results\nAll quarterly results referred to in the text, tables and attachments to this release are unaudited. The financial statements from which the financial results reported in this press release are derived have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, unless otherwise noted as \"non-GAAP,\" and are presented in U.S. dollars.\nQ&A\nFor Q&A regarding the first quarter 2018 performance upon the release, investors may send the questions via email to IR@gigamedia.com.tw , and the responses will be replied individually.\nAbout GigaMedia\nHeadquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, GigaMedia Limited (Singapore registration number: 199905474H) is a diversified provider of digital entertainment services.
