(NASDAQ:AMAT) today reported record revenue, operating profit and earnings per share in its second quarter ended April 29, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Results\nCompared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Applied grew net sales by 29 percent to $4.57 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company increased gross margin by 0.7 points to 45.8 percent, and grew operating income by 41 percent to $1.33 billion or 29.1 percent of net sales. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew 43 percent to $1.09.\nOn a non-GAAP adjusted basis, over the same period, the company increased gross margin by 0.4 points to 46.7 percent, grew operating income by 40 percent to $1.38 billion or 30.2 percent of net sales, and increased EPS by 54 percent to $1.22.\nThe company generated $611 million in cash from operations and returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends of $105 million.\n“Applied’s performance in the second fiscal quarter was another all-time record for the company, which demonstrates strong execution and customer pull for materials solutions that help accelerate roadmaps and bring new devices to market faster,” said Gary Dickerson, president and CEO. “Applied has the broadest opportunity across major technology trends, and our markets are strong, with long-term growth drivers firmly in place.”\nQuarterly Results Summary\nQ2 FY2018 Q2 FY2017 Change (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) Net sales $ 4,567 $ 3,546 29 % Gross margin 45.8 % 45.1 % 0.7 points Operating margin 29.1 % 26.5 % 2.6 points Net income $ 1,129 $ 824 37 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.09 $ 0.76 43 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Results Non-GAAP adjusted gross margin 46.7 % 46.3 % 0.4 points Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin 30.2 % 27.8 % 2.4 points Non-GAAP adjusted net income $ 1,273 $ 861 48 % Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS $ 1.22 $ 0.79 54 % A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in the financial tables included in this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures” section.\nBusiness Outlook\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Applied expects net sales to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.53 billion; the midpoint of the range would be an increase of approximately 18 percent, year over year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.21; the midpoint of the range would be an increase of approximately 36 percent, year over year.\nThis outlook for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of $0.05 per share and includes the normalized tax benefit of share-based compensation of $0.01 per share, but does not reflect any items that are unknown at this time, such as any additional charges related to acquisitions or other non-operational or unusual items, as well as other tax related items, which we are not able to predict without unreasonable efforts due to their inherent uncertainty.\nSecond Quarter Reportable Segment Information\nSemiconductor Systems Q2 FY2018 Q2 FY2017 (In millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 2,999 $ 2,404 Foundry 21 % 41 % DRAM 31 % 19 % Flash 37 % 33 % Logic and other 11 % 7 % Operating income 1,071 808 Operating margin 35.7 % 33.6 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Results Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 1,117 $ 854 Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin 37.2 % 35.5 %\nApplied Global Services Q2 FY2018 Q2 FY2017 (In millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 943 $ 724 Operating income 278 194 Operating margin 29.5 % 26.8 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Results Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 278 $ 195 Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin 29.5 % 26.9 %\nDisplay and Adjacent Markets Q2 FY2018 Q2 FY2017 (In millions, except percentages) Net sales $ 600 $ 391 Operating income 162 84 Operating margin 27.0 % 21.5 % Non-GAAP Adjusted Results Non-GAAP adjusted operating income $ 166 $ 84 Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin 27.7 % 21.5 % Use of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures\nApplied provides investors with certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, which are adjusted for the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; tax effect of share-based compensation; certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. Additionally, the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 non-GAAP results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with changes to recent U.S. tax legislation. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management, and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWebcast Information\nApplied Materials will discuss these results during an earnings call that begins at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. A live webcast will be available at www.appliedmaterials.com . A replay will be available on the website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and markets, industry outlooks and demand drivers, technology transitions, our business and financial performance and market share positions, our capital allocation, our investment and growth strategies, our development of new products and technologies, our business outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and other statements that are not historical facts.
