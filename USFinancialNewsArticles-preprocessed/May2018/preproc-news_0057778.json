(NYSE: EXPR), a specialty retail apparel company, announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2018. These results, which cover the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018, are compared to the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017. Comparable sales for the first quarter of 2018 were calculated using the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the 13-week period ended May 6, 2017.\nDavid Kornberg, the Company’s president and chief executive officer, stated: “Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our strategy and holistic approach to driving improved sales and profitability is working. Comparable sales grew for the first time since late 2015, and for the second consecutive quarter we expanded our gross margin and increased earnings relative to the prior year. We are making significant progress executing against our initiatives and the business is building momentum. E-commerce had another outstanding quarter, with comparable sales increasing 33%, on top of 27% growth achieved in the prior year period.”\nMr. Kornberg continued, “As we look to the balance of the year, we are focused on continuing to drive growth through important initiatives across product, brand, and customer experience. The initial customer reaction to our launch of extended sizes in stores has been positive and is driving customer acquisition and incremental business to the brand. We continue to see success from our expanded omni-channel capabilities and expect their contribution to our results to build as we move through the year. Our financial position remains strong with $185 million in cash at quarter end, no debt, and our inventories are well-positioned. Under our $150 million share repurchase program, we have repurchased $38 million, or 4.9 million shares to date, underscoring our confidence in the business and commitment to driving shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results:\nNet sales increased 1% to $479.4 million from $474.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) increased 1%, compared to a 10% decrease in the first quarter of 2017. E-commerce sales increased 35% year over year to $132.6 million. On a comparable sales basis, e-commerce sales increased 33%. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 29.9% of net sales compared to 27.9% in last year’s first quarter. The improvement was driven by a 90 basis point increase in merchandise margin and a 110 basis point decrease in buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $140.6 million versus $132.3 million in last year’s first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased by 140 basis points year over year to 29.3%. Operating income was $2.8 million. This compares to an operating loss of $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 includes a $6.3 million impact related to the exit of Canada. Income tax expense was $2.1 million, at an effective tax rate of 80.1%, compared to an income tax benefit of $4.8 million, at an effective tax rate of 64.5% in last year’s first quarter. The effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 include negative impacts from certain discrete items totaling $1.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Net income was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $2.7 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, net loss in the first quarter 2017 was $3.7 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share. Real estate activity for the first quarter of 2018 is presented in Schedule 5.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Balance Sheet Highlights:\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $184.5 million versus $191.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures totaled $7.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018, compared to $14.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017. Inventory was $277.5 million compared to $280.2 million at the end of the prior year’s first quarter.\nShare Repurchase Program:\nOn November 28, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorized the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock using available cash. Under this program, the Company repurchased 2.1 million common shares for $17.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2.2 million common shares for $15.6 million during the first quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, the Company has repurchased an additional 0.7 million shares for approximately $5 million and currently has approximately $112 million remaining under its authorization. The Company’s second quarter and full year 2018 guidance reflects share repurchases made to date, however does not contemplate any future share repurchases.\nRevenue Recognition:\nEffective February 4, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard (“ASC 606”) on a full retrospective basis. As a result, the condensed financial statements as of February 3, 2018 and for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017, have been recast. The adoption of ASC 606 did not change the timing of cash flows or cash available for return to shareholders but did change the timing of revenue recognition for certain revenue streams. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in changes in classifications of certain items within the Company’s financial statements. For additional information regarding the adjustments see Exhibit 99.3 to the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 14, 2018.\n2018 Guidance:\nThe Company notes that 2018 is a fifty-two week period as compared to a fifty-three week period in 2017. The fifty-third week was in the fourth quarter and contributed approximately $0.04 in diluted EPS in 2017. The table below compares the Company’s projected results for the thirteen week period ended August 4, 2018 to the actual results for the thirteen week period ended July 29, 2017.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance Second Quarter 2017\nActual Results\nComparable Sales -1% to 1% -4% Effective Tax Rate NM (1) 26.6% (2,4) Interest Expense, Net $0.1 million $0.7 million Net Income ($1.5) to $1.5 million ($11.9) million (2,3,4) Adjusted Net Income N/A $0.7 million (4,5) Diluted EPS ($0.02) to $0.02 ($0.15) (2,3,4) Adjusted Diluted EPS N/A $0.01 (4,5) Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 74.5 million 78.8 million (1) Not meaningful for the second quarter of 2018 due to the projected near break even pre-tax income.

Schedule 4\nSupplemental Information - Consolidated Statements of Income\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company supplements the reporting of its financial information determined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional useful information to assist stockholders in understanding its financial results and assessing its prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are important indicators of the Company’s business performance because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s underlying operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in the business. In addition, adjusted operating income is used as a performance measure in the Company’s seasonal cash incentive compensation program and adjusted diluted earnings per share is used as a performance measure in the Company’s executive compensation program for purposes of determining the number of equity awards that are ultimately earned. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating income, reported net income, or reported diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the below reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Management strongly encourages investors and stockholders to review the Company’s financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThirteen Weeks Ended April 29, 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Operating\nLoss\nNet Loss Diluted\nEarnings per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nDiluted Shares\nOutstanding\nReported GAAP Measure $ (6,730 ) $ (2,668 ) $ (0.03 ) 78,446 Impact of Canadian Exit 6,271 6,271 0.08 Income Tax Benefit - Canadian Exit — (7,297 ) (0.09 ) Adjusted Non-GAAP Measure $ (459 ) $ (3,694 ) $ (0.05 ) Thirteen Weeks Ended July 29, 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Operating\nLoss\nNet Loss Diluted\nEarnings per\nShare\nWeighted\nAverage\nDiluted Shares\nOutstanding\nReported GAAP Measure $ (16,028 ) $ (11,890 ) $ (0.15 ) 78,786 Impact of Canadian Exit (a) 17,622 17,622 0.22 Income Tax Benefit - Canadian Exit — (5,074 ) (0.06 ) Adjusted Non-GAAP Measure $ 1,594 $ 658 $ 0.01 78,810 (b) (a) Includes $16.3 million in restructuring costs and an additional $1.3 million in inventory adjustments related to the Canadian exit.
