It is up 26 bps this week, the biggest weekly rise since March 2017.\n“I suspect that the mini-BOT news is pushing prices a bit lower,” said DZ Bank strategist Andy Cossor.\nThe gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields - a closely watched indicator of relative risks - was at 151 basis points, having touched its widest levels since early January on Thursday at around 157 bps .\nA draft programme for a potential coalition government between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League earlier this week revealed plans to demand 250 billion euros of debt forgiveness and create procedures to allow countries to exit the euro, jolting markets.\nA 5-Star source said on Thursday the programme contained no reference to a possible exit from the euro or “anything that could cause any concern regarding Italy’s euro membership”.\nStill, the headlines this week have prompted investors to pay closer attention to Italian political risks.\nOn Thursday, the two parties agreed the basis for a governing accord that would slash taxes, ramp up welfare spending and pose the biggest challenge to the European Union since Britain voted to leave the bloc two years ago.\nWhile the Italian/German bond yield spread has widened it remains below peaks seen early last year when investors fretted about euro zone break up risks ahead of the French presidential election.\n“The more we think about it, and the more we speak to major investors in BTPs, the more we conclude that the violent spread widening earlier in the week was simply caused by a flush out of risk-averse periphery investors,” said Peter Chatwell, head of rates strategy at Mizuho.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
