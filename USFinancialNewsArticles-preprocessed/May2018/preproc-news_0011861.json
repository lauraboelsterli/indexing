    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 12:37 PM / Updated an hour ago Britain's Kew Gardens reopens vast glasshouse after extensive works Reuters Staff 1 With 15,000 new panes of glass, Britain’s Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew will reopen its famed Temperate House on Saturday after a five-year restoration that cost 41 million pounds ($56 million). A visitor cycles past the newly restored Victorian Temperate House which has been re-opened to the public following a five year restoration programme in Kew Gardens, London, Britain, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nMore than 69,000 items have been cleaned and replaced in the vast Grade I-listed building, billed as the world’s largest Victorian glasshouse and home to 10,000 plants, including some of the rarest from the world’s temperate regions.\nThe 4,880 square-meter glasshouse, built in 1860, had been in a state of disrepair, according to officials at the UNESCO World Heritage site which attracts more than one million visitors a year.
