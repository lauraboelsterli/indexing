Excluding the adjustment related to the change in fair value of the stock warrants, adjusted earnings per diluted common share (2) totaled 3 cents in both the current year quarter and the prior year quarter.\n\"Trends in virtually all of our revenue categories improved, and we are pleased with the positive momentum that we generated in the second quarter,\" said Kevin Mowbray, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Digital advertising revenue increased 2.7% and represented 31.9% of total advertising revenue for the quarter. This was driven by strong performance in digital retail and a 25.5% increase in programmatic advertising,\" said Mowbray.\n\"Subscription revenue increased 2.1% in the quarter through our premium content offerings and acquisitions in the prior year. Total revenue decreased 4.2% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter in 2017 and was down 6.3% on same-property basis,\" Mowbray said.\n\"Revenue at TownNews.com , excluding intercompany revenue, increased 17.0% in the quarter and over the last twelve months on a standalone basis, revenue totaled $17.3 million,\" Mowbray added. \" Townnews.com further strengthened its position as the leading multimedia content management platform through the acquisition of Field59, a producer of video management and streaming solutions. We are optimistic that the acquisition will accelerate top-line revenue growth at TownNews.com ,\" Mowbray said.\nMowbray also noted the following financial highlights for the quarter:\nDigital retail advertising, which represented 63% of total digital advertising in the March quarter, grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by advertising from local retailers.\nMonthly visits to Lee mobile, tablet, desktop and app sites averaged 77.5 million, an increase of 11.6% over the prior year quarter.\nTotal advertising and marketing services revenue decreased 7.7% in the quarter.\n\"Cash costs (2) in the quarter, excluding workforce adjustments and other, were down 3.5% compared to the prior year,\" said Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Ron Mayo. \"On a same property basis, cash costs excluding workforce adjustments and other were down 6.0%.\n\"For fiscal 2018, we expect cash cost excluding workforce adjustments and other, to decrease 6.0-6.5% on a same property basis,\" Mayo added.\n\"Our revenue and cost performance for the quarter resulted in maintaining our industry-leading margins, and we expect this to continue throughout fiscal year 2018.\n\"The company continues to aggressively reduce debt,\" Mayo added. \"Debt reduction in the March quarter was $15.6 million and totaled $68.6 million over the last twelve months. Interest expense decreased $1.4 million, or 9.3%, in the quarter and $5.5 million, or 9.1%, in the past twelve months.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA (2) over the last twelve months totaled $139.7 million. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA totaled $26.8 million compared to $28.8 million in the same quarter of the prior year. As of March 25, 2018, the principal amount of debt was $516.3 million,\" Mayo said.\n\"Leverage net of cash was 3.61 times Adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.89 times Adjusted EBITDA one year ago,\" he added.\nSECOND QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS\nOperating revenue for the 13 weeks ended March 25, 2018 totaled $127.8 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared with a year ago.

Digital advertising in the quarter represented 31.9% of total advertising revenue.\nTotal digital revenue, including digital advertising and digital services, was $26.7 million for the quarter, up 3.6% compared with a year ago and up 3.2% on a same property basis.

Average daily newspaper circulation, including TNI and MNI and digital subscribers, totaled 0.8 million in the 13 weeks ended March 25, 2018. Sunday circulation totaled 1.1 million. Price increases and additional revenue from premium content partially offset revenue lost from lower print circulation volumes.\nOther revenue, which consists of digital services, commercial printing, revenue from delivery of third party products, decreased 5.2% in the current year quarter. The decrease was due to volume declines in commercial printing and third party delivery and was partially offset by an increase in revenue at TownNews.com . Excluding intercompany revenue, revenue at TownNews.com , the majority of which is included in Other revenue, increased to $3.5 million, or 17.0% in the quarter. On a standalone basis, revenue at TownNews.com totaled $17.3 million for the last twelve months.\nOperating expenses for the 13 weeks ended March 25, 2018 decreased 3.6%. Cash costs, excluding workforce adjustments and other, decreased 3.5% compared to the prior year quarter and decreased 6.0% on a same property basis. Compensation decreased 9.4% on a same property basis, primarily as a result of a reduction in staffing levels. Newsprint and ink expense decreased 9.2% on a same property basis due to lower volumes from unit declines and using lower basis weight newsprint. Other operating expenses decreased 1.9% on a same property basis, primarily driven by lower delivery and other print-related costs and offset in part by higher costs associated with growing digital revenue and increases in other cash costs from outsourcing.\nWorkforce adjustment and other costs totaled $1.8 million and $2.4 million in the 2018 quarter and 2017 quarter, respectively.\nIncluding equity in earnings of associated companies, depreciation and amortization, gain on sales of assets, and workforce adjustments and other, operating income totaled $17.3 million in the current year quarter, compared with $18.8 million a year ago.\nIn the 13 weeks ended March 25, 2018, interest expense decreased 9.3%, or $1.4 million, due to lower debt balances.

Lee recognized $1.2 million of debt refinancing and administrative costs in the current quarter and $1.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The vast majority of the debt refinancing and administrative costs represent amortization of refinancing costs paid in 2014.\nIncome attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated for the quarter totaled $2.2 million, compared with income of $6.1 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $26.8 million.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS AND EPS FOR THE QUARTER\nThe following table summarizes the impact from warrant fair value adjustments on income attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and earnings per diluted common share.

Cash costs, excluding workforce adjustments and other, decreased 5.1% compared to the prior year and decreased 7.5% on a same property basis. Compensation decreased 9.6% on a same property basis, primarily as a result of a decrease in the average number of full-time equivalent employees of 12.5%. Newsprint and ink expense decreased 12.5%, due to a reduction in newsprint volume partially offset by higher prices. Other operating expenses decreased 4.6%.\nIncluding equity in earnings of associated companies, depreciation and amortization, gain on sales of assets, curtailment gains, as well as workforce adjustments and other in both years, operating income was $47.8 millions in 2018, compared with $50.2 millions a year ago.\nIn the 26 weeks ended March 25, 2018 interest expense decreased 9.0%, or $2.7 million, due to lower debt balances, and we recognized non-operating income of $0.1 million in 2018 compared to $7.4 million for the change in fair value of stock warrants in the prior year. The fair value of the warrants fluctuates with the market value of our common stock. In the current fiscal year, $2.3 million of debt financing and administrative costs were expensed compared to $2.0 million in the same period a year ago. Debt financing and administrative costs are mainly amortization of costs paid as part of our refinancing in 2014.\nIncome attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated for the year totaled $37.2 million, compared to income of $18.3 million a year ago.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the 26 weeks ended March 25, 2018 was $67.1 million, compared to $72.1 million for the 26 weeks ended March 25, 2018.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS AND EPS FOR THE YEAR TO DATE\nOn December 22, 2017, comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was signed into law. Among other provisions, the 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% in December 2017. The reduction of the corporate tax rate will cause us to adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%. The transitional impact from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a provisional net decrease in income tax expense of $24,872,000 in the 26 weeks ended March 25, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated impact from the 2017 Tax Act as well as the warrant fair value adjustments on income attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and earnings per diluted common share.\n26 Weeks Ended March 25\n2018 March 26\n2017 (Thousands of Dollars, Except Per Share Data) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Income attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated, as reported 37,242 0.67 18,301 0.33 Adjustments: Warrants fair value adjustment (124 ) (7,378 ) Income tax effect of adjustments, net (24,872 ) — (24,996 ) (0.45 ) (7,378 ) (0.13 ) Income attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated, as adjusted 12,246 0.22 10,923 0.20 DEBT AND FREE CASH FLOW\nDebt was reduced $15.6 million in the quarter and $68.6 million during the last twelve months.

The reader should refer to the Company's most recent reports on Form 10-Q and on Form 10-K for definitive information. (2 ) The following are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures for which reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures are included in tables accompanying this release: • Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that enhances financial statement users overall understanding of the operating performance of the Company. The measure isolates unusual, infrequent or non-cash transactions from the operating performance of the business. This allows users to easily compare operating performance among various fiscal periods and how management measures the performance of the business. This measure also provides users with a benchmark that can be used when forecasting future operating performance of the Company that excludes unusual, nonrecurring or one time transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the calculation used by stockholders and analysts to determine the value of our business when using the market approach, which applies a market multiple to financial metrics. It is also a measure used to calculate the leverage ratio of the Company, which is a key financial ratio monitored and used by the Company and its investors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus nonoperating expenses, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, loss (gain) on sale of assets, impairment charges, workforce adjustment and other costs, stock compensation and our 50% share of EBITDA from TNI and MNI, minus equity in earnings of TNI and MNI and curtailment gains.\n• Adjusted Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share are non-GAAP financial performance measures that we believe offer a useful metric to evaluate overall performance of the Company by providing financial statement users the operating performance of the Company on a per share basis excluding the impact of changes in the warrant valuation as well as unusual and infrequent transactions. It is defined as income (loss) attributable to Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and earnings (loss) per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of the warrant valuation and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.\n• Cash Costs is a non-GAAP financial performance measure of operating expenses that are settled in cash and is useful to investors in understanding the components of the Company’s cash operating costs. Generally, the Company provides forward-looking guidance of Cash Costs, which can be used by financial statement users to assess the Company's ability to manage and control its operating cost structure. Cash Costs is defined as compensation, newsprint and ink, other operating expenses. Depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, other non-cash operating expenses and other unusual and infrequent transactions are excluded. Cash Costs are also presented excluding workforce adjustments and other.\n• We also present revenue and certain operating expense trends on a Same Property basis which excludes the operating results of a weekly publication purchased in 2017 and the purchase of the Dispatch-Argus on June 30, 2017. Same Property results are useful to investors in understanding the revenue and operating expense trends excluding the impact of changes due to operations no longer owned by the Company.
