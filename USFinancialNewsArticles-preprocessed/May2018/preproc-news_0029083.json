National Election Committee (NEC) spokesman Dim Sovannarom attends a news conference in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Samrang Pring\nPrime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for 33 years, has waged a campaign against his critics, including the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which won the support of a new generation of voters disillusioned at what they see as the corruption and nepotism that have stalked politics.\nBut in November, the Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP and banned more than 100 of its politicians, after the government accused it of plotting to take power with the help of the United States.\nMembers of the opposition have called for a boycott of the July 29 vote but preparations are going ahead, with party registration ending on Monday.\n“Now, we have 20 political parties registered, this shows a multi-party democracy,” NEC spokesman Dim Sovannarom told a news briefing.

REUTERS/Samrang Pring\n“This is an opportunity for people, in every five years, to chose their leaders,” he added.\nThe NEC would take a week to consider the party registration applications, he said.\nAnalysts say that with the dissolution of the CNRP, Hun Sen will easily the July vote.\n“The strategy of decapitating and finally dissolving the opposition was designed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling party,” Cambodia-based political analyst Lao Mong Hay told Reuters.
