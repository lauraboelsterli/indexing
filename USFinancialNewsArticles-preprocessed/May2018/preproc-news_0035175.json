REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\nIt is also likely that a government including the League would look to replace the bank’s chief executive, Claudio Borghi told Reuters by telephone on Thursday.\n“The state won’t pull out of Monte dei Paschi, as I promised in the election campaign, and its mission will be redefined,” he said.\nLeaders of the far-right League and the 5-Star Movement (M5S), the two biggest parties after inconclusive elections in March, have been discussing a common policy agenda to form a coalition government to end 10 weeks of stalemate.\nShares in Monte dei Paschi, 68 percent owned by the state after last year’s bailout, fell sharply on Thursday after it emerged a League-M5S government would reassess the lender’s mission to serve the community.\nMonte dei Paschi is shutting down branches to meet profit goals under a restructuring plan agreed with EU authorities to clear the bailout.\nState support for a company can only be temporary based on European competition rules and Italy’s outgoing center-left government had repeatedly said it would look to get out of Monte dei Paschi as quickly as possible.\nUnder the bailout deal, Italy is due to exit the troubled lender in 2021 at the latest.\nBorghi said instead the new government would keep the bank under its control so that branches that were useful to small local communities could stay open.\nAnd a change at the helm was likely.\n“As with all the state-controlled companies we plan to proceed with a significant spoils system,” he said. “WE HAVE A PLAN”\nMarco Morelli, a former head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Italy who also worked at Monte dei Paschi until 2010, has held the reins at Monte dei Paschi since 2016.\nHe has steered the troubled lender through the tumultuous months of its bailout, returning it to a profit.\nAsked on Thursday about possible changes under a new government, Morelli said “the shareholders, and especially the most important one, are free to make all the decisions they deem opportune on governance.”\n“We have a plan ... which is the result of extended negotiations ... and we’re pressing ahead with that,” he said.\nMonte dei Paschi and the Italian authorities negotiated for months with Brussels to win approval for the 5.4 billion euro ($6.4 billion) capital injection and EU competition authorities monitor closely progress with the plan.\nAfter years of losses due to bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, the world’s oldest bank reported a net profit of 188 million euros in the first quarter.\n“The first quarter was a very, very relevant first step but there is a long road ahead,” Morelli said.
