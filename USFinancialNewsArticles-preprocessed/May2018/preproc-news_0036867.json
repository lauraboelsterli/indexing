Billings does not equate to statutory revenue. Adjusted operating profit represents the Group’s operating profit / (loss) adjusted for amortisation charges, share option charges and exceptional items. Cash earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“Cash EBITDA”) is defined as the Group’s operating profit/ (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortisation charges, any gain or loss on the sale of tangible and intangible assets, share option charges, unrealised foreign exchange differences and exceptional items, with billings replacing recognised revenue.
