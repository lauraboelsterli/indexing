Aziz Sheikh father of Sabika Aziz Sheikh, a Pakistani exchange student, who was killed with others when a gunman attacked Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, U.S., sits in an ambulance next to her coffin, wrapped in national flag, during a funeral in Karachi, Pakistan May 23, 2018. REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n“But due to bad luck in a country that accuses the world of terrorism, she became a victim of terrorism herself.”\nSheikh’s father, Aziz, said earlier the thought of school shootings had never crossed his mind when he sent Sabika to study in the United States.\n“Sabika’s case should become an example to change the gun laws,” Aziz Sheikh told Reuters. [L3N1SS2PQ] Slideshow (3 Images)\nSabika was part of the YES exchange programme funded by the U.S. State Department, which provides scholarships for students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend an academic year in the United States. She was due to return to Pakistan on June 9.\n“I have no words to express my feelings,” family friend Mohammad Ali said after the coffin arrived at the family home. “It is a great loss to Pakistan. She wanted to do a lot for this country.” Writing by Saad Sayeed; Editing by Nick Macfie",
