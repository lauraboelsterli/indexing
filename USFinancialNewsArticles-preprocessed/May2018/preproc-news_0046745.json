(NASDAQ:TRNS) (“Transcat” or the “Company”), a leading provider of accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services and value-added distributor of professional grade handheld test, measurement and control instrumentation, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). Transcat operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year, ending the last Saturday in March. In a 52-week fiscal year, each of the four quarters is a 13-week period. In a 53-week fiscal year (which occurs once every five or six years), the last quarter is a 14-week period. Fiscal 2018 consisted of 53 weeks while the fiscal year ended March 25, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”) consisted of 52 weeks.\n“Our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated solid performance in both of our segments as we achieved new records with more than $155 million in revenue and $5.9 million in net income. We are particularly pleased that we now have had 36 straight quarters, or nine years, of quarter-over-quarter growth in our Service segment revenue,” commented Lee D. Rudow, President and CEO. “We saw healthy demand in both segments. Strong execution in our Service segment helped us continue to take market share, especially in the targeted life science space, while our Distribution segment had growth across all channels.”\n“While we didn’t see the desired improvement in reported Service gross margin, key Service performance indicators continued to move in the right direction. On a consolidated basis, we generated higher operating income, operating margin and strong cash flow, reduced debt and funded longer-term productivity enhancement investments.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Review (Results compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017)\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q4 FY17 Q4 $'s % Service Revenue $ 21,955 $ 19,526 $ 2,429 12.4% Distribution Sales 20,497 18,927 1,570 8.3% Revenue $ 42,452 $ 38,453 $ 3,999 10.4% Gross Profit $ 10,895 $ 9,782 $ 1,113 11.4% Gross Margin 25.7% 25.4% Operating Income $ 3,503 $ 2,565 $ 938 36.6% Operating Margin 8.3% 6.7% Net Income $ 2,454 $ 1,429 $ 1,025 71.7% Net Margin 5.8% 3.7% Adjusted EBITDA* $ 5,310 $ 4,214 $ 1,096 26.0% Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 12.5% 11.0% *See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nTranscat achieved record quarterly revenue of $42.5 million, which includes the 53 rd week in fiscal 2018. Consolidated gross profit improved $1.1 million and gross margin increased 30 basis points. Total operating expenses were up only $0.2 million, or 2.4%. As a result, operating income increased nearly 37%, and operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 8.3%.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law. The Tax Act includes numerous changes in existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Tax Act contains other provisions that are not expected to materially impact the Company. As a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rates, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 25.2% compared with 39.0% in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased $0.13 to $0.33, of which $0.06 of the increase was due to the Tax Act.\nService segment continues to deliver organic growth\nRepresents the accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services business (52% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018).\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q4 FY17 Q4 $'s % Service Segment Revenue $ 21,955 $ 19,526 $ 2,429 12.4% Gross Profit $ 6,267 $ 5,864 $ 403 6.9% Gross Margin 28.5% 30.0% Operating Income $ 2,420 $ 1,993 $ 427 21.4% Operating Margin 11.0% 10.2% Adjusted EBITDA* $ 3,637 $ 3,170 $ 467 14.7% Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 16.6% 16.2% *See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nService revenue increased on all organic growth, and was comprised of new business from the life science market and growth in general industrial manufacturing, which includes both the defense and aerospace market. When normalizing for the extra days from fiscal 2018’s 53 weeks, the Company estimates that its fourth quarter Service revenue growth was approximately 6%.\nThe segment gross margin was negatively impacted by the mix of services performed during the quarter and some lab closures due to March snow storms in the Northeast. Segment operating expenses were down as a percent of segment revenue, which helped drive an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin.\nStrong sales and margins throughout the Distribution segment\nRepresents the sale and rental of new and used professional grade handheld test, measurement and control instrumentation (48% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018).\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 Q4 FY17 Q4 $'s % Distribution Segment Sales $ 20,497 $ 18,927 $ 1,570 8.3% Gross Profit $ 4,628 $ 3,918 $ 710 18.1% Gross Margin 22.6% 20.7% Operating Income $ 1,083 $ 572 $ 511 89.3% Operating Margin 5.3% 3.0% Adjusted EBITDA* $ 1,673 $ 1,044 $ 629 60.2% Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 8.2% 5.5% *See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nThe Distribution sales increase reflects higher rental revenue, which was up 67% to $1.0 million, and the additional week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The segment gross profit improved due to a mix of higher margin new product sales and increased rentals which have a higher margin profile. Segment operating expenses were down as a percent of segment sales, which combined with gross profit expansion helped drive a 230 basis point improvement in operating margin.\nFull-Year Fiscal 2018 Review (Results compared with fiscal 2017)\n($ in thousands) Change FY18 FY17 $'s % Service Revenue $ 77,445 $ 71,103 $ 6,342 8.9% Distribution Sales 77,696 72,795 4,901 6.7% Revenue $ 155,141 $ 143,898 $ 11,243 7.8% Gross Profit $ 37,441 $ 34,970 $ 2,471 7.1% Gross Margin 24.1% 24.3% Operating Income $ 9,026 $ 7,934 $ 1,092 13.8% Operating Margin 5.8% 5.5% Net Income $ 5,922 $ 4,522 $ 1,400 31.0% Net Margin 3.8% 3.1% Adjusted EBITDA* $ 16,368 $ 14,520 $ 1,848 12.7% Adjusted EBITDA* Margin 10.6% 10.1% *See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nTotal revenue increased to a record $155.1 million on all organic growth. When normalizing for the extra days from fiscal 2018’s 53 weeks, the Company estimates that its full year Service revenue growth was approximately 7%. The Distribution sales increase reflected $1.2 million more in rental revenue and increased demand from industrial customers.\nAs a percentage of total revenue, consolidated operating expenses were 18.3%, down 50 basis points. As a result, operating income increased $1.1 million, or 13.8%, to $9.0 million, or 5.8% of revenue.\nTranscat achieved record net income of $5.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.81, up $0.17, or 26.6%. Adjusted EBITDA improved 12.7% to $16.4 million and as a percent of total revenue was up 50 basis points to 10.6%. See Note 1 on page 5 for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for the Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Overview\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.9 million, up $2.3 million, or 30.9%. Capital expenditures were $5.9 million for fiscal 2018. Investments were primarily for assets for customer-driven expansion of Service segment capabilities, including mobile calibration fleet investments and RF/electronics assets for the aerospace/defense and life science markets, and purchases of rental business assets.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total debt of $22.9 million, with $21.3 million available under its secured revolving credit facility. Total debt at year-end was down $4.5 million from the prior year end. The Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in its credit agreement, was 1.40 at March 31, 2018, compared with 1.88 at fiscal 2017 year-end.\nOutlook\nMr. Rudow concluded, “We are pleased with the results we delivered for fiscal 2018. We continue to expect mid to high single-digit organic growth in our Service segment and believe we will continue to take market share, particularly within the life science space. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is strong, and continues to be an important element of our long-term growth strategy. We are building our business for the long term with investments in operational excellence and technology, both of which are designed to improve infrastructure to expand margins incrementally over time.\n“We think we have a great leadership team in place, are confident in our direction, and believe we have positioned Transcat to be successful for our shareholders.”\nTranscat expects its income tax rate to range between 25% and 27% in fiscal 2019. This rate includes Federal, various state, and Canadian income taxes.\nThe Company anticipates total capital expenditures to be approximately $7.0 million to $7.5 million in fiscal 2019, with the majority of the incremental capital expenditures in excess of fiscal 2018 spend levels planned for IT infrastructure investments to drive operational excellence and for growth-oriented opportunities within both of its operating segments. Maintenance/existing asset replacements are expected to be consistent with fiscal 2018 at approximately $1.0 million to $1.5 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nTranscat will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday, May 23, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Management will review the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, as well as the Company’s strategy and outlook.

The conference call can be accessed by calling (201) 689-8471.

The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, and stock-based compensation expense, which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is included. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating its business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. See the attached Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table on page 10.\nABOUT TRANSCAT\nTranscat, Inc. is a leading provider of accredited calibration, repair, inspection and laboratory instrument services.
