Money markets have whittled down the odds of an interest rate hike from the European Central Bank by June 2019 to 75 percent.\nThe Fed’s interest rate hikes may not pose as big a risk for global financial markets and emerging market economies as many have thought, the U.S. central bank’s chairman said on Tuesday, comments that the market widely saw as a sign that the Fed was unlikely to soften its policy stance.\nStill, overall moves were subdued in cautious trade as there was an undercurrent of caution evident in global markets after Trump’s decision injected fresh uncertainty, with the euro well on the back foot after falling to a late-December low and stock markets broadly mixed.\n“I would have expected a bit of a safe-haven bid this morning,” said Benjamin Schroeder, rates strategist at ING.\n“There is still an interim period before sanctions kick in. And other signatories and Iran want to keep the deal going so there is a period where things could be hammered out.”\nItalian bonds nursed losses after yields posted their second-biggest daily rise this year on Tuesday by 10 basis points. Benchmark ten-year Italian debt settled at a six-week high of 1.87 percent, up nearly one basis point on the day. (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Saikat Chatterjee Editing by Andrew Heavens)\n ",
