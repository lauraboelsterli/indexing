    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - China’s Ningbo Jifeng Auto Parts ( 603997.SS ) has made an approach to buy control of German rival Grammer ( GMMG.DE ) at a time when Chinese takeovers face increased scrutiny from European authorities eager to protect domestic know-how.\nNingbo Jifeng had already gained clearance from German authorities to build a 25.5 percent stake in Grammer, but wants to increase its holding. Following is a list of major bids by Chinese firms for all or part of German companies:\nBIOTEST ( BIOG_p.DE )\nBiotest, whose products are used to treat blood coagulationdisorders, auto-immune diseases and immune deficiencies, agreed in April 2017 to be taken over by Chinese investor Creat GroupCorp in a cash deal worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion).\nDAIMLER ( DAIGn.DE )\nGeely Chairman Li Shufu bought a $9 billion stake in German carmaker Daimler using banks, shell companies and derivatives, prompting questions in Berlin about the adequacy of German disclosure rules. The German markets regulator said Li’s approach breached disclosure rules.\nDEUTSCHE BANK ( DBKGn.DE )\nChinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] bought shares inDeutsche Bank in 2016 and became the top investor after a capital increase in 2017. This year HNA reduced its holding to7.9 percent from 10 percent.\nENERGY FROM WASTE Beijing Enterprise ( 0392.HK ) agreed in 2016 to buy Energy from Waste (EEW) from Swedish buyout group EQT in a deal valuing the German waste management firm at about 1.8 billion euros.\nHAUCK & AUFHAEUSER Fosun International ( 0656.HK ) agreed in 2016 to buy German private bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser for up to 210 million euros, in what was the first Chinese takeover of a German bank.\nISTA A consortium led by Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure ( 1038.HK ),part of Li Ka-shing’s empire, bought German metering and energy management group Is-a in 2017 from private equity fund CVC in a deal valued at up to 4.5 billion euros.\nKRAUSMAFFEI [KMGER.UL] A group of Chinese investors including China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL] agreed in 2016 to buyplastics processing machinery maker KraussMaffei Group GmbH for925 million euros from Canada’s Onex Corp.\nKION ( KGX.DE )\nWeichai Power ( 000338.SZ ) took a 25 percent stake in German for klift truck maker Kion in 2012. It has since graduallyincreased its stake and now holds about 43 percent.\nKUKA ( KU2G.DE )\nChinese home appliance maker Midea Group ( 000333.SZ ) made a bid in 2016 for Kuka, valuing the German factory robot manufacturer at about 4.5 billion euros. At the time, it was the most expensive offer by a Chinese investor to gain control of German industrial technology.\nMEERWIND China Three Gorges [CYTGP.UL], which operates the world’slargest hydropower plant on the Yangtze river, agreed in 2016 to buy German offshore wind park Meerwind from U.S. buyout firm Blackstone for an estimated 1.6 billion euros.\nOSRAM ( OSRn.DE )\nOsram agreed in 2016 to sell its biggest unit - now renamed LEDvance - to IDG Capital Partners, Chinese lighting company MLSCo ( 002745.SZ ) and financial investor Yiwu State-Owned AssetsOperation Center for more than 400 million euros.\nPUTZMEISTER Putzmeister was one of the first prominent mid-sized German engineering firms to sell out to the Chinese, when Sany Heavy Industry ( 600031.SS ) bought the concrete pump maker for $698million in 2012.\nCompiled by Edward Taylor; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
