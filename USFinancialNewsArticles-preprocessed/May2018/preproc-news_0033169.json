    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Altice USA, Inc. (“Altice USA”, NYSE: ATUS) today declared a one-time cash dividend of $2.035 per share of Altice USA Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The dividend is payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2018.\nOn January 8, 2018 Altice N.V. (“Altice NV”, Euronext: ATC, ATCB), the majority stockholder of Altice USA, announced that its Board of Directors had approved plans for the separation of Altice USA from Altice NV. Altice NV aims to complete the proposed transaction in June 2018 following receipt of regulatory approvals and Altice NV shareholder approval. The payment date for the one-time cash dividend Altice USA declared today will be two business days prior to the separation date. The specific dividend payment date will be announced when the separation date is established.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, Altice USA estimates that approximately 78.6% ($1.60) of the one-time cash dividend will be treated as a taxable dividend based on Altice USA’s estimated earnings and profits and the remaining 21.4% ($0.435) will be treated as a return of capital to stockholders, to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis in the shares, with any excess generally treated as a capital gain. These preliminary estimates are based on currently available information and are subject to change. Additional information about the tax treatment of the one-time cash dividend, including the actual amount treated as a taxable dividend, will be made available at the investor relations page of the Altice USA website, www.alticeusa.com . The actual amount treated as a taxable dividend to Altice USA stockholders may differ materially from these estimates due to finalization of Altice USA’s results and other developments that may arise between now and the time such information is required to be made available. The final determination of the actual amount treated as a taxable dividend and return of capital will be based on Altice USA’s 2018 full year earnings and profits which are expected to be finalized in January 2019.\nIf the Master Separation Agreement to be entered into by Altice NV and Altice USA in connection with the separation of Altice USA from Altice NV is terminated on or prior to the payment date of the dividend, the payment of the one-time cash dividend will not occur. Because the payment of the dividend is subject to a condition, as required by New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules, Altice USA’s Class A common stock will trade with “due-bills” representing an assignment of the right to receive the cash dividend beginning on May 21, 2018 (one business day prior to the record date) through the payment date and will not trade ex-dividend until the first business day after the payment date. Stockholders who sell their shares of Altice USA Class A common stock on or before the payment date will not be entitled to receive the cash dividend.\nDue-bills obligate a seller of shares of stock to deliver the dividend payable on such shares to the buyer. The due-bill obligations are settled customarily between the brokers representing the buyers and sellers of the stock. Altice USA has no obligation for either the amount of the due-bill or the processing of the due-bill. Buyers and sellers of Altice USA’s Class A common stock should consult their broker before trading in Altice USA’s Class A common stock to be sure they understand the effect of the NYSE’s due-bill procedures.\nThe aggregate cash dividend payment to holders of an odd number of shares of common stock of Altice USA will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking statements.
