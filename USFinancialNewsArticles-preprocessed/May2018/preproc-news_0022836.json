(NASDAQ:CUTR) (“Cutera” or the “Company”), a leading provider of laser and other energy-based aesthetic systems for practitioners worldwide, today reported financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nKey financial highlights for the first quarter 2018, when compared to the first quarter 2017, include:\nRevenue increased 16% to $34.1 million, due primarily to 31% system revenue growth in North America;\n-- Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for the truSculpt ® 3D and the successful launch of both the Juliet ™ and Secret ™ RF systems. Combined, these three systems accounted for over 35% of global sales in the first quarter;\n-- Global average selling prices of the Company’s core xeo ® and the excel ™ family of systems increased compared to first quarter 2017; and\n-- Products consumed in procedures using the truSculpt 3D , Juliet and Secret RF platforms, plus distributed skincare products, accounted for 6% of total sales in the first quarter. Recurring revenue, which includes these sales and Service revenue, accounted for 20% of total revenue in the first quarter. Gross Margin of 51% compared to 53% in the first quarter 2017 reflects a combination of factors, including elevated investment in our service organization and increased facility and warranty costs. The increase in service spend includes activities aimed at scaling our service organization with the goal of improving our customers’ productivity worldwide. Net Loss was $2.0 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share while non-GAAP* net loss was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per fully diluted share.\n“Our first quarter performance in North America was strong, as system revenue grew 31% over last year. Continued demand for truSculpt 3D and the launch of our Juliet and Secret RF systems drove our results,” stated President and CEO, James Reinstein. “The overall performance in international was weighed down by a temporary administrative regulatory issue in Japan. Now resolved, this issue impacted our ability to import units into Japan for part of Q1 and over-shadowed very strong growth in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. Net net, we still expect to achieve our full year revenue goal. While growth continues to drive our performance, we also continue to experience collateral ‘growing pains’ that reflect our focus on appropriately scaling our organization for the long term. Since I joined Cutera in early 2017, improving the Company’s infrastructure has been a top priority in order for the Company to sustain these impressive growth rates. We made significant progress in a short period of time and I expect continued improvements to be reflected in our financial results going forward. The overwhelming positive customer feedback we heard at the recent ASLMS conference supports what we are striving to accomplish at Cutera. Ultimately, we expect our efforts in scaling the Company to generate strong long-term shareholder value.”\nProduct Updates\nAt the recent American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) conference, Cutera launched its latest version of the enlighten ® system, enlighten ® SR . This system offers practitioners a solution to address both photodamaged and aging skin. Development and launch of our next generation truSculpt system remains on schedule and the Company will provide more details on its product pipeline, including this new offering and a general corporate update, at its analyst day later in 2018.\n2018 Outlook:\nWe reiterate our 2018 revenue guidance range of between $178 to $181 million, an 18% - 20% increase over 2017; Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 57% to 58%, as we continue to build our infrastructure to a scale appropriate to support our growth and our expanding customer base; Operating expenses are expected to remain consistent with 2017 levels in the range of 52% to 54% of revenue, as we continue to invest in product development and the scalability of our operations; Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.11 as compared to $0.93 for the full-year of 2017; and Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $15.0 to $17.0 million.\nPlease refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of items excluded from expected non-GAAP earnings.\nEffect on Net Revenue for the Adoption of ASC 606\nThe Company adopted the New Revenue Standard (“ASC 606”), on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method, which primarily impacted the Company’s recognition of commission costs. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment of $5 million to retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the period presented.\nConference Call\nThe conference call to discuss these results is scheduled to begin today at 1:30 p.m. PST (4:30 p.m. EST). Participating in the call will be James Reinstein, President and Chief Executive Officer and Sandra Gardiner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The call will be broadcast live over the Internet, hosted at the Investor Relations section of Cutera's website at http://www.cutera.com/ , and will be archived online within one hour of its completion through May 29, 2018.

From time to time in the future, there may be other items that we may exclude if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. We have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis due to the potential significant variability, limited visibility, unpredictability, or unique non-recurring nature of the excluded items.\nCompany management uses these measurements as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, on a regular basis and for benchmarking against other medical technology companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per diluted share exclude the following:\nNon-cash expenses for stock-based compensation. We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. We record non-cash compensation expense related to grants of options, performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of the grants, the non-cash compensation expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. We believe that excluding this item allows users of our financial statements to better review and assess both current, and historical results of operations. We also believe that excluding non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to our peer companies; and\nDepreciation and amortization. We have excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations. We continue to evaluate our business performance excluding non-cash charges and believe that excluding these items allows users of our financial statements to better review and assess both current, and historical results of operations.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this press release, other than purely historical information, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These statements include, but are not limited to, Cutera’s plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, product launches and performance, trends, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “seek,” “guidance,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “believe,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” “foresee” or variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current, preliminary expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause Cutera's actual results to differ materially from the statements contained herein. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, the Registration Statement on Form S-8 and other documents filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by Cutera.\nAll information in this press release is as of the date of its release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Cutera undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date they were made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
