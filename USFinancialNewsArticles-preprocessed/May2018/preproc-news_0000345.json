    "text": "NEW YORK, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nTour Revenues increased 31% to $82.4 million Net income available to common stockholders increased $10.2 million to $10.8 million Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.9 million to $22.2 million Lindblad segment Net Yield increased 12% to $1,127 and Occupancy increased to 91% Bookings in the first quarter of 2018 for future travel increased 20% Repurchased $0.9 million of stock and warrants\nLindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIND; the \"Company\" or \"Lindblad\"), a global provider of expedition cruises and adventure travel experiences, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSven-Olof Lindblad, President and Chief Executive Officer, said \"The strong financial results delivered by Lindblad during the first quarter are a continuation of the momentum we generated during the back half of 2017 and highlights the opportunity in front of us as we continue to add vessels to our fleet. The addition of the National Geographic Quest in July of 2017 expanded our capacity by approximately 15% and as we have increased inventory we have grown our net yields and maintained high occupancy levels. This highlights the demand from both our loyal customer base and a growing audience seeking authentic expedition travel. Bookings during 2018 remain very strong, up 20% versus the same period a year ago, and we are seeing broad based demand for travel on our existing fleet, as well as for the additional two ships we will be adding over the next couple of years. The National Geographic Venture and the recently named National Geographic Endurance will further increase our capacity in high demand geographies and will provide the opportunity to build additional shareholder value in the years ahead.\"\nFIRST QUARTER RESULTS\nTour Revenues\nFirst quarter tour revenues of $82.4 million increased $19.3 million, or 31%, as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by growth of $17.3 million at the Lindblad segment and a $2.0 million increase at Natural Habitat. Excluding the estimated $9.1 million impact from voyage cancellations in the first quarter of 2017, total Company revenue would have increased 14% versus the same period a year ago.\nLindblad segment tour revenue of $70.5 million increased $17.3 million, or 32%, compared to the first quarter a year ago primarily due to a 26% increase in Available Guest Nights, mostly from the launch of the National Geographic Quest in July 2017 and the impact of voyage cancellations for necessary repairs in the first quarter a year ago. The year on year growth also reflects a 12% increase in Net Yield to $1,127 due to increased pricing and changes in itineraries as well as an increase in Occupancy to 91% due to higher demand across the fleet. Excluding the estimated $9.1 million impact from the voyage cancellations in the first quarter of 2017, Lindblad segment revenue would have increased 13% versus the same period a year ago.\nNatural Habitat revenues of $12.0 million increased $2.0 million, or 20%, compared to the first quarter a year ago due primarily to higher ticket revenue from additional departures and increased pricing.\nNet Income\nNet income available to common stockholders for the first quarter was $10.8 million, $0.24 per diluted share, as compared with net income available to common stockholders of $0.6 million, $0.01 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The $10.2 million increase is primarily due to the higher operating results and $3.3 million of lower stock-based compensation expense in the current year partially offset by $1.9 million of increased tax expense, $1.3 million of higher depreciation and amortization due primarily to the addition of the National Geographic Quest to the fleet in July 2017 and costs of $1.0 million related to refinancing the Company's credit facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $22.2 million increased $11.9 million, or 116%, as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by growth of $11.0 million at the Lindblad segment and a $0.9 million increase at Natural Habitat. Excluding the estimated $6.5 million impact from the voyage cancellations in the first quarter of 2017, total Company Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 33% versus the same period a year ago.\nLindblad segment Adjusted EBITDA of $20.9 million increased $11.0 million, or 112%, as compared to the first quarter a year ago as the increased tour revenues and lower charter costs, due mostly to a planned reduction in Cuba itineraries, were partially offset by operating costs on the National Geographic Quest. The first quarter of 2018 also included higher operating expenses due to the cancelled voyages in the prior year as well as higher commission expense related to the revenue growth and increased personnel costs. Excluding the estimated $6.5 million impact from the voyage cancellations in the first quarter of 2017, Lindblad segment Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 28% versus the same period a year ago.\nNatural Habitat Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million increased $0.9 million compared to the first quarter a year ago as the revenue growth was partially offset by increased personnel and marketing costs to drive long-term growth initiatives.\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nChange\n%\nTour revenues:\nLindblad\n$ 70,453\n$ 53,202\n$ 17,251\n32%\nNatural Habitat\n11,957\n9,926\n2,031\n20%\nTotal tour revenues\n82,410\n63,128\n19,282\n31%\nImpact of voyage cancellations\n-\n9,140\n(9,140)\nNA\nTotal tour revenues\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ 82,410\n$ 72,268\n$ 10,142\n14%\nOperating income:\nLindblad\n$ 13,439\n$ 1,266\n$ 12,173\nNM\nNatural Habitat\n932\n99\n833\nNM\nTotal operating income\n14,371\n1,365\n13,006\nNM\nImpact of voyage cancellations\n-\n6,464\n(6,464)\nNA\nTotal operating income\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ 14,371\n$ 7,829\n$ 6,542\n84%\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nLindblad\n$ 20,889\n$ 9,842\n$ 11,047\n112%\nNatural Habitat\n1,293\n422\n871\nNM\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\n22,182\n10,264\n11,918\n116%\nImpact of voyage cancellations\n-\n6,464\n(6,464)\nNA\nTotal adjusted EBITDA\nexcluding voyage cancellations\n$ 22,182\n$ 16,728\n$ 5,454\n33%\nThe impact of the cancelled voyages in the prior year on tour revenues was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds. The impact of the cancelled voyages on operating income and Adjusted EBITDA was calculated as booked tour revenue at the time of cancellation less insurance proceeds and estimated operating costs.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $97.3 million as of March 31, 2018, as compared with $96.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase primarily reflects $10.5 million in net cash provided by operating activities due to the improved operating performance and $18.0 million in net cash provided by financing activities primarily due to the increase in long-term debt associated with refinancing our credit facility. These increases were mostly offset by purchases of property and equipment of $14.5 million, primarily related to the construction of two new vessels, and a $13.2 million increase in restricted cash related to higher deposits for travel on the Company's U.S. flagged vessels.\nFree cash flow use was $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared with $20.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, the $16.1 million improvement is primarily due to the strong operating performance and lower capital expenditures for the construction of new vessels. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement to make available, at the Company's option, a loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $107.7 million for providing financing for up to 80% of the purchase price of the Company's new expedition ice-class vessel, the National Geographic Endurance. At the Company's election, the loan will bear interest either at a fixed interest rate effectively equal to 5.78% or a floating interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00% per annum.\nOn March 27, 2018, the Company refinanced its existing senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility. The new $200 million, seven-year, senior secured term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%, with a potential step down to LIBOR plus 3.25% depending on the Company's credit rating. The new $45 million, five-year, revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.00%. The pricing of the new term loan and revolving credit facility reflects a one percentage point rate reduction compared to the prior $175 million term loan facility and $45 million revolving credit facility. Additionally, the covenants in the new facility were modified to provide the Company with additional strategic and operational flexibility. The proceeds from the new term loan were utilized to pay down the Company's existing term loan with the remaining additional proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.\nLINDBLAD FLEET ACTIVITIES\nThe Company expanded its travel offerings in July 2017 with the launch of the National Geographic Quest, which sailed in Alaska and British Columbia during the summer before voyaging to Costa Rica and Panama for the winter season. The Company's second new-build coastal vessel, the National Geographic Venture, is currently expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe Company is also building a polar ice class vessel, the National Geographic Endurance, for delivery in January 2020. This state-of-the-art vessel will join the National Geographic Explorer and the National Geographic Orion as the third polar ice class vessel in the Lindblad National Geographic fleet, with the ability to voyage anywhere around the globe and specializing in polar travel. The vessel will be capable of exploring deep into the Antarctic and Arctic waters and will be built with the Ulstein X-BOW® design allowing for greater comfort and speed through rough waters. The ship-building contract for the National Geographic Endurance also includes options to build two additional polar ice class vessels.\nSTOCK AND WARRANT REPURCHASE PLAN\nPursuant to its existing $35 million stock and warrant repurchase plan, during the first quarter the Company repurchased 568,446 warrants for $0.8 million at an average price of $1.35 and 9,030 shares of common stock for $0.1 million at an average price of $8.98. As of April 30, 2018, the Company had repurchased 6.0 million warrants and 864,806 shares under the plan for a total of $22.9 million and had $12.1 million remaining under the plan. As of April 30, 2018, there were 45.8 million shares common stock and 10.1 million warrants outstanding.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nThe Company's current expectations for the full year 2018 are as follows:\nTour revenues of $308 - $315 million (16 – 18% growth) Adjusted EBITDA of $54 - $57 million (24 – 31% growth)\nAs of April 30, 2018, the Lindblad segment had 94% of full year 2018 projected guest ticket revenues on the books versus 93% of full year 2017 revenue at the same time last year. The Company also continues to anticipate it will achieve its long-range revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company uses a variety of operational and financial metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Occupancy, Net Yields and Net Cruise Costs, to enable it to analyze its performance and financial condition. The Company utilizes these financial measures to manage its business on a day-to-day basis and believes that they are the most relevant measures of performance. Some of these measures are commonly used in the cruise and tourism industry to evaluate performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to assess revenue and cost performance, in addition to the standard GAAP-based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies within the industry.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP are included in the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 10.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 3, 2018 to discuss the earnings of the Company.

Other supplemental adjustments include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, executive severance costs, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses, debt refinancing fees and acquisition-related expenses. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense, and other operating income and expense. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA helps provide a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of the Company's financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as unearned passenger revenues, capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. The Company's use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry.\nThe following metrics apply to the Lindblad segment:\nAdjusted Net Cruise Cost represents Net Cruise Cost adjusted for Non-GAAP other supplemental adjustments which include certain non-operating items such as stock-based compensation, the National Geographic fee amortization, merger-related expenses and acquisition-related expenses.\nAvailable Guest Nights is a measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin) multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period. The Company also records the number of guest nights available on its limited land programs in this definition.\nGross Cruise Cost represents the sum of cost of tours plus merger-related expenses, selling and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense.\nGross Yield represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds divided by Available Guest Nights.\nGuest Nights Sold represents the number of guests carried for the period multiplied by the number of nights sailed within the period.\nMaximum Guests is a measure of capacity and represents the maximum number of guests in a period and is based on double occupancy per cabin (except single occupancy for a single capacity cabin).\nNet Cruise Cost represents Gross Cruise Cost excluding commissions and certain other direct costs of guest ticket revenues and other tour revenues.\nNet Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel represents Net Cruise Cost excluding fuel costs.\nNet Revenue represents tour revenues less insurance proceeds, commissions and direct costs of other tour revenues.\nNet Yield represents Net Revenue divided by Available Guest Nights.\nNumber of Guests represents the number of guests that travel with the Company in a period.\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing Guest Nights Sold by Available Guest Nights.\nVoyages represent the number of ship expeditions completed during the period.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lindblad-expeditions-holdings-inc-reports-2018-first-quarter-financial-results-300641768.html\nSOURCE Lindblad Expeditions Holdings, Inc.",
