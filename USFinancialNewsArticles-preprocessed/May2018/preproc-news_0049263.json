    "text": "BRASILIA, May 22 (Reuters) - Brazil on Tuesday scrapped a forecast for 12.2 billion reais ($3.3 billion) worth of revenues from the privatization of power utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA from the 2018 budget, citing a lower likelihood that those funds materialize this year.\nIn a news conference, Planning Minister Esteves Colnago said the privatization of Eletrobras, as the utility is known, is still a priority but there is a growing risk that those revenues will only be booked at the start of next year.\n$1 = 3.65 reais Reporting by Marcela Ayres; Writing by Bruno Federowski\n ",
