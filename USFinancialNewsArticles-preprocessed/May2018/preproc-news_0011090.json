(NASDAQ: HMTV) (“Hemisphere” or the “Company”), the only publicly traded pure-play U.S. media company targeting the high growth U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets with leading broadcast and cable television and digital content platforms, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Hemisphere, Alan Sokol, said, “Our first quarter results reflect continued progress in Puerto Rico’s recovery. We have begun to see signs of normalization across the island that give us confidence for the future, as vital services are now available to virtually the entire island and electricity has been restored to 98% of homes. While we expect that there will be some volatility to the recovery efforts, we anticipate continued progress through the remainder of the year.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, on a year-over-year basis, Hemisphere’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 27%, due to the continued disruption caused by Hurricane Maria. Nonetheless, as compared to the fourth quarter, both advertising revenue and retransmission fees grew significantly and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 54%, despite the first quarter typically being our seasonally weakest. This reflects the improvement in conditions in Puerto Rico, as well as our continued effective execution, notwithstanding the challenging environment.\nOur business outside of Puerto Rico continues to perform well, with continued organic subscriber growth, once again highlighting the unique growth paradigm of our U.S. networks. In addition, we drove significant U.S. advertising revenue increases in the first quarter, led by robust growth at Cinelatino and WAPA America.\nOur strategic investments are also off to a solid start in 2018. Pantaya, our OTT platform remains one of the top downloaded entertainment apps on iOS and Android, while Canal 1, the #3 rated national broadcast network in Colombia, continues to grow ratings and audience share with its differentiated news and content offering.”\nAs of midnight, May 4, 2018, the Company has reached an impasse in negotiations with DIRECTV in Puerto Rico regarding its retransmission consent agreement. As a result, WAPA is currently not being broadcast in Puerto Rico to DIRECTV customers. The Company has engaged in extended negotiations with DIRECTV, but does not believe that DIRECTV is properly valuing WAPA and WAPA Deportes’ extraordinary lineup of news, sports and entertainment programming. Recently, the Company successfully signed a new retransmission consent agreement with another large pay television distributor in Puerto Rico, which is now paying fair market value for WAPA’s programming. The Company is hopeful that DIRECTV will follow suit and that the blackout will be short-lived.\nHemisphere Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Acquire 75% Interest in Snap TV\nHemisphere today announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire a 75% interest in Snap Global, LLC (“Snap TV”), a leading independent distributor of content to broadcast, pay TV and OTT platforms in Latin America. As part of the investment, the Company has also signed a co-production joint venture with Mar Vista Entertainment, an established independent film and TV production company and minority owner of Snap TV, to co-produce new original movies and series. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nSnap TV distributes third party content to major free and pay TV broadcasters and OTT platforms serving Latin America and other Spanish speaking markets. Snap TV has also co-produced successful series for NatGeo and History Channel in Latin America, and together with Mar Vista, has produced movies in Latin America. Snap TV will be based in Hemisphere’s Miami headquarters.\n“We are thrilled to be acquiring a majority interest in Snap TV,” continued Sokol. “Snap TV is one of the fastest growing and most innovative content distribution companies in Latin America. Content distribution is an important strategic asset, and we are confident that our resources and combined expertise will accelerate Snap’s growth and position it as the leading independent distributor of Hispanic content. Our partnership with Mar Vista will facilitate expansion of our original production strategy, and provide us with world-class content that we can exploit on our networks and platforms and syndicate to existing and emerging platforms.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nNet revenues were $29.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net revenues of $34.2 million for the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was due to a $4.7 million decline in advertising revenue, driven by the continued impact of Hurricane Maria, particularly the widespread loss of power, the restoration of which continued during the period. Additionally, in 2017, the Company benefited from advertising sales for the World Baseball Classic televised on WAPA, which did not occur in 2018. The decrease in net revenues in the period was also due to a $1.0 million, or 5%, decline in subscriber and retransmission fees as a result of the interruption caused by Hurricane Maria on subscriptions of pay television distributors in Puerto Rico, as well as the termination of carriage of Television Dominicana by AT&T in September 2017. This decline was partially offset by rate increases and organic growth in U.S. cable network subscribers. Other revenues increased $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to the timing and availability of content licensed to third parties.\nOperating expenses were $24.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to operating expenses of $27.1 million for the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to lower programming and production costs, as WAPA implemented cost savings measures following Hurricane Maria, offset in part by incremental Hurricane Maria related expenses of $0.5 million. Additionally, transaction expenses were lower, primarily due to fees incurred in the prior year period in connection with the refinancing of the Company’s Term Loan.\nNet loss was $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net income of $2.7 million in the comparable period in 2017. The decline in net income was due to lower revenues as a result of the impact of Hurricane Maria and loss on equity investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $14.5 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $209.1 million in debt and $107.4 million of cash. The Company’s leverage ratio was approximately 4.4 times, and net leverage ratio was approximately 2.2 times.\nAs previously announced, the Company implemented a share repurchase plan during the third quarter of 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 3,225 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $10.50, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $34,000.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company funded $14.8 million in investments towards its strategic ventures, primarily related to Canal 1.\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as select financial data as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nHEMISPHERE MEDIA GROUP, INC.\nComparison of Consolidated Operating Results\n(amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Unaudited) Net revenues $ 29,035 $ 34,191 Operating Expenses: Cost of revenues 9,427 10,541 Selling, general and administrative 10,584 10,228 Depreciation and amortization 3,997 4,115 Other expenses 233 2,250 Gain on disposition of assets (3 ) - Total operating expenses 24,238 27,134 Operating income 4,797 7,057 Other expense: Interest expense, net (2,884 ) (2,628 ) Loss on equity investments (9,795 ) - Total other expense (12,679 ) (2,628 ) (Loss) income before income taxes (7,882 ) 4,429 Income tax benefit (expense) 323 (1,684 ) Net (loss) income $ (7,559 ) $ 2,745 Reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income $ (7,559 ) $ 2,745 Add (Deduct): Income tax (benefit) expense (323 ) 1,684 Other expense 12,679 2,628 Gain on disposition of assets (3 ) - Transaction and non-recurring expenses 239 2,278 Hurricane related expenses 536 - Depreciation and amortization 3,997 4,115 Stock-based compensation 996 1,070 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,562 $ 14,520 Selected Financial Data :\n(amounts in thousands)\nAs of As of March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (Unaudited) (Audited) Cash $107,377 $124,299 Debt (a) $209,081 $211,214 Leverage ratio (b): 4.4x 4.1x Net leverage ratio (c): 2.2x 1.7x (a) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the debt.\n(b) Represents gross debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months.

When presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Hemisphere’s management adds back (deducts) from net income or net loss, if any, depreciation expense, amortization of intangibles, gain on disposition of assets, transaction and non-recurring expenses including hurricane related expenses, income tax (benefit) expense, interest expense, stock-based compensation, and other expense items. The specific reasons why Hemisphere’s management believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding Hemisphere’s financial condition, results of its operations and cash flows has been provided in the Form 8-K filed in connection with this press release. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found above in the table that sets forth Hemisphere’s financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nConference Call\nHemisphere will conduct a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 10:00 AM ET on Friday, May 4, 2018.
