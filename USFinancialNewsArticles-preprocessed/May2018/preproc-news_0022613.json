The pitch, the pace, even all the pauses that convey meaning â€” you want to get all that right,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote speech on Tuesday at the company's annual I/O developer conference.\nThe first voices will be released immediately, with John Legend's voice coming later this year.\nFollowing the announcement, Chrissy Teigen, Legend's model wife, tweeted the news.\n@ChrissyTeigen tweet\n\"I don't even need human John anymore,\" she joked on the social media platform.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai spoke at the company's annual I/O developer conference. Watch the live stream of Pichai's keynote here .\nThe three-day I/O event is typically an opportunity for Google to show off its artificial intelligence tools and announce upcoming products, like the latest version of its Android operating system.\nThis year the conference comes amid broader policy discussions, as Google prepares to roll out privacy changes in compliance with stricter GDPR standards out of Europe.\nshow chapters The $80 billion reason John Legend is backing start-ups led by former inmates 6:54 PM ET Thu, 29 March 2018 | 00:58",
