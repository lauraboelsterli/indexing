CPSC's work to ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household chemicals – contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.\nFederal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the Commission.\nFor more lifesaving information, follow us on Facebook , Instagram @USCPSC and Twitter @USCPSC or sign up to receive our e-mail alerts.
