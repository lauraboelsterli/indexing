    "text": "0 COMMENTS A cashier scans a customers purchases at a Home Depot Inc. store in New York, U.S., on Friday, May 11, 2018. Photo: Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg\nHome Depot Inc. already has shrugged off the negative impact this year’s prolonged winter had on the retailer’s first quarter sales, said Carol Tomé, finance chief of the Atlanta-based company.\nComparable store sales, which tracks performance of stores and websites that have been operating for more than a year, fell short of analysts’ expectations at 4.2% in the first quarter vs the 5.4% increase analysts expected, according to data from FactSet. Unusually cold weather in March and April took a toll on Home Depot’s sales of gardening supplies, but the rest of the retailer’s business performed ahead of expectation during the quarter, Ms. Tomé said.\n“The whole company now is double-digit positive, our growth is double digit over last year,” Ms. Tomé told CFO Journal, referring to an uptick in revenue in recent weeks.\nHome Depot posted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.4 billion, up from $2 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 4.4% to nearly $25 billion from the comparable quarter of 2017. The retailer’s fiscal first quarter concluded at the end of April.\nThe world’s largest home-improvement chain also rolled out a new online shopping feature during the first fiscal quarter that allows customers to add installation services to online orders. For example, a customer looking for a kitchen faucet online can now arrange and pay for the installation of that faucet as part of the same online shopping experience.\nThe feature is part of the company’s effort to create an interconnected shopping experience for its customers, Ms. Tomé said. The retailer has earmarked $1 billion of its $2.5 billion in 2018 capital spending for such “interconnection” improvements, she said.\n“It’s one Home Depot and we want to give a similar experience regardless of the channel that you chose to shop,” Ms. Tomé said.\nAnother aspect of that effort is Home Depot’s plan to hire around 1,500 new technology employees by year end. Each of those employees will be allocated to a project with certain return criteria to track the performance of the investment, Ms. Tomé said.\nStill, as CFO, Ms. Tomé said she had to look beyond the numbers to resolve the logistics of such a large hiring drive.\n“As CFO I had to decide where all those people are going to sit,” Ms. Tomé said. Home Depot is headquartered in Atlanta and has a technical facility in Austin, Texas.\n“I had to work with business leaders to explain that some of their people weren’t going to be here in Georgia, they’re going to be in that facility in Austin,” she said, adding that balancing resource allocation and logistical challenge is part of her remit. “People have to have a place to sit and a place to park,” she added.\nShare this: CAPEX CAPITAL SPENDING EARNINGS Previous Germany’s Merck Breaks Down Currency Impact ",
