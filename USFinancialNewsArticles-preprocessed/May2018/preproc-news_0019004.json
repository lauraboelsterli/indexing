    "text": "Katie Kramer | CNBC Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company.\nWalt Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC on Tuesday that he remains \"confident\" the deal with Twenty-First Century Fox will move forward.\nDisney's $52 billion bid for Fox was announced in December. On Monday, sources told CNBC that Comcast is planning a $60 billion all-cash bid to acquire Fox's assets if the U.S. government approves AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.\n\"We made a good deal, actually a deal that shareholders reacted quite favorably to and we're going to remain confident in our ability to close,\" Iger told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on \" Closing Bell .\"\nWhen asked specifically about the Comcast plan, Iger said he wouldn't speculate on what the company may do or why it was doing it. He also wouldn't comment on Comcast's plan to offer cash, versus Disney's payment with stock.\nHowever, Iger pointed out that Disney's offer received unanimous approval by the Fox board.\n\"They obviously believed not only in what we were paying but how we were paying for it,\" he said.\nâ€” CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.
