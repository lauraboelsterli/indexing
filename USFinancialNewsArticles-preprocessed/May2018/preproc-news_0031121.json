    "text": "20 Mins Ago | 00:49\nWhen Fox announced Thursday that the police comedy \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" was canceled, actress Stephanie Beatriz started planning for the worst.\n\"Essentially, we had lost our jobs for a moment,\" Beatriz, who plays an officer named Rosa on the five-season show, tells CNBC Make It .\nShe began asking herself, \"What can I cut out of my monthly budget that isn't necessary? What can I shed?\" Beatriz says. \"That was the initial thing.\" FOX | Getty Images Stephanie Beatriz in the Return to Skyfire episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine\nThen, late on Friday May 11, NBC agreed to pick up the series for a 13-episode sixth season.\n\"We're all thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and best-cast comedies in a long time will take its place in our comedy lineup,\" Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement reported by The New York Times .\nFor Beatriz, that was a reason to splurge.\n\"When we got the pick-up, I went and got my nails done,\" she says. \"They were $200.\"\nThe nail artist went to Beatriz's house and crafted a pink and gold glitter mani, which Beatriz showed off Monday at NBC's Upfront presentations. CNBC Brooklyn Nine-Nine actress Stephanie Beatriz shows her manicure.\n\"I would never do that on a regular basis, but because we had just gotten the pick-up, it was like a gift to myself,\" Beatriz adds. \"Some people go to fancy dinners, I get my nails done.\"\nBeatriz's Instagram page shows other luxury looks.\nWhile researching her role as Rosa — a tough, no nonsense character for \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" — Beatriz discovered that some women in the real police force also sported extravagant manicures now and again, she told Seth Meyers on a recent episode of NBC's \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\"\n\"I interviewed various female detectives,\" the actress said . \"My favorites were the beat cops because all of them had serious nails.\"\nWhen \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine's\" cancellation was first announced by Fox, the show's fans, including stars like Lin-Manuel Miranda, took to Twitter using the hashtags #SaveB99 and #RenewB99.
