    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fred's, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRED) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nCommenting on today’s announcement, Fred’s Interim CEO, Joseph Anto stated “I’m excited to say we are now executing a turnaround plan to accomplish two main goals: eliminating our debt and generating significant positive EBITDA and free cash flow, on a run rate basis, by Q4 of FY 2018. Our plan is focused on five key areas: strategic transactions, optimizing our cost structure and capital allocation, talent acquisition, revenue and margin initiatives and assortment optimization.\n“Some of the strategic transactions we are actively pursuing include a sale of our specialty pharmacy business and portions of our vast real estate portfolio. In addition, we are evaluating various options for our retail pharmacy portfolio. We’ve made significant progress on the expense side of our business, having identified $30-$40 million in operating cost reductions for FY 2018, and our work in this area is far from over. We are bringing new talent into every part of the organization, including store operations, supply chain, private brands, finance and real estate. Additionally, we have multiple initiatives focused on driving revenue and gross margin in the front store and we continue to actively manage and reduce our SKU count in order to optimize our assortment.”\nHeath Freeman, Chairman of the Board commented: “The new Fred’s team is confident in our ability to reset the cost structure, bring in the right talent and allocate capital wisely. We are focused on paying down debt, driving significant cash flow from operations and maximizing value for our shareholders.”\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s Board of Directors approved a plan to actively market its specialty pharmacy business for sale. As a result of this decision, Fred’s reclassified the specialty pharmacy business from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The classification was evaluated under ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations. The specialty pharmacy business operations have been removed from the continuing operations as part of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements. The following financial results are for continuing operations for the current and prior periods, unless otherwise indicated.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016\nNet sales up 2.1% to $477.3 million in Q4 2017 vs Q4 2016, which included 14 weeks of activity compared to 13 weeks last year. Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in Q4 2017 versus a 4.8% decline in Q4 2016. 1 Gross margin down 280 basis points to 24.1% in Q4 2017 vs Q4 2016. Net loss was $22.6 million, or $(0.62) per share in Q4 2017, compared to a loss of $21.7 million, or $(0.58) per share in Q4 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(18.9) million in Q4 2017 compared to $13.0 million in Q4 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 vs. Fiscal Year 2016\nNet sales down 4.3% to $1.81 billion in 2017, which included 53 weeks of activity compared to 52 weeks last year. Comparable store sales decreased 2.5% in 2017 compared to a 2.4% decrease in 2016. 2 Gross margin down 90 basis points to 25.4% in 2017. Net loss was $139.3 million, or $(3.73) per share in 2017, compared to a loss of $68.1 million, or $(1.84) per share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $24.1 million in 2017 compared to $31.9 million in 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFred’s net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 2% to $477.3 million from $467.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. The fourth quarter of 2017 had 14 weeks of activity compared to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter last year. Comparable store sales for the quarter decreased 0.9% compared to a 4.8% decrease the fourth quarter of last year.\nFred’s gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 8% to $115.1 million from $125.7 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for the quarter decreased 280 basis points to 24.1% from 26.9% in the same quarter last year. Fred’s recorded LIFO adjustments of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $2.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter, including depreciation and amortization, improved 350 basis points to 28.4% of sales from 31.9% of sales in the fourth quarter last year. Much of the improvement was attributable to professional, legal and banking fees associated with the Rite Aid deal that did not recur in Q4 of 2017. Excluding one-time charges related to the Rite-Aid transaction, SG&A expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 230 basis points to 28.4% from 30.7%.\nOperating loss, which is equivalent to earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $20.6 million in in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a $23.4 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Fred’s recorded a net loss of approximately $22.6 million, or $(0.62) per share, compared to a net loss of $21.7 million, or $(0.58) per share, in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that further excludes depreciation and amortization and non-recurring items from EBIT, was $(18.9) million compared to $13.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFred’s net sales for fiscal 2017 decreased 4% to $1.81 billion from $1.89 billion. Fiscal 2017 had 53 weeks of activity compared to 52 weeks last year. The decrease in sales is attributed to the closure of underperforming stores in 2017 and a decrease in comparable sales. On a comparable store basis, 2017 sales decreased 2.5% compared to a 2.4% decrease in 2016.\nGross profit in 2017 decreased 7% to $459.1 million from $495.7 million in the prior year. Gross margin in 2017 decreased 90 basis points to 25.4% compared to 26.3% in 2016. In 2017, Fred’s recorded LIFO adjustments of $1.3 million compared with $5.1 million in 2016.\nIn 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 230 basis points to 32.7% of sales compared to 30.4% in 2016. Most of the increase was related to professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees incurred regarding the attempt to acquire Rite Aid stores that did not recur, as well as impairment charges for the write-down of certain assets and lease liability impairments recorded for stores closed in 2017.\nOperating loss in 2017 was $131.7 million, or 7.3% of sales, compared with a loss of $77.7 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2016.\nFor 2017, Fred’s net loss totaled $139.3 million, or $(3.73) per share, compared to a net loss of $68.1 million, or $(1.84) per share, in 2016.\nFor 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $24.1 million compared to $31.9 million in 2016.\nConference Call\nFred’s will hold a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results.\nDate: Friday, May 4, 2018\nTime: 8:00 a.m. Eastern time\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-877-407-4018\nInternational dial-in number: 1-201-689-8471\nConference ID: 13678332\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

Non-recurring items includes discontinued operations, impairment, valuation allowance, closed stores, professional fees, and other. The exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that Fred’s do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, Fred’s believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as Fred’s management and board of directors. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a common alternative measure of financial performance used by investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies. These groups use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company and to compare the operating performance of a company to others in its industry. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in the financial tables attached to this news release.\nAbout Fred’s Inc.\nTracing its history back to an original store in Coldwater, Mississippi, opened in 1947, today Fred’s, Inc. operates approximately 600 general merchandise and pharmacy stores, including 12 franchised locations, and three specialty pharmacy-only locations.
