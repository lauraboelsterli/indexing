We are pleased with our first quarter results and look forward to launching new, compelling products throughout the remainder of the year.”\nOutdoor:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the outdoor segment grew 24% with significant contributions from our fēnix® adventure line of wearables. Gross margin improved to 65% while operating margin remained strong at 30%, resulting in operating income growth of 27%. We introduced the tactix® Charlie, a tactical themed GPS wearable, and began shipping the Descent™ dive watch, bringing an attractive design to underwater adventurers. Looking forward, we remain focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market.\nFitness:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the fitness segment posted revenue growth of 20% primarily driven by our advanced wearables. Gross and operating margins increased year-over-year to 58% and 20%, respectively, resulting in an operating income growth of 81%. During the first quarter, we started shipping our first GPS running watch with integrated music and Garmin Pay contactless payments. We recently introduced the Edge® 130, a compact GPS cycling computer, the Edge 520 Plus, an advanced cycling computer, and the Varia™ RTL510 rearview radar. Both computers allow cyclists to plan and download their route in advance and brings connectivity to riders. The updated Varia radar enhances the safety features from the first generation and the new design easily mounts to most road-use bikes. Even though the market for basic activity trackers has continued to rapidly mature, we continue to see opportunities for advanced wearables within the fitness segment.\nAviation:\nThe aviation segment posted solid first quarter revenue growth of 19%. Gross and operating margins were strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25%. During the quarter, we started delivering the G500/600 TXi flight decks including the G500H TXi helicopter variant. We continue to invest in upcoming certifications with our OEM partners, and ongoing aftermarket opportunities.\nMarine:\nThe marine segment posted revenue growth of 9% driven by our recent Navionics® acquisition. Gross margin increased year-over-year to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the first quarter of 2018, we introduced the GCV 20 ultra-high definition scanning sonar that delivers higher resolution imaging at greater depths. Additionally, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders, Inc., the industry’s largest purchasing cooperative network of leading boat brands. We remain focused on innovations and achieving market share gains within the inland fishing category.\nAuto:\nThe auto segment recorded a revenue decline of 12% in the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction somewhat offset by growth in certain niche product lines. Gross and operating margins were 43% and 2%, respectively. During the quarter, we announced a new generation dēzl™ 780, with built in Wi-Fi® and dash cam capabilities bringing advanced safety features and alerts to the trucking industry. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market and to optimize profitability in this segment.\nAdditional Financial Information:\nTotal operating expenses in the quarter were $284 million, an 11% increase from the prior year. Research and development increased 16% driven by the incremental costs associated with acquisitions, investments in the outdoor and fitness segments for the development of advanced wearable products and continued innovation in the aviation segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% driven primarily by personnel related expenses and incremental costs associated with acquisitions. Advertising expenses decreased 20% year over year primarily due to reduced media spending and lower cooperative advertising.\nThe effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 16.0% compared to the pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% (see attached table for reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure) in the prior year quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of the release of reserves.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we generated $188 million of free cash flow (see attached table for reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure). We continued to return cash to shareholders with our quarterly dividend of approximately $96 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion.\nAs announced in February 2018, the Board will recommend to the shareholders for approval at the annual meeting to be held on June 8, 2018 a cash dividend in the total amount of $2.12 per share (subject to adjustment in the event that the Swiss Franc weakens more than 35% relative to the USD), payable in four equal installments on dates to be approved by the Board.\n2018 Guidance:\nWe are maintaining our 2018 guidance for revenue of approximately $3.2 billion and pro forma EPS of $3.05 (see attachment for reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure).\nRevenue Standard Adoption\nWe adopted the new revenue standard in the first quarter of 2018. The prior periods presented here have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. See Appendix A for further discussion of the new revenue standard.\nWebcast Information/Forward-Looking Statements:\nThe information for Garmin Ltd.’s earnings call is as follows:\nWhen: Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Where: http://www.garmin.com/en-US/company/investors/events/\nHow: Simply log on to the web at the address above or call to listen in at 855-757-3897 An archive of the live webcast will be available until May 1, 2019 on the Garmin website at www.garmin.com .

These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies. Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the Company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the Company, as described in more detail by category below.\nThe tables below provide reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\nPro forma effective tax rate\nThe Company’s income tax expense is periodically impacted by discrete tax items that are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. Therefore, management believes disclosure of the effective tax rate and income tax provision before the effect of such discrete tax items are important measures to permit investors' consistent comparison between periods. In the first quarter 2018, there were no such discrete tax items identified.\nGarmin Ltd. And Subsidiaries Pro Forma Effective Tax Rate (in thousands, except effective tax rate (ETR) information) 13-Weeks Ended April 1, 2017 $ ETR (1) U.S. GAAP income tax provision (benefit) $ (150,029 ) (169.8 %) Pro forma discrete tax items: Switzerland corporate tax election (2) 168,755\nTotal pro forma discrete tax items 168,755\nIncome tax provision (Pro Forma) $ 18,726 21.2 % (1) Effective tax rate is calculated by taking the Income tax provision divided by Income before taxes, as presented on the face of the Condensed Consolidated statements of Income. (2) In first quarter 2017, a $169 million tax benefit was recognized resulting from the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. The revaluation is due to the Company’s election in February 2017 to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with global tax initiatives. As this revaluation is not reflective of income tax expense incurred related to the current period earnings, and therefore affects period to period comparability, it has been identified as a discrete pro forma tax item.\nThe net release of uncertain tax position reserves, amounting to approximately $3.5 million and $1.0 million in the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively, have not been included as pro forma adjustments in the above presentation as such amounts tend to be more recurring in nature, and do not affect comparability between periods.\nPro forma net income (earnings) per share\nManagement believes that net income (earnings) per share before the impact of foreign currency gains or losses and certain discrete income tax items, as discussed above, is an important measure in order to permit a consistent comparison of the Company’s performance between periods.\nGarmin Ltd. And Subsidiaries Pro Forma Net Income (Earnings) Per Share (in thousands, except per share information) 13-Weeks Ended March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 Net income (GAAP) $ 129,374 $ 238,404 Foreign currency gains / losses (1) (816 ) 37,497 Tax effect of foreign currency gains / losses (2) 130 (7,945 ) Discrete tax items (3) - (168,755 ) Net income (Pro Forma) $ 128,688 $ 99,201 Net income per share (GAAP): Basic $ 0.69 $ 1.27 Diluted $ 0.68 $ 1.26 Net income per share (Pro Forma): Basic $ 0.68 $ 0.53 Diluted $ 0.68 $ 0.52 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 188,322 188,333 Diluted 189,292 189,031 (1) The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency losses are driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar and the related exchange rate impact on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the Company’s subsidiaries. However, there is minimal cash impact from such foreign currency losses. (2) The tax effect of foreign currency gains/losses were calculated using the effective tax rate of 16.0% and a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% 2018 and 2017, respectively. (3) The discrete tax items are discussed in the pro forma effective tax rate section above. Free cash flow\nManagement believes that free cash flow is an important financial measure because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations that is available for investing and defines it as operating cash less capital expenditures for property and equipment. Management believes that excluding purchases of property and equipment provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the Company’s operating results to historical performance. This metric may also be useful to investors, but should not be considered in isolation as it is not a measure of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. The most comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operating activities.\nGarmin Ltd. And Subsidiaries Free Cash Flow (in thousands) 13-Weeks Ended March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 214,190 $ 120,395 Less: purchases of property and equipment (26,336 ) (25,538 ) Free Cash Flow $ 187,854 $ 94,857 Forward-looking pro forma tax rate\nForward-looking pro forma tax rate and pro forma earnings per share are calculated before the effect of certain discrete tax items. Management believes certain discrete tax items may not be reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. Therefore, in order to permit consistent comparison between periods, the tax rate and earnings per share before the effect of such discrete tax items are important measures. At this time management is unable to determine whether or not significant discrete tax items will be identified in fiscal 2018.\nForward-looking pro forma earnings per share (EPS)\nIn addition to the discrete tax items discussed in the forward-looking pro forma effective tax rate section above, our 2018 pro forma EPS excludes foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The estimated impact of such foreign currency gains and losses cannot be reasonably estimated on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the related tax effects of such gains and losses. The impact of such foreign currency gains and losses, net of tax effects, was less than $0.01 for the 13-weeks ended March 31, 2018.\nAPPENDIX A – New revenue standard\nIn the first quarter of 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”), the new revenue standard. ASC Topic 606 replaces existing revenue recognition rules with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective method. Under this method, the new revenue standard is applied to each prior period reported in the forthcoming 2018 Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings. This adoption approach enhances comparability, as all periods presented in the forthcoming filings are reported under the new standard.\nThe following tables contain restated summarized financial information resulting from the adoption of ASC Topic 606. Amounts related to the income tax effect of the new standard that were previously disclosed as the anticipated adoption impact in our fourth quarter 2017 press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K and in Note 2 of our fiscal 2017 K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 21, 2018 have been revised in the tables below and in Note 1 of the Company’s first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q filing by immaterial amounts in connection with our adoption of ASC Topic 606. Restated revenue, gross profit and operating income were not affected by this revision. Finalized balance sheet information can be found within Note 1 of the Company’s first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q filing. Historical net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities were not impacted by adoption of the new revenue standard. Within this appendix, the references to periods such as “FY 17”or “Q1 17” refer to the corresponding periods as reported in the applicable Form 10-K or Form 10-Q filings.\nGarmin Ltd.

The results above are restated under ASC Topic 606.\n(2)\nU.S. GAAP ETR is calculated by taking the Income tax provision (benefit) divided by Income before income taxes. Pro Forma ETR is calculated by taking the Income tax provision adjusted for Pro forma discrete tax items divided by Income before income taxes.\n(3)\nIn first quarter 2017, a $169 million tax benefit was recognized resulting from the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets. The revaluation is due to the Company’s election in February 2017 to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives. In the fourth quarter 2017, an additional $11 million benefit was recognized as a result of this Switzerland election. These impacts during the transitional period following the election are not reflective of current income tax expense incurred and therefore affect period-to-period comparability.\n(4)\nFollowing adoption in fiscal 2017 of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), the Company may periodically incur tax expense resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) expiring unexercised. New grants of stock options and SARs no longer comprise a significant component of the Company’s compensation arrangements. As the tax expense from expired awards is not related to current period earnings or compensation activities, and affects period-to-period comparability, it has been identified as a pro forma adjustment.\nGarmin Ltd.

The results above are restated under ASC Topic 606.\n(2)\nThe majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gains and losses are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar and the related exchange rate impact on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the Company’s subsidiaries. However, there is minimal cash impact from such foreign currency gains and losses.\n(3)\nThe tax effect of foreign currency gains and losses is calculated using the pro forma ETR for the respective period, as presented above. The quarterly tax effects may not cross-foot to the annual tax effect due to quarterly variances in pro forma ETR.\n(4)\nThe discrete tax items are discussed in the pro forma effective tax rate section above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502005404/en/\nGarmin\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nTeri Seck, 913-397-8200\ninvestor.relations@garmin.com\nor\nMedia Relations Contact:\nTed Gartner, 913-397-8200\nmedia.relations@garmin.com\nSource: Garmin",
