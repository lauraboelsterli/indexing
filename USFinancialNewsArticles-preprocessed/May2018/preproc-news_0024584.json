    "text": "Reblog The leaders of the worldâ€™s biggest car companies are heading to the White House on Friday, and it may be their last chance to prevent a head-on collision between the Trump administration and the state of California. The administration wants to cut back dramatically on Obama-era emissions regulations, which are supported by California and other states. The White House, along with environmental and transportation regulators, are bringing in chief executives from General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, as well as other car company representatives, to forge a common stance over fuel-economy requirements.",
