(“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:BILI), a leading online entertainment platform for young generations in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights:\nTotal net revenues [1] reached RMB868.0 million (US$138.4 million), a 105% increase from the same period in 2017. Net loss was RMB57.8 million (US$9.2 million) and net loss margin was 7%, compared to net loss of RMB67.4 million and net loss margin of 16% in the same period in 2017.

Average monthly paying users reached 2.5 million, a 190% increase from the same period in 2017. Average monthly paying users for mobile games reached 0.8 million, a 79% increase from the same period in 2017.\n“We are pleased to report strong operational and financial results for our first quarter as a public company, with remarkable growth across our three primary business streams,” said Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Bilibili. “As a premier entertainment platform serving young generations in China, we continue to offer new immersive content, vibrant interaction among users and dynamic community environment. Our MAUs reached over 77 million in the first quarter, and we have seen a substantial increase in the number of paying users, demonstrating our strong momentum driven by the implementation of our monetization strategies. As the hub for China’s distinct and thriving Generation Z culture, we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture the future of online entertainment market in China,” Mr. Chen concluded.\n“The 105% increase in total net revenues in the first quarter of 2018 from the same period in 2017 was driven by our robust growth of revenues from mobile games, live broadcasting and value-added services, and advertising,” said Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer of Bilibili. “We are also improving our operating efficiency while continuing to grow our business. For the first quarter, we generated operating cash flow of RMB471.1 million and our net loss margin was 7%, compared to 16% for the same period in 2017.”\n[1] The Company has adopted ASU No. 2014-09, ''Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”, using the modified-retrospective transition approach beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and comparable periods.\n[2] Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal net revenues. Total net revenues increased to RMB868.0 million (US$138.4 million), representing an increase of 105% from the same period of 2017.\nMobile games. Revenues from mobile games increased to RMB688.5 million (US$109.8 million), representing an increase of 97% from the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increasing popularity of mobile games such as Fate/Grand Order and Azur Lane .\nLive broadcasting and Value-added services (VAS). Revenues from live broadcasting and VAS increased to RMB95.8 million (US$15.3 million), representing an increase of 151% from the same period of 2017, mainly attributable to the Company’s enhanced monetization efforts and promotion of its VAS services.\nAdvertising. Revenues from advertising increased to RMB70.4 million (US$11.2 million), representing an increase of 144% from the same period of 2017. This increase was contributed by increasing brand advertising as well as newly launched performance-based advertising attracted by the high-quality traffic of the Company’s platform.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to RMB13.3 million (US$2.1 million), representing an increase of 65% from the same period of 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in the sales of products through the Company’s e-commerce platform.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 80% to RMB654.9 million (US$104.4 million), compared to RMB363.0 million in the same period of 2017. Revenue-sharing cost , a key component of cost of revenues, was RMB334.5 million (US$53.3 million), representing an increase of 120% from the same period in 2017.\nGross profit. Gross profit increased to RMB213.1 million (US$34.0 million), representing an increase of 249% from the same period of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses. Total operating expenses increased to RMB287.4 million (US$45.8 million), representing an increase of 107% from the same period of 2017.\nSelling and marketing expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB78.9 million (US$12.6 million), representing a 93% increase year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app, as well as the promotional expenses for the Company’s mobile games.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were RMB102.6 million (US$16.4 million), representing a 140% increase year over year. The increase was primarily due to the share-based compensation expenses with an IPO condition and an increase in professional service fees.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were RMB105.9 million (US$16.9 million), representing a 92% increase year over year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount in research and development personnel.\nLoss from operations. Loss from operations was RMB74.3 million (US$11.8 million), compared to RMB77.7 million in the same period of 2017.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million), compared to RMB1.8 million in the same period of 2017.\nNet loss. [3] Net loss was RMB57.8 million (US$9.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to RMB67.4 million in the same period of 2017.\n[3] The Company has adopted ASU No. 2016-01, ''Financial Instruments,\" beginning January 1, 2018. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this new standard might increase the volatility of its investment income, net, as a result of remeasurement of its equity investments. For equity investments without readily determinable fair value, the Company elected to measure them at cost minus impairment (if any), plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuers. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an investment income of RMB20.6 million (US$3.3 million) as a result.\nAdjusted net loss. [2] Adjusted net loss, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, narrowed down by 95% to RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million) from RMB59.6 million in the same period of 2017.\nBasic and diluted EPS and Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS . Basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB1.73 (US$0.28), compared to RMB1.69 in the same period of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share were RMB0.94 (US$0.15), compared to RMB1.58 in the same period of 2017.\nCash Flow and Working Capital\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, as well as time deposits of RMB1.1 billion (US$167.9 million), compared to RMB764.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB471.1 million (US$75.1 million), compared to RMB205.9 million in the same period of 2017.\nRecent Developments\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 42,000,000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each representing one Class Z ordinary share of the Company, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company received a total of approximately US$443.3 million of net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company currently expects:\nNet revenues to be between RMB970.0 million and RMB1.0 billion.\nThe above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions, and customer demand, which are all subject to change.\nConference Call\nThe Company’s management will host an earnings conference call at 9:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on May 23, 2018 (9:00 AM Beijing/Hong Kong time on May 24, 2018).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States: +1-866-519-4004\nInternational: +65-6713-5090\nHong Kong: +800-906-601\nChina: 400-620-8038\nConference ID: 4369088\nParticipants should dial-in at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and ask to be connected to the call for “Bilibili Inc.”\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.bilibili.com .\nA replay of the conference call will be accessible approximately two hours after the conclusion of the live call through May 30, 2018, by dialing the following telephone numbers:\nUnited States: +1-855-452-5696\nInternational: +61-2-8199-0299\nHong Kong: +800-963-117\nChina: 400-632-2162\nReplay Access Code: 4369088\nAbout Bilibili Inc.\nBilibili represents the iconic brand of online entertainment with a mission to enrich the everyday life of young generations in China. Bilibili is a full-spectrum online entertainment world covering a wide array of genres and media formats, including videos, live broadcasting and mobile games.

The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisition, which are non-cash charges. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nExchange Rate Information\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on March 30, 2018 set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.
