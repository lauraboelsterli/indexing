    "text": "First Quarter Highlights\nPurchased $17.6 million of re-performing mortgage loans (“RPLs”) with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of $19.7 million and underlying collateral value of $32.4 million. Interest income of $25.6 million; net interest income of $13.1 million. Net income attributable to common stockholders of $7.7 million. Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.41. Taxable income of $0.37 per share. Book value per share of $15.53 at March 31, 2018. Held $47.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018.\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Great Ajax Corp. (NYSE: AJX), a Maryland corporation that is a real estate investment trust, today announces its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. We focus primarily on acquiring, investing in and managing a portfolio of RPLs secured by single-family residences and commercial properties and, to a lesser extent, non-performing mortgage loans (“NPLs”). In addition to our continued focus on residential RPLs, we also originate and acquire small balance commercial loans (\"SBC loans\") secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/residential properties.\nFinancial Results (Unaudited)\n($ in thousands except per share amounts)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nLoan interest income (1,2) $ 25,445 $ 24,231 $ 24,396 $ 21,682 $ 20,556 Total revenue (1,3) $ 14,743 $ 13,797 $ 14,226 $ 13,105 $ 13,667 Consolidated net income (1) $ 8,322 $ 6,638 $ 7,716 $ 7,102 $ 8,698 Net income per diluted share $ 0.38 $ 0.33 $ 0.38 $ 0.36 $ 0.46 Average equity (1) $ 318,839 $ 302,482 $ 292,640 $ 288,884 $ 284,872 Average total assets (1) $ 1,377,537 $ 1,230,026 $ 1,157,223 $ 1,050,108 $ 952,112 Average daily cash balance (4) $ 51,540 $ 47,717 $ 43,666 $ 47,705 $ 35,513 Average carrying value of RPLs (1) $ 1,199,638 $ 1,046,126 $ 998,692 (5)\n$ 898,749 (5)\n$ 810,166 (5)\nAverage carrying value of NPLs $ 40,593 $ 43,400 $ 44,919 (5)\n$ 48,396 (5)\n$ 52,770 (5)\nAverage carrying value of originated SBC loans $ 11,629 $ 11,273 $ 8,427 (5)\n$ 5,493 (5)\n$ 2,781 (5)\nAverage debt balance (1) $ 1,064,490 $ 943,329 $ 883,770 $ 775,717 $ 669,938\n(1) Reflects the impact of consolidating the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-D, which is 50% owned by a third-party institutional investor.\n(2) Loan interest income excludes interest income from debt securities and bank account balances. (3) Total revenue includes net interest income, income from investments in our manager and other income. (4) Average daily cash balance includes cash and cash equivalents, and excludes cash held in trust. (5) The 2017 quarterly average balances for mortgage loans were calculated using daily ending balances. Prior quarters of 2017 have been restated to conform to the current quarter presentation.\nOur consolidated net income increased $1.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the acceleration of deferred issuance costs of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to calling our 2015-B and -C securitizations. Additionally, we realized an increase in fee income from the Home Affordable Modification Program and a gain, net of impairments, on real estate owned property (\"REO\") sales. Our net interest income increased $0.1 million as a result of recording a full quarter of acquisitions, net of funding costs, that were made in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Although we only hold a 50% interest in the assets of Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2017-D, we are required to consolidate 100% of its assets and record an offsetting liability and non-controlling interest for the debt and equity, respectively, held by our joint venture partner. Accordingly, our net interest income reflects the impact of consolidating the joint venture.\nOn January 26, 2018, we agreed to acquire an 8% ownership interest in Great Ajax Financial Services LLC (“GAFS”), the parent of our servicer, Gregory Funding LLC. The acquisition will be completed in two steps. On January 26, 2018, the initial closing, we acquired a 4.9% interest in GAFS and three warrants, each exercisable for a 2.45% interest in GAFS upon payment of additional consideration, in exchange for consideration of $1.1 million of cash and 45,938 shares of our common stock. At the date of an additional closing, expected to take place at the end of May, 2018, we expect to acquire the remaining 3.1% interest in GAFS and three warrants, each exercisable for a 1.55% interest in GAFS, in exchange for consideration of $0.7 million of cash and shares of our common stock with a value of approximately $0.4 million, with the actual number of shares dependent upon our common stock’s public trading price at the close of trading on the day immediately preceding the date of the additional closing.\nWe collected $50.4 million on our mortgage loan and REO portfolios through loan payments, loan payoffs and sales of REO during the quarter, and ended the first quarter with $47.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We had an average cash balance of $51.5 million during the quarter. We continue to see a high volume of payoffs in certain RPL cohorts as borrowers continue to refinance or sell the underlying real property. Additionally, we continue to experience duration extension in other cohorts of our RPL portfolio resulting from materially lower than expected delinquencies and higher expected future cash flows in the form of interest and principal payments. This results in a significant aggregate increase in expected future cash flows for these loans but a lower current yield and lower expected current period income. The increase in the quality of the portfolio has resulted in a lower cost of funds on our securitization transactions.\nWe acquired $17.6 million of RPLs with an aggregate UPB of $19.7 million, and underlying collateral values of $32.4 million during the quarter to end the period with $1,247.2 million of mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of $1,448.3 million. Mortgage loans purchased during the first quarter and held as of quarter-end were on our consolidated balance sheet for a weighted average of 56 days during the quarter.\nPortfolio Acquisitions\n($ in thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nRPLs Count 87 1,211 (1)\n109 1,218 24 UPB $ 19,699 $ 241,309 $ 32,718 $ 249,000 $ 3,445 Purchase price $ 17,566 $ 219,236 $ 26,645 $ 210,204 $ 3,143 Purchase price % of UPB 89.2 % 90.9 % 81.4 % 84.4 % 91.2 % (1) Includes the impact of 1,003 mortgage loans with a purchase price of $177.3 million and UPB of $194.3 million acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 through a 50%-owned joint venture that we consolidate.\nThe following table provides an overview of our portfolio at March 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):\nNo. of loans 6,840 Weighted average LTV (4) 87.5 % Total UPB $ 1,448,313 Weighted average remaining term (months) 321 Interest-bearing balance $ 1,355,418 No. of first liens 6,819 Deferred balance (1) $ 92,895 No. of second liens 21 Market value of collateral (2) $ 1,942,170 No. of rental properties 15 Price/total UPB (3) 81.1 % Market value of rental properties $ 6,087 Price/market value of collateral 61.8 % Capital invested in rental properties $ 5,325 Re-performing loans 95.9 % Price/market value of rental properties 87.5 % Non-performing loans 3.2 % No. of other REO 136 Originated SBC loans 0.9 % Market value of other REO (5) $ 26,816 Weighted average coupon 4.36 % (1) Amounts that have been deferred in connection with a loan modification on which interest does not accrue.

(5) Market value of Other REO is the estimated expected gross proceeds from the sale of the REO less estimated costs to sell, including repayment of servicer advances.\nSubsequent Events\nOn April 26, 2018 we closed Ajax Mortgage Loan Trust 2018-A (\"2018-A\"), a joint venture with two independent third parties, which issued an aggregate of $128.0 million of senior securities and retained $32.0 million of equity issued with respect to $160.0 million UPB of mortgage loans. Ninety-four percent of the UPB was RPLs, and 6.0% was NPLs. The senior securities represent 80% of the UPB of the underlying mortgage loans. The securities may be sold by any party at a future date. We retained a 9.4% interest and expect to account for 2018-A as an equity-method investee. Subsequently, we acquired for the account of 2018-A, an additional 42 RPLs with an aggregate UPB of $13.2 million in one transaction from a single seller. The loans were acquired at 87.5% of UPB and 61.8% of the estimated market value of the underlying collateral value of $18.7 million. We also agreed to acquire for the account of 2018-A, subject to due diligence, 810 RPLs and 49 NPLs, with UBP of $138.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, in three transactions from three different sellers. The RPL price equals 92.1% of UPB and 57.1% of the underlying collateral value of $223.0 million. The NPL price equals 57.5% of UPB and 39.6% of the underlying collateral value of $8.5 million.\nAdditionally, we have also agreed to acquire, subject to due diligence, 85 RPLs and 504 NPLs with UPB of $18.1 million and $123.7 million, respectively, in three transactions from three different sellers. The purchase price of the RPLs equals 91.9% of UPB and 60.0% of the estimated market value of the underlying collateral of $27.8 million. The purchase price of the NPLs equals 79.5% of UPB and 63.2% of the estimated market value of the underlying collateral of $155.6 million. Some of these loans may be acquired through a joint venture with institutional investors.\nOn April 23, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, to be paid on May 30, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of May 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nGreat Ajax will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 to review our financial results for the quarter.
