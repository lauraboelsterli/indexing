Both the companies reported first-quarter results.\n* Keyera Corp fell 3.9 percent, the most on the TSX, on plans to develop a crude oil storage and blending terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. The second biggest decliner was Semafo Inc, which was down 3.5 percent.\n* The most heavily traded shares by volume were Element Fleet Management, Neovasc Inc and Aurora Cannabis , which was down 1.0 percent.\n* The TSX posted 15 new 52-week highs and seven new lows.\n* Across all Canadian issues there were 35 new 52-week highs and 64 new lows, with total volume of 160.01 million shares.
