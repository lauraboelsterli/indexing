We look forward to presenting updated patient data from the Fanconi Anemia program later this month, and to disclosing our AAV-based gene therapy program by the end of the year,” said Gaurav Shah, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Rocket. “We remain on track for multiple regulatory filings across our pipeline over the next 12 months. As a result, there is the potential for four programs to be in the clinic in 2019, with clinical data for up to two programs.”\nDr. Shah continued, “While near-term milestones are certainly important, Rocket's long-term strategy is based on a sustainable and integrated multi-platform approach. We remain focused on our mission of continued innovation to deliver best-in-class curative cell and gene therapies to patients living with devastating diseases.”\nAnticipated Milestones Over the Next 12 -18 Months\nFanconi Anemia (FA): Updated patient data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of RP-L102 conducted with CIEMAT is expected over the next 12 months.
