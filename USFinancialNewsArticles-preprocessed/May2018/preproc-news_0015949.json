(\" the Company \") in a taking private transaction (the \" Transaction \").\nWe believe that our Proposal provides an attractive opportunity for the Company's shareholders. The Proposal represents a premium of approximately 51.8% to the Company's last closing price on May 7th, 2018, a premium of approximately 56.1% to the Company's volume-weighted average closing price (\" VWAP Price \") during the last 5 trading days, a premium of approximately 45.7% to the VWAP Price during the last 15 trading days, and a premium of approximately 32.1% to the VWAP Price during the last 30 trading days.\nSet forth below are the primary terms of our Proposal:\n1. Purchase Price. We propose to acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company and the American Depositary Share of the Company (\" ADS \", each representing one Class B ordinary share of the Company). The consideration payable for each ADS to be acquired will be $8.70 in cash per ADS (or per ordinary share).\n2. Funding. We intend to finance the Transaction primarily with equity capital, and possibly some debt capital. Equity financing will be provided from us as the Proposing Buyer and any additional members we accept into a consortium of buyers.\n3. Due Diligence. We believe that we will be in a position to complete customary legal, financial and accounting due diligence for the Transaction in a timely manner and in parallel with discussions of corresponding definitive agreements.\n4. Definitive Agreements. We are prepared to promptly negotiate and finalize definitive agreements (the \" Definitive Agreements \") providing for the Transaction. These documents will provide for representations, warranties, covenants and conditions that are typical, customary and appropriate for transactions of this type.\n5. Process. We believe that the Transaction will provide superior value to the Company's shareholders. We recognize that the Board will, through a committee of independent directors, evaluate the Transaction independently before it can make any determination to endorse it.\nIn considering our offer, you should be aware that the Proposing Buyer is interested only in acquiring the outstanding shares of the Company that the Proposing Buyer does not already own, and that the Proposing Buyer does not intend to sell its stake in the Company to any third party.\n6. Participating Shareholders. As we proceed with due diligence evaluation, we may consider inviting certain shareholders of the Company to participate in our proposed Transaction.\n7. Confidentiality. We are sure you will agree with us that except as required by applicable laws and regulations (including the listing rules of applicable stock exchanges), it is in all of our interests to ensure that we proceed in a strictly confidential manner until we have executed Definitive Agreements or terminated our discussions. In the event the Board of the Company intends to disclose this Proposal, we request that FutureX Capital be notified in advance of any such disclosure.\n8. No Binding Commitment. This letter constitutes only a preliminary indication of our interest, and does not constitute any binding commitment with respect to the Transaction. A binding commitment will result only from the execution of Definitive Agreements, and then will be on terms and conditions provided in such documentation.\n9. About FutureX Capital. FutureX Capital is a Greater China-based private equity firm led by Cynthia Zhang, who founded the overseas PE platform of ChinaAMC, a leading asset manager in China. FutureX's primary areas of investment focus include technology, software and AI.\nIn closing, we would like to express our commitment to working together to bring this Transaction to a successful and timely conclusion.

We look forward to hearing from you.\nSincerely,\nBy: /s/ Cynthia Qian Zhang\nCynthia Qian Zhang\nDirector\nFutureX Capital Limited\n : releases/gridsum-announces-receipt-of-preliminary-non-binding-proposal-300644505.html\nSOURCE Gridsum Holding Inc.",
