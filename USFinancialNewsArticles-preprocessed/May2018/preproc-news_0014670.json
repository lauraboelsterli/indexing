    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KDMN) today provided a business update and reported financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2018.\n“We have made significant progress this quarter in the development of KD025 in cGVHD, highlighted by our alignment with the FDA to commence a registrational trial in this indication,” said Harlan W. Waksal, M.D., President and CEO at Kadmon. “We continue to prioritize the development of KD025 in cGVHD and remain on track to initiate this pivotal trial this year. In parallel, we remain focused on the advancement of our ROCK inhibitor platform for the treatment of fibrotic and inflammatory diseases.”\nClinical Update\nKD025 – Anticipated 2018 Milestones\nInitiate open-label, pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) Present updated results from ongoing, open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 clinical trial in cGVHD at upcoming medical meetings Present additional data from ongoing, randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference in May 2018 Initiate Phase 2 clinical trial in scleroderma\nAdditional Clinical Updates\nEnrollment continues in the Company’s ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of tesevatinib in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of tesevatinib in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Kadmon is also continuing dialogue with the FDA regarding its review and approval of KD034, the Company’s generic trientine hydrochloride formulation, for the treatment of Wilson’s disease.\nFinancial Results\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nLoss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $17.9 million, compared to $13.9 million for the respective period in 2017.\nRevenue was $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.6 million for the respective period in 2017. The Company does not rely on the revenue generated from its commercial operations; however, the Company leverages its commercial infrastructure to support the development of its clinical-stage product candidates by providing quality assurance, compliance, regulatory and pharmacovigilance capabilities, among others.\nResearch and development expenses were $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $8.4 million for the respective period in 2017. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily related to development of the Company’s most advanced product candidates, KD025 and tesevatinib.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $8.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.1 million for the respective period in 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation of $1.6 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, Kadmon’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $49.2 million, compared to $67.5 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAbout Kadmon Holdings, Inc.\nKadmon Holdings, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company developing innovative product candidates for significant unmet medical needs.
