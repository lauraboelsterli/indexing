    "text": "TORONTO, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd. (TSX:WDO) (“Wesdome” or the “Company”) today announces first quarter (“Q1 2018”) financial results. All figures are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nMr. Duncan Middlemiss, President and CEO commented, “2018 is off to a strong start with higher underground grades and volume driving higher gold production and lower costs. Free cash flow generation of $3.2 million, or $0.02 per share after investment of $8.5 million back into the properties has allowed the company to build its cash position by nearly $4.4 million. We expect costs to continue to trend downwards in the second half of the year, when we open two new stopes in both the 303 and 7 Zones. Lower general and administrative costs are also benefitting costs on an all-in sustaining basis. During the quarter, the cash position increased from $22.1 million at the end of 2017 to $26.5 million at the end of Q1 2018.”\n“Cash flows will continue to be used to aggressively drill underground at the Eagle River Underground Mine and the Kiena Complex. The objective at the Eagle River mine is to expand all three parallel Zones, with a focus on the 300 and 7 Zones, increase reserves, and diversify production areas within existing infrastructure to further increase the ratio of Eagle River Underground ore versus Mishi Open Pit ore to the mill. In Q1, this strategy began to take effect with 57% of tonnes delivered to the mill coming from the Eagle River Underground Mine versus 50% in 2017. We expect the higher ratio of Eagle River Underground ore to continue throughout 2018.”\n“At Kiena, this is a year of assessment where we will be drilling 50,000 metres underground including the Kiena Deep A and Upper Quartz Zones. The objective of this year’s program is to complete a resource update on the Kiena Deep discovery and we are well underway with over 13,000 metres completed to date and we have just added a fourth underground drill.”\nKey operating and financial highlights of the Q1 2018 results include:\nGold production of 17,949 ounces from the Eagle River Complex, a 18% increase over the same period in the previous year (Q1 2017: 15,162 ounces):\nEagle River Underground 44,480 tonnes at a head grade of 12.0 grams per tonne (“g/t Au”) for 16,398 ounces produced, 21% increase over the previous year (Q1 2017: 13,588 ounces).\nMishi Open Pit 32,846 tonnes at a head grade of 1.8 g/t Au for 1,550 ounces produced (Q1 2017: 1,574 ounces).\nRevenue of $26.2 million, a 30% increase over the previous year (Q1 2017: $20.1 million).\nOunces sold 15,430 at an average sales price of $1,698/oz (Q1 2017: 12,320 ounces at an average price of $1,631/oz).\nCash costs 1 of $999/oz or US$790/oz, a 12% decrease over the same period in 2017 (Q1 2017: $1,134/oz or US$857/oz).\nAll-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) 1 of $1,342/oz or US$1,061/oz, a 17% decrease over the same period in 2017 (Q1 2017: $1,613/oz or US$1,219/oz).\nEarned mine profit 1 of $10.8 million, a 76% increase over Q1 2017 (Q1 2017 - $6.1 million).\nOperating cash flow of $12.4 million or $0.09 per share a 190% increase over the previous year (Q1 2017: $4.3 million or $0.03 per share).\nFree cash flow of $3.2 million or $0.02 per share 1 (Q1 2017: outflow of $5.9 million or ($0.05) per share).\nNet income of $2.9 million or $0.02 per share (Q1 2017: $0.7 million or $0.01 per share). Net income (adjusted) 1 was $2.9 million or $0.02 per share.\nCash position of $26.5 million.\n1 Refer to the Company’s 2018 Interim Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, section entitled “Non-IFRS Performance Measures” for the reconciliation of these non-IFRS measurements to the financial statements.\nExploration Highlights for Q1 2018\nEagle River\nMineral Reserves at Eagle River increased by 21% to 416,000 ounces of gold; grade increased by 32% compared to December 2016 (9.2 g/t Au to 12.2 g/t Au in 1.1 million tonnes for 416,000 ounces (2016: 344,000 ounces)).\nDevelopment drifting on 7 Zone continues to return longer than average strike lengths including a combined 23.8 g/t Au uncut (20.2 g/t Au cut) over a width of 2.1 m and a total strike length of 122.8 m from the 1022 metre level (“m-level”). Kiena\nThe development of the Kiena Deep exploration ramp at the 1000 m-level commenced early August 2017 is now completed.\nInitial drilling at Kiena Deep A Zone intersected visible gold in several drill holes within predominantly shear zone hosted quartz veins in mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks. Highlights include 39.6 g/t Au over 18.2 m core length (12.6 g/t Au cut) in hole 6275.\nIn addition, development on cross-cut level 102 and 103 northeast exposed a narrow-laminated quartz vein, named the “Prospect vein”. Four grab samples returned 6.7, 137.9, 227.1 and 5.0 g/t Au.\nOne drill has been actively drilling several auxiliary targets near existing underground development including the S-50 and VC zone sectors and has returned encouraging results, including 6.7 g/t Au uncut (6.0 g/t Au cut) over 37.6 m core length and 17.9 g/t Au uncut (16.3 g/t Au cut) over 6.0 m core length from S-50 Zone. Technical Disclosure\nThe technical content of this release has been compiled, reviewed and approved by Marc-Andre Pelletier, P. Eng, Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Michaud, P.Geo., Vice President, Exploration of the Company and each a \"Qualified Person\" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects .\nCautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Reserves and Resources\nThe mineral reserve and resource estimates reported in this news release were prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“ NI 43-101 ”) as required by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) applies different standards in order to classify and report mineralization. This news release uses the terms “measured”, “indicated” and “inferred” mineral resources, as required by NI 43-101. Readers are advised that although such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities regulations, the SEC does not recognize such terms. Canadian standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories constitute or will ever be converted into mineral reserves. In addition, “inferred” mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, is economically or legally mineable or will ever be upgraded to a higher category of mineral resource.\nWesdome Gold Mines 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call:\nMay 2, 2018 at 10:00 am ET:\nNorth American Toll Free: + 1 (844) 202-7109\nInternational Dial-In Number: +1 (703) 639-1272\nConference ID: 7789489\nWebcast link: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/zpgsbyms\nWebcast can also be accessed under the News and Events section of the Company’s website ( www.wesdome.com )\nWesdome Gold Mines Ltd.\nSummarized Operating and Financial Data\n(Unaudited, expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share and per unit amounts and otherwise indicated) Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Operating data Milling (tonnes) Eagle River 44,480 38,578 Mishi 32,846 36,641 Throughput 2 77,326 75,219 Head grades (g/t) Eagle River 12.0 11.5 Mishi 1.8 1.7 Recovery (%) Eagle River 95.4 95.3 Mishi 81.6 80.9 Production (ounces) Eagle River 16,398 13,588 Mishi 1,550 1,574 Total gold produced 2 17,948 15,162 Total gold sales (ounces) 15,430 12,320 Eagle River Complex (per ounce of gold sold) 1 Average realized price $ 1,698 $ 1,631 Cash costs 999 1,134 Cash margin $ 699 $ 497 All-in Sustaining Costs 1 $ 1,342 $ 1,613 Mine operating costs/tonne milled 1 $ 208 $ 213 Average 1 USD → CAD exchange rate 1.2647 1.3236 Cash costs per ounce of gold sold ( US$ ) 1 $ 790 $ 857 All-in Sustaining Costs ( US$ ) 1 $ 1,061 $ 1,219 Financial Data Mine profit 1 $ 10,774 $ 6,127 Net income $ 2,859 $ 695 Net income adjusted 1 $ 2,859 $ 695 Operating cash flow $ 12,423 $ 4,318 Free cash flow $ 3,216 $ (5,942 ) Per share data Net income $ 0.02 $ 0.01 Adjusted net earnings 1 $ 0.02 $ 0.01 Operating cash flow $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Free cash flow 1 $ 0.02 $ (0.05 ) Notes\nRefer to the Company’s Interim Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, section entitled “Non-IFRS Performance Measures” for the reconciliation of these non-IFRS measurements to the financial statements.
