Implementation of some or all of the new services referred to is subject to regulatory or other third party approvals.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation. These non-GAAP key business indicators, which include Adjusted EBITDA, should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense (5) derivative income (expense) and (6) certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Please see \"Adjusted EBITDA\" below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 1\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31 ,2017\nNet Loss\n(2,752,925)\n(9,669,092)\nAdd Back:\nInterest Expense\n239,169\n604,015\nConversion of debt, etc.\n-\n4,106,652\nDepreciation and amortization\n110,676\n109,534\nTaxes\n4,561\n4,170\nStock-based compensation equity plans\n738,212\n3,294,160\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(1,660,307)\n(1,550,561)\nIPSIDY INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash\n$ 2,412,363\n$ 4,413,822\nAccounts receivable, net\n676,628\n165,929\nCurrent portion of net investment in direct financing lease\n54,215\n52,790\nInventory\n475,541\n492,030\nOther current assets\n560,721\n218,537\nTotal current assets\n4,179,468\n5,343,108\nProperty and equipment, net\n202,926\n209,719\nOther Assets\n1,446,732\n1,243,531\nIntangible Assets, net\n2,794,600\n2,878,080\nGoodwill\n6,736,043\n6,736,043\nNet investment in direct financing lease, net of current portion\n604,663\n618,763\nTotal assets\n$ 15,964,432\n$ 17,029,244\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$ 1,816,982\n$ 1,447,185\nCapital lease obligation, current portion\n28,251\n27,420\nDeferred revenue\n538,812\n122,511\nTotal current liabilities\n2,384,045\n1,597,116\nLong-term liabilities:\nNotes payable, net\n2,519,785\n2,375,720\nCapital lease obligation, net of current portion\n108,127\n115,509\nTotal long-term liabilities\n2,627,912\n2,491,229\nTotal liabilities\n5,011,957\n4,088,345\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders' Equity:\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 1,000,000,000 shares\nauthorized;
