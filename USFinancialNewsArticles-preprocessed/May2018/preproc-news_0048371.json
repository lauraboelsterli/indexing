    "text": "19 COMMENTS BEIJING—The collapse of a planned U.S.-North Korea summit gives China greater sway over diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\nWith talks stalling, Beijing has more time to assert itself as a power broker, and possibly use its influence as leverage against Washington in their bilateral trade dispute.\nChinese officials and state media expressed disappointment in U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel a June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un citing recent hostility from Pyongyang.\nRelated\nDonald Trump Cancels North Korea Summit Trump Administration Resumes Pressure Campaign on North Korea Analysis: The Trump-Kim Summit, Lost in Translation “We hope North Korea and the U.S. will treasure the positive progress achieved so far,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Friday at a regular news briefing. Both sides should “show mutual goodwill, meet each other halfway and continue to resolve each other’s concerns through dialogue,” he said.\nIf the U.S. strategy toward Pyongyang pivots back toward threats of tougher sanctions and military action, as White House officials have suggested, Washington would need Beijing—as North Korea’s biggest trade partner—to continue strictly enforcing United Nations sanctions on its neighbor, as it has over the past year or so.\nFor China, “the priority is to persuade North Korea to continue talks with the U.S. and take concrete steps toward denuclearization in exchange for easing sanctions,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at Renmin University in Beijing. “This should be the foundation for any Chinese effort to restore economic and trade ties with North Korea.”\nRelated Video President Trump cancelled a planned summit meeting Thursday with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib looks at what might have prompted the change, whether it could be permanent, and how North Korea might react. Photos: Getty Images Chinese traders near the North Korean border say they haven’t seen signs of Beijing relaxing sanctions enforcement in recent weeks, though they expressed hope that warming bilateral ties will lead to a lifting of trade curbs.\nMr. Trump has suggested that China may be behind Pyongyang’s harsh rhetoric in recent days that raised doubts about the summit—a claim that Chinese experts derided as an attempt to scapegoat Beijing for Washington’s own missteps.\nU.S. intelligence officials say Mr. Kim’s attitude appeared to shift immediately after his second meeting with Mr. Xi in early May . They assessed that Mr. Xi exercised some influence on that shift in an effort to put pressure on Washington.\nIt “is a totally baseless allegation,” said Lu Chao, a North Korea expert at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences. “China fully supports and encourages communication between North Korea and the U.S.”\nChina’s goal has always been to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula through peaceful dialogue, said Mr. Lu, the foreign ministry spokesman. “We don’t have hidden intentions.”\n‘ We don’t have hidden intentions. ’\n—Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang In return, Chinese commentators accused Mr. Trump of acting rashly, saying his reversal reflects Washington’s misunderstanding of Pyongyang’s intentions and underscores divisions in U.S. foreign-policy circles over North Korea strategy.\n“The crux of the matter remains the lack of consensus between North Korea and the U.S., particularly the differences and misunderstandings over the denuclearization process,” said Zhang Yushan, a Korea expert at the Jilin Academy of Social Sciences.\nSome foreign diplomats and analysts in China say Mr. Xi is unlikely to have sought to sabotage the summit since Beijing is alarmed by the prospect of a potential U.S. military strike on North Korea if talks fail.\nRather, they say, Mr. Xi likely gave Mr. Kim advice on negotiating with Mr. Trump, and might have provided assurances of Chinese support that could have emboldened the North Korean leader.\nThe recent record of China-North Korea relations “is not one that suggests that [Mr. Kim] listens to Xi unless it suits his purposes,” Bilahari Kausikan, a senior Singaporean diplomat, wrote Friday in a social-media post.\nInstead, Pyongyang was more likely put off by remarks from Trump administration officials , including national security adviser John Bolton, who recently suggested that North Korea should denuclearize quickly in a fashion similar to Libya under leader Moammar Gadhafi, who in 2003 agreed to give up his nascent nuclear program.\nAnalysts say Mr. Kim likely sees Gadhafi’s downfall and death in a 2011 uprising, backed by Western powers, as a cautionary tale.\nNorth Korea “often uses the Libya analogy to justify why it must have nuclear weapons,” wrote Mr. Kausikan. “The hostile rhetoric that Trump used to justify calling off the meeting came after his people talked about the Libya model.”\nEven so, the cancellation may bring relief to some Chinese officials who have grown concerned in recent months that Beijing was being marginalized in negotiations, and feared its interests might not be reflected in a potential U.S.-North Korea agreement, diplomats and analysts say.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, at left, with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Photo: Andy Wong/Associated Press China has long worried that regime collapse in North Korea, or reunification with the South, could create another U.S.-allied democracy on its periphery and bring American troops closer to its borders.\nFor now, improved ties with North Korea have strengthened Beijing’s hand. Since Mr. Kim traveled to Beijing in March for his first meeting with Mr. Xi, the two sides have increased official exchanges and pledged greater cooperation.\nDays after Mr. Kim’s second China trip, Chinese ambassador to North Korea Li Jinjun toured the North Korean border city of Sinuiju as part of efforts to “strengthen local and non-governmental exchanges between the two countries,” according to Chinese state media.\nNorth Korea meanwhile sent a high-ranking delegation to tour Chinese facilities showcasing industrial advancements in information-technology and agriculture. President Xi told the delegation that China “supports North Korea’s efforts to develop its economy” and is willing to “deepen exchanges” on governance, Chinese state media said.\n—Kersten Zhang and Xiao Xiao contributed to this article.\nWrite to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com",
