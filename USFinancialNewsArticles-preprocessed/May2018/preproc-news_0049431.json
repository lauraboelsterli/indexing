He is a trusted colleague, and I feel honored to count him among my close friends.”\nHawley joined Optovue in 2008 as the company was just beginning its entry into the ophthalmic and optometric OCT markets as the vice president of business development. Within six months, he was also heading up the U.S. organization. As the company introduced its OCTA technology to markets outside the U.S., Hawley was promoted to senior vice president of global sales in 2016.\n“I am thankful for the opportunities that Optovue has given me during my tenure, and proud of the organization we have built together,” said Hawley. “I may be retiring from day-to-day operations; however, I will remain involved in an advisory role, and I look forward to the company’s continued success and growth.”\nIn a prestigious career spanning more than 35 years in ophthalmic diagnostic instrumentation, service, sales, marketing and strategic planning, John also held executive and sales management positions at Heidelberg Engineering, INTERZEAG, BioRad, and Cilco. Prior to this, John was a member of the Royal Australian Navy.\nAbout Optovue\nOptovue, Inc. is a privately held medical device company founded in 2003.
