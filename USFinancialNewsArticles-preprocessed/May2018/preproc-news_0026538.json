    "text": "(Reuters) - Top Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd ( AMP.AX ) on Thursday reported subdued cash flows in its Australian wealth management business in the first quarter amid a scandal that has shaken up its board and sent its shares crashing.\nCash inflows during the quarter fell, while outflows narrowed, resulting in a net outflow of A$200 million ($149.2 million), flat over last year.\nTotal assets under management for the business at the end of the first quarter were A$128.3 billion, 2 percent lower than the last quarter, the company said, citing negative investment markets during the period.\nReporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
