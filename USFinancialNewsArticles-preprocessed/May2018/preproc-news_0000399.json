    "text": "(Unless stated otherwise, all first quarter 2018 comparisons are relative to the first quarter of 2017; all information is in U.S. dollars.)\nTORONTO and TAMPA, FL, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Cott Corporation (NYSE:COT; TSX:BCB) today announced its results ended March 31, 2018.\nFollowing the closing of the sale of Cott's traditional business on January 30, 2018, Cott became a pure play water, coffee and filtration business. In keeping with Cott's new \"better for you\" business focus, Cott has updated its corporate logo to reflect its new business of water and coffee services.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS â€“ CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nRevenue increased 4% (3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and adjusted for comparable trading days) to $561 million compared to $537 million.\nReported net income and net income per diluted share were $5 million and $0.03, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $65 million.\nCott completed the sale of its traditional beverage manufacturing business to Refresco Group N.V. (\"Refresco\") on January 30, 2018 for $1.25 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion of proceeds were utilized to repay outstanding debt (inclusive of principal, premium and interest payments). As of March 31, 2018, Cott's leverage was 3.6 times (net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA).\nOn March 23, 2018, Cott completed the acquisition of Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc., a direct-to-consumer home and office water, coffee, and filtration services business. On April 9, 2018, Cott sold its PolyCycle Solutions assets to Consolidated Container Company. The net impact of these two transactions on 2018 revenues is expected to be an increase of approximately $30 million.\nCott increased targeted full year 2018 revenues to over $2.35 billion to reflect the Crystal Rock and PolyCycle transactions.\nCott increased targeted full year 2018 cash flow provided by operations to reflect the Crystal Rock and PolyCycle transactions to approximately $235 million with capital expenditures in the range of $115 to $120 million, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $115 to $120 million (when excluding acquisition, integration, and other working capital adjustments).\nOn May 1, 2018, Cott's Board of Directors approved a $50 million share repurchase plan.\n\"I am pleased with the activity undertaken and the results of the first quarter. In addition to our continuing revenue and EBITDA growth, we closed on the sale of our traditional business which reduced our debt by around $1 billion, we received approval from our Board of Directors to rebrand Cott's corporate identity to reflect the change in the business and approved a stock repurchase program,\" commented Jerry Fowden, Cott's Chief Executive Officer.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 GLOBAL PERFORMANCE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nRevenue increased 4% to $561 million (3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and adjusted for comparable trading days) as each of the operating segments generated growth during the quarter. Revenue drivers in the quarter are tabulated below:\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue Bridge\n2017 Q1 Revenue\n$\n536.9\nRoute Based Services\n+8.3\nCoffee, Tea and Extract Solutions\n+7.7\nFewer trading days (1)\n-6.4\nForeign exchange (1)\n+14.6\nOther\n-0.3\n2018 Q1 Revenue\n$\n560.8\n(1) See Exhibit 5 for details by reporting segment\nGross profit increased 2% to $274 million, driven primarily by revenue growth within our operating segments, offset in part by increases in previously disclosed freight costs within our Route Based Services segment alongside a change in customer mix within our Coffee, Tea and Extract solutions segment.\nInterest expense was $21 million. The proceeds from the sale of our traditional business were used to redeem the remaining $250 million of our 10% DS senior secured notes and $525 million of our 5.375% notes, and to pay off the outstanding balance on our asset-based lending facility. As a result, interest expense is expected to be approximately $57 million for the remainder of 2018 or $78 million in total for fiscal year 2018.\nReported net income and net income per diluted share were $5 million and $0.03, respectively, compared to reported net loss and net loss per diluted share of $10 million and $0.07, respectively.\nReported EBITDA was $74 million compared to $50 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $65 million driven primarily by revenue growth within our operating segments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $23 million, less $30 million of capital expenditures resulted in free cash flow of ($7) million or $7 million of adjusted free cash flow (adjusted for acquisition, integration, and other working capital adjustments) compared to adjusted free cash flow of $9 million in the prior year.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 REPORTING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\nRoute Based Services\nRevenue increased 5% (2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and adjusted for comparable trading days) to $371 million. A detailed breakdown is tabulated below.\nRoute Based Services\nRevenue Bridge\n2017 Q1 Revenue\n$\n352.3\nHOD Water related\n+2.5\nRetail\n+3.9\nFiltration\n+0.9\nOCS\n-1.1\nOther\n+2.1\nFewer trading days\n-1.3\nForeign exchange impact\n+11.8\n2018 Q1 Revenue\n$\n371.1\nGross profit increased 3% to $228 million, driven primarily by increased revenue, offset in part by freight and transportation costs.\nOperating income increased 32% to $12 million, due primarily to the increase in gross profit.\nCoffee, Tea and Extract Solutions\nRevenue increased 2% (5% adjusted for comparable trading days) driven primarily by 3% growth in coffee pounds sold (7% adjusted for comparable trading days) and growth in liquid coffee and extracts.\nCoffee, Tea and Extract Solutions\nRevenue Bridge\n2017 Q1 Revenue\n$\n143.3\nCoffee volume\n+7.5\nCoffee price/mix\n-5.4\nLiquid coffee and extracts\n+4.1\nOther\n+1.5\nFewer trading days\n-4.9\n2018 Q1 Revenue\n$\n146.1\nGross profit was $39 million compared to $42 million due to a $2 million commodity hedging gain recorded in the prior year as well as fewer trading days.\nOperating income was $4 million compared to $6 million due to a $2 million commodity hedging gain recorded in the prior year as well as fewer trading days.\n2018 FULL YEAR FOREIGN EXCHANGE, REVENUE, AND FREE CASH FLOW OUTLOOK FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nCott increased the targeted full year 2018 consolidated revenue to over $2.35 billion and full year 2018 cash flow provided by operations to approximately $235 million with capital expenditures in the range of $115 to $120 million, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $115 to $120 million (when excluding acquisition, integration, and other working capital adjustments).\nGreen coffee commodity market prices have been declining since the end of 2016. At current rates, in conjunction with the timing of various pricing agreements, we would expect to see a 0.5% to 1% lowering of our quarterly consolidated revenues with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold. As a majority of our coffee purchases are incorporated into our hedging program, the changes in pricing will operate similar to a pass-through mechanism and as a result our profitability will not be materially impacted by revenue impacts caused by the market movement in green coffee prices.\nSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nCott's board of directors has determined that the repurchase of a portion of Cott's outstanding common shares is an appropriate use of available cash and is in the best interests of Cott and its shareowners. In order to facilitate repurchases, the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") has approved Cott's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid for a portion of its common shares as appropriate opportunities arise from time to time. The total size of the repurchase is capped at $50 million. Repurchases will be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") and other alternative Canadian trading systems in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Cott may begin to purchase common shares on or about May 7, 2018.\nAs of April 23, 2018, Cott's public float was 137,685,569 common shares, with 140,188,624 common shares issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the notice, up to 10% of the public float, or 13,768,557 common shares, may be repurchased during the 12-month period commencing May 7, 2018 and ending on May 6, 2019, subject to the aggregate $50 million cap. Of this amount, up to 7,009,431 common shares may be repurchased through the facilities of the NYSE. Common shares will be repurchased at then-current market prices. Pursuant to the TSX rules, the maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased during a single trading day on the TSX is 38,601, representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of 154,406 of Cott's common shares on the TSX for the past six months, subject to certain exceptions for block repurchases. Rule 10b-18 contains similar volume-based restrictions on daily purchases on the NYSE, subject to certain exceptions for block repurchases. Cott will fund the purchases through cash on hand, and repurchased common shares will be cancelled.\nThe notice of intention provides that no appraisal or valuation regarding Cott, its material assets or securities, has been prepared within the two years preceding the date of the notice.\nTo the knowledge of Cott, no director, senior officer or other insider of Cott currently intends to sell any Common Shares under the bid. However, sales by such persons through the facilities of the TSX or NYSE may occur if the personal circumstances of any such person change or any such person makes a decision unrelated to these normal course purchases. The benefits to any such person whose Common Shares are purchased would be the same as the benefits available to all other securityholders whose Common Shares are purchased.\nCott will enter into an automatic purchase plan in relation to purchases under the normal course issuer bid. The automatic purchase plan will allow for the purchase of Common Shares, subject to certain trading parameters, at times when Cott ordinarily would not be active in the market due to its own internal trading black-out period, insider trading rules or otherwise. Outside of these periods, Common Shares may also be repurchased in accordance with management's discretion and in compliance with applicable law.\n\"We are pleased to announce today that a share repurchase program has been approved by our Board of Directors and the TSX. This program is an integral part of our capital deployment strategy which also incorporates an acceleration of our complementary tuck-in acquisition plan,\" commented Mr. Fowden.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS CONFERENCE CALL\nCott Corporation will host a conference call today, May 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET, to discuss first quarter results, which can be accessed as follows:\nNorth America: (888) 231-8191\nInternational: (647) 427-7450\nConference ID: 4264928\nA live audio webcast will be available through Cott's website at http://www.cott.com . The earnings conference call will be recorded and archived for playback on the investor relations section of the website for a period of two weeks following the event.\nABOUT COTT CORPORATION\nCott is a water, coffee, tea, extracts and filtration service company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North American and European home and office bottled water delivery industry and a leader in custom coffee roasting, blending of iced tea, and extract solutions for the U.S. foodservice industry. Our platform reaches over 2.4 million customers or delivery points across North America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and distributors. This enables us to efficiently service residences, businesses, restaurant chains, hotels and motels, small and large retailers, and healthcare facilities.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement its reporting of financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, Cott utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Cott excludes from GAAP revenue the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of additional trading days in the prior period to separate the impact of these factors from Cott's results of operations. Cott utilizes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a global basis to separate the impact of certain items from the underlying business. Because Cott uses these adjusted financial results in the management of its business, management believes this supplemental information is useful to investors for their independent evaluation and understanding of Cott's underlying business performance and the performance of its management. Additionally, Cott supplements its reporting of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP by excluding additions to property, plant & equipment to present free cash flow, and by excluding acquisition and integration cash costs as well as a working capital adjustment related to the Concentrate Supply Agreement with Refresco to present adjusted free cash flow, which management believes provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing common shares, and strengthening the balance sheet. The non-GAAP financial measures described above are in addition to, and not meant to be considered superior to, or a substitute for, Cott's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings announcement reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 conveying management's expectations as to the future based on plans, estimates and projections at the time Cott makes the statements.
