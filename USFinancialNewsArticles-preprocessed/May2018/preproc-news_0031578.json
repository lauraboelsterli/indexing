Gen. (Ret.) Barbara J. Faulkenberry and Joseph C. Gatto, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). The shareholders also re-elected Board Chairman Richard L. Flury. General Faulkenberry and Messrs. Flury and Gatto were each nominated to the Board of Directors by management in the Company's proxy statement dated March 23, 2018.\nOur newest independent Board member, Major General (Ret.) Faulkenberry, retired from the U.S. Air Force in 2014 as a Major General (2-stars) after a 32-year career. Her last assignment was as Vice Commander (COO) and interim Commander (CEO) of a 37,000-person organization conducting Department of Defense air logistics including cargo/passenger, air refueling, and patient movements across the globe. During her military career, General Faulkenberry served in a wide variety of operational and leadership positions, including Director of Mobility Forces for the U.S. Central Command during the drawdown of forces in Iraq and the simultaneous buildup in Afghanistan. Her staff assignments included experience in operations, logistics, strategy, governmental affairs and leadership development.

As a member of the management team, Joe has been a critical element to Callon's strategic growth in the Permian Basin, and we welcome his further contributions as a member the Board. On behalf of the Board, we look forward to leveraging both new members' insights and expertise to build upon Callon's success in the years to come.\"\nCallon Petroleum Company is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and operation of oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin in West Texas.\nThis news release is posted on the Company's website at www.callon.com , and will be archived for subsequent review under the \"News\" link on the top of the homepage.\nMark Brewer\nDirector of Investor Relations\n281-589-5200\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/callon-petroleum-company-announces-election-of-new-directors-to-the-board-300647924.html\nSOURCE Callon Petroleum Company",
