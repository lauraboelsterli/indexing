    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 8:24 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Halep races past Osaka in Rome, Wozniacki advances Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - World number one Simona Halep produced a ruthless display to see off Japan’s Naomi Osaka 6-1 6-0 in the second round of the Italian Open on Wednesday.\nRomanian Halep was forced to save four break points in her opening service game for 1-1 but then went on to claim 12 consecutive games to avenge her Indian Wells loss to eventual champion Osaka in March.\nThe 20-year-old Osaka failed to convert any of her six break-point opportunities before conceding the match in just under an hour.\n“I just tried to build my points, to build a little bit of space and open the court, and tried to make winners,” Halep said.\n“It’s tough to make winners on this court, for me, but it’s good when I can build the point. I just want to play like today.”\nHalep will next meet American Madison Keys, who clinched a 7-6(2) 7-6(0) win over Croatian qualifier Donna Vekic.\nSecond seed Caroline Wozniacki began her campaign with a comfortable 6-1 6-4 victory over Belgian Alison van Uytvanck.\nThe 27-year-old Dane, chasing her first claycourt title since 2011, will face 15th seed Anastasija Sevastova for a place in the quarter-finals.\nA decade after they last met in Rome, Maria Sharapova once again did enough to secure a victory over Dominika Cibulkova in three sets.\nFormer world number one Sharapova struck 41 winners as she rallied back from a set down to edge her Slovakian opponent 3-6 6-4 6-2 in a thrilling 2-1/2 hour contest.
