Brazil's head coach Tite shows the list with his 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia during a news conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes\nGeromel has just two caps but was outstanding in leading the Porto Alegre side to the Copa Libertadores last season.\nFagner and Manchester City’s Danilo are the two right backs drafted in to replace Dani Alves, who was ruled out with a knee injury last weekend.\nCassio, who has just one cap, was selected as the third goalkeeper behind regulars Alisson (Roma) and Ederson (Manchester City).\nNeymar, who was been out with an injured foot since Feb. 25, is in the squad and expected to be fit by early June.\nThe only country to win the World Cup five times, Brazil kick off their World Cup campaign against Switzerland on June 17 before playing Costa Rica and Serbia in Group E.
