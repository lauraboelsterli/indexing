    "text": "Management reaffirms outlook for adjusted EPS growth of more than 30 percent in 2018\nST. LOUIS, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nA PDF accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/2b4eb7d5-af24-4c92-ac66-b1dc43e84411\nRevenues of $325 million in Q1’18 were on par with Q1’17, as record quarterly Energy Services revenues mitigated the lost contribution from the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project, which was substantially completed during FY’17.\nQ1’18 loss per diluted share was $0.06 compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.17 in Q1’17. Q1’18 adjusted (non-GAAP) 1 earnings per diluted share were $0.13 compared to $0.18 in Q1’17.\nContract backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $718 million, an increase of $58 million, or 9 percent, from contract backlog at March 31, 2017, each excluding backlog for the large deepwater pipe coating and insulation project. New orders grew 1 percent compared to Q1’17 to $353 million, overcoming the impact of exiting the Fyfe North America structural construction business in FY’17.\n1 Adjusted (non-GAAP) results exclude certain charges related to the Company’s restructuring activities, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses and credit facility amendment fees. Reconciliation of adjusted results is included below.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nInfrastructure Solutions' adjusted operating income declined from Q1’17 primarily due to weather impacts of more than $3 million, or $0.08 per share.\nCorrosion Protection delivered results in line with expectations, with declines primarily attributed to lost contributions from the large deepwater project that was substantially completed in FY’17.\nEnergy Services delivered record quarterly revenues of $92 million and more than doubled operating income due to stronger than expected Q1’18 turnaround activity.\nQ1’18 results benefited from favorable discrete tax adjustments of approximately $0.03 per share. Management expects the full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be between 23 and 24 percent.\n“Aegion delivered solid first quarter results, despite the impact of severe winter weather that affected parts of the U.S. and Canada for the first four months of the year. Order intake growth remained robust, overcoming the impacts of exiting the Fyfe North America structural construction business. We also ended the first quarter with a strong backlog position of $718 million.\nAs we look forward, we are working to recover lost Q1’18 volumes within the Infrastructure Solutions segment and we are starting to see positive momentum in our U.S. and Canada cathodic protection businesses. We remain confident in our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of more than 30 percent in 2018.”\nCharles R.
