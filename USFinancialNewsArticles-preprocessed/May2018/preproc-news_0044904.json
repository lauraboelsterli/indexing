    "text": "– Commercialization Expertise Beneficial as SetPoint Advances its Clinical Program –\nVALENCIA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SetPoint Medical , a clinical-stage biomedical technology company developing bioelectronic therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases, announced today the appointment of Ankit Shah as Senior Director of Commercialization and Marketing. Mr. Shah has more than a decade of experience developing and commercializing innovative medical technology.\nMr. Shah will oversee SetPoint’s efforts to commercialize its proprietary bioelectronic device as the company advances their bioelectronic medicine approach to treat autoimmune inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and multiple sclerosis.\n“SetPoint is pleased to welcome Ankit. Ankit’s experience and drive will help in the development and implementation of our commercialization strategy,” said Anthony Arnold , Chief Executive Officer of SetPoint Medical. “Ankit can help us advance this new approach for treating inflammatory diseases through the approval and reimbursement processes to ultimately expand treatment options for patients suffering from some very debilitating conditions.”\nSetPoint is developing a novel proprietary bioelectronic medicine platform that targets the body’s natural Inflammatory Reflex to activate systemic anti-inflammatory pathways. The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine aims to address unmet patient needs by delivering targeted digital doses to modulate physiological circuits for treatment of diseases historically treated with drugs.\nPrior to joining SetPoint, Mr. Shah was the Senior Director of Marketing and Business Development at Intersect ENT (NASDAQ: XENT). He joined Intersect ENT as a founding member of the commercialization team and led their product marketing and physician education initiatives. He also held positions at Medtronic, SV Health Investors and was awarded a fellowship grant from the Food and Drug Administration. He holds a B.S. and M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Marquette University and an M.B.A. in Health Care Management from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nAbout SetPoint Medical\nSetPoint Medical is a privately held biomedical technology company dedicated to treating patients with debilitating inflammatory diseases using bioelectronic therapy. SetPoint’s approach is intended to offer patients and providers a treatment alternative for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory diseases with less risk and cost than drug therapy.\nSetPoint is developing a novel bioelectronic medicine platform that stimulates the vagus nerve to activate the body’s natural Inflammatory Reflex, which is intended to produce a potent systemic anti-inflammatory effect. The company has published positive results from a first-in-human proof-of-concept trial in rheumatoid arthritis in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and presented positive results at the American College of Rheumatology meeting. Current investors in the company include Morgenthaler Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Topspin Partners, Medtronic, GlaxoSmithKline’s Action Potential Venture Capital Limited and Boston Scientific.
