    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Defence Ministry on Sunday expressed its opposition to what it called “provocation” by two U.S. warships that sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China.\nThe U.S. action seriously infringed upon Chinese sovereignty because the warships entered Chinese territorial waters without permission, the ministry said in a short statement.\nChinese ships and aircraft were sent to warn the U.S. ships to leave, it added.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
