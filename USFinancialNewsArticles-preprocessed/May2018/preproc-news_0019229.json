REUTERS/Luc Gnago/File Photo\nTanzania, Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer, is seeking to reap more profits from its vast mineral resources by overhauling the fiscal and regulatory regime of its mining sector but the moves have alarmed companies and investors.\n“AngloGold Ashanti has ... sought constructive dialogue with the government of Tanzania, which has indicated its willingness to engage. The parties will work toward a mutually agreeable time for those discussions to take place,” the company said in a quarterly market update.\nUnder new regulations the mining ministry passed in January, Tanzania will now make it compulsory for foreign-owned mining groups to offer shares to the government and local companies.\nChief Executive Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, told a media conference call that AngloGold was also having problems getting VAT refunds from the Tanzanian government which he said was “locking up close to $3 to $4 million a month.”\nHe also said the company was affected by a 2 percent hike in royalties and a 1 percent increase in levies, which had lifted costs on its Geita mine there.\nGeita’s cash costs rose 31 percent to $892 an ounce in the March quarter from the same period last year, underscoring the scale of the additional burden on the company.\nThe company said it is on track to meet its annual production forecast of between 3.325 and 3.450 million ounces for 2018 after producing 824,000 ounces in the quarter to the end of March, down slightly from 830,000 ounces in the same period last year.\nFull financial results are done every six months.
