(NASDAQ:AKCA), an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., focused on developing and commercializing drugs to treat patients with serious and rare diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The company reported a net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $30 million on a GAAP basis and $23 million on a pro forma basis. Akcea had $245 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2018. In April, Akcea received an additional $200 million of cash for the issuance of 10.7 million shares to Ionis, providing additional funds to launch two drugs in 2018 and advance the Company’s pipeline, including AKCEA-TTR-L Rx .\n“With our acquisition of the TTR franchise from Ionis, we accelerated our growth and are now in a position to potentially launch two rare disease drugs this year. The addition of the TTR franchise allows us to efficiently scale our business and provide a strong foundation for future growth,” said Paula Soteropoulos, chief executive officer of Akcea. “This past quarter we have been focused on completing the build out of the commercial teams, to launch both inotersen, which we plan to market under the brand name TEGSEDI and volanesorsen, which we plan to market under the brand name WAYLIVRA TM . We are also supporting the FCS and hATTR patient communities through early access programs. As we look toward approval of both drugs, we are confident that we are prepared to successfully launch and deliver these drugs to two underserved, rare disease patient communities.”\n“The FDA has extended the review period for TEGSEDI and has assigned a new PDUFA goal date of October 6, 2018. The FDA determined that they need additional time to review our responses to their standard information requests and we are working closely with them to advance the review of our filing as quickly as possible,” said Sarah Boyce, president of Akcea. “Additionally, our discussions with the EU and Canada continue to progress well. We are moving forward at full speed to bring TEGSEDI to people with this devastating and fatal disease as quickly as possible after approval.”\n“The addition of the TTR franchise has created meaningful value for our shareholders. We are now preparing to realize commercial revenue from two products this year. With the $200 million cash infusion from Ionis, we have approximately $445 million of cash on a pro forma basis, which we believe is sufficient to execute on our key milestones through 2019,” said Michael MacLean, chief financial officer of Akcea.\n2018 Upcoming Events\nPotential approval and launch of TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA this year in the US, EU and Canada. Report top-line results in the second half of 2018 from a Phase 2b trial of AKCEA-APO(a)-L Rx in patients with high lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a). Initiate Phase 1 clinical studies of AKCEA-TTR-L Rx .\nRecent Key Highlights\nAnnouncement and closing of the partnership with Ionis to commercialize the TTR franchise. Addition of Sarah Boyce to Akcea as president and a member of Akcea’s board of directors. Initiation of the WAYLIVRA global Early Access Program including initiation of the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) in the UK for the treatment of people with FCS. Presentation of multiple data sets at the International Symposium on Amyloidosis (ISA) including the NEURO-TTR and Open Label Extension Studies for TEGSEDI and the preclinical data set for AKCEA-TTR-L Rx . Presentation of AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx Phase 1/2 results at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Annual Scientific Session and Expo. Convening of the first FCS global connection summit where the patient leaders named the first Friday in November as FCS Awareness Day.\nFinancial Results\nAll pro forma amounts referred to in this press release exclude non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards. Please refer to the reconciliation of pro forma and GAAP measures, which is provided later in this release.\nRevenue\nAkcea’s revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $17 million. Akcea’s revenue to date is entirely related to the Company’s collaboration with Novartis comprised of the $75 million upfront payment and the purchase of Ionis stock by Novartis at a premium of $33 million. On January 1, 2018, Akcea adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to equity of approximately $12 million as of that date primarily related to the change in measuring progress of the Phase 2 trials for AKCEA-APO(a)-L Rx and AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx .\nOperating Expenses\nAkcea’s operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on a GAAP basis were $47 million and $41 million on a pro forma basis. These amounts compare to GAAP operating expenses of $69 million and pro forma operating expenses of $66 million for the same period in 2017. Akcea’s pro forma operating expenses decreased for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the one-time sub-license expense of $48 million paid to Ionis in the first quarter of 2017 related to Akcea’s collaboration with Novartis. However, this decrease is reduced by a $23 million increase in Akcea’s pro forma operating expenses related to development and commercialization activities in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet Loss\nAkcea reported a net loss of $30 million on a GAAP basis for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $64 million for the same period in 2017. Akcea reported a pro forma net loss of $23 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $61 million for the same period in 2017. This is primarily due to the one-time sub-license expense of $48 million paid to Ionis in the first quarter of 2017 related to Akcea’s collaboration with Novartis. For the first quarter of 2018, basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock was $0.44.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018 Akcea had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $245 million compared to $260 million at December 31, 2017. With the $200 million cash infusion from Ionis in April of 2018, Akcea has approximately $445 million on a pro forma basis, which is sufficient to execute on key milestones through 2019.\nConference Call\nAt 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, May 3, 2018, Akcea will conduct a live webcast conference call to discuss this earnings release and related activities. Interested parties may listen to the call by dialing (855) 237-2439, passcode 1497015 or access the webcast at www.akceatx.com .
