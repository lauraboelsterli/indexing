A broker reacts while trading at his computer terminal at a stock brokerage firm in Mumbai, August 24, 2015. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files\nThe broader NSE Nifty closed 1.01 percent lower at 10,430.35, while the benchmark BSE Sensex fell 0.88 percent to 34,344.91. Both the indexes fell over 1 percent in the last hour of trading.\nHindustan Petroleum declined nearly 8 percent, while ONGC dropped 5.3 percent.\nVedanta Ltd fell 6.4 percent to its lowest close since June 30, 2017, after an Indian court halted the proposed expansion of Vedanta Resources Plcâ€™s copper smelter in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. On Tuesday, 11 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of the plant on environmental grounds. Reporting by Krishna V Kurup in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu",
