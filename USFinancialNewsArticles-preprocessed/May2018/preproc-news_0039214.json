    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cheniere Energy, Inc. (“Cheniere”) (NYSE American: LNG) announced today that it has submitted a proposal to the board of directors of Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (“Cheniere Partners Holdings”) (NYSE American: CQH) to acquire the publicly held shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings not already owned by Cheniere in a stock for stock exchange. Subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, Cheniere is proposing consideration of 0.4500 Cheniere shares for each outstanding publicly-held share of Cheniere Partners Holdings as part of a transaction that would be structured as a merger of Cheniere Partners Holdings with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere. The proposed consideration represents a value of $28.24 per common share of Cheniere Partners Holdings based on the closing price of Cheniere’s shares as of May 16, 2018. The proposed transaction is expected to be a tax-free exchange to Cheniere Partners Holdings’ shareholders.\nThe proposed transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and approval of such definitive agreement and transactions contemplated thereunder by the board of directors of Cheniere, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and a conflicts committee established by the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and the consummation of the proposed transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that any such approvals will be forthcoming, that a definitive agreement will be executed, or that any transaction will be consummated.\nAbout Cheniere\nCheniere Energy, Inc., a Houston-based energy company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses, owns and operates the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana. Directly and through its subsidiary, Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P., Cheniere is developing, constructing, and operating liquefaction projects near Corpus Christi, Texas and at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, respectively. Cheniere is also exploring a limited number of opportunities directly related to its existing LNG business.\nFor additional information, please refer to the Cheniere website at www.cheniere.com and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
