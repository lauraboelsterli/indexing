    "text": "LISHUI, China, May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tantech Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: TANH), (\"Tantech\" or the \"Company\"), an alternative energy company with diversified operations, including the manufacturing of bamboo-based charcoal products and Electric Vehicles (EVs), today announced its financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights (All Figures Approximated)\nTotal revenues increased by 6.3%, or approximately $2.6 million, to $43.1 million Total gross profit from following segments decreased by 18.2%, or approximately $2.4 million, to $10.7 million\n- Gross profit from the Company's Consumer Products segment decreased by 33.6%, or $4.2 million, to $8.3 million\n- Gross profit from the Company's Trading segment decreased by 21.0%, or $0.1 million, to $0.4 million\n- Revenues from newly acquired Electronic Vehicle segment was approximately $8.6 million.\nDespite the decline in gross profit, the Company was still able to achieve net income attributable to common stockholders of $3.8 million, or $0.15 per share for fiscal year 2017 The Company expects increased revenue and a concerted increase in development of new electric vehicle models in 2018 and beyond driven by innovation, new business development initiatives and more streamlined operations\nMr. Zhengyu Wang, Chairman and CEO of Tantech said, \"During the reporting period, the Company continued to implement its transformation efforts by focusing on special purpose electric automobiles. The Company made a concerted effort to create efficiencies and improve competitiveness. During the reporting period, the Company reported $43.1 million in revenue and $3.8 million in net profit attributed to shareholders.\nIn FY 2017, the Company acquired a 70% ownership interest in Suzhou E Motors Co., Ltd. (\"Suzhou E-Motors\"), a Chinese manufacturer of special purpose electric vehicles and power batteries. After the acquisition, Suzhou E-Motors became a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. During the reporting period, Suzhou E-Motors generated $1.9 million in revenue.\"\nMr. Wang continued, \"In a bid to improve efficiencies, the Company agreed to dispose of its Electric Double-Layer Capacitor (\"EDLC\") carbon business during the reporting period. Compared to lithium-ion batteries, EDLC carbon, the key material to make super capacitors, is more environmentally friendly and requires less time to recharge. However, as China's policies prefer lithium-ion batteries over other battery technologies in the electric automobile industry, demand for EDLC and super capacitors has shrunk sharply. Recognizing the challenges, the Company in December sold the EDLC carbon business to a Chinese start-up company controlled by Dr. Zaihua Chen, the Company's former Chief Technology Officer.\n\"In early 2018, the Company also acquired an 18% equity interest in Libo Haokun Stone Co., which owns a small marble quarry in the southwestern province of Guizhou, for $18.2 million. Since its establishment, the Company has accumulated rich customer resources and has built a strong brand image in home decoration and indoor air purification. With China's growing economy and rising household income, marble has become a favored choice for commercial construction and home decoration because of its endurance and environmentally friendly fabrication process. The investment in Libo Haokun was aimed at diversifying risk and creating more value for our shareholders.,\" continued Mr. Wang.\n\"Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, as China makes adjustments to government policies for alternative energy automobiles, the Company will accelerate the research and development for and launch of new models, expand production capacity and improve product competitiveness to satisfy various demands and will work toward realizing its goal of becoming the leading manufacturer of special purpose electric automobiles in China.\" Mr. Wang concluded.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by approximately $2.6 million, or 6.3%, to approximately $43.1 million in fiscal 2017 from approximately $40.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to approximately $8.6 million in revenue from our new electronic vehicle (\"EV\") segment and approximately $1.3 million increase in revenue from our trading segment, offset by a $7.7 million decrease in revenue from our consumer product segment.\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\n($'000)\nGross\nProfit\n($'000)\nGross\nMargin\n(%)\nRevenues\n($'000)\nGross\nProfit\n($'000)\nGross\nMargin\n(%)\nConsumer product\n32,676\n8,319\n25.5%\n39,979\n12,528\n31.3%\nTrading\n1,829\n417\n22.8%\n554\n528\n95.3%\nElectric Vehicles\n8,579\n1,943\n22.7%\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n43,084\n10,679\n24.8%\n40,533\n13,056\n32.2%\nRevenues for the consumer product segment decreased by $7.7 million, or 18%, to $32.7 million for fiscal 2017 from $40.0 million for fiscal 2016. The gross margin of our consumer product segment decreased from 31.3% in fiscal 2016 to 25.5% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in our revenue from our consumer product segment in 2017 was due to decreasing orders from the company's traditional selling channels. During fiscal 2017, the Company gradually reduced its relationships with certain supermarket customers with low selling prices and unfavorable profit margins. On the other hand, the Company increased sales to distributors during the current period. In response to market competition, the Company also reduced its average selling price by approximately 3% to 5% to satisfy customers' demand in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.\nIn our trading segment, revenue was approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2017, increasing 230% from $0.6 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, we dropped the trading business of non-\"Charcoal Doctor\" products, because those products disrupted our own branded charcoal products sales. The change in marketing strategy caused lower sales volume and revenue in fiscal 2016. Starting in fiscal 2017, the Company focused on promoting \"Charcoal Doctor\" products in the market. As a result, our domestic sales of \"Charcoal Doctor\" products increased from $0.1 million in fiscal 2016 to $1.4 million in fiscal 2017, while export sales remained around $0.4 million in both years. The gross margin in export sales is generally higher than in domestic sales. The decline in gross margin in fiscal 2017 was due to the fact that approximately 76% of sales in fiscal 2017 were made to the domestic market with lower margins, compared to only 19% sales to domestic market in fiscal 2016.\nOn July 12, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of 70% of the equity interests of Suzhou E-Motors Co., Ltd (\"E-Motors\"), a specialty electric vehicles and power batteries manufacturer based in Zhang Jia Gang City, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China. The revenue for our new EV segment was approximately $8.6 million in fiscal 2017 with a gross margin of 22.6%. The Company sold 196 electronic vehicles in fiscal 2017 with an average price of approximately $47,000.\nAs mentioned above, until recently, the Company had another Biofuel Energy segment, which primarily produces and sells BBQ charcoal and bamboo-based fuel for EDLC. Our EDLC carbon and low emission barbecue charcoal products are facing increasing challenges from rapid technology innovation, competition from large international rivals, and our limited sales network for these products. Thus, we decided to cease operations of our EDLC carbon segment and sold certain key assets to an entity headed by our former Chief Technology Officer. On December 14, 2017, the Company and ZheJiang Apeikesi Energy Technology Co., Ltd signed a purchase agreement, pursuant to which, the Purchaser agreed to acquire certain assets and all copyrights and technology know-how related to EDLC carbon business from the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Tantech Energy.\nCost of revenues\nOur cost of revenues increased by approximately $4.9 million or 17.9% to approximately $32.4 million in fiscal 2017 from approximately $27.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in cost of revenues was mainly attributable to approximately $6.6 million cost of revenue for EV segment.\nGross profit\nOur gross profit decreased by approximately $2.3 million, or 18.2%, to approximately $10.7 million in fiscal 2017 from approximately $13 million in fiscal 2016. The gross profit margin was 24.8% in fiscal 2017, as compared to 32.2% in fiscal 2016. On a segment basis, gross margins for consumer product and trading were 25.5% and 22.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, compared to 31.3%, and 95.4%, respectively, for fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the lower selling price related our consumer products and trading segment in fiscal 2017.\nSelling expenses\nSelling expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million to approximately $0.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to $0.3 million of selling expense in our EV segment, which is our new business segment acquired in fiscal 2017. The selling expense for our consumer product segment and trading segment decreased by $0.2 million comparing to fiscal 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million or 28.4%, to approximately $4.7 million in fiscal 2017 from approximately $3.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to additional allowances of $2.6 million provided for the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 358.4%, to $0.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $0.1 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to our R&D efforts in our new EV segment during the second half of fiscal 2017. We intend to focus more efforts on the EV segment going forward.\nProvision for income taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of approximately $0.2 million or 11.2% from approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2016. Even though the Company had a lower income before income tax from continuing operations, the Company provided full valuation allowance on bad debt reserves due to uncertainties in realizing those tax benefits in the future, which resulted in higher income tax provision in fiscal 2017.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\nOur net income attributable to common stockholders was approximately $3.8 million in fiscal 2017, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million from approximately $4.3 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease was attributable to the factors described above.\nRecent Updates\nAs previously reported, on January 10, 2018, the Company signed a share purchase agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Shanghai Shicai Minerals Co., Ltd. (\"Shanghai Shicai\") to acquire all of the shares of Lishui Xincai Industrial Co., Ltd. (\"Lishui XinCai\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Shicai, at a price of approximately $18.2 million (or RMB 120 million). Lishui Xincai owns 18% of the equity interests in Libo Haokun Stone Co., Ltd. (\"Libo Haokun\"). Following the completion of the acquisition, the Company indirectly holds a 18% stake in Libo Haokun. Libo Haokun holds a government-issued permit and has the exclusive right to mine a 0.11-square-kilometer marble quarry in the southwestern province of Guizhou, China. According to a geological report issued by Liaoning Nuclear Geological Survey Institute in June 2016, the quarry had estimated reserves of approximately 4.02 million cubic meters of ores.\nAbout Tantech Holdings Ltd.\nEstablished in 2001 and headquartered in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China, Tantech Holdings Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, primarily develops and manufactures bamboo-based charcoal products in China and internationally.
