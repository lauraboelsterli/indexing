    "text": "Tel Aviv, Israel, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InspireMD, Inc. (NYSE American:NSPR), a leader in embolic prevention systems (EPS) / thrombus management technologies and neurovascular devices, today announced results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 highlights:\nAchieves revenue of $1.0 million for Q1 2018 versus $569,000 in Q1 2017, an increase of 77% Total CGuard™ EPS sales increase 132% to $831,000 for Q1 2018 5th consecutive quarter of sequential double-digit growth Continues global expansion setting up distribution in South Korea, Greece and the Carribean. Achieves regulatory approvals and launches CGuard TM in India and Peru Ends Q1 with $4.6 million of cash plus an additional $4.1 million in net proceeds from capital raise that closed in Q2\nJames Barry, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of InspireMD, commented, “We are pleased to report sales in excess of $1 million for the first quarter of 2018. This marks a major milestone since full implementation of our new commercial strategy in Q3 of 2017. Achieving this level of sales in such a short time is a tribute to our operational and commercial teams, as well as the growing physician enthusiasm and appreciation for CGuard™ EPS. Specifically, sales of CGuard TM EPS increased by 132% versus the same period last year. We believe this sets the foundation for continued growth in 2018. At the same time, we are building strong support among key opinion leaders, illustrated by the featured presentations at top industry conferences and publication of clinical results in leading journals.”\n“Given the enthusiasm by leading physicians, including their conducting investigator initiated clinical trials, we remain confident in the potential for CGuard™ EPS to become the preferred option for patients that are candidates for carotid artery stenting (CAS). In addition, clinical data suggests that CGuard™ EPS may offer a safer alternative to the surgical gold standard carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This could significantly expand the addressable market for CGuard TM given the safety advantages of our device, as we believe more physicians, including surgeons, would choose a minimally invasive procedure over surgery for their patients.”\n“Having met previously with the FDA regarding our investigational device exemption (IDE) submission for CGuard™ EPS, we are now evaluating plans to restart the regulatory approval process in the United States. Concurrently, we are exploring other synergistic opportunities and product extensions that may allow us to leverage our distribution network and growing sales channels in Europe, Asia and Latin America.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1,007,000 compared to $569,000 during the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of CGuard™ EPS as we transitioned from our prior exclusive distribution partner for most of Europe to local distributors, continued focus on expanding existing markets such as Germany and Italy and expanding into new geographies such as India. Total operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $2,246,000, a decrease of 9.4% compared to $2,478,000 for the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses and a decrease in salary expenses, primarily due to a salary related accrual in 2017, partially offset by an increase in legal expenses. Financial expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $436,000 compared to $154,000 for the same period in 2017, largely due to a non-cash expense associated with our preferred stock.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $2,389,000, or $1.08 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2,559,000, or $28.31 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $4,637,000, compared to $3,710,000 as of December 31, 2017. Based on the Company’s current business plan, the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements for approximately 12 months from the date of the balance sheet.\nAbout InspireMD, Inc.\nInspireMD seeks to utilize its proprietary MicroNet™ technology to make its products the industry standard for embolic protection and to provide a superior solution to the key clinical issues of current stenting in patients with a high risk of distal embolization, no reflow and major adverse cardiac events.\nInspireMD intends to pursue applications of this MicroNet technology in coronary, carotid (CGuard™), neurovascular, and peripheral artery procedures.
