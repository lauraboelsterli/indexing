    "text": "If you think you've snagged just what you need to cover your college costs this fall, think again.\nThat's because while universities give families an idea of how much it costs to attend school, those estimates can be inaccurate — particularly for students who opt to live off campus.\nAs many as a third of colleges and universities understate the local cost of living by at least $3,000, researchers found .\nRoom, board, transportation expenses and other miscellaneous costs add to the actual cost of attendance and can vary sharply from your school's best estimates.\n\"Colleges estimate the cost for those who live off campus, and that's what the student uses when they decide what to budget for,\" said Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University.\n\"For instance, juniors will think of getting a cheaper place that's further away from campus, but they don't think about the cost of commuting,\" she said.\nAs a result, students will have to do their own research to arrive at the true cost of attendance and then calculate whether they have enough.\nHere are some examples of what schools are getting wrong about costs.\nOff-campus affordability Hero Images | Hero Images | Getty Images During the 2016-2017 school year, four-year colleges in the U.S. estimated that a student at a public school residing off-campus and not living with family would spend $9,602 on room and board, according to the National Center for Education Statistics .\nFor private schools, the average cost of room and board was slightly higher at $9,660.\nThose estimated expenses weren't all that different from those residing on campus, where students at public and private schools could expect costs of about $10,000.\n\"Do you want to live well at college at the expense of living well after college?\" -Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of higher education policy and sociology, Temple University Take those figures with a grain of salt, experts say.\n\"It's easy for colleges to estimate incorrectly,\" said Goldrick-Rab. \"The school is just reading local ads for apartments and doing small surveys of students.\"\nFor example, colleges don't consider a student's need to have the first and last month of rent when seeking an apartment off campus, she said.\nLiving expenses Jose Luis Pelaez Inc | Getty Images The estimate for \"other expenses,\" which include things like laundry, transportation and entertainment, was $3,804 for students at a public college living off campus, according to The National Center for Education Statistics, compared with $3,528 for those residing off campus at a private college.\n\"Schools are generally coming up with a conservative estimate because they don't want students to be oversensitive to price shock,\" said David Helene, co-founder of Edquity, an app that helps guide college students through the financial planning process.\nSee below for a chart from Helene, detailing the annual cost of these surprise expenses based on the largest city in each of the 50 states.",
