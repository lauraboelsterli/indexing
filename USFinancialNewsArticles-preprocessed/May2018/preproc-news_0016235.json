    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 3:05 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Bunge hires banks for Brazil IPO, but launch unlikely soon: sources Tatiana Bautzer , Carolina Mandl 2 Min Read\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Global commodities trader Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) has hired banks to prepare an initial public offering (IPO) of its Brazilian sugarcane mills, but chances of an imminent launch are slim, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: An incoming truckload of soybeans is unloaded at a farm in Fargo, North Dakota, U.S., December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Dan Koeck/File Photo\nThe investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Itaú Unibanco Holding SA ( ITUB4.SA ) and Banco Santander Brasil SA ( SANB11.SA ) are working with the company on the deal.\nBunge Chief Executive Soren Schroder said last week the company may file with the Brazilian securities regulator for an offering as soon as this month. [nL1N1S918I]\nBankers are beginning to prepare the company for the offering, but investor interest seems to be small, as the global sugar glut pushed down prices and made it tough for mills to turn a profit, the sources added, asking for anonymity because talks are still private.\nBunge’s sugar and bioenergy division continued to lose money in the first quarter, leading the company to cut its forecast for the unit’s 2018 earnings by $10 million.\nOne of the people said market volatility also reduces the chances of a transaction soon. Bunge and the banks did not immediately comment on the matter.\nBunge has tried to sell its eight Brazilian sugar and ethanol mills for four years, but a separate sale process has failed to attract firm interest from strategic or financial investors.
