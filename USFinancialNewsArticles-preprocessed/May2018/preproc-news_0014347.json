    "text": "Financial and Operating Results Highlight Strong Start to the Year\nBOSTON, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbonite, Inc. (NASDAQ: CARB), a leader in data protection, today announced the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nRevenue of $64.0 million increased 12% year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP revenue of $64.9 million increased 10% year-over-year. 1\nBookings of $67.6 million increased 9% year-over-year. 2\nNet income per share was $0.42 (basic) and $0.40 (diluted), as compared to $0.27 in 2017 (basic and diluted).\nNon-GAAP net income per share was $0.29 (basic) and $0.27 (diluted), as compared to $0.09 (basic and diluted) in 2017. 4\n“Q1 was a great start to the year for Carbonite. We closed the Mozy acquisition, and we started integrating and onboarding the team. We continue to successfully execute our strategy, building the leading data protection platform for businesses, positioning us well to serve a large and growing market opportunity,” said Mohamad Ali, CEO of Carbonite.\n“In the first quarter we delivered financial results that were at or above the top of our guidance range. At the same time, we are making the system and platform investments that will allow us to continue to drive meaningful operating synergies over time. Our Q1 results coupled with the acquisition of Mozy position us well for continued growth and profitability expansion,” said Anthony Folger, CFO of Carbonite.\nThe Company uses a variety of operational and financial metrics, including non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate its performance and financial condition. The accompanying financial data includes additional information regarding these metrics and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results:\nRevenue for the first quarter was $64.0 million, an increase of 12% from $57.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $64.9 million, an increase of 10% from $59.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. 1\nBookings for the first quarter were $67.6 million, an increase of 9% from $62.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. 2\nGross margin for the first quarter was 71.4%, compared to 69.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in the first quarter, compared to 73.8% in the first quarter of 2017. 3\nNet income for the first quarter was $11.9 million, compared to net income of $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $8.1 million, compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. 4\nNet income per share for the first quarter was $0.42 (basic) and $0.40 (diluted), compared to net income per share of $0.27 (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.29 (basic) and $0.27 (diluted) for the first quarter, compared to non-GAAP net income per share of $0.09 (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2017. 4\nCash flow from operations for the first quarter was $3.3 million, compared to $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter was $2.4 million, compared to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. 5\n1 Non-GAAP revenue excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions. 2 Bookings represent the aggregate dollar value of customer subscriptions and software arrangements, which may include multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, hardware, professional services and post-contractual support, received during a period and are calculated as revenue recognized during a particular period plus the change in total deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue recorded in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and the adoption impact of Topic 606, net of foreign exchange and the change in unbilled revenue during the same period. 3 Non-GAAP gross margin excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and acquisition-related expense. 4 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, non-cash convertible debt interest expense and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. 5 Adjusted free cash flow is calculated by subtracting the cash paid for the purchase of property and equipment and adding the payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, and litigation from net cash provided by operating activities. Business Outlook\nBased on the information available as of May 7, 2018, Carbonite expects the following for the second quarter and full year of 2018:\nSecond Quarter 2018:\nCurrent Guidance\n(5/7/2018) GAAP Revenue $75.8 - $77.8 million Non-GAAP Revenue $78.0- $80.0 million Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share $0.34 - $0.38 Full Year 2018:\nPrior Guidance\n(2/13/2018) Current Guidance\n(5/7/2018) Business Bookings $223.8 - $234.8 million $223.8 - $234.8 million Consumer Bookings Y/Y Growth 5% - 15% growth 5% - 15% growth GAAP Revenue $294.0 - $304.0 million $296.9 - $306.9 million Non-GAAP Revenue $302.5 - $312.5 million $302.5 - $312.5 million Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $1.45 - $1.55 $1.51 - $1.59 Non-GAAP Gross Margin 76.0% - 77.0% 76.0% - 77.0% Adjusted Free Cash Flow $32.0 - $38.0 million $32.0 - $38.0 million Carbonite’s expectations of non-GAAP net income per share for the second quarter and full year of 2018 excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired deferred revenue, amortization expense on intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, restructuring-related expense, non-cash convertible debt interest expense, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP net income per share assumes an effective tax rate of 8% for the full year of 2018. Non-GAAP net income per share assumes fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 31.2 million for the second quarter and 31.3 million for the full year of 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCarbonite will host a conference call on Monday, May 7, 2018 at 5:30 p.m. ET to review these results. This call will be webcast live and can be found in the investor relations section of the Company's website at http://investor.carbonite.com . The conference call can also be accessed by dialing (877) 303-1393 in the United States or (315) 625-3228 internationally with the passcode 9759657.\nFollowing the completion of the call, a recorded replay will be available on the Company’s website, http://investor.carbonite.com , under “Events & Presentations”.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including bookings, non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, non-GAAP operating expense and adjusted free cash flow.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and ordinary results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods and uses these measures in financial reports prepared for management and the Company’s board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software-as-a-service companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nThe Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant items that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the tables at the end of this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nWith respect to our expectations under \"Business Outlook\" above, the Company has not reconciled non-GAAP net income per share to net income per share in this press release because we do not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, litigation-related expense, acquisition-related expense, amortization expense on intangible assets, non-cash convertible debt interest expense, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments as we are unable to quantify certain of these amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release, including under “Business Outlook,” have \" \" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These may generally be identified as such because the context of such statements will include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would\" or words of similar import.
