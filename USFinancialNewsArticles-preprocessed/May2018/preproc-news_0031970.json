    "text": "COLUMBIA, Md., May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- W. R. Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA) today announced that by mutual agreement Thomas E. Blaser, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will resign from the company effective May 31, 2018 to pursue other interests. The company has retained an executive search firm and begun a formal search for his replacement. Blaser’s departure is not related to any financial performance, policy, or control issues or any disagreements on accounting or financial reporting matters. Grace reaffirmed its full-year 2018 outlook.\nFollowing Blaser’s resignation, William C. Dockman, Vice President and Controller, will assume the role of interim Chief Financial Officer along with his current duties. Dockman has been the company’s Vice President and Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2012.\nAbout Grace\nBuilt on talent, technology, and trust, Grace is a leading global supplier of catalysts and engineered materials.

Such statements generally include the words “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “targets,” “will,” “expects,” “suggests,” “anticipates,” “outlook,” “continues,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, expected financial positions; results of operations; cash flows; financing plans; business strategy; operating plans; capital and other expenditures; competitive positions; growth opportunities for existing products; benefits from new technology and cost reduction initiatives, plans and objectives; and markets for securities. For these statements, Grace claims the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Like other businesses, Grace is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from its projections or that could cause other forward-looking statements to prove incorrect. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: risks related to foreign operations, especially in emerging regions; the costs and availability of raw materials, energy and transportation; the effectiveness of its research and development and growth investments; acquisitions and divestitures of assets and businesses; developments affecting Grace’s outstanding indebtedness; developments affecting Grace's pension obligations; its legal and environmental proceedings; environmental compliance costs; the inability to establish or maintain certain business relationships; the inability to hire or retain key personnel; natural disasters such as storms and floods, and force majeure events; changes in tax laws and regulations; international trade disputes, tariffs and sanctions; the potential effects of cyberattacks; and those additional factors set forth in Grace's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are readily available on the Internet at www.sec.gov . Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Grace's projections and forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates those projections and statements are made. Grace undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to the projections and forward-looking statements contained in this announcement, or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this announcement.\nMedia Relations\nRich Badmington\nT +1 410.531.4370\nrich.badmington@grace.com Investor Relations\nJeremy Rohen\nT +1 410.531.8234\njeremy.rohen@grace.com\nSource:W.
