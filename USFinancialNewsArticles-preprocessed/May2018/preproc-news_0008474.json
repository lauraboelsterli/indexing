    "text": "In his Brewers debut, lefty Wade Miley pitched six sharp innings as Milwaukee knocked off the host Cincinnati Reds 3-1 on Wednesday night at Great American Ball Park.\nThe Brewers have beaten the Reds in five of six meetings this season.\nMiley (1-0) signed a minor league contract with the Brewers and made the team in spring training, only to see a groin injury delay the start of his season. He gave up only a run-scoring double to Devin Mesoraco in the fourth inning. Miley allowed three hits and three walks while striking out four.\nThe Brewers hitters, meanwhile, were mustering just enough offense against Reds right-hander Luis Castillo, who has struggled mightily this season and was coming off a start in Minnesota where he was chased before getting an out in the second inning. He began the night with a 7.85 ERA.\nCastillo (1-4) allowed two runs on nine hits in six innings. He issued only one walk while striking out seven.\nThe Brewers opened the scoring with a run off Castillo in the second inning.\nJesus Aguilar and Domingo Santana hit one-out singles, and with two outs, Orlando Arcia smacked a hard ground ball that deflected off Reds first baseman Joey Votto’s glove and trickled down the right field line.\nThe Reds tied the game in the bottom of the fourth.\nEugenio Suarez led off with a walk against Miley, who led the majors with 93 walks while going 7-15 with a 5.61 ERA with the Baltimore Orioles last season. One out later, Mesoraco drove in Suarez with a double to the wall in left-center field.\nThe Brewers wasted little time regaining the lead, however, when Christian Yelich began the fifth inning with a long home run into the seats in right field, his third of the season.\nMilwaukee added a run in the eighth against Reds reliever Jared Hughes, who spent last season with the Brewers. Hernan Perez, an early-game replacement at third base for Travis Shaw, opened with a single, and Aguilar singled to put runners at first and third.\nOne out later, Brewers catcher Manny Pina hit what looked like a double-play ground ball, but Reds second baseman Alex Blandino threw wildly to first to complete the play, allowing Perez to score.\nBrewers relievers Dan Jennings and Jeremy Jeffress combined for three shutout innings in relief of Miley. Jeffress went the final two innings for his second save.\nYelich, Aguilar, Santana and Arcia each had two of Milwaukee’s 12 hits. Cincinnati managed only four hits.\nShaw appeared to hit a foul ball off his right foot during his at-bat in the second inning and did not come out for defense in the bottom of the second. An announcement later said he had a foot contusion.\nShaw is hitting .241 with six home runs and 16 RBIs this season.\nBrewers left fielder Ryan Braun left the game in the bottom of the sixth inning, although no announcement about his status was immediately made.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
