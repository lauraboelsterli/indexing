    "text": "(Adds details of case, comments from Apple)\nMay 24 (Reuters) - After nearly five days of deliberations, a U.S. jury on Thursday said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd should pay $539 million Apple Inc for copying patented smartphone features, technology publication CNET reported, bringing a years-long feud between the technology companies into its final stages.\nThe worlds top smartphone rivals have been in court over patents since 2011, when Apple filed a lawsuit alleging Samsungs smartphones and tablets slavishly copied its products. Samsung was found liable in a 2012 trial, but a disagreement over the amount to be paid led to the current retrial over damages where arguments ended on May 18.\nSamsung previously paid Apple $399 million to compensate Apple for infringement of some of the patents at issue in the case. The jury has been deliberating the case since last week.\nBecause of that credit, if the verdict is upheld on appeal it will result in Samsung making an additional payment to Apple of nearly $140 million.\nIn a statement, Apple said it was pleased that the members of the jury \"agree that Samsung should pay for copying our products.\nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe new jury verdict followed a trial in San Jose, California, before Judge Lucy Koh that focused on how much Samsung should pay for infringing Apple patents covering aspects of the iPhone's design. The jury awarded Apple $533.3 million for Samsung's violation of so-called design patents and $5.3 million for the violation of so-called utility patents.\nApple this year told jurors it was entitled to the $1 billion in profits Samsung made from selling infringing phones, saying the iPhone's design was crucial to their success.\nSamsung sought to limit damages to about $28 million, saying it should only pay for profits attributable to the components of its phones that infringed Apple patents.\nJurors in the earlier trial awarded $1.05 billion to Apple, which was later reduced by appeals courts.\nSamsung paid $548 million to Apple in December 2015, including $399 million for infringement of some of the patents at issue in this week's trial.
