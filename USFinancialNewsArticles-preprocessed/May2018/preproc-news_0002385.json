(4) The combined risk-to-capital ratio equals the sum of the net risk in force of Essent Guaranty, Inc. and Essent Guaranty of PA, Inc. divided by the combined statutory capital. Exhibit L Essent Group Ltd. and Subsidiaries Supplemental Information Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Book Value per Share We believe that long-term growth in Adjusted Book Value per Share is an important measure of our financial performance and is a measure used to determine vesting on certain restricted stock granted to senior management under the Company’s long-term incentive plan. Adjusted Book Value per Share is a financial measure that is not calculated under standards or rules that comprise accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and is referred to as a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted Book Value per Share may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Adjusted Book Value per Share is one measure used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Book Value per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Book Value by Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding. Adjusted Book Value is defined as consolidated stockholders’ equity of the Company, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) plus the proceeds, if any, from the assumed exercise of all \"in-the-money\" options, warrants and similar instruments. Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding is defined as total common shares outstanding plus all equity instruments (including restricted share units) issued to management and the Board of Directors and any \"in-the-money\" options, warrants and similar instruments. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses that arise from changes in the market value of the Company’s investments that are classified as available for sale. The Company does not view these unrealized gains and losses to be indicative of our fundamental operating performance. As of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company does not have any options, warrants and similar instruments outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted Book Value to the most comparable GAAP amount as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 in accordance with Regulation G:\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNumerator: Total Stockholders' Equity (Book Value) $ 1,995,290 $ 1,940,436 $ 1,412,752 Subtract: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (32,002 ) (3,252 ) (7,405 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 2,027,292 $ 1,943,688 $ 1,420,157 Denominator: Total Common Shares Outstanding 98,102 98,434 93,377 Add: Restricted Share Units Outstanding 456 536 598 Total Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding 98,558 98,970 93,975 Adjusted Book Value per Share $ 20.57 $ 19.64 $ 15.11\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005071/en/\nEssent Group Ltd.\nMedia Contact\n610-230-0556\nmedia@essentgroup.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Contact\nChristopher G.
