    "text": "Constellation Brands : \"Last week the stock was at $236 and then Molson [Coors] reported a terrible number and it's just been taken down with that. I don't think that's right. My charitable trust owns it.\"\nOpko Health : \"Ever since they bought BioReference Labs, the stock has been slugged and I think that's probably a mistake, that it's been slugged. And that's why I want [CEO] Phil Frost to come on the show and tell us.\"\nThor Industries : \"OK, well, they did have an inventory buildup which was not good and they did have expenses go higher because they're assembling some of their best vehicles in Indiana, [which has] the lowest unemployment rate in the country. So it's been hurt by both of those. We've got to see what happens with the quarter because those are negatives, and I'm not denying it. Those are negatives.\"\nZendesk Inc. : \"The more I hear about it, the more companies just love working with them and turning that stuff over to them for customer support. I like ServiceNow , but, you now, Zendesk could end up being one of our cloud princes because that's how good they're doing. So I'm not going to suggest selling it.\"\nBox Inc. : \"Look, when no one believed in [CEO] Aaron Levie, I did, OK? I believed in him and I still believe in him and I think the stock goes higher. Remember it at $12 when I said Aaron was good to go?\"\nHain Celestial Group : \"Hain had a bad quarter and bad guidance. And I don't know, I can't be reassuring. I don't know what to say. [CEO] Irwin Simon should come on and maybe tell us what the future looks like. But right now, it's not that good. Tough, but I said it.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: The market's wrong on Constellation Brands 19 Hours Ago | 04:13 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Constellation Brands.\n ",
