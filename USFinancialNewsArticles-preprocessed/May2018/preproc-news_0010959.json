Our recent network investments also have driven meaningful improvements in our broadband subscriber trends with March representing our best performance in more than five years.\n“Total cash costs improved by more than 6 percent year-over-year, driven in part by our IT integration work, as well as our continued focus on reducing network interconnection expenses and driving improvements in our overall organizational effectiveness,” Thomas said.\nResults under GAAP\nTotal revenues and sales were $1.45 billion, an increase of 6 percent from the same period a year ago, and total service revenues were $1.44 billion, an increase of 7 percent year-over-year.

(\"Uniti\").\nOur purpose for these adjustments is to improve the comparability of results of operations for all periods presented in order to focus on the true earnings capacity of our core business operations and our ability to generate cash flow. We use adjusted results, including adjusted OIBDA, adjusted OIBDAR, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted capital expenditures as key measures of the operational performance of our business. Our management, including the chief operating decision-maker, consistently uses these measures for internal reporting and the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance.\n(A) Represents EarthLink revenues and sales prior to the merger date of February 27, 2017.
