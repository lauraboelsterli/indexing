    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New Point Exploration Corp. (CSE:NP) (Frankfurt:4NP) (“ New Point ” or the “ Company ”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a share purchase agreement (the “ Acquisition Agreement ”) with Goldhat Resources Inc. and its shareholders, pursuant to which New Point has acquired Goldhat and its US subsidiary, which holds a long term, exclusive lease of certain unpatented mining claims known as the “ Empire Lithium Property ”.\nEmpire Lithium Property, Nevada\nBryn Gardener-Evans, President & CEO of New Point commented, “We are excited to add a promising lithium property to the portfolio at a time when lithium is receiving heightened market attention due to the emerging battery and electric vehicle markets.” Gardener-Evans continued, “This property is of particular interest due to its geological setting and the presence of lithium in active geothermal fluids and surface salts in the San Emidio Desert, which reflect many of the same characteristics of lithium brine deposits in Clayton Valley, Nevada and South America.”\nAbout the Empire Lithium Property\nThe Empire Lithium Property is located in the San Emidio Desert, Nevada, approximately 100km north-northeast of Reno, and covers approximately 600 acres. The Property is in the northeastern corner of the Walker Lane trend, a structurally complex tectonic zone. This zone is still geologically active with numerous earthquakes and recent volcanic activity. Although the San Emidio Valley is the site of drilling for geothermal energy exploration and development, previous drilling has not been directed at a lithium brine or minerals model.\nA grid soil sampling program was conducted on the Empire Lithium Property in October of 2016 by Nevada Energy Metals Inc. [Source: Alan J. Morris MSc, CPG, October 25, 2016: NI 43-101 Technical Report, San Emidio Desert Project, Washoe County, Nevada, USA]. The program collected samples on 200-meter intervals with lines spaced 400 meters apart and produced values of lithium ranging from 78.8 to 600 ppm with a median value of 300 ppm. These values compare favorably with the background in adjoining property ranges and may indicate the concentration of subsurface lithium brines in the Empire Lithium Property’s playa silts and salt crust.\nThe Company is currently in the process of preparing an initial exploration program for the property, which is expected to commence shortly.\nQuality Control and Sampling\nThe soil samples were collected by a contract crew provided by Carlin Trend Mining Services of Elko, Nevada. The Author of the report titled NI 43-101 Technical Report, San Emidio Desert Project, Washoe County, Nevada, USA , Alan Morris, inserted standards into the sample stream and transported the samples from the office to the ALS preparation laboratory in Elko. ALS took custody of the samples on September 19, 2016 and shipped the samples to their Reno laboratory for sieving. After preparation, aliquots of the samples were shipped to the ALS analytical laboratory in Vancouver for analysis. Quality control standards inserted into the sample stream returned a variation of +/- 3.8% around the mean of 723. This standard has an approximate value of 750 ppm so these values are somewhat less than the advertised value but are well within acceptable range for exploration samples. Other than the soil sampling program, no proprietary data have been identified or reviewed on this project area. All data used in preparation of this report are derived from public domain sources. These reports are authored by reputable individuals or organizations and are assumed to be factually accurate.\nAcquisition and Lease Terms\nPursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, on closing of the acquisition of Goldhat, New Point issued a total of 2.1 million common shares to the Goldhat shareholders. Under the long term lease, New Point’s newly acquired subsidiary will be responsible for annual lease payments of US$15,000 in year one and increasing to US$50,000 per annum after the 10 th anniversary. Mineral products from the Empire Lithium Property are subject to 2% net smelter return, which may be purchased for US$1M, and a further 1% net smelter return that may not be purchased. There is also a two year work commitment under the lease of US$75,000 in each year.\nQualified Person\nTechnical aspects of this press release have been reviewed and approved by Mr. Eric Saderholm, P.Geo., the designated Qualified Person (QP) under National Instrument 43-101.\nAbout New Point Exploration Corp.\nNew Point (CSE: NP) is engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties related to the growing battery industry. Focused on high grade, prospective properties in North America, New Point is building a portfolio that includes lithium, cobalt and copper projects in prospective, mining-friendly jurisdictions. New Point, A Next Generation Metals Company .\nOn Behalf of the Board of New Point Exploration Corp.\nBryn Gardener-Evans\nPresident & CEO\nCorporate Office\n1240-1140 West Pender St\nVancouver, BC\nV6E 4G1\nFor further information, please contact:\nE: investors@newpointexploration.com\nP: 403-830-3710",
