    "text": "MILAN, May 28 (Reuters) - Italy’s League leader Matteo Salvini said on Monday he hoped a new government would be in place in October, in time to approve the country’s 2019 budget and avoid a vat tax hike next year.\nSalvini did not specify whether he was referring to a new caretaker government led by prime-minister designate Carlo Cottarelli, or a newly elected government.\nCottarelli, an ex-IMF official, was nominated by Italy’s president on Monday to run the country until new elections could be held, sometime between September and early next year.
