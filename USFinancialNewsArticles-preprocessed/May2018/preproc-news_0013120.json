    "text": "ROCHESTER, Mich., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OptimizeRx Corp. (OTCQB:OPRX), the nation’s leading provider of digital health messaging for the pharmaceutical industry, reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Quarterly comparisons are to the same year-ago quarter.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue increased 91% to a record $4.1 million. Gross margin improved from 35.8% to 51.2%. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue reduced from 77% to 56%. Acquired new pharmaceutical manufacturer brands for OptimizeRx’s core offerings of financial and brand messaging that are distributed through the company’s expanding network of EHR channel partners. Appointed two new independent directors, Patrick Spanglar and Bryan Archambault, and established an audit committee to continue to improve corporate governance.\nQ1 2018 Financial Summary\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 91% to a record $4.1 million from $2.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to revenue from OptimizeRx’s two core products of financial and brand messaging coupled with broader distribution with the company’s new channel partners. The launch of new pharmaceutical brands also contributed to the increase.\nGross margin improved to 51.2% in the first quarter of 2018 from 35.8% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was due primarily to brand messaging products costs which decreased as a percentage of sales throughout 2017 as brand messaging volume increased. The company is focused on improving margins, targeting gross margin of at least 55% by the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.3 million, up from $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to additional expenses related to growth initiatives, including in the company’s executive and sales team. However, operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 56% as compared to 77% in the same year-ago quarter.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $189,000 or $(0.01) per share, as compared to a net loss of $883,000 or $(0.03) per share in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in net loss was primarily due to the increase in revenue and decrease in operating expense as a percentage of revenue.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $4.3 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was due to use of cash in operating activities, primarily a reduction in revenue share payable resulting from a change in payment terms with one of our partners. The company expects to have positive cashflow from operations in future quarters in 2018. The company continued to operate debt-free.\nManagement Commentary\n“In Q1, we achieved our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth as our topline increased 91%,” said William Febbo, CEO of OptimizeRx. “This strong performance was driven by growth across all of our messaging products as well a brand support. The sequential growth also means we bucked the typical seasonal downtick in Q1, which was largely due to exceptional execution by our sales team and account managers.\n“The big jump in gross margin to 51.2% was primarily due to increased brand messaging revenues which has a large fixed-cost component, and we expect to maintain if not expand gross margin throughout the year.\n“Q1 also demonstrated the substantial leverage in our operating model in how it supports greater market reach and revenue growth without lockstep increases in operating cost. This means, as we grow, we expect our operating expense as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease as our cashflow from operations strengthens.\n“Through to the end of the year, we expect our actual operating expenses to continue at the Q1 2018 level or perhaps only slightly above, as we further implement our business plan and expand our operations to grow the business in a very dynamic and active marketplace.\n“This effort will be supported by our strengthened ability to acquire, integrate and expand into new EHR, eRx and other platforms. In fact, in Q1 we launched with two EHRs and signed for the first time a clinical decision support tool used in both ambulatory and hospital settings. As a result, we have more master service agreements now more than ever, and we anticipate revenue from these channels to accelerate in 2018.\n“We’ve received the approval of our board for a reverse stock split in order to meet the minimum price requirement for NASDAQ. It will be a one-for-three, and we expect to uplist within the next couple of months. We believe a NASDAQ listing will help broaden our shareholder base by increasing our appeal to both retail and institutional investors. We also expect it to provide investors with greater liquidity and ultimately increase shareholder value.\n“Driven by the launch of additional channels, brands and products, as well as the ongoing growth in our nationwide EHR network, we expect continued revenue growth in 2018. While we are focused on the top-line, we are also carefully managing our expenses. Together, we believe this will keep us on track to achieving profitability on quarterly basis by the end of the year.”\nConference Call\nOptimizeRx management will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Wednesday, May 2, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-800-263-0877\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-794-2094\nConference ID: 4411468\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.
