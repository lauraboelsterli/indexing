The annual list includes women from vendors, distributors, solution providers, and other organizations that figure prominently in the IT channel ecosystem.\nFor the second year in a row, Sophos has the most women included on CRN’s Women of the Channel list from any dedicated IT security company. The following women from Sophos were selected by the editors of CRN due to their professional accomplishments, demonstrated expertise and ongoing dedication to the IT channel:\nKendra Krause, vice president, global channels Justine Lewis, vice president, worldwide field and channel marketing Erin Malone, vice president, North America channel sales Caralyn Stern, senior marketing director, global channel and Americas Allison Clarke, director, global channel programs Regina Vignone, director of channel sales, North America, East Andrea Carter, director of marketing and global field programs, UKI Nicki Dewhurst, marketing director, Asia Pacific and Japan Maria Claudia Ardila, channel program manager, Latin America Claudia Vizcarra, regional sales manager, Latin America\nCRN has also included Kendra Krause, Erin Malone, and Caralyn Stern in the 2018 Power 100, an elite subset of the Women of the Channel list which recognizes women leaders whose vision and influence are key drivers of their company's success.\n“Having ten women from our worldwide team being recognized on CRN’s Women of the Channel list is an incredible achievement.

Sophos is a global leader in a market that is growing worldwide and doesn’t show any signs of decelerating. I am proud to be part of the winning team at Sophos.”\nMany of the women CRN awarded played a key role in accelerating Sophos’ Cloud Security Provider (CSP) Program, which enables partners worldwide to better serve their customers as they migrate to the cloud and capitalize on revenue opportunities the cloud brings to the channel.
