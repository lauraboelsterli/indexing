REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\nIt was the latest in a run of mediocre economic data and further reduced the chances of a rate increase from the Bank of England when it meets next week.\n“We are starting to see any residual expectations of a rate hike from the Bank of England next week starting to fade,” said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.\nSwap markets now indicate a less than 20 percent chance of a rate increase next month, down from 90 percent in early April.\nStruggling against a resurgent dollar, the British currency GBP=D3 fell 0.6 percent to $1.3683. It is down nearly 5 percent from a post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4377 hit on April 17.\nBritain's FTSE 100 .FTSE hit a session high after the data sent the pound sharply down. The leading index of international companies, which benefit from a weaker sterling, was last up 0.28 percent.\nBritish gilt futures FLGcv1 rose modestly by around 7 ticks to turn positive and were last up around 3 ticks on the day.\nData from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed net long speculative positions, which had started April at their highest level in four years, posting their second-biggest weekly drop of the last eight months.\nAgainst the euro, sterling weakened 0.26 percent to 87.94 pence.
