Net written premiums were $109 million, up 26.5%, driven by a combination of premium growth and increased retention rates. On March 28, 2018, we expanded our insurance operations into Europe with the creation of Fortegra Europe Insurance Company Limited (“FEIC”).\nTiptree Capital:\nOn February 1, 2018, we sold our senior living operations to Invesque in exchange for a net 16.4 million shares, which was $0.91 accretive to our book value per share, as exchanged, or a 9.1% increase over our December 31, 2017 book value per share, as exchanged.\nCorporate:\nOn March 23, 2018, we initiated an up to $20 million share buy-back plan split evenly between open market and opportunistic large block purchases. On April 10, 2018, we completed a corporate reorganization that eliminated our dual class stock structure. On May 4, 2018, we extended our existing credit facility to September 2020 and up-sized to $75 million while reducing the interest rate by 100 basis points. Combined with corporate cash, this gives us approximately $100 million of capital available to invest in support of our growth objectives.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenues\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenues were $148.1 million, which increased $1.9 million, or 1.3%, over prior year period driven by growth in earned premiums and service and administrative fees, partially offset by reduced other income, and unrealized losses on equity securities. Earned premiums were $101.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up from $89.2 million in the comparable 2017 period. This was consistent with our strategy to grow written premiums of our insurance business which contributes to increased investable assets and investment income. In addition to the growth in revenues, the combination of unearned premiums and deferred revenues on the balance sheet grew by $110.0 million or 23.4%, from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 as we continue to grow credit protection and warranty written premiums, which are earned over multiple years.\nNet Income (Loss) before non-controlling interests\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net income before non-controlling interests was $29.0 million compared to net income of $1.3 million in the 2017 period, an increase of $27.7 million. The increase was driven by $34.5 million of income from discontinued operations including the net gain on sale of Care, which was partially offset by unrealized losses on equity securities (including the Invesque common stock), and lower asset management income as we reduced our exposure to CLO subordinated notes which resulted in less distributions and gains compared to 2017.\nThe table below highlights certain key drivers impacting our consolidated results presented on a pre-tax basis. Our investments are focused on a longer term investment horizon. In addition, our equity securities holdings are relatively concentrated, and are carried at fair value and marked to market through unrealized gains and losses. As a result, we expect our earnings relating to these securities to be relatively volatile between periods. For a further discussion on these key drivers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Selected Key Metrics — Income (loss) before taxes (from continuing and discontinued operations)” in our Form 10-Q for the quarter\n($ in thousands) 31, 2018 2017 Unrealized & realized gains (losses) on equity securities (1) $ (8,697\n) $ (1,740 ) Discontinued operations (Care) (2) $ 46,808 $ (1,530\n) Asset management - credit investments $ 277 $ 5,168\n(1)\nIncludes $3.9 million attributable to Invesque shares from the date of the sale (February 1, 2018). (2)\nIncludes pre-tax Gain on sale of Discontinued Operations of $46.2 million.\nNet Income (Loss) Available to Class A Common Stockholders\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net income available to Class A common stockholders was $23.6 million, an increase of $22.5 million from the prior year period. The key drivers of net income available to Class A common stockholders were the same factors which impacted the net income before non-controlling interests.\nNon-GAAP\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA and book value per share, as exchanged as measurements of operating performance which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that use of Adjusted EBITDA provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance, and to analyze a company’s ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the Company’s executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. Book value per share, as exchanged assumes full exchange of the limited partners units of Tiptree Financial Partners, L.P. (“TFP”) for Tiptree Class A common stock. Management believes that use of this financial measure provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze company growth on a relative per share basis.\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.3 million compared to $11.8 million for the 2017 period, a decrease of $6.5 million, or 55.1%. The key drivers of the change in Adjusted EBITDA were the same as those which impacted our net income before non-controlling interests, excluding add-backs associated with the Care gain and non-recurring expenses. For Care, the reduction in EBITDA is related to accumulated depreciation and amortization, and certain operating expenses, which were previously included in Adjusted EBITDA in prior periods. See “— Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for a reconciliation to GAAP net income.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $407.7 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $393.8 million as of March 31, 2017, primarily driven by net income over the last four quarters and the net increase in equity outstanding as a result of an option exercise, net of share re-purchases.\nAs exchanged book value per share for the period ended March 31, 2018 was $10.59, an increase from $10.15 as of March 31, 2017. The key drivers of the period-over-period impact were earnings per share of $0.87 over the last four quarters and the purchase of 1.0 million shares at an average 28% discount to book value. Those increases were partially offset by dividends paid of $0.12 per share, officer and director compensation share issuances, and the exercise of a 2007 founders’ option in June 2017, the latter of which resulted in 1.5 million shares being issued for $5.36 per share in cash paid to the Company which resulted in a $0.19 decrease in book value per share. Over the past twelve months, Tiptree returned $12.0 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid.\nResults by Segment\nTiptree is a holding company that combines insurance operations with investment management expertise. In addition to our specialty insurance operations, we allocate our capital across our investments in other companies and assets which we refer to as Tiptree Capital. As of March 31, 2018, Tiptree Capital consists of asset management operations, mortgage operations and other investments (including Invesque common shares). As such, we classify our business into three reportable segments– specialty insurance, asset management and mortgage. Corporate activities include holding company interest expense, employee compensation and benefits, and other expenses. The following table presents the components of total pre-tax income including continuing and discontinued operations.\nPre-tax Income\n($ in thousands) 31, 2018 2017 Specialty Insurance\n$ 1,343 $ 4,801 Tiptree Capital: Asset management 892 5,581 Mortgage 153 301 Other (2,717 ) 84 Corporate (6,714 ) (6,729 ) Pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations $ (7,043 ) $ 4,038 Pre-tax income (loss) from discontinued operations (1) $ 46,808 $ (1,530 )\n(1)\nIncludes Care for 2017 and 2018. Includes $46.2 million pre-tax gain on sale of Care in 2018. Management evaluates the return on Invested Capital and Total Capital, which are non-GAAP financial measures, when making capital investment decisions. Invested Capital represents its total cash investment, including any re-investment of earnings, and acquisition costs, net of tax. Total Capital represents Invested Capital plus Corporate Debt. Management believes the use of these financial measures provide supplemental information useful to investors as they are frequently used by the financial community to analyze how the Company has allocated capital over-time and provide a basis for determining the return on capital to shareholders. Management uses both of these measures when making capital investment decisions, including reinvesting cash, and evaluating the relative performance of its businesses and investments.

This includes interest expense associated with asset-specific debt at subsidiaries in the specialty insurance, asset management, mortgage and other operations. (2) Following the purchase accounting adjustments, current period expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated and current period income associated with deferred revenues were less favorably stated. Thus, the purchase accounting effect related to Fortegra increased EBITDA above what the historical basis of accounting would have generated. The impact of this purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an adjusted EBITDA without such purchase accounting effect. (3) For Reliance, within our mortgage operations, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of changes in contingent earn-outs. For our specialty insurance operations, depreciation and amortization on senior living real estate that is within net investment income is added back to Adjusted EBITDA. For Care (Discontinued Operations), the reduction in EBITDA is related to accumulated depreciation and amortization, and certain operating expenses, which were previously included in Adjusted EBITDA in prior periods.
