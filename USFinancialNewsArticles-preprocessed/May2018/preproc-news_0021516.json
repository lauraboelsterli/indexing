The Luxury division continued to deliver very strong results, while our Professional Beauty division once again demonstrated consistent solid growth. The Consumer Beauty division continued its uneven performance, but with encouraging signs of stability.\nWe continued to reshape our growth profile by strengthening our iconic global brands, supported by recent relaunches. We are also fueling smaller brands with high growth potential and stabilizing the remaining portfolio including the conclusion of our previously communicated portfolio rationalization program. This streamlining of our portfolio is an important milestone that will allow us to focus on those brands where we believe we are particularly suited to drive long term revenue growth.\nThough there is still much work to be done, including the continued integration of the P&G Beauty business, I am encouraged by how far we have come since embarking on our journey to transform Coty into a challenger in the global beauty industry.\nAs we have said, recovery will not be a straight line, but we continue to aim to deliver modest organic net revenue growth for the second half of the year. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to aim for a healthy improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year, with most of the impact coming in Q4, as we continue to deliver on our merger synergies.\"\nBasis of Presentation\nTo supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in this release using the non-GAAP financial measures described in this section. The term “combined company” describes net revenues of Coty Inc. and the P&G Beauty Business giving effect to the Merger for purposes of the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as if it had occurred on July 1, 2016. Combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. \"Constant currency” describes net revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange translations. The term “adjusted” primarily excludes the impact of restructuring and business realignment costs, amortization, costs related to acquisition activities, and certain interest expense and other (income) expense items to the extent applicable. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional discussion of these measures as well as the definition of free cash flow.\nNet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to three months ended March 31, 2017, are reported by segment and geographic region and are presented on a reported (GAAP) and a constant currency basis. Net revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to nine months ended March 31, 2017, are reported by segment and geographic region and are presented on a reported (GAAP), combined company and combined company constant currency basis. Certain percentages may not agree to the tables due to rounding. Operating income is reported by segment. All changes in margin percentage are described in basis points rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.\nOperating income, net income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, and earnings per diluted share (EPS (diluted)) are presented on a reported (GAAP) basis and an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a performance measure and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Net revenues on a constant currency basis, net revenues on a combined company basis, net revenues on a combined company constant currency basis, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for additional discussion of these measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this release.\nTo the extent that Coty provides guidance, it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary Operating Review\nNet revenues of $2,222.7 million increased 9.4% as reported compared to the prior year and increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis. The 3.4% constant currency net revenue growth reflected a 3.2% contribution from Burberry Beauty and one month of Younique, and 0.2% increase in organic net revenue growth, which includes two months of Younique. Organic net revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Luxury and steady momentum in Professional Beauty, partially offset by a decline in Consumer Beauty.\nGross margin of 63.4% increased significantly from 59.8% in the prior year, while adjusted gross margin increased 100bps to 64.3% from 63.3% with strength in all three divisions and mainly due to the realization of benefits from our synergy program.\nReported operating income increased to $19.9 million from a loss of $(192.5) million, primarily due to higher gross profit and lower acquisition costs.\nAdjusted operating income increased 9.4% to $227.8 million from $208.3 million driven by improved gross margin and tight cost controls, which were partially offset by increased marketing spend to support multiple brand relaunch efforts.\nReported effective tax rate was (7.9)% compared to 36.9%.\nAdjusted effective tax rate was 23.8% compared to 22.2%.\nReported net loss decreased to $(77.0) million from $(164.2) million, primarily due to higher operating income partially offset by higher interest and tax expense.\nAdjusted net income of $96.2 million decreased from $110.3 million, reflecting increased interest and redeemable non-controlling interest expense, partially offset by higher adjusted operating income.\nCash Flows\nNet cash from operating activities in the quarter was $(118.9) million, compared to $43.3 million in the prior year, driven by higher working capital requirements due, in part, to the Burberry Beauty acquisition and build-up of inventory in preparation for consolidation of certain distribution centers. Negative free cash flow of $(205.4) million in the quarter compared to $(82.5) million in the prior year reflects higher cash used in operating activities partially offset by lower capital expenditures. On March 15, 2018, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share for a total of $93.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents of $460.8 million decreased by $74.6 million compared to June 30, 2017.\nTotal debt of $7,931.2 million increased by $715.6 million while net debt of $7,470.4 million increased by $790.2 million from the balance on June 30, 2017 driven in part by the acquisition of the Burberry Beauty business.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Review by Segment\nThree Months Ended March 31, Net Revenues Change Reported Operating\nIncome\nAdjusted Operating\nIncome\n(in millions) 2018 2017 Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2018 Change 2018 Change Luxury $ 752.5 $ 634.6 19 % 12 % $ 59.4 (2 %) $ 100.4 17 % Consumer Beauty 1,021.7 988.6 3 % (1 %) 64.2 2 % 97.3 (20 %) Professional 448.5 408.9 10 % 2 % 11.4 >100\n%\n30.1 >100\n%\nCorporate — — N/A N/A (115.1 ) 61 % — N/A Total $ 2,222.7 $ 2,032.1 9 % 3 % $ 19.9 >100% $ 227.8 9 %\nLuxury\nReported net revenues of $752.5 million increased 18.6% compared to the prior year and 11.8% on a constant currency basis. The increase in constant currency reflects 6.1% organic growth driven by the on-going success of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom fragrances as well as CK One and Chloe Nomade, and a 5.7% contribution from Burberry. Adjusted operating income of $100.4 million increased 16.6% from $86.1 million in the prior year.\nConsumer Beauty\nNet revenues of $1,021.7 million increased 3.3% compared to the prior year and decreased (1.2)% on a constant currency basis. The decrease in constant currency reflects a (4.4)% decline in organic growth, which includes two months of Younique. The decline in our organic net revenue growth was driven by certain U.S. brands not yet fully benefiting from relaunch efforts and the impact of pricing actions to improve profitability in our Brazil business, partially offset by growth in the rest of ALMEA. Adjusted operating income decreased 19.9% to $97.3 million from $121.5 million in the prior year.\nProfessional\nNet revenues of $448.5 million increased 9.7% compared to the prior year and 1.9% on a constant currency basis. The 1.9% growth in the underlying business reflects higher net revenues from OPI due to on-going success of the gel restage as well as strength in lacquers. Wella Professionals also continues to benefit from the successful Wellaplex product launch. Adjusted operating income increased >100% to $30.1 million from $0.7 million in the prior year.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Review by Geographic Region\nThree Months Ended March 31, Net Revenues Change (in millions) 2018 2017 Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\nNorth America $ 712.8 $ 685.1 4 % 4 % Europe 976.5 848.4 15 % 3 % ALMEA 533.4 498.6 7 % 5 % Total $ 2,222.7 $ 2,032.1 9 % 3 %\nNorth America\nReported net revenues increased 4.0% compared to the prior year and increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the contributions from Younique and Burberry, the on-going success of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom and certain mass fragrances, partially offset by declines in U.S. color cosmetics. OPI was also a contributor.\nEurope\nReported net revenues increased 15.1% compared to the prior year and increased 2.7% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by incremental revenues from the success of fragrances including Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom as well as Max Factor.\nALMEA\nReported net revenues increased 7.0% compared to the prior year and increased 4.8% on a constant currency basis reflecting incremental revenues from fragrances driven by the launches of Tiffany & Co. and Gucci Bloom, and higher revenues from color cosmetics driven by Max Factor in China, partially offset by lower revenues in Brazil.\nNoteworthy Company Developments\nOther noteworthy company developments include:\nOn April 5, 2018, Coty completed its previously announced offering of three series of U.S. dollar denominated and euro denominated senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $550 million and €800 million, in a private offering.

More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the SEC from time to time.\nAll made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise.\nComparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues, combined company net revenues, gross profit and adjusted operating income.\nThe Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis, on a combined company, combined company constant currency, and combined company constant currency excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business (\"combined company organic (LFL)\") basis. The Company believes that combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period, as the total business and individual divisions are being managed on a combined company basis. In the periods described in this release, combined company period-over-period and combined company constant currency period-over-period give effect to the completion of the Merger for purposes of the nine months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as if it has been completed on July 1, 2016. Combined company growth and combined company constant currency growth do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. For a reconciliation of combined company period-over-period, combined company constant currency period-over-period, and combined company organic (LFL) period-over-period, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Combined Company and Like-For-Like Net Revenues”. For a reconciliation of the Company's combined company period-over-period, combined company constant currency period-over-period and combined company organic (LFL) by segment and geographic region, see the tables entitled “Net Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income by Segment” and “Net Revenues by Geographic Regions.\"\nThe Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross profit, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted”. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period. In calculating adjusted operating income, operating income margin, gross profit, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin and EPS (diluted), the Company excludes the following items:\nCosts related to acquisition activities: The Company excludes acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the above referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Amortization expense: The Company excludes the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Interest and other (income) expense: The Company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing related forward contracts as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant non-controlling interest percentage. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred.\nThe Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income” and \"Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment.\" For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted cash tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Effective Tax Rates and Cash Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.”\nThe Company also presents free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company's ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.”\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n- Tables Follow -\nCOTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net revenues $ 2,222.7 $ 2,032.1 $ 7,098.6 $ 5,409.0 Cost of sales 812.4 816.1 2,711.7 2,153.2 as % of Net revenues 36.6 % 40.2 % 38.2 % 39.8 % Gross profit 1,410.3 1,216.0 4,386.9 3,255.8 Gross margin 63.4 % 59.8 % 61.8 % 60.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,252.3 1,092.4 3,764.0 2,741.5 as % of Net revenues 56.3 % 53.8 % 53.0 % 50.7 % Amortization expense 92.8 102.6 260.6 219.0 Restructuring costs 42.7 155.8 75.6 179.0 Acquisition-related costs 2.6 57.7 63.7 275.1 Operating income (loss) 19.9 (192.5 ) 223.0 (158.8 ) as % of Net revenues 0.9 % (9.5 %) 3.1 % (2.9 %) Interest expense, net 72.6 60.8 199.3 159.1 Other expense (income), net 3.0 (0.5 ) 10.1 0.2 (Loss) income before income taxes (55.7 ) (252.8 ) 13.6 (318.1 ) as % of Net revenues (2.5 %) (12.4 %) 0.2 % (5.9 %) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 4.4 (93.4 ) (28.8 ) (220.6 ) Net (loss) income (60.1 ) (159.4 ) 42.4 (97.5 ) as % of Net revenues (2.7 %) (7.8 %) 0.6 % (1.8 %) Net income (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1.1 3.5 (3.0 ) 14.2 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 15.8 1.3 32.9 5.7 Net (loss) income attributable to Coty Inc. $ (77.0 ) $ (164.2 ) $ 12.5 $ (117.4 ) as % of Net revenues (3.5 %) (8.1 %) 0.2 % (2.2 %) Net (loss) income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share: Basic $ (0.10 ) $ (0.22 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.19 ) Diluted $ (0.10 ) $ (0.22 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.19 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 750.1 747.3 749.4 607.9 Diluted 750.1 747.3 753.1 607.9 Cash dividend declared per common share $ 0.125 $ 0.125 $ 0.375 $ 0.525 COTY INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES INCLUDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nRECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO ADJUSTED RESULTS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThese supplemental schedules provide adjusted Non-GAAP financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.
