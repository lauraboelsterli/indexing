    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Commercial Real Estate, privately owned and locally-based San Francisco commercial real estate firm, is pleased to announce the sale of 318 N. Sunrise Avenue in Roseville, CA.\nThe 24,750 square foot property was purchased for $4,511,000 by a San Francisco-based investor and is located in the Centre Pointe Regional Shopping Center, in between Home Depot and Fitness Evolution. The building is currently leased to Pet Club.\nThe deal was led by Richard Gumbiner, broker associate with Starboard Commercial Real Estate. According to Gumbiner, the 100 percent leased NNN investment is located at a prosperous retail intersection with Hwy 80 visibility, and provides long-term stable income to the investor with minimal management obligations.\n\"Conditions are still favorable to find NNN leased investment properties. Cap rates have improved and financing is still readily available at attractive rates,\" shared Gumbiner. \"Investors who are experiencing challenges with rent control, management, or excessive operating expenses should consider whether a NNN leased investment is more appropriate to their investment goals.\"\nThe city of Roseville has a diverse economy that allows the city to thrive. The most dynamic industries in the city are technology, healthcare, agriculture, financial services, and retail.
