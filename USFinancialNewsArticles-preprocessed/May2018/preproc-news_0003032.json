    "text": "Delivered 27% Crude Oil Growth Year-over-Year\nRaised Full-Year 2018 Production Growth Outlook\nMIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Concho Resources Inc. (NYSE: CXO) (the “Company” or “Concho”) today reported financial and operating results for first-quarter 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights\nAnnounced agreement to acquire RSP Permian, Inc. Increased crude oil production volumes by approximately 14 MBopd, or 11%, quarter-over-quarter to 144 MBopd. Delivered total production of 228 MBoepd, exceeding the high end of the Company’s guidance range. Raised full-year 2018 production growth outlook to a range of 18% - 20% and maintained capital expenditure guidance. Concho’s outlook excludes the RSP Permian transaction. Achieved record 30-day production rates in the Company’s Northern and Southern Delaware Basin assets and set a Company record average lateral length in the Northern Delaware Basin. Received $157 million cash distribution from Oryx Southern Delaware Holdings, LLC. Reduced total debt by approximately $320 million from year-end 2017. Reported net income of $835 million, or $5.58 per diluted share. Adjusted net income totaled $149 million, or $1.00 per diluted share (non-GAAP). Generated $570 million of EBITDAX (non-GAAP).\nSee “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release for a description of non-GAAP measures adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and EBITDAX as well as a reconciliation of these measures to the associated GAAP measure.\nTim Leach, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our team achieved another outstanding quarter of operational and financial results, driving significant production growth while maintaining a disciplined capital program. Our results reflect our focus on large-scale project development, which enables us to maximize ultimate recovery, efficiencies and returns. Looking ahead, we intend to build on our strong momentum and capitalize on our execution strength, cost control and strong balance sheet to extend our track record of delivering growth and returns. We are excited about our pending transaction with RSP, which reinforces our scale advantage. We look forward to completing the acquisition and delivering the value creating benefits of the transaction to the shareholders of both companies.”\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Operations Summary\nProduction for first-quarter 2018 was 21 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), or an average of 228 thousand Boe per day (MBoepd), an increase of approximately 26% from first-quarter 2017 and 8% from fourth-quarter 2017. Average daily crude oil production for first-quarter 2018 totaled 144 thousand barrels per day (MBopd), an increase of approximately 27% from first-quarter 2017 and 11% from fourth-quarter 2017. Natural gas production for first-quarter 2018 totaled 505 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd).\nDuring first-quarter 2018, Concho averaged 20 rigs, compared to 16 rigs in fourth-quarter 2017. The table below summarizes the Company’s gross drilling and completion activity by core area for first-quarter 2018.\nNumber of\nWells Drilled\nNumber of\nOperated\nWells Drilled\nNumber of\nWells\nCompleted\nNumber of\nOperated Wells\nCompleted\nNorthern Delaware Basin 33 20 25 12 Southern Delaware Basin 16 15 12 10 Midland Basin 21 21 18 18 New Mexico Shelf 1 1 1 1 Total 71 57 56 41 The Company is currently running 20 rigs, including nine rigs in the Northern Delaware Basin, six rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin and five rigs in the Midland Basin. Concho expects to add one rig to the Northern Delaware Basin and one rig to the New Mexico Shelf in May 2018. Additionally, the Company is currently utilizing six completion crews.\nNorthern Delaware Basin\nIn the Northern Delaware Basin, Concho added 12 wells with at least 60 days of production as of the end of first-quarter 2018. The average 30-day peak and average 60-day peak rates for these wells were 1,993 Boepd (74% oil) and 1,900 Boepd (73% oil), respectively. The wells delivered record 30-day performance. In addition, ten of the 12 wells added were long-lateral wells, driving a Company record average lateral length in the Northern Delaware Basin of 8,544 feet.\nDelineating Lower Second Bone Spring in Eddy County, New Mexico\nIn the Northern Delaware Basin, Concho continues to optimize lateral placement, completion techniques and well spacing to maximize recovery from the prolific multi-zone resource. During first-quarter 2018, Concho delineated a new target within the 2nd Bone Spring formation in Eddy County, New Mexico, with two successful well results from the Craig Federal 12H and the Road Runner Federal 12H. These two wells, which were landed in the lower 2nd Bone Spring, are part of a stacked development pattern in the 2nd Bone Spring, with the landing zones between these two wells and existing wells separated vertically by 500 feet. Additionally, the average 30-day peak and average 60-day peak rates per well were 2,457 Boepd (74% oil) and 2,322 (72% oil), respectively, from an average lateral length of approximately 9,830 feet.\nSouthern Delaware Basin\nIn the Southern Delaware Basin, Concho added 21 wells with at least 60 days of production as of the end of first-quarter 2018. The average 30-day peak and average 60-day peak rates for these wells were 2,070 Boepd (73% oil) and 1,787 Boepd (73% oil), respectively. Notably, the average 30-day peak rate marked a Company record in the Southern Delaware Basin. The average lateral length for these wells was 9,204 feet.\nMidland Basin\nIn the Midland Basin, Concho added 20 wells with at least 60 days of production as of the end of first-quarter 2018. The average 30-day peak and average 60-day peak rates for these wells were 1,156 Boepd (85% oil) and 1,114 Boepd (84% oil), respectively, with an average lateral length of 10,156 feet.\nDelivering Outstanding Results from Large-Scale Project Development in the Midland Basin\nDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Concho completed the 13-well, two-mile Mabee Ranch project located in Andrews County, Texas. The project achieved average 30-day peak and average 60-day peak rates of approximately 15 MBoepd (83% oil) and 14 MBoepd (83% oil), respectively. Additionally, through fiber optic monitoring, Concho continues to gather valuable proprietary data with long-term implications for full-field development optimization. The Company has transferred several of these completion techniques to other projects across the portfolio.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nConcho’s average realized price for crude oil and natural gas for first-quarter 2018, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $61.29 per Bbl and $3.39 per Mcf, respectively, compared to $49.08 per Bbl and $3.00 per Mcf, respectively, for first-quarter 2017.\nNet income for first-quarter 2018 was $835 million, or $5.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $650 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, for first-quarter 2017. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP), which excludes non-cash and unusual items, for first-quarter 2018 was $149 million, or $1.00 per diluted share. Non-cash and unusual items for first-quarter 2018 included (i) a preliminary non-cash gain of approximately $575 million attributable to the Company’s strategic trade with a large integrated oil company, (ii) a gain of approximately $134 million due to the sale of non-core leasehold in Ward and Reeves Counties, Texas, and (iii) a gain of approximately $103 million related to the cash distribution from the Company’s equity method investment. Adjusted net income for first-quarter 2017 was $72 million, or $0.49 per diluted share.\nEBITDAX (non-GAAP) for first-quarter 2018 totaled $570 million, compared to $461 million for first-quarter 2017.\nConcho’s effective income tax rate for first quarter 2018 was 23%, compared to 36% for first quarter 2017, primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nAgreement to Acquire RSP Permian Enhances Scale Advantage\nOn March 28, 2018, Concho announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of RSP Permian, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of RSP will receive 0.320 shares of Concho common stock for each share of RSP common stock. The transaction is expected to be completed in third-quarter 2018, subject to approval of both Concho and RSP shareholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nStrengthening Financial Position\nDuring first-quarter 2018, Concho further strengthened its financial position through several accretive transactions.\nAs previously reported, Concho completed the sale of non-core leasehold in Ward and Reeves Counties, Texas, for proceeds of approximately $280 million during first-quarter 2018. Additionally, the Company completed a strategic trade with a large integrated oil company. For Concho, the trade enhances its core development area in the Northern Midland Basin and adds working interests to certain operated properties in Upton County, Texas, and in the New Mexico Shelf. In the trade, Concho conveyed its 32,000 acre checker-board leasehold position in Culberson County, Texas.\nConcho owns a 23.75% membership interest in Oryx Southern Delaware Holdings, LLC, which operates a crude oil gathering and transportation system in the Southern Delaware Basin. During first-quarter 2018, Oryx obtained a term loan of $800 million, the proceeds from which were used in part to fund a cash distribution to its equity holders. Concho received a distribution of approximately $157 million, which represents an approximate 3.5 times multiple on Concho’s invested capital, and the Company retains its ownership stake in Oryx.\nAs a result of these transactions and a disciplined capital investment program, Concho reduced its total debt by approximately $320 million in first-quarter 2018 as compared to year-end 2017. At March 31, 2018, Concho had total long-term debt of $2.4 billion, with no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility.\nOutlook\nConcho’s outlook excludes the pending RSP Permian transaction. Concho expects second-quarter 2018 production to be 226 MBoepd to 230 MBoepd. For full-year 2018, the Company raised its production growth outlook to a range of 18% to 20%, as compared to the prior range of 16% to 20%. Also, the Company updated its guidance for crude oil price realizations for full-year 2018. The updated guidance range of ($1.50) to ($2.00) per barrel reflects pricing deductions and excludes the regional Midland-Cushing price differential. As highlighted below under “Commodity Derivatives Update,” Concho enters into basis hedges to protect against the Midland-Cushing differential.\nCommodity Derivatives Update\nThe Company enters into commodity derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, including regional price dislocations such as the Midland/Cushing crude oil price differential. For the remainder of 2018, Concho has crude oil swap contracts covering approximately 112 MBopd at a weighted average price of $54.20 per Bbl, and it has Midland/Cushing basis swaps covering approximately 94 MBopd at a weighted average price of ($0.85) per Bbl. Please see the table under “Derivatives Information” below for detailed information about the Company’s current derivatives positions.\nConference Call\nConcho will host a conference call tomorrow, May 2, 2018, at 8:00 AM CT (9:00 AM ET) to discuss first-quarter 2018 results.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited The Company reports its financial results in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the Company believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. In addition, the Company believes these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. See the reconciliations throughout this release of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share\nThe Company’s presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under GAAP without regard to certain non-cash and unusual items. The Company believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring, comparable basis from period to period. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of net income to adjusted net income (non-GAAP), both in total and on a per diluted share basis, for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net income - as reported $ 835 $ 650 Adjustments for certain non-cash and unusual items: (Gain) loss on derivatives 35 (286 ) Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives (112 ) 28 Leasehold abandonments 10 6 Gain on disposition of assets and other (719 ) (654 ) Gain on equity method investment distribution (103 ) - Tax impact 205 336 Excess tax benefit (2 ) (8 ) Adjusted net income $ 149 $ 72 Net income per diluted share - as reported $ 5.58 $ 4.37 Adjustments for certain non-cash and unusual items per diluted share: (Gain) loss on derivatives 0.23 (1.92 ) Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives (0.75 ) 0.18 Leasehold abandonments 0.07 0.04 Gain on disposition of assets and other (4.80 ) (4.40 ) Gain on equity method investment distribution (0.69 ) - Tax impact 1.37 2.27 Excess tax benefit (0.01 ) (0.05 ) Adjusted net income per diluted share $ 1.00 $ 0.49 Adjusted earnings per share: Basic net income $ 1.00 $ 0.49 Diluted net income $ 1.00 $ 0.49\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDAX\nEBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator.\nThe Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, (3) accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations expense, (4) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (5) (gain) loss on derivatives, (6) net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives, (7) gain on disposition of assets, net, (8) interest expense, (9) gain on equity method investment distribution and (10) federal and state income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP.\nThe Company’s EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company’s operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company’s management team and by other users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For example, EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net income to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Net income $ 835 $ 650 Exploration and abandonments 18 15 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 317 283 Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations 2 2 Non-cash stock-based compensation 17 12 (Gain) loss on derivatives 35 (286 ) Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives (112 ) 28 Gain on disposition of assets, net (723 ) (654 ) Interest expense 30 40 Gain on equity method investment distribution (103 ) - Income tax expense 254 371 EBITDAX $ 570 $ 461\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006788/en/\nConcho Resources Inc.\nInvestor Relations\nMegan P.
