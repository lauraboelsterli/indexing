    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 7:06 PM / Updated an hour ago Rugby - Majestic Toner powers Leinster to Pro14 final win over Scarlets Philip O'Connor 2 Min Read\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - A superb display by lock Devin Toner laid the foundations for Leinster to outclass Scarlets 40-32 in the Pro14 final at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday, capping a fine season with another trophy to add to the European Cup they won two weeks ago in Bilbao.\nWith Leinster outscoring the Welsh side by three penalties to two in the early stages, Toner bulldozed over for the first try on the half-hour mark to put his side 14-6 up, with Johnny Sexton missing the conversion.\nScarlets struck back almost immediately, exploring some sloppiness in defence to allow Johnny McNicholl to dive over for a try and close the gap to 14-11, but again the conversion was missed.\nToner was instrumental in the Irish provincial sideâ€™s second try before the break, snagging a line-out with one hand for Luke McGrath and Sexton set up James Lowe to go over in the corner.\nSexton adding the conversion to leave his side leading by 10 at the break, and after his superb free kick into the corner early in the second, Toner urged his men on again and Sean Cronin touched down after a rolling maul form the resulting line-out.\nJordan Larmour piled on the misery for Scarlets with a superb solo effort, collecting the ball while charging towards his own goal before hammering it up the field and winning the chase to touch down for a 22-point lead.\nMcNicholl claimed his second for Scarlets with an acrobatic dive to reduce the deficit to 15 but minutes later Leinster broke the line again and Jack Conan swan-dived across the line to touch down beneath the posts.\nScarlets substitute Werner Krueger added a late consolation try and McNicholl then completed his hat-trick late on as the deficit was cut to 40-32, but Leinster had too much power as they claimed the Pro14 crown.
