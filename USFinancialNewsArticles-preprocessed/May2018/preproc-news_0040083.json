    "text": "Bitcoin Those Lambos parked at the bitcoin conference are just a promotion Three Lamborghinis parked Monday morning near a major cryptocurrency conference in New York belonged to a New Jersey-based car rental and company founder John Nouri. \"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo.\" \"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and … the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview. 1 Hour Ago | 01:15\nThree Lamborghinis parked Monday morning near a major cryptocurrency conference in New York did not belong to investors in bitcoin , or any other digital coin.\nInstead, two of the luxury cars were from Broadway Supercars, a New Jersey-based car rental, and one belonged to company founder John Nouri.\nHe said he was hired to park the cars for about five hours Monday morning on Sixth Ave just outside a Hilton hotel, where more than 8,500 people are expected to attend CoinDesk's Consensus conference that kicked off Monday. It's part of a promotion for the conference, and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, he said.\n\"We do a lot of this for a lot of companies all the time,\" Nouri said. \"It's an attention grabber. It's for the people walking in. They all say once you make money in crypto, you buy a lambo.\"\n\"I never made money with crypto but I have ten lambos,\" Nouri said. His company rents Lamborghinis out for $1,000 a day.\nBitcoin multiplied 13 times in price last year, minting cryptocurrency millionaires. A Lamborghini can cost about $200,000 or more, and the luxury cars have become an internet symbol for volatile cryptocurrencies' massive potential for wealth creation.\n\"I see a parallel between young people that are really willing to become very rich with the very high-risk investment, and … the fact that our customers are very young,\" Lamborghini CEO Stefano Domenicali told CNBC in a recent interview.\nCase in point, coder Peter Saddington, 35, bought a Lamborghini three years ago for $200,000 with 45 bitcoins. He'd spent less than $115 on the coins when cryptocurrencies were at the very fringes of mainstream interest.\nBitcoin traded near $8,700 early Monday afternoon, less than half their worth in mid-December.",
