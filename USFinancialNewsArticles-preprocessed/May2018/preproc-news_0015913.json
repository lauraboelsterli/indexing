Before joining Cicis, he most recently served as president of Dunkin' Brands International at Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. and Dunkin' Donuts LLC, where he was responsible for nearly 8,500 Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins restaurants located in more than 60 countries around the world.\nA seasoned operator, he has also held top leadership roles at Papa John's International, where his last position was president of global operations, and at AFC Enterprises (Popeyes Restaurants), where he was responsible for the business planning and operation of 1,400 franchise locations.\n\"Bill has an outstanding track record as a leader of large franchise systems, improving operations, customer service and overall business growth,\" said Arlon Managing Director Ben Fishman. \"We have deep confidence that he will continue to strengthen and improve Cicis in meaningful ways for our strategic partners and most importantly, our guests.\"\nCicis was acquired by Arlon Group in 2016 and currently has approximately 430 restaurants in 31 states.

Mitchell will also serve on Cicis' board of directors.\nAbout Cicis\nFounded in 1983, Irving, Texas-based Cicis invented the Unlimited Pizza Buffet concept, offering guests a wide variety of pizzas, including traditional and flatbreads, along with pastas, salads and desserts for dine-in, carry-out and catering.
