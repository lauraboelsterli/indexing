    "text": "LAS VEGAS, - Digipath, Inc. (OTCQB: DIGP) (\"DIGP\" or the \"Company\"), a service oriented independent testing laboratory and media firm focused on the developing cannabis market, today announced financial and operating results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2018 Company Highlights\nSecond quarter sales of $583,073 increased by $86,024, year-over-year growth of approximately 17% from the previous year's net sales of $497,049, and a 47.9% decrease on a quarter-over-quarter basis Realized positive net cash flow from operating activities of $101,547 through the second fiscal quarter, an increase of approximately $207,000, or 197%, from the comparative six months ended March 31, 2017, and utilized $143,008 of proceeds from financing activities, which in part, financed $186,370 of lab equipment to support our increased demand Adjusted EBITDA was $(43,961), compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(145,065) for the comparative six months ended March 31, 2017, an improvement of approximately $101,104 on a year over year basis The gross margin decreased to 38.7%, from 53.1% in the prior year's second fiscal quarter, as we upgraded instrumentation and developed new assays to comply with Nevada regulations and improve processes to become more efficient Maintained our debt free balance sheet with a $237,525 of working capital on hand as of March 31, 2018, including $236,362 of cash Net loss for the second quarter was impacted by non-cash expenses of $306,882, which improved by $101,104, or 70%, over the comparative period in the prior year, consisting of allowance for bad debts, depreciation and stock-based compensation, as reflected in the Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss\nThe complete quarterly filing can be found on our website:\nDigipath SEC Filings\nManagement Comment\nTodd Denkin, Digipath's President and COO, commented, \"Digipath's second fiscal quarter of 2018 ending March 31st showed a 17% increase year-over-year in revenue as demand for our cannabis testing continued to grow in Nevada. The second quarter revenues were overshadowed due to the stronger than expected first fiscal quarter revenues reflecting a short term uptick in our cannabis testing volume resulting from the interruption of three of our competitors' operations in Nevada, followed by our own brief suspension during the start of our second fiscal quarter. During this time, we used the opportunity to service and upgrade instrumentation, develop and validate new state mandated assays and to prepare for ISO 17025 accreditation as we continue to manage growth in this heavily regulated frontier.\"\nThe table below shows the interim results and key metrics:\nQuarterly Data\nQuarterly Data\nFYE September 30, 2018\nFYE September 30, 2017\nQ2 2018\nQ1 2018\nQ2 2017\nQ1 2017\nRevenues (Thousands)\n$ 583\n$ 1,119\n$ 497\n$ 410\nLab Revenue Growth (%YOY)\n17.0%\n173.0%\n252.2%\n301.2%\nGross Profit Margins (%)\n-14.2%\n66.3%\n55.5%\n50.2%\nQuick Ratio (%)\n171.2%\n461.3%\n605.6%\n142.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA Return on Assets (%)\n-25.3%\n18.6%\n-3.8%\n-6.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before (i) other income (expense), (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) bad debts, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment of development costs, (vii) non-cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under ASC Topic 718, and (viii) gain on early extinguishment of debt. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors regarding our current financial performance; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measurements. Specifically, we believe Adjusted EBITDA results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain income and expenses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
