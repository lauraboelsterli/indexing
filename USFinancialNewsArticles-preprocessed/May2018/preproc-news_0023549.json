    "text": "Revenue Increases 16.2% Year-Over-Year with Record Gross Profit Dollars Increasing 33.4%; Expects Continued Strong Growth in the Second Quarter\nPLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Diodes Incorporated (Nasdaq: DIOD), a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high-quality application specific standard products within the broad discrete, logic, analog and mixed-signal semiconductor markets, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nRevenue was $274.5 million, an increase of 16.2 percent from the $236.3 million in the first quarter 2017 and an increase of 2.3 percent from the $268.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017; GAAP gross profit was a record $98.6 million, compared to $73.9 million in the first quarter 2017 and $96.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017; GAAP gross profit margin was 35.9 percent, compared to 31.3 percent in the first quarter 2017 and 35.9 percent in the fourth quarter 2017; GAAP net income was $18.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017 and a net loss of ($30.7) million, or ($0.62) per share, in the fourth quarter 2017; Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $24.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017 and $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017; Excluding $5.0 million, net of tax, of non-cash share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by $0.10 per diluted share; EBITDA was a record $54.2 million, or 20 percent of revenue, compared to $28.6 million, or 12 percent of revenue, in the first quarter 2017 and $47.0 million, or 18 percent of revenue, in the fourth quarter 2017; and Achieved cash flow from operations of $54.0 million and $22.3 million free cash flow, including $31.6 million of capital expenditures. Net cash flow was a negative $21.3 million, which includes the pay down of $46.5 million of long-term debt.\nCommenting on the results, Dr. Keh-Shew Lu, president and chief executive officer, stated, “First quarter revenue was at the high-end of guidance primarily driven by strong growth in the consumer, automotive and industrial markets, complemented by revenue in Europe reaching record levels. In fact, our automotive end market reached 9 percent of revenue in the quarter as we continue to benefit from our successful customer and content expansion efforts. Since implementing our automotive strategy in 2013, we have achieved a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent in this business, reflecting our expanded customer base, increasing pipeline of design wins and growing content across multiple applications.\n“The quarter was also highlighted by gross profit dollars reaching a record, growing 33 percent year-over-year -- twice the rate of our revenue growth and contributing to an almost 3.5 times increase in non-GAAP earnings per share over the same time period. Additionally, EBITDA in the first quarter reached a record $54.2 million, or 20 percent of revenue. The operating leverage in our business model positions Diodes to deliver increasing profits and cash flow in the coming quarters, as revenue continues to increase at a faster rate than operating expenses and approach our target model of 20 percent of revenue.\n“Looking to the second quarter, we expect to extend our growth momentum with continued strength across our target geographies and end markets, which we anticipate will result in the achievement of new quarterly records for both revenue and gross profit.”\nFirst Quarter 2018\nRevenue for first quarter 2018 was $274.5 million, an increase of 16.2 percent from $236.3 million in first quarter 2017 and an increase of 2.3 percent from the $268.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Revenue increased in the quarter due primarily to strength in the automotive and industrial end markets, contributing to the achievement of record revenue in Europe.\nGAAP gross profit for the first quarter 2018 was a record $98.6 million, or 35.9 percent of revenue, compared to the first quarter 2017 of $73.9 million, or 31.3 percent of revenue and fourth quarter 2017 of $96.4 million, or 35.9 percent of revenue. The 460 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin was due primarily to favorable product mix, increased contribution from the Pericom products as well as improved capacity utilization.\nGAAP operating expenses for first quarter 2018 were $71.7 million, or 26.1 percent of revenue, and $64.7 million, or 23.6 percent of revenue, on a non-GAAP basis, which excluded $4.8 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible asset expenses, $2.6 million of expenses related to officer retirement and a credit of $0.3 million related to the KFAB restructuring. GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter 2017 were $64.6 million, or 27.3 percent of revenue, and in the fourth quarter 2017 were $72.9 million, or 27.2 percent of revenue.\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $18.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in first quarter 2017 and a net loss of ($30.7) million, or ($0.62) per share, in fourth quarter 2017 which includes $45.9 million tax expense associated with the tax law reform.\nFirst quarter 2018 non-GAAP adjusted net income was $24.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, which excluded, net of tax, $3.9 million of non-cash acquisition-related intangible asset amortization costs and $2.0 million of officer retirement expenses. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $7.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017 and $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2017.\nThe following is an unaudited summary reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and per share data, net of tax (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nGAAP net income $ 18,526 GAAP diluted income per share $ 0.37 Adjustments to reconcile net income to non-GAAP net income: M&A Pericom 2,574 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n2,574 KFAB (253 ) Restructuring (253 ) Others 3,342 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 1,328 Officer retirement 2,014 Non-GAAP net income $ 24,189 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.48 (See the reconciliation tables of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income near the end of this release for further details.)\nIncluded in first quarter 2018 GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income was approximately $5.0 million, net of tax, of non-cash share-based compensation expense. Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) and non-GAAP adjusted EPS would have increased by $0.10 per diluted share for first quarter 2018, $0.05 for first quarter 2017 and $0.06 for fourth quarter 2017.\nEBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), which represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, in the first quarter 2018 was a record $54.2 million or 19.7 percent of revenue, compared to $28.6 million or 12.1 percent of revenue in the first quarter 2017 and $47.0 million or 17.5 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter 2017. For a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, see the table near the end of this release for further details.\nFor first quarter 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $54.0 million. Net cash flow was a negative $21.3 million, including the $46.5 million long-term debt pay down. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $22.3 million, which includes $31.6 million of capital expenditures.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $186.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, long-term debt (including the current portion) totaled approximately $221.8 million, and working capital was approximately $393.9 million.\nThe results announced today are preliminary, as they are subject to the Company finalizing its closing procedures and customary quarterly review by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. As such, these results are subject to revision until the Company files its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nDr. Lu concluded, “For the second quarter of 2018, we expect continued strong growth with revenue increasing to a range between $292 million and $308 million, or up 6.4 to 12.2 percent sequentially. We expect GAAP gross margin to be 35.5 percent, plus or minus 1 percent. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which are GAAP operating expenses adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, are expected to be approximately 22.0 percent of revenue, plus or minus 1 percent. We expect interest expense to be approximately $2.5 million. Our income tax rate is expected to be 29.0 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, and shares used to calculate diluted EPS for the second quarter are anticipated to be approximately 51.3 million.” Please note that purchase accounting adjustments of $3.8 million, after tax, for Pericom and previous acquisitions are not included in these non-GAAP estimates.\nConference Call\nDiodes will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share would have improved by $0.05 per share.\nADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company adjusts United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income and earnings per share attributable to common stockholders to provide investors a better depiction of the Company’s operating results, allow for a more accurate comparison between the Company’s current and historical operating results and provide a baseline for more informed modeling of future earnings. The Company makes adjustments for inventory acquired, transaction costs, retention costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring costs. The Company also excludes these items to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, develop budgets, determine incentive compensation awards and manage cash expenditure. The presentation of the above non-GAAP measures allows investors to review the Company’s results of operations from the same viewpoint as the Company’s management and Board of Directors. The Company has historically provided similar non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors an enhanced understanding of its operations, facilitate investors’ analyses and comparisons of its current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of its future performance. The Company also believes the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional information that research analysts use to evaluate semiconductor companies. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may differ from measures used by other companies. For example, we do not adjust for any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest except for one-time non-cash items outside the course of ordinary business, such as impairment of goodwill . The Company recommends a review of net income on both a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis be performed to get a comprehensive view of the Company’s results and provides a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income.\nDetail of non-GAAP adjustments\nRetention costs – The Company excluded costs related to employee retention in connection with the Pericom acquisition. Although these retention costs will be recurring every quarter until the final retention payment has been made, they are not part of the employees’ normal annual salaries and therefore are being excluded. The Company believes the exclusion of retention costs related to acquisitions provides investors with a more accurate reflection of costs likely to be incurred in the absence of an unusual event such as an acquisition and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such costs.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets – The Company excluded this item, including amortization of developed technologies and customer relationships. The fair value of the acquisition-related intangible assets, which was recognized through purchase accounting, is amortized using straight-line methods which approximate the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated each period over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets. The Company believes that exclusion of this item is appropriate because a significant portion of the purchase price for its acquisitions was allocated to the intangible assets that have short lives and exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both the Company’s newly acquired and long-held businesses. In addition, the Company excluded this item because there is significant variability and unpredictability among companies with respect to this expense.\nKFAB restructuring - The Company has recorded restructuring charges related to the shutdown and relocation of its wafer fabrication facility located in Lee’s Summit, MO (“KFAB”). These restructuring charges are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the restructuring charges provides investors an enhanced view of the cost structure of the Company’s operations and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such charges or may reflect different levels of such charges.\nOfficer Retirement – The Company has recorded increased expense related to the retirement of two corporate officers. The officer retirement expense has been excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s current period operating performance in order to facilitate comparisons with previously presented periods that do not reflect such expense.\nCASH FLOW ITEMS\nFree cash flow (FCF) (Non-GAAP)\nFCF for the first quarter of 2018 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations. For the first quarter of 2018, FCF was a $22.3 million ($54.0 million less $31.6 million). FCF represents the cash and cash equivalents that we are able to generate after taking into account cash outlays required to maintain or expand property, plant and equipment. FCF is important because it allows us to pursue opportunities to develop new products, make acquisitions and reduce debt.\nCONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, such as financial institutions in extending credit, in evaluating companies in our industry and provides further clarity on our profitability. In addition, management uses EBITDA, along with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. The calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, operating in different income tax jurisdictions, and accounting effects of capital spending, including the impact of our asset base, which can differ depending on the book value of assets and the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income from operations and net income, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our EBITDA takes into account all net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization without taking into account any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest . Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income (per-GAAP) $ 18,526 $ 1,217 Plus: Interest expense, net 2,243 3,190 Income tax provision 7,783 560 Depreciation and amortization 25,610 23,664 EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 54,162 $ 28,631 DIODES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS (in thousands)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) (audited) CURRENT ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 182,411 $ 203,820 Short-term investments 3,851 4,558 Accounts receivable, net 174,141 200,112 Inventories 236,501 216,506 Prepaid expenses and other 37,415 37,328 Total current assets 634,319 662,324 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, net 469,654 459,169 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES 41,157 40,580 OTHER ASSETS Goodwill 135,994 134,187 Intangible assets, net 151,810 156,445 Other 38,428 35,968 Total assets $ 1,471,362 $ 1,488,673 CURRENT LIABILITIES Line of Credit $ 4,466 $ 1,008 Accounts payable 106,973 108,001 Accrued liabilities and other 86,027 99,301 Income tax payable 21,041 18,216 Current portion of long-term debt 21,876 20,636 Total current liabilities 240,383 247,162 LONG-TERM DEBT, net of current portion 199,924 247,492 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES - non current 26,321 25,176 OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 94,925 94,925 Total liabilities 561,553 614,755 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES EQUITY Diodes Incorporated stockholders' equity Preferred stock - par value $1.00 per share; 1,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding — — Common stock - par value $0.66 2/3 per share; 70,000,000 shares authorized; 49,571,038 and 49,130,090, issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 34,021 33,727 Additional paid-in capital 385,928 386,338 Retained earnings 551,213 532,687 Treasury stock, at cost, 1,457,206 and 1,457,206 shares held at March 31, 2018 and December 31,2017, respectively (37,768 ) (37,768 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (64,841 ) (83,480 ) Total Diodes Incorporated stockholders' equity 868,553 831,504 Noncontrolling interest 41,256 42,414 Total equity 909,809 873,918 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,471,362 $ 1,488,673\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006418/en/\nCompany Contact:\nDiodes Inc.\nLaura Mehrl\nDirector of Investor Relations\nP: 972-987-3959\nE: laura_mehrl@diodes.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nShelton Group\nLeanne Sievers\nPresident, Investor Relations\nP: 949-224-3874\nE: lsievers@sheltongroup.com\nSource: Diodes Incorporated",
