    "text": "The volcano eruption on Hawaii's Big Island is driving away some tourists from the affected area, but the rest of the island is \"open for business,\" Gov. David Ige told CNBC on Tuesday.\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park, a popular tourist destination, has been shut down since the Kilauea volcano began spewing lava and toxic gases earlier this month.\n\"The actual area of the eruption is a very, very small portion of Hawaii Island. Less than 1 percent of the land mass is actually impacted,\" Ige said on \" Closing Bell .\"\nFor the rest of the island, \"visitor arrivals there are still strong,\" he added.\nGetty Images An ash plume rises from the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island on May 15, 2018 in Volcano, Hawaii. Tourism is the Big Island's largest industry. However, some vacationers are now not making the trip.\nBoth Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean have cancelled stops at Hilo, the Big Island's port. And tourism authorities said summer bookings for hotels on the island have fallen almost 50 percent since the eruption started on May 3.\nMeanwhile, the closure of the national park is costing the island $166 million, the National Park Service said on Monday.\nThe lost revenue rises to $222 million when some 2,000 jobs indirectly impacted by park tourists are included,",
