May 18, 2018; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Vegas Golden Knights right wing Reilly Smith (19) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal against the Winnipeg Jets in the third period in game four of the Western Conference Final of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs at T-Mobile Arena.

It was only the fourth shot on goal of the period for Vegas.\nThe Golden Knights, the expansion team that has exceeded expectations throughout the season, have won three games in a row since the Jets claimed the series opener.\n“That’s what we’ve done all year,” Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said postgame. “We take it one game at a time.”\nGame 5 will be Sunday afternoon in Winnipeg.\nWilliam Karlsson and Tomas Nosek also scored for Vegas.\nPatrik Laine and Tyler Myers scored Winnipeg’s goals.

Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\nKnights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves.\nJets goalie Connor Hellebuyck stopped 26 shots.\nTwo nights earlier when the Jets lost, they found themselves trailing in a series for the first time this postseason, and now they’re in an even more dire situation.\nMyers tied the game 5:34 into the third period by sending the puck through past Fleury, who didn’t have the net covered as well as it initially appeared.\nThe Jets were insisting they needed to apply more pressure in this game, and there were signs of that. They registered 12 shots on goal in the first 10 minutes of the third period.
