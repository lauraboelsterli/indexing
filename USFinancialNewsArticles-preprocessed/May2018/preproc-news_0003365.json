    "text": "May 1 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said on Tuesday its half-year cash earnings from continued operations rose 4 percent, helped by lower bad debts and controlled costs, while a judicial inquiry investigates the countryâ€™s lenders.\nThe lender said cash profit from continued operations totalled A$3.49 billion ($2.63 billion) for the six months ended March 31, compared with A$3.36 billion in the same period a year earlier and a forecast for a 3-percent increase to A$3.46 billion, according to five analysts polled by Reuters.\nThe lender also kept its interim dividend steady at A$0.80 per share.
