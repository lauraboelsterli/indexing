A Japan Airlines Boeing 777-300ER lands at San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California, February 14, 2015. REUTERS/Louis Nastro/File Photo\nThe new airline will be based at Narita International Airport and will offer flights to Asia, Europe and the Americas, JAL said in a statement.\nBudget flights have been slow to take off in Japan, which is dominated by full-service carriers JAL and ANA Holdings Inc ( 9202.T ) and has a sophisticated high-speed rail network, but with growing numbers of Asia travellers taking to the air the two Japanese airlines are looking to expand their low-cost offerings.
