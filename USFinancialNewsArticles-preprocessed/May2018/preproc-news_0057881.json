    "text": "13 COMMENTS MILAN—Snap elections are months away, but one winner has already emerged from the political chaos sweeping Italy: Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant League party.\nThe firebrand politician’s popularity has soared in the polls by transforming the League from a near-defunct secessionist group to a nativist, hard-right movement often compared with France’s National Front.\nNow, as he hits the campaign trail with a virulently anti-European Union message, he has an even bigger prize—the premiership—in his sights.\nItaly’s political landscape was upended on Sunday after the League and its partner, the 5 Star Movement, refused to withdraw a euroskeptic figure as their choice to head the Economy Ministry, despite opposition from President Sergio Mattarella. That clash meant the end of a possible 5 Star-League coalition government.\nThe president then asked Carlo Cottarelli , an International Monetary Fund veteran, to try to form a new government. With both the League and 5 Star opposed to his candidacy, Mr. Cottarelli is unlikely to win the parliamentary vote of confidence he needs to become the head of a fully functioning government. Without that backing he would likely head a caretaker government charged only with looking after day-to-day activities until fresh elections are held, possibly as early as July.\n“Salvini got the exact result he wanted and that is early elections,” Massimo D’Alema, a former center-left prime minister, said in an interview with Italy’s Radio 24. “He knowingly planted the mine that would blow up the government.” Mr. Salvini denied that allegation.\nMr. Salvini’s fortunes have risen precipitously. The 45-year-old took over the League in 2013, dropping the party’s decades-old quest for the wealthy north to secede from Italy. In March parliamentary elections , the party grabbed 17% of the vote, up from 4% five years earlier.\nSupport for the League neared 28% in an SWG poll published Monday, making it the country’s second-biggest party, trailing just 2 points behind 5 Star, which dropped to 30% of the popular vote in the recent election.\nThe rise of the League has been almost as remarkable as that of Mr. Salvini, who dropped out of college and delivered pizzas in his native Milan before being elected at 20 to the city council with the Northern League, as it was then known. He worked his way up in the party, serving in the European Parliament before becoming party leader five years ago.\nWith fiery comments and a brash style, Mr. Salvini exploited Italians’ rising discomfort with the migration wave that has brought more than 750,000 seaborne arrivals to Italy since 2011. He has pledged to deport hundreds of thousands of them.\n“We will adopt every possible means to stop this invasion,” Mr. Salvini said last year. “When I say every means I mean every means, obviously legal or almost (legal), because we are facing an evident attempt at ethnic cleansing, an ethnic substitution to the detriment of those living in Italy.”\nRelated\nAnalysis: Italy’s Astonishing Bond Reaction Tests Global Markets Italy and the Euro Crisis: How We Got Here With his new strategy, Mr. Salvini pulled the League in line with other nationalist parties in Europe, including the National Front in France and the Fidesz party of Hungary’s Viktor Orban. Mr. Salvini cheered the election of President Donald Trump, whom he met in April 2016. He tweeted a photo of himself next to Mr. Trump, both with a thumbs-up and the words “Go, Donald.”\nItaly’s immigration crisis allowed Mr. Salvini to hone an anti-euro message that would become the League’s hallmark. He blasted EU rules saying that migrants must remain in the country that is their first port of call until their asylum application is processed. Italy signed onto the rules, but Mr. Salvini and other politicians say the country has been abandoned by the EU and forced to bear the brunt of coping with huge numbers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.\nThe League chief completed his new “Italy first” message with attacks on the euro, feeding the feeling in Italy that its perennially weak economy and failure to fully recover from the financial crisis is due to the constraints imposed by the common-currency system. Mr. Salvini has branded the euro a flawed project doomed to fail.\nIn the past, Mr. Salvini favored a controlled and coordinated Italian exit from the eurozone, but more recently he has softened his position, calling instead for more flexibility on the rules underpinning euro membership, such as changes to the budgetary requirements that would allow Italy to spend more and increase its deficit and debt.\n“Those in power want Italy to be weak,” Mr. Salvini said Tuesday. “Either the European Union rules change or it doesn’t make sense to stay in this European Union.”\nThat new focus, as well as the League’s tradition of retail politics—shaking hands with voters at local events—has helped extend the group’s reach beyond its northern stronghold.\nNewsletter Sign-up On social media Mr. Salvini posts a steady stream of selfies at town festivals and demonstrations against immigrant reception centers. He often wears a sweatshirt bearing the name of the town or region he is visiting and is adept at whipping a crowd into a frenzy.\n“Salvini speaks to the people and they understand him,” said Susanna Ceccardi, the League mayor of the town of Cascina near Pisa in central Italy. In Tuscany, where Pisa is located, the League won 17% of the vote this year, up from 1% in 2013.\nNow, Mr. Salvini must decide whether to run in the election with 5 Star. Alternatively, he could run as the senior partner of a center-right coalition with Forza Italia, the conservative party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. If that coalition wins a parliamentary majority, Mr. Salvini could lay claim to the prime minister’s seat, a goal he has clearly stated.\nSome say the League could prove far more moderate in power than in opposition. The party has long ruled Lombardy and the Veneto, two large regions in Italy’s wealthy north that make up a quarter of the country’s population, earning kudos from many for its solid administration.\nWrite to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com",
