    "text": "BURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CIRCOR International, Inc. (NYSE: CIR), a leading provider of flow control solutions and other highly engineered products for the Industrial, Energy, and Aerospace & Defense markets, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018. Results include the acquisition of the Colfax Fluid Handling business, which CIRCOR acquired in December 2017.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights\nOrders of $326.2 million, up 77% and down 1% organically Revenue of $275.6 million, up 90% and up 4% organically Backlog of $561 million, up $60 million in the quarter GAAP Loss Per Share of $0.88, Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.40 Integration of Fluid Handling businesses on track\n“The momentum we saw across many of our end markets in Q4 2017 is continuing as we move through the early stages of 2018,” said Scott Buckhout , President and Chief Executive Officer. “For CIRCOR overall, our reported results were stronger than we expected as we entered the quarter. Our book to bill ratio in Q1 was almost 1.2, increasing our backlog by $60 million. Orders continue to be healthy and we expect that trend to continue through the second quarter.”\n“As we announced in Q1, we have re-aligned our businesses to focus on three primary end markets – Industrial, Energy, and Aerospace & Defense,” Buckhout said. “This is part of our strategy to simplify the business, clarify customer and channel relationships, and better exploit growth opportunities across the organization.”\n“The Fluid Handling acquisition brings a strong platform for revenue growth and profitability. Fluid Handling orders were up 16% on a pro forma, organic basis in the quarter. The integration is on track, and we are confident in our ability to fully realize all of the committed synergies,” added Buckhout.\n“Overall, we remain committed to driving long-term growth, generating strong cash flow, and delevering the Company by reducing debt and expanding margins,” concluded Buckhout.\nSecond-Quarter 2018 Guidance\nFor the second quarter of 2018, CIRCOR expects revenue in the range of $275 million to $285 million, and GAAP loss per share of $0.09 to $0.27, which reflects acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.51 to $0.53 and other special and restructuring charges of $0.12 to $0.18. Excluding the impact of amortization, special and restructuring charges, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.54 per share. Presentation slides that provide supporting information to this guidance and first-quarter results are posted on the “Investors” section of the Company’s website, http://investors.circor.com , and will be discussed during the conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET tomorrow, May 2, 2018.\nSelected Consolidated Results (unaudited)\n($ millions except EPS) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change Revenue $ 275.6 $ 145.2 90% GAAP Operating (Loss) Income $ (13.4) $ 7.4 N/M Adjusted Operating Income 1 $ 19.8 $ 9.1 118% GAAP Operating Margin (4.9)% 5.1% N/M Adjusted Operating Margin 1 7.2% 6.3% 90 bps GAAP (Loss) Earnings Per Share (Diluted) $ (0.88) $ 0.29 N/M Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Diluted) 1 $ 0.40 $ 0.32 25% Operating Cash Flow $ (0.1) $ 16.2 N/M Free Cash Flow 2 $ (8.3) $ 13.4 N/M Orders $ 326.2 $ 184.1 77% Segment Results\n($ millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change Energy Revenue $ 100.0 $ 76.2 31% Segment Operating Income $ 5.7 $ 6.4 (11)% Segment Operating Margin 5.7% 8.4% (270) bps Orders $ 129.8 $ 100.0 30% Aerospace & Defense Revenue $ 58.5 $ 41.6 41% Segment Operating Income $ 8.9 $ 3.8 136% Segment Operating Margin 15.3% 9.1% 620 bps Orders $ 59.8 $ 56.4 6% Industrial Revenue $ 117.1 $ 27.4 328% Segment Operating Income $ 12.9 $ 4.4 195% Segment Operating Margin 11.1% 16.0% (490) bps Orders $ 136.6 $ 27.7 394%\n1. Adjusted Consolidated and Segment Results for Q1 2018 exclude non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization, special and restructuring charges totaling $33.2 million ($25.5 million, net of tax). These charges include: (i) $20.2 million charge for non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, including the amortization of a step-up in fair value of inventories ($6.6 million); (ii) $10.5 million charge related to restructuring activities, primarily severance, related to our Engineered Valves, Reliability Services and Germany-based Pumps business; and (iii) $2.5 million related to the separation of Fluid Handling business from Colfax Corporation. Consolidated and Segment Results for Q1 2017 exclude non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization, special and restructuring charges totaling $1.7 million ($0.6 million, net of tax). These charges include (i) $2.6 million charge for non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, (ii) $1.5 million charge related to other restructuring activities, primarily the exit of manufacturing operations in China and France; and (iii) $2.3 million net special gain primarily related to updating fair value estimates related to the purchase of Critical Flow Solutions, partially offset by Brazil losses incurred subsequent to our Q1 2016 closure of manufacturing operations.\n2. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by subtracting GAAP capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, from GAAP Operating Cash Flow.\nConference Call Information\nCIRCOR International will hold a conference call to review its financial results at 9:00 a.m. ET tomorrow, May 2, 2018. To listen to the live conference call and view the accompanying presentation slides, please visit “Webcasts & Presentations” in the “Investors” portion of CIRCOR’s website. The live call also can be accessed by dialing (877) 407-5790 or (201) 689-8328. The webcast will be archived on the Company’s website for one year.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per share (diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt, free cash flow, organic growth and pro forma combined amounts are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in our financial and operating decision making because we believe they better reflect our ongoing business and allow for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures also allow investors and others to compare the Company’s current financial results with the Company’s past financial results in a consistent manner.\nFor example:\nWe exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including significant transaction costs and amortization of inventory and fixed-asset step-ups and the related tax effects. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives up to 25 years. Exclusion of the non-cash amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. For example, we exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business, significant litigation-related matters and lump-sum pension plan settlements.\nCIRCOR’s management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the Company’s operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. We use such measures when publicly providing our business outlook, assessing future earnings potential, evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions and in our financial and operating decision-making process, including for compensation purposes.\nInvestors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in this news release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27 A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
