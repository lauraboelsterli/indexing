The 32-year-old broke down in tears and went on to smash his racket while waiting for the physiotherapist to arrive.\nAfter losing the first two points on his serve in the eighth game, Baghdatis decided to pull the plug on his campaign.\n1400 THIEM CONTINUES FINE FORM Seventh seed Dominic Thiem, who lifted his second title of the season in Lyon last week, raced to a 6-2 6-4 6-1 victory over Belarusian Ilya Ivashka.\nThe two-time French Open semi-finalist will next face promising Greek teenager Stefanos Tsitsipas.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “He’s one very good, upcoming player.
