    "text": "Pre-race favorite Justify won the Kentucky Derby by 2 1/2 lengths on Saturday, becoming the first horse in 136 years to win at Churchill Downs after not racing as a two-year-old.\nThe colt earns a sizable paycheck for his large ownership team: 62 percent of the $2 million purse, or $1.24 million.\nThe 52-year-old jockey, Mike Smith, also brings home a nice paycheck: The winning horse rider gets 10 percent of what the owners collect , meaning that Smith, who is the second-oldest jockey to win the Kentucky Derby, got a check for $124,000. That number will get shaved down to about $100,000 after paying his agent and valet, the person who gets the jockey's gear in place.\nAnd that's before taxes. Still, it's a nice payday for two minutes of work.\nIcon Sportswire | Getty Images Justify (7), ridden by jockey Mike Smith crosses the finish line to win the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs The second and third place jockeys get 5 percent of their owner's take ($400,000 and $200,000), meaning Jose Ortiz, who rode second place finisher Good Magic, earned $20,000 and Javier Castellano, who rode third place finisher Audible, earned $10,000.\nAfter fees, they'll take home closer to $14,000 and $7,000.\nAs for the 17 other jockeys, they won't make out nearly as favorably. Their ride is only worth \"a couple hundred dollars apiece,\" jockey agent Ron Anderson told CNBC in 2010 .\nLike this story?
