    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn., 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. (4M) announced today that Rob Klawonn has joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer to lead the commercialization of their industry-disruptive carbon fiber production technology to manufacture carbon fiber.\nMr. Klawonn assumes the role of CEO, succeeding Josh Kimmel, who has held the position for a year. Mr. Kimmel will continue to serve as the Company's President and will also be on the corporation's board of directors. \"Rob's expertise, knowledge, and network in the carbon fiber industry is exactly what 4M needs at this stage to ensure the company maximizes the value of the technology,\" said Kimmel.\nFor the past 10 years, Mr. Klawonn has been President of Teijin Carbon America (formerly Toho Tenax America) and since 2015, he has also been President of Diversified Structural Composites, a Teijin subsidiary producing various pultruded components for the Wind Energy and Industrial sectors. He served on the ACMA (American Composites Manufacturers Association) Board of Directors from 2015-2017.\nMr. Klawonn reflected: \"The past 10 years have been extremely challenging for materials businesses, including carbon fiber. While glass fiber composites are relatively mature, carbon fiber is still an adolescent with a tremendous future. 4M's plasma oxidation technology will position it to survive and thrive in a competitive landscape of incumbent materials such as steel, aluminum, and glass fiber composites.\"\n\"Our goal is to stand up multiple carbon fiber production lines in the next five years,\" said Rodney Grubb, Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of 4M. \"With his extensive background and industry experience, Rob will be instrumental in helping us to do that.\"\nAbout 4M Carbon Fiber Corp.\nNamed for plasma, the fourth state of matter, 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. is headquartered in Knoxville, TN as a unique manufacturer of carbon fiber and oxidized PAN fiber. The Company's atmospheric plasma oxidation process was co-developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and RMX Technologies, LLC. RMX developed a revolutionary plasma-based fiber oxidation technology with support from the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory and is supporting 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. in commercializing this technology to produce carbon fiber.

All statements regarding the Company's financial position, potential, business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations are Forward-Looking statements. Many of these statements contain words such as \"goal,\" \"aims,\" \"may,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"would,\" \"exceed,\" \"should,\" \"steady,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"dramatic,\" and variations of such words and similar expressions identify Forward Looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not a Forward-Looking statement. Because Forward Looking statements involve future risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The Company cannot predict the actual effect these factors will have on its results and many of the factors and their effects are beyond the Company's control. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely too heavily on these forward-looking statements.\nAgency Contact:\nChuck Morris\nMorris Creative Group LLC\n865-637-9869\n194283@email4pr.com\nCompany Contact:\nJosh Kimmel\n194283@email4pr.com\nwww.4MCarbonFiber.com\nView original content with multimedia: releases/4m-carbon-fiber-corp-hires-seasoned-industry-expert-as-ceo-300639580.html\nSOURCE 4M Carbon Fiber Corp.",
