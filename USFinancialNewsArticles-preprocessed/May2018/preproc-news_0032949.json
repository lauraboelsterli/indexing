    "text": "BAGHDAD, May 14 (Reuters) - Populist Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr’s electoral alliance is almost certainly headed for first place in Iraq’s parliamentary election with 91 percent of votes counted in 16 out of Iraq’s 18 provinces, the election commission said on Monday.\nThe commission had announced preliminary results from 10 provinces on Sunday and added six more on Monday. Results from Kurdish province Dohuk and the ethnically-mixed oil region of Kirkuk are yet to be announced.
