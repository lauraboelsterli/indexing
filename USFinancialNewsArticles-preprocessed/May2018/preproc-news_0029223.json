    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia and TORONTO, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Metalla Royalty & Streaming Ltd. (“Metalla”) (TSX-V:MTA) (OTCQX:MTAFF) (Frankfurt:X9CP) and ValGold Resources Ltd. (“ValGold”) (TSX-V:VAL) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\") whereby Metalla will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of ValGold (the \"Arrangement\"). Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, all of ValGold’s issued and outstanding common shares will be exchanged for Metalla common shares on the basis of 0.1667 of a Metalla common share for each ValGold common share (the \"Exchange Ratio\"). All currency is in Canadian Dollars unless otherwise noted.\nThe Exchange Ratio implies a consideration of $0.13 per ValGold common share, based on the 40-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Metalla common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) for the period ending May 9, 2018. This represents a 79% premium to the 40-day VWAP of ValGold common shares and 62.5% premium as of market close on May 9, 2018, on the TSXV. The undiluted equity value of the transaction is approximately $7.2 million.\nBENEFITS TO METALLA SHAREHOLDERS\nAcquisition of a 2% NSR royalty on the Garrison Project in a world-class mining district in Ontario, Canada Addition of a proven mine builder and high-quality counterparty Osisko Mining Inc. (TSX:OSK) the management team largely responsible for the discovery, development, financing, and commissioning of the Canadian Malartic Mine Enhances and expands growth-profile with a royalty on a gold development asset with approximately 1.2 million oz. measured and indicated resource and a 0.8 million oz. inferred resource Maintains cash balance through an all-share transaction Accretive to existing Metalla shareholders on a per share basis\nBENEFITS TO VALGOLD SHAREHOLDERS\nAn immediate premium of 79% to Valgold’s 40-day VWAP Enhanced market liquidity Access to Metalla’s dividend stream and policy on closing Significant asset diversification from Metalla’s portfolio of producing, development, and exploration royalties and streams with top-tier operators Maintains upside exposure to the Garrison Project through a Metalla ownership position and expected re-valuation of the related royalty through enhanced price discovery reflected in Metalla shares\nBrett Heath, President, and CEO of Metalla, stated, \"The acquisition of ValGold is an exciting transaction that strengthens Metalla’s development pipeline of royalties and adds a top-tier operator in a world-class mining jurisdiction with significant potential upside. This acquisition is consistent with our long-term strategy of executing accretive deals in known mining camps with strong counterparties.”\nKevin Snook, Chairman, and CEO of ValGold stated, “Metalla’s management team and board has built an impressive and diversified royalty and streaming portfolio in only 20 months. ValGold shareholders can look forward to seeing the full value of the Garrison royalty recognized in Metalla’s share price as well as improved market liquidity and exposure to Metalla’s dividend and diversified royalty and streaming assets.”\nGARRISON ROYALTY\nValGold holds a 2% net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty on certain claims of the Garrison Project (the “Garrison Royalty”), which covers the Garrcon and Jonpol properties, and the eastern portion of the 903 Zone. The Garrison Project is located approximately 100 kilometers east of Timmins Ontario, and 40 kilometers north of Kirkland Lake. It resides along the famous Golden Highway in the Timmins and Kirkland Lake region which has historically produced over 100 million ounces of gold.\nThe Garrison Project is 100% owned by Osisko Mining Inc. (“Osisko”) and consists of a portfolio of properties spanning a 50 km distance along the Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone, encompassing 16 non-contiguous properties including the Garrcon and Jonpol properties, 903 Zone, and Buffonta, and Golden Pike advanced exploration properties.\nThe Garrison Royalty covers 35 patented mining claims and three deposits known as the Garrcon and Jonpol properties, and the eastern portion of the 903 Zone. These claims were the subject of a National Instrument (NI) 43-101 resource estimate dated March 2014 by ACA Howe International Inc. which estimated the mineral resource according to CIM standards at the Garrcon and Jonpol properties to be:\nDomain Category Tonnes Au Grade\n(g/tonne) Au (troy\noz) Garrcon Measured 15,100,000 1.07 521,000 Garrcon and Jonpol Total Indicated 14,972,000 1.40 676,000 Garrcon and Jonpol Total Measured + Indicated 30,072,000 1.24 1,197,000 Garrcon and Jonpol Total Inferred 7,873,000 3.19 808,000 For further details, see technical report entitled “Technical Report on the Golden Bear Project - Garrison Property Larder Lake Mining Division Garrison Township, Ontario, Canada for Northern Gold Mining Inc.” dated March 3, 2014, filed by Northern Gold Mining Inc. on May 2, 2014 and available under Northern Gold Mining Inc.’s profile on SEDAR. This is a summary table for the Garrison Property (Garrcon and Jonpol deposits). These mineral resources were estimated using a 0.4 gpt Au cut-off grade for open pit and 1.5 gpt Au for underground resources. Moreover, all raw assays were top-cut to 112 g/tonne Au and 114 g/tonne Au for higher grade and lower grade domains, respectively. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and by definition do not demonstrate economic viability. This mineral resource estimate includes inferred mineral resources that are normally considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is also no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be converted to the measured and indicated resource categories through further drilling, or into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Readers are cautioned that inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined economically.\nAs of the end of January 2018, Osisko has completed 85,000 meters of new drilling since the 2014 resource update to complement the 108,000 meters drilled at Garrison by previous operators. Osisko has announced that it expects to release an updated resource estimate in July 2018.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION\nThe Arrangement Agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each of Metalla and ValGold. The ValGold board of directors recommends that ValGold shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement at the special meeting of shareholders to be called to approve the Arrangement (the “Special Meeting”). Evans & Evans, Inc. has provided an opinion to the board of directors of ValGold, stating that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of ValGold common shares pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view to such holders.\nCertain executive officers and directors of ValGold have entered into lockup agreements and have agreed to vote their ValGold securities in favour of the Arrangement.\nTRANSACTION SUMMARY\nUnder the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, ValGold shareholders will receive 0.1667 common shares of Metalla for each ValGold common share held as of the effective date of the Arrangement. Holders of ValGold stock options outstanding at closing will receive Metalla common shares on the basis of the in-the-money value of their ValGold options. Pursuant to the transaction, Metalla will issue an aggregate of approximately 9.5 million common shares to ValGold shareholders and optionholders. Upon completion of the Arrangement, current ValGold shareholders and optionholders will own approximately 11.2% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Metalla. Under the Arrangement, all existing warrants of ValGold will become exercisable to acquire Metalla common shares at exercise prices adjusted by the Exchange Ratio.\nThe Arrangement will be effected by way of a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Arrangement will require approval by 66 2 / 3 rds percent of the votes cast at the Special Meeting and any additional shareholder approvals which may be required under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions . In addition to shareholder and court approvals, the Arrangement is subject to applicable regulatory approvals (including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange) and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature.\nThe Arrangement Agreement includes customary provisions including non-solicitation of alternative transactions, right to match superior proposals and fiduciary-out provisions. In addition, ValGold has agreed to pay a termination fee to Metalla of $600,000 in the event of a termination of the Arrangement Agreement due to the occurrence of certain events. Metalla and ValGold have each agreed to pay a $150,000 expense reimbursement fee to the other party as reimbursement for certain expenses upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement due to the occurrence of certain other specified events.\nTIMING\nFull details of the proposed transaction will be included in ValGold’s management information circular, which is expected to be mailed to shareholders in early June 2018. It is anticipated that the Special Meeting and the closing of the proposed transactions will take place in mid-July 2018.\nQUALIFIED PERSON\nThe technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Charles Beaudry, geologist M.Sc., member of the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario and the Ordre des Géologues du Québec and a consultant to Metalla.

Forward-looking information in this press release includes, but is not limited to Metalla, ValGold and their respective shareholders; the timing and receipt of required shareholder, court, stock exchange and regulatory approvals for the Arrangement; the ability of ValGold and Metalla to satisfy the other conditions to, and to complete, the Arrangement, the anticipated timing of the mailing of ValGold’s information circular regarding the Arrangement; liquidity, enhanced value and capital markets profile of Metalla; future growth potential for Metalla, ValGold and their respective businesses; estimates regarding future profitability, release of a new resource estimate on the Garrison property, and expected re-valuation of Garrison royalty.\nIn respect of the forward‐looking statements and forward-looking information concerning the anticipated completion of the proposed Arrangement and the anticipated timing for completion of the Arrangement, the parties have provided such statements in reliance on certain assumptions that they believe are reasonable at this time, including assumptions as to the time required to prepare and mail shareholder meeting materials, including the required information circular; the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner, the necessary shareholder, court, stock exchange and regulatory approvals; and the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely manner, the other conditions to the closing of the Arrangement.

Readers are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward‐looking statements or forward-looking information.
