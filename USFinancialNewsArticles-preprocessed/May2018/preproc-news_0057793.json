    "text": "HALIFAX, NS, May 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - DHX Media Ltd. (or the \"Company\") (TSX: DHX.A, DHX.B), (NASDAQ: DHXM), announces that its common voting shares and variable voting shares now trade under the single ticker \"DHX\" on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"). As previously announced, this consolidation is solely an administrative change for trading purposes, which is designed to enhance the liquidity and trading volume of DHX Media's shares. The Company's shares will continue to trade under the ticker \"DHXM\" on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\"NASDAQ\").\nThe Company also announces the adoption by its board of directors (the \"Board of Directors\") of a new by-law (the \"Advance Notice By-Law\") that requires advance notice when director nominations are made by shareholders to provide for an orderly nomination process and ensure that shareholders are well-informed about director nominees in advance of shareholder meetings.\nSINGLE CUSIP AND TSX TICKER\nThe Company's common voting shares previously traded on the TSX under \"DHX.B\" (CUSIP 252406707). Its variable voting shares previously traded on the TSX under \"DHX.A\" and on the NASDAQ under \"DHXM\" (CUSIP 252406608).\nEffective today, both classes of shares have commenced trading under the single TSX symbol \"DHX,\" and on the NASDAQ under \"DHXM,\" as well as combining under the same CUSIP number 252406152. For trading purposes on the two stock exchanges and reporting in brokerage accounts, both classes of shares will also be combined under the single designation of \"Common and Variable Voting Shares\" of DHX Media.\nADVANCE NOTICE BY-LAW\nThe Company has adopted the \"Advance Notice By-law\" that requires advance notice be given to the Company when director nominations are made by shareholders other than through a request for a meeting or through a shareholder proposal, in each case in accordance with the Canada Business Corporations Act.\nThe Advance Notice By-law provides a clear process for shareholders to follow for director nominations, and will help ensure that all shareholders receive adequate notice and information about director nominees in order to exercise their voting rights in an informed manner. The Advance Notice By-law is similar to the advance notice by-laws adopted by many other Canadian public companies.\nAmong other things, the Advance Notice By-law fixes deadlines by which shareholders must notify DHX Media of director nominations prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders where directors are to be elected. It also sets forth the information about the proposed nominee that a shareholder must include in the notice for it to be valid.\nIn the case of an annual shareholder meeting, notice to the Company must be given not less than 30 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. In the event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the first public announcement of the meeting's date, notice may be given not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such announcement.\nIn the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is not also an annual meeting), notice to the Company must be given not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting.\nThe Advance Notice By-Law also prescribes the proper written form for a shareholder's notice and provides that the Company's Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, waive any requirement under these provisions.\nThe Advance Notice By-law is effective immediately and will be placed before shareholders for approval, confirmation and ratification at the next Annual and/or Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the \"Meeting\"). Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Advance Notice By-Law will cease to be effective unless it is approved, ratified and confirmed by a resolution adopted by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the Company at the Meeting.\nThe full text of the Advance Notice By-law is available under DHX Media's profile at www.sedar.com .\nAbout DHX Media\nDHX Media Ltd.
