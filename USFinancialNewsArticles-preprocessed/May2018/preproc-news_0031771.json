FILE PHOTO: Brazilian Partido Social Liberal (PSL) presidential candidate and former military officer Jair Bolsonaro gestures during a military event in Sao Paulo, Brazil May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File photo\nExcluding jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who will likely be barred if he registers to run, the MDA poll commissioned by transportation lobby CNT showed 18.3 percent of voters backing Bolsonaro, 11.2 pct for environmentalist Marina Silva, and 9.0 pct for leftist Ciro Gomes. The surveyâ€™s margin of error was 2.2 percentage points. Reporting by Maria Carolina Marcello and Anthony Boadle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
