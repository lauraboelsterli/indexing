(NASDAQ:HIIQ), a leading cloud-based technology platform and distributor of affordable individual and family health insurance and supplemental plans, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company will host a live conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 8:30 A.M. EST.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $67.8 million, compared to $55.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 21.3%. Total collections from members (premium equivalents) of $105.0 million compared to $90.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 15.5%. Net income was $6.0 million, compared to $8.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 29.4%. Drivers include higher stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 and a one-time tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $11.9 million, compared to $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 22.7%. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33, compared to $0.58 in the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 43.1%. Drivers are consistent with change in net income. Record adjusted earnings per share, also referred to as adjusted net income per share, or adjusted EPS, was $0.52 compared to $0.36 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 44.4%. Record policies in force as of March 31, 2018, totaled approximately 383,200, compared to 345,000 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 11.1%.\nPremium equivalents, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliations of these measures to their respective most directly comparable GAAP measure included within this press release.\n2018 Full Year Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms its annual guidance of revenue for 2018 to be between $290 million and $300 million or grow approximately 15% to 20% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA to be between $54 million and $57 million or grow approximately 20% to 25% year-over-year and adjusted EPS to be between $2.45 and $2.55 or grow approximately 48% to 55% year-over-year. These guidance numbers are based on the Company’s current method of accounting for revenue. As an emerging growth company, it will be adopting the revised revenue recognition standard, known as ASC 606, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n“Following a Q4 of 2017 that exceeded all expectations due to the shortened open enrollment period, the first quarter of 2018 has performed as expected, and we have record policies in force coupled with an outstanding compliance performance. As our market continues to evolve our first quarter provides an excellent foundation for the launch of our next generation of technology and the rest of 2018,” said Gavin Southwell, HIIQ's Chief Executive Officer and President.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Discussion\nFirst quarter revenues of $67.8 million increased 21.3%, compared to the first quarter in 2017, driven by an increase in policies in force, favorable commission margins, and improved discount benefit plan offerings.\nTotal selling, general & administrative expense (\"SG&A\") was $16.2 million (23.9% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $15.3 million (27.4% of revenues) in the same period in 2017. Core SG&A, defined as total SG&A adjusted for stock-based compensation, transaction costs, severance, restructuring and other costs, and marketing leads and advertising expense, was $11.0 million (16.2% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.8 million (17.5% of revenues) in the same period in 2017. A reconciliation of Core SG&A to SG&A is included within this press release.\nNet income was $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.5 million in the same period in 2017, a decrease of 29.4%. First quarter 2017 included a one-time approximate $3.3 million tax benefit related to the early adoption of an accounting policy related to share-based payment transactions. Additionally, stock-based compensation was $1.8 million higher in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year period. EBITDA was $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.0 million in the same period in 2017, an increase of 11.3%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 22.7% compared to $9.7 million in the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 17.6% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 17.4% in the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adjusting for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation and items that are not part of regular operating activities, including tax receivable adjustments, severance, restructuring, and acquisition costs. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 is included within this press release.\nGAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.33, compared to $0.58 in the same period in 2017. First quarter 2017 GAAP diluted EPS included a benefit that resulted from the above-described early adoption of an accounting policy related to share-based payment transactions. Additionally, the higher stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 had an unfavorable impact on GAAP diluted EPS.\nAdjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.52, compared to $0.36 in 2017. The increase in Adjusted EPS was driven by revenue from greater policies in force as well as a lower pro-forma statutory tax rate of 24%, compared to 38% used in the prior period. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income per share is included within this press release.\nThe Company makes advances to distributors based on actual sales. These advanced commissions assist distributors with working capital. The Company recovers advances on an ongoing basis from future commissions on premiums, which are collected over the period in which policies renew. At March 31, 2018, the short- and long-term advanced commission balance was $38.1 million, a $1.4 million decrease from the December 31, 2017 year-end balance of $39.5 million.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million from the December 31, 2017 year-end balance. The Company reclassified in-transit credit card and ACH receipts previously included in accounts receivable, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet to cash and cash equivalents. The change resulted in a $1.6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the first quarter 2018 and a $2.4 million increase to cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\nRegulatory Update\nAs previously disclosed, the Company is the subject of a multistate market conduct examination. The Company has been cooperating with all regulatory inquiries and as of May 2, 2018, no findings of any sort have been formally or informally communicated to the Company by the examiners.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call on May 3, 2018 at 8:30 A.M.

We have included EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. However, EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently than we do. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nTo calculate adjusted EBITDA, we calculate EBITDA, which is then further adjusted for non-cash items such as stock-based compensation and items that are not part of regular operating activities, including tax receivable adjustments, severance, restructuring, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have presented adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nTo calculate adjusted net income, we calculate net income then add back amortization (but not depreciation), interest, tax expense, non-cash items such as non-cash stock-based compensation and other items that are not part of regular operating activities, including, tax receivable adjustments, severance, restructuring, and acquisition costs. From adjusted pre-tax net income we apply a pro-forma tax expense calculated at an assumed rate of 24% and 38% for the first quarter in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that when measuring Company and executive performance against the adjusted net income measure, applying a pro forma tax rate better reflects the performance of the Company without regard to the Company’s organizational tax structure. We have included adjusted net income in this report because it is a key performance measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of our company. Other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do. Adjusted net income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or substitution for earnings per share as reported under GAAP.\nAdjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the total number of diluted Class A and Class B shares of our common stock for each period. We have included adjusted net income per share in this report because it is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. Other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do. Adjusted net income per share has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for earnings per share as reported under GAAP.\nReconciliation of Premium Equivalents to Revenues\n(unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Premium equivalents (1) $ 104,976 $ 90,940 Less risk premium 35,546 33,541 Less amounts earned by third party obligors 1,680 1,531 Revenues $ 67,750 $ 55,868 Premium equivalents is defined as our total collections, including the combination of premiums, fees for discount benefit plans, enrollment fees, and third-party commissions and referral fees. All amounts not paid out as risk premium to carriers or paid out to other third-party obligors are considered to be revenues for financial reporting purposes. We have included premium equivalents in this report because it is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the inclusion of premium equivalents can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. This financial measurement is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and is not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be used as, and is not an alternative to, revenues as a measure of our operating performance.\nSummary of Selected Metrics\n(unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nSubmitted Applications during the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change IFP 92,000 117,100 (21.4 )% Supplemental products 64,700 88,300 (26.7 )% Total 156,700 205,400 (23.7 )%\nPolicies in Force Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change IFP 192,300 173,700 10.7 % Supplemental products 190,900 171,300 11.4 % Total 383,200 345,000 11.1 %\nSubmitted IFP Applications by Channel Q1’17 Q2’17 Q3’17 Q4’17 Q1’18 eCommerce 31,800 13,500 20,600 27,200 18,900 All Others 85,300 82,400 72,500 98,600 73,100 Total 117,100 95,900 93,100 125,800 92,000\nCore SG&A as a Percentage of Revenue Q1’17 Q2’17 Q3’17 Q4’17 Q1’18 Total SG&A $ 15,257 $ 14,697 $ 15,503 $ 18,989 $ 16,213 Less: Stock-based compensation 821 934 2,682 2,967 2,633 Less (add): Transaction costs 306 450 5 (16 ) 56 Less: Severance, restructuring and other charges 533 363 238 672 287 Less: Marketing and Advertising 3,787 1,800 2,249 3,657 2,232 Core SG&A (1) $ 9,810 $ 11,150 $ 10,329 $ 11,709 $ 11,005 % of Revenue 17.6 % 18.0 % 16.3 % 16.8 % 16.2 % Core SG&A is defined as total SG&A adjusted for stock-based compensation, transaction costs, severance, restructuring and other costs, and marketing leads and advertising expense.\nContacts:\nHealth Insurance Innovations, Inc.: Michael Hershberger\nChief Financial Officer\n(813) 397-1187\nmhershberger@hiiQuote: .com Investor Contact: John Evans\nPIR Communications\n(415) 309-0230\nIR@hiiQuote: .com Media Contact for AgileHealthInsurance.com\n& HealthPocket.com : Kevin McVicker\nKmvicker@sbpublicaffairs.com Media Contact for HealthPocket.com : Cassandre Durocher\nCdurocher@sbpublicaffairs.com\nSource:Health Insurance Innovations, Inc.",
