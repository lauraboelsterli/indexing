    "text": "JERUSALEM, May 13 (Reuters) - Bangkok-based petrochemical producer Indorama Ventures has agreed to buy a 65.72 percent stake in Israelâ€™s Avgol Industries for about $314 million, the companies said on Sunday.\nIndorama will pay 5.78 shekels per share for a 50.76 percent in Avgol held by HFH International, and 14.96 percent owned by Leumi Partners, a subsidiary of Bank Leumi.\nBank Leumi said it expects a pre-tax gain of 118 million shekels ($33 million) from the sale.\nAvgol is a manufacturer of nonwovens for hygiene applications and holds a global market share of 10 percent. Its fabrics are used in diapers and feminine hygiene products.\nShares in Avgol, which has a market valuation of 1.16 billion shekels, were up 8.4 percent to 4.28 shekels in morning trade.\nThe transaction is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals, Indorama said.
