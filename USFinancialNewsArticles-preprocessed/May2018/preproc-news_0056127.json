    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 12:18 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Cricket-Patient Pakistan stay in control of first test Ed Osmond 2 Min Read\nLONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Pakistan continued to dominate the first test against England at Lordâ€™s as they moved calmly to 136 for three at lunch on the second day.\nThe touring side, who had dismissed England for 184 after losing the toss, resumed on 50 for one on another overcast day at the home of cricket on Friday, with Azhar Ali and Haris Sohail untroubled by a toothless England seam attack.\nAzhar played one glorious cover drive for four off Mark Wood and the pair took the total to 87 before Wood made the breakthrough, Sohail edging an outswinger to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow to depart for 39.\nEngland captain Joe Root rotated his fast bowlers in an effort to unsettle the batsmen before turning to off-spinner Dom Bess in his first test.\nAzhar nudged the 20-year-old for a single to bring up a half-century that included six fours, but the compact right-hand batsman failed to add to his tally, falling lbw to a full-length delivery from James Anderson.\nAsad Shafiq (28 not out) and Babar Azam (eight not out) took Pakistan to the interval without further mishap, Asad launching Bess for six over mid-wicket as his team look to build a substantial lead and put England under pressure at the start of the two-match series.
