    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pacific Ethanol, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEIX), a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels and high-quality alcohol products in the United States, reported its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNeil Koehler, Pacific Ethanol’s president and CEO, stated: “Production margins in the ethanol industry during the first quarter improved slightly from the fourth quarter of 2017 but remained compressed, as ethanol inventories reached an historic high in early March. The fundamentals have improved since then due to strong exports, higher fuel demand, and moderating overall ethanol production. Ethanol inventories have fallen nine percent over the last two months and are now five percent lower than last year at this time. We are optimistic the improved supply and demand balance will result in margin improvements as we enter the peak demand season.\n“Overall, the long-term fundamentals in our markets are getting stronger. Demand for our low carbon ethanol and high protein feed products is increasing both nationally and internationally. We continue to focus on product diversification and technology innovation to improve our operating efficiencies and financial performance.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to 2017\nNet sales were $400.0 million, compared to $386.3 million. The increase was due to an increase in production gallons sold offset in part by a reduction in both third-party gallons sold and in our average ethanol sales price per gallon. Total gallons sold of 232.7 million, compared to 226.2 million. Total production gallons sold of 140.8 million, compared to 115.0 million. Cost of goods sold was $396.7 million, compared to $392.1 million. Gross profit was $3.4 million, compared to gross loss of $5.8 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.3 million, compared to $5.5 million, which included $3.6 million in one-time gains associated with legal matters in the prior year. Operating loss was $6.0 million, compared to $11.2 million. Net loss available to common stockholders was $8.2 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to $12.9 million, or $0.31 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of negative $1.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $57.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $49.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time/11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 9, 2018.

The pass code will be 8857956.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement believes that certain financial measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") are useful measures of operations. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as unaudited net income (loss) attributed to Pacific Ethanol before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, asset impairments, purchase accounting adjustments, fair value adjustments, and depreciation and amortization expense. A table is provided at the end of this release that provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management provides this non-GAAP measure so that investors will have the same financial information that management uses, which may assist investors in properly assessing the company's performance on a period-over-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of performance under GAAP, or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.\nAbout Pacific Ethanol, Inc.\nPacific Ethanol, Inc.
