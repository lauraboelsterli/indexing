    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Two people died and 18 were injured when a regional train crashed into a truck in the northern Italian region of Piedmont, emergency services said on Thursday.\nItalian police officers inspect the place where a train plowed into a truck last night in Caluso near Turin, Italy, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Massimo Pinca The five-carriage train smashed into the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) late Wednesday after the lorry had broken through a level crossing and got stuck on the tracks between the towns of Rodallo and Caluso, Italy’s state train company said.\nThe drivers of both the train and a vehicle accompanying the HGV, which was carrying an exceptional load, were killed.\nThe local train connects the regional capital of Turin with the northern city of Ivrea.\nIt was the latest in a series of deadly accidents on Italy’s rail network.\nIn January three people were killed when a train derailed along a busy commuter route near Milan. In 2016, 23 people died when two trains collided in the southern region of Puglia.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Reporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ",
