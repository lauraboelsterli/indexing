    "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqis voted on Saturday in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, a poll which could affect the balance of power in the Middle East.\nAn Iraqi woman's finger is seen stained with ink at a polling station during the parliamentary election in the Sadr city district of Baghdad, Iraq May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Wissm al-Okili Here is how the new government will be formed, according to the Iraqi constitution, which specifies a 90-day process:\nIf the prime minister-designate fails to put together a governing coalition after 30 days, or if parliament rejects the prime minister-designate’s proposed cabinet, the president must nominate another candidate within 15 days.\nReporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
