    "text": "Published: May 25, 2018 10:34 a.m. ET Share\nDefect could prevent drivers from being able to slow down by canceling cruise function Getty Images Mike Manley, head of Ram brand at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\nBy Chester Dawson\nDETROIT—Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Friday it is recalling nearly five million vehicles in the U.S. to fix a flaw that prevents drivers from slowing down by canceling the cruise control function.\nThe auto maker FCAU, -1.98% said that drivers could lose control of vehicle speed “in an unlikely series of events” involving a short circuit in an electrical network, which would then maintain a set speed even if the brakes are tapped or a driver attempts to turn it off.\nFiat Chrysler said the errant cruise control can be overpowered by continuous application of the brakes or by shifting into neutral and bringing the vehicle to a halt. The company said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries from the flaw, but did identify one owner of a 2017 Dodge Journey crossover who experienced it.\nIt impacts certain 2014-2019 model year vehicles with automatic transmissions and gasoline-powered engines, the company said. Included are vehicles across 16 models sold under the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands, including the 2018 Jeep Wrangler SUV and 2014-2019 Ram 1500 pickup, it said. ",
