    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of Cara Therapeutics surged more than 20 percent on Wednesday after it signed a licensing agreement with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd that could give the U.S. drug developer up to $470 million in milestone payments.\nThe deal gives the kidney drug developer worldwide rights, except in the United States, Japan and South Korea, to sell Korsuva, Caraâ€™s injection for severe itching associated with chronic kidney disease in dialysis patients.\nCara will get an upfront payment of $50 million in cash and an equity investment of $20 million to acquire common stock at a price of about $17 per share, a premium of about 47 pct to its closing on Tuesday.\nCara began the first late-stage study for Korsuva injection in January and expects to start a similar study globally later in the year.\nReporting by Mrinalini Krothapalli\n ",
