    "text": "Top News\nTrade War Pause\nThe Sino-American trade war is “on hold”—Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s words there—after both the U.S. and China agreed to suspend their threats of massive tariffs on each other’s exports, while they conclude a long-lasting trade agreement. According to Donald Trump’s chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, the president is in a “very positive mood about this.” So are the markets—stocks, oil and the dollar are all up. NBC\nFacebook Breakup Call\nProgressive and pro-consumer groups are calling on the Federal Trade Commission to force the separation of Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp from the Facebook mothership. Their coalition, Freedom From Facebook, alleges that the company has amassed too much power and needs to be broken up—and also that privacy protections be boosted and cross-network communication made possible. Fortune\nAnti-Bullying Push\nThe British government is threatening social media companies with huge fines if they don’t combat bullying and harassment on their platforms. Digital minister Matt Hancock has revealed plans for a statutory code of conduct on Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, to be introduced in the fall. Facebook would also get big fines if it allows children under the age of 13 to sign up—something that’s actually already banned under the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Times of London\nGE Merger\nGeneral Electric’s transportation division, which makes train engines, may reportedly merge with Wabtec. That’s according to Reuters, which says the combined business could be valued at $20 billion and the merger may be announced this week. However, sources told the news organization that it was still possible the deal could fall through. Reuters Advertisement Around the Water Cooler\nGiuseppe Conte\nGiuseppe Conte is a 54-year-old law professor with hardly any political experience. And? He’s widely speculated to be the next Italian prime minister under a deal struck between the populist Five Star Movement and far-right League parties. Although Conte’s nomination is still not yet official, League leader Matteo Salvini issued this threat to Italian president Sergio Mattarella, who could theoretically veto the appointment: “We hope no one will place vetoes on this person’s name or surname. We won’t accept it.” Financial Times\nIran Deal\nIran is urging China to help protect the nuclear deal that’s threatened by U.S. withdrawal. “We expect other remaining members of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, including China, to help implement and continue this deal, and fulfil their commitment and obligations according to this deal,” the Iranian ambassador to China, Ali Asghar Khaji, said. “If we could gain these rights and benefits from this deal we will stay in it. If these Iranian rights were not satisfied, and our interests were not reached, we will think about other options.” South China Morning Post\nDirty Money\nThe U.K. Parliament’s foreign affairs committee says the country has been turning a blind eye to Russian “dirty money,” with London being used as a hiding place for the assets of President Vladimir Putin and his cronies. The committee accuses the government of a “lethargic response” to the poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Committee chair Tom Tugenhat wrote that “London’s markets are enabling the Kremlin’s efforts.” BBC\nDVD Lives\nNetflix’s DVD division, which boasts a mere three million subscribers, still exists and is still profitable—in the first quarter of this year, it made $56 million on revenues of $99 million. Why is it still around? Because some areas have poor connectivity, making streaming difficult. Also, because it has many more titles on offer than Netflix’s vastly more popular streaming service. And also, maybe because some subscribers don’t realize they haven’t cancelled their subscription. CNBC\nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer .
