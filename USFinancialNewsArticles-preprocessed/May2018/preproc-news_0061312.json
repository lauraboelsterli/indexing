So it set out to come up with its own metric for which US cities have improved most, since a city has to be \"capable of progress,\" it says, \"to be considered attractive in the long run.\"\nTo qualify what makes a city increasingly prosperous, RENTCafé looked at six indicators in cities with populations exceeding 100,000 to see how they've improved \"between 2000 and 2016, according to U.S. Census data, and single out the ones that have made the most progress overall.\"\nThe indicators include shifts in median income, home values and the share of residents with higher-education, as well as changes in population, poverty and unemployment rate. The final ranking is based on the combined value of the individual ranks of the six main fields.\nBased on that data, here are the top 5 most prosperous U.S. cities: Odessa, Texas",
