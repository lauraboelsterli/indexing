    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 5:32 PM / Updated 16 hours ago Weinstein's lawyer concerned about publicity, 'pressure' on prosecutors Brendan Pierson 3 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The lawyer defending movie mogul Harvey Weinstein against rape charges said Tuesday he was concerned that publicity surrounding the case and “inappropriate pressure” on prosecutors could be unfair to his client. Benjamin Brafman, Lawyer for Film producer Harvey Weinstein, exits the Manhattan Criminal Court following a meeting in New York, U.S., May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, spoke to reporters after a closed-door proceeding before New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke in Manhattan, which he said he had requested to raise his concerns about the case. Brafman said he expected Weinstein would be exonerated of the charges, which he called “absurd.”\nWeinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women, in some instances dating back decades, has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone. Benjamin Brafman, Lawyer for Film producer Harvey Weinstein, speaks to the press following a meeting at the Manhattan Criminal Court, in New York, U.S., May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nBrafman said he could not discuss the substance of the proceeding in detail and did not say exactly what action, if any, he had asked the judge to take. Weinstein did not appear at the proceeding.

Authorities did not identify the two women, but said the crimes took place in 2004 and 2013. If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between five and 25 years in prison. [nL2N1SW0E7]\nBrafman said Tuesday that Weinstein was accused of raping one woman, and that he had a 10-year consensual affair with her both before and after the alleged rape.
