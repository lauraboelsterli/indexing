REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo Here are some brief facts about the newest member of the Windsors.\n- Markle was born in Los Angeles on Aug. 4 1981, days after Harry’s father Prince Charles married his first wife Princess Diana. Her father Thomas Markle was a lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms and her mother Doria Ragland was a clinical therapist. Her parents divorced when she was six and she has two half-siblings.\n- She went to Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, a private all-girl Catholic school. However, after her engagement was announced, Harry’s spokesman said she identifies as a Protestant and would be baptized and confirmed into the Church of England before the wedding.\n- Markle attended the Northwestern University where she studied theater and international studies. She made her first TV appearance in a 2002 episode of medical drama “General Hospital” and has since appeared in a number of U.S. TV shows and films. She is best known for her role as Rachel Zane in the legal drama “Suits”.\n- In 2011, she married film producer Trevor Engelson but they divorced in 2013.\n- She ran her own lifestyle blog, thetig.com, and has worked as a humanitarian campaigner, acting for the likes of World Vision and as a United Nations women’s advocate.\n- She met Harry on a blind date organized by a mutual friend in London in July 2016. They became engaged in November 2018.\nReporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
