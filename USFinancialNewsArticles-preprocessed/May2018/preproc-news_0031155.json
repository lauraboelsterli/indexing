    "text": "Author Tom Wolfe, chronicler and satirist of American culture, dies at age 87 Published 13 Mins Ago The Associated Press Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Author Tom Wolfe speaks during a post-screening discussion at the 10th Annual FOLCS Film Festival in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2015.\nAuthor Tom Wolfe , who chronicled everything from hippies to the space race before turning his sharp eye to fiction, has died. He was 87.\nWolfe's agent Lynn Nesbit told The Associated Press that Wolfe died in a New York City hospital. Additional details were not immediately available.\nThe \"new journalism\" reporter and novelist insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it. His writing style was rife with exclamation points, italics and improbable words.\nAmong his acclaimed books were \"The Right Stuff\" and \"The Bonfire of the Vanities,\" a satire of Manhattan-style power and justice that became one of the best-selling books of the '80s.",
