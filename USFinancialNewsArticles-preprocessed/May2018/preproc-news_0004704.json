French revenue rose 0.6 percent to 1.3 billion euros.\nInternational revenue growth was also strong, with Europe excluding France up 7.4 percent to 2.4 billion euros, although unfavourable exchange rates - mainly the strong euro - shaved 204 million euros off its revenue.\nRevenue in the rest of the world was up 14.7 percent to 1.6 billion euros, but up just 2.8 percent after factoring in currency swings, while Asia and Latin America both grew more than 20 percent at constant exchange rates.\nVeolia CEO Antoine Frerot said new lines of business represented more than half of the first-quarter’s revenue growth. These include plastics and chemicals recycling, toxic waste handling, management of water for aquaculture, production of energy from waste or biomass and the capture of methane.\n“This is the main engine of our growth today and will be in the years ahead,” he said.\nFrerot said new services now make up about 30 percent of Veolia’s revenue, from 15 percent five years ago.\nVeolia is boosting recycling and waste water handling services for industrial companies as its traditional French water business faces pressure from contract renegotiations.\nFrerot said Veolia is still eyeing small to medium-size acquisitions and could buy companies valued at a few hundreds of millions of euros this year.\nCFO Philippe Capron said that after repaying a 1.4 billion euro hybrid loan this year, Veolia will not deleverage further. It has net financial debt of 9.6 billion.\nVeolia’s core earnings rose 3.4 percent to 876 million euros, in line with forecasts for 872 million euros.\nCurrent earnings rose 4.8 percent to 448 million, while net profit jumped 26 percent to 193 million euros partly because of capital gains on the sale of its industrial cleaning unit in the United States.\nVeolia confirmed its earnings guidance. For 2018 it forecasts core earnings growth greater than in 2017, while for 2019, it expects core earnings of at least 3.3 billion to 3.5 billion euros.\nFrerot said that Veolia could not bid for unlisted smaller French competitor Saur if it were to be sold, for antitrust reasons.\nHe said Veolia had begun international arbitrage court proceedings with the government of Gabon, which seized its assets there earlier this year. In the first quarter of last year, Gabon accounted for 79 million euros of revenue and 16 million of core earnings.\n$1 = 0.8340 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Adrian Croft\nOur ",
