    "text": "– Delivers 9% net sales growth over Q1 2017 –\nOAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) today announced results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our start to 2018 with a 9% increase in net sales,” stated Tarang Amin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Highlights for the quarter included our full-chain rollout at Ulta Beauty, our most successful Beautyscape influencer program and product collaborations to date, and expanding our operations advantage to our first U.S. manufacturing partner.”\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 results\nNet sales increased 9%, or $5.3 million from the first quarter of 2017, to $65.9 million, primarily driven by growth in leading national retailers largely attributable to the benefit of shelf space acquired in 2017 and the addition of store locations at Ulta Beauty. Gross margin decreased from 63% to 61% in the first quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates, customer mix and freight, partially offset by margin accretive innovation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $36.2 million, or 55% of net sales, compared to $33.0 million, or 54% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017. SG&A includes $4.6 million of costs and expenses that are non-cash or that management does not believe are reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations. Adjusted SG&A, excluding these costs and expenses, was $31.7 million, or 48% of net sales, compared to $29.4 million, or 49% of net sales in the same period in fiscal 2017.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and included discrete tax expense of $0.2 million related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock. This is as compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which included a benefit from stock option exercises of $0.8 million. The increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a reduction in our U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the tax reform laws effective as of the beginning of 2018.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, based on a weighted-average share count of 49.3 million shares. This compares to net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, based on a weighted-average share count of 49.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (EBITDA excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) increased 3% to $11.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income (net income excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was unchanged in the first quarter of 2018, at $5.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, based on a weighted-average diluted share count of 49.3 million. This is as compared to a weighted-average diluted share count 49.5 million in the same quarter of 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company excluded the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, net of the related tax effect, from both current and prior period adjusted net income.\nBalance sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $10.5 million in cash, as compared to $10.1 million as of December 31, 2017. Inventory at March 31, 2018 totaled $61.7 million, compared to $62.7 million on December 31, 2017 and $76.9 million on March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, long-term debt totaled $145.7 million, as compared to $147.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nCompany outlook\nThe Company reaffirmed its outlook for 2018:\nFiscal 2018 Outlook (Approx.)\nFiscal 2017 Actual\n% Change Net sales $ 286-291 million $ 270 million 6-8% Adjusted EBITDA $ 65-66.5 million $ 62 million 6-8% Adjusted net income $ 30-31 million $ 32 million (a) (1)-(4)% Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.59-0.61 $ 0.64 (a) (5)-(8)% Fully diluted shares outstanding 51.4 million 49.4 million — (a) The Company's 2018 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets. The Company began excluding these items from its adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS metrics beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 adjusted net income includes $4.4 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets (net of the related tax effect).\nFirst quarter 2018 conference call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, May 9, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results.

Beauty, visit the Company’s website at http://www.elfcosmetics.com .\nNote regarding non-GAAP financial measures\nThis press release includes references to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted SG&A, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because its management uses them as supplemental measures in assessing its operating performance, and believes they are helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company’s performance. The non-GAAP measures included in this press release are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company’s definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA excludes costs related to “restructuring” of operations, stock-based compensation, retail store pre-opening costs and other non-cash and non-recurring costs. Adjusted net income excludes costs related to “restructuring” of operations, stock-based compensation, retail store pre-opening costs, other non-cash and non-recurring costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments. With respect to the Company’s expectations under “Company Outlook” above, the Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS guidance non-GAAP measures to the corresponding net income and diluted EPS GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. The Company cannot provide meaningful estimates of the non-recurring charges and credits excluded from these non-GAAP measures due to the forward-looking nature of these estimates and their inherent variability and uncertainty. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including those statements relating to the Company’s outlook for 2018 under “Company Outlook” above. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecasts, projections, beliefs and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among other things, the risks and uncertainties that are described in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, including the Company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company’s ability to grow net sales and adjusted EBITDA as anticipated; the Company’s ability to effectively compete with other beauty companies; the Company’s ability to successfully introduce new products; the Company’s ability to attract new retail customers and/or expand business with its existing retail customers; the loss of any of the Company’s key retail customers or if the general business performance of its key retail customers declines; and the Company’s ability to effectively manage its SG&A and other company expenses. Potential investors are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\ne.l.f.
