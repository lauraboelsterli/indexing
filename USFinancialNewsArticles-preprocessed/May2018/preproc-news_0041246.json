    "text": "Published: May 13, 2018 7:53 p.m. ET Share\nLatest agreement with Icahn, Deason overhauls Xerox board Reuters Xerox said it opted to back out of the deal with Fujifilm because of material deviations in the audited financials from unaudited financials.\nBy Cara Lombardo\nXerox Corp. said it will back out of its merger deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. as it reached a new settlement with two of its biggest shareholders, the latest twist in a monthslong tug of war over the future of the iconic American company.\nXerox XRX, +2.86% said it reached a settlement to replace its chief executive and overhaul its board after it ended a plan to combine with its joint venture with Fujifilm FUJIY, +1.04% . This is Xerox’s second settlement with activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason; the company had earlier struck a deal with the two billionaires to oust Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson and flip the board, but that agreement abruptly expired earlier this month before receiving court approval.\nIf it remains in place, the new deal marks a win for Icahn and Deason, who agreed to table their proxy fight after several months of drama. They opposed the plan to combine with the joint venture Fuji Xerox, arguing it undervalued Xerox, and had planned to run their own slate of directors for Xerox’s board.\nNow, the new Xerox board will immediately begin examining strategic alternatives.\nAs part of the settlement, John Visentin will replace Jacobson as chief executive, the company said Sunday. Visentin is a former executive at several technology companies and had been working with the activist investors at Xerox.",
