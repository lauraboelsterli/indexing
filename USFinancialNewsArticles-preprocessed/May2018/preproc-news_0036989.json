    "text": "GRAND CAYMAN, May 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Physical Hard Assets Fund SPC announced today the appointment of Philip Judge as the new Chief Executive Officer of Physical Hard Assets Fund SPC and Physical Gold Fund SP.\nPhilip Judge also serves as Managing Director of Vigilant Capital, the Fund's Sponsor. Mr. Judge has worked closely with the Fund's management team since its inception particularly with structuring, planning, and launch.\nMr. Judge brings 30 years of expertise involving the acquisition, custody, management, and logistics in the precious metals industry to Physical Gold Fund's executive team. Having done business in multiple jurisdictions including Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Dubai, USA, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands, Uruguay, and Panama, his international experience brings a dense web of long-standing industry connections to the fund. He has extensive experience in international business law, regulation, multi-jurisdictional business architecture, corporate structuring, and banking.\n\"Since 2001, the business environment has changed rapidly and dramatically around the globe but never more than in international business regulation, structuring, investment, compliance, and banking.\" Philip argues, \"Far too many international institutions and investors have been on the back foot and reactionary to massive changes facing international business and investment over the last decade. It is with this in mind, and the impact on gold investors, that we have structured this world-leading Fund.\"\n\"We are excited to have Philip step into the role of CEO for Physical Gold Fund,\" says Alex Stanczyk, Managing Director. \"His deep well of expertise and relationships in the industry are incredibly rare and allows our Fund access to connections in the industry that are unrivaled. In addition, his many years of international business experience provide a perspective into international business structuring that has been instrumental in developing a governance, jurisdictional, and risk mitigation stack unique in the industry. It enhances our ability to manage risk during a liquidity crisis, which is arguably the most important role for a physical gold position.\"\nAbout Physical Hard Assets Fund SPC\nPhysical Hard Assets Fund SPC is a Segregated Portfolio Company domiciled in Cayman Islands and regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA).\nAbout Physical Gold Fund SP\nPhysical Gold Fund SP (PGF) is a Segregated Portfolio Fund of the Physical Hard Assets Fund SPC.
