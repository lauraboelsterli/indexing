    "text": "TORONTO, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Atomic Corporation (“Global Atomic” or the “Company”), (TSX-V:GLO) is pleased to announce continuing positive results from its 2018 DASA Uranium Project drill program in the Republic of Niger, West Africa and a record zinc production year from its Zinc operations in Iskenderun, Turkey.\n3D Model : DASA Open Pit and Underground Resources Model With Planned Drilling\nDrill Hole Longitudinal Section 1925\nDrill Hole Longitudinal Section 1950\nAt DASA, the focus of current drilling is to continue to define the “Flank Zone” area in order to complete an updated National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) resource technical report by CSA Global Pty Ltd of Perth, Western Australia. Two holes just completed and probed have returned excellent results which continue to improve the overall DASA resource.\nDASA Project Highlights:\nDrill hole ASDH 126B intersected continuous high-grade mineralization from 58.5 meters to 262.6 meters returning a 204.1 meter intersection grading 8,062 ppm; including 28,490 ppm (2.85%) eU 3 O 8 over 28.2 meters. This hole was drilled vertically and oblique to the dip to prove that the mineralization is continuous and is therefore not an indication of the true thickness of the zone. Drill hole ASDH 563 intersected 7,277 ppm eU 3 O 8 over 107.3 meters including 12,456 ppm over 46.1 meters. This hole has been drilled perpendicular to the structure and approximates true thickness in this area. In drill hole ASDH 563 the probe was saturated for 8.5 meters from 231.2 meters to 239.7 meters. A new mineralized zone was discovered along strike and north of the main DASA deposit, called Tagama East, which has not been factored into the current resource estimate. See drill holes below. DASA drilling table (drills sections attached):\nHole From (meters) – To (meters) Length (meters) Grade (ppm eU 3 O 8 ) Flank Zone\nASDH 126B\nincluding\n58.5 - 262.6\n187.1 – 215.3\n204.1\n28.2 8,062\n28,490 ASDH 563\nincluding\nincluding 142.9 - 250.2\n198.0 - 244.1\n231.2 - 239.7 107.3\n46.1\n8.5 7,277\n12,456\n25,140 (saturated) Tagama East\nDADH 380 521.4 – 544.5 23.1 1,027 DADH 386 290.5 – 315.8 25.3 1,759 * These are preliminary results based on gamma probing. Drillhole ASDH 563 is currently being probed with a Geiger-M ü ller probe, which will give a more accurate result. Final results will be released once chemical assaying is completed at ALS Global in Vancouver, Canada.\nDrilling on the Flank Zone will continue for the next month in order to achieve a Measured and Indicated resource classification in this area. Further drilling on strike and down dip will continue in order to build the overall DASA resource. A number of high priority targets will be the focus of the exploration drilling.\nManagement expects the updated NI 43-101 resource estimate to be completed in Q3 2018 and a technical report prior to year-end 2018.\nMr. George Flach, P.Geo., VP, Exploration for Global Atomic said “The drilling, contractors and our local Nigerien team are making significant progress advancing this high value uranium project. DASA is proving to be an outstanding asset which continues to improve”.\n3D Model : DASA Open Pit and Underground Resources Model With Planned Drilling is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/8fb1d627-13d4-4dea-b49b-640f5f96b183\nDrill Hole Longitudinal Section 1925 is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/a71f0c3e-3d21-4673-beff-085c31062aad\nDrill Hole Longitudinal Section 1950 is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/b7745820-ccda-4094-8616-92da0038a466\nZinc Operation Highlights:\n2017 was a record year with 33 million pounds (100%) of zinc produced in concentrate (2016 – 22 million pounds). The Company’s 49% share of EBITDA of the joint venture was $10.8 million in 2017 (2016 – $4.6 million). The Company’s 49% share of the net earnings of the joint venture was $6.9 million in 2017 (2016 - $3.5 million) with earnings per share of $0.048 based on the currently outstanding 107 million shares. Based on Turkish earnings for 2017, a dividend of 47.3 million Turkish Lira was declared on April 27, 2018, with distribution to the joint venture partners in mid-May (the Company’s share is approximately $7.2 million). Steel market conditions in Turkey continue to improve and zinc prices remain strong. Based on improved market conditions, the Turkish joint venture is studying expansion and modernization of the Turkish plant, which will double production and reduce costs. The expansion is expected to be undertaken in 2019, with costs paid from operating earnings and available lines of credit.\nPlease visit the corporation’s website, www.globalatomiccorp.com , for the latest news and our 2017 Financial Statements and MD&A which are now posted to the website and www.sedar.com .\nInvestor Relations\nGlobal Atomic also announced it has entered into an agreement with third party investor relations provider Renmark Financial Communications (“Renmark”) for the period February 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019 subject to a right of early termination in favour of the Company after the initial six month period.
