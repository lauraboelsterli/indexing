    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enstar Group Limited (Nasdaq:ESGR) filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC today, reporting its earnings and financial position for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nEnstar reported consolidated net losses of $41.2 million (or $2.12 per fully diluted share of losses) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net earnings of $54.7 million (or $2.80 per fully diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included net unrealized losses of $100.3 million on fixed maturities investments, which are accounted for on a trading basis. Many insurance companies predominantly use available-for-sale accounting where unrealized amounts are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity and therefore do not impact earnings. Unrealized amounts would only become realized in the event of a sale of the specific securities prior to maturity or a credit default.\nEnstar's shareholders' equity at March 31, 2018 amounted to $3,100 million (or $157.06 per fully diluted share), a slight decrease from $3,136.7 million (or $159.19 per fully diluted share) as at December 31, 2017. The Form 10-Q, which is available on Enstar's website, www.enstargroup.com , contains a more detailed description of Enstar's business and financial results.\nAbout Enstar\nEnstar is a multi-faceted insurance group, with over $15.6 billion in assets, that offers innovative capital release solutions and specialty underwriting capabilities through its network of group companies in Bermuda, the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, and other international locations. Enstar is a market leader in completing legacy acquisitions, having acquired over 80 companies and portfolios since its formation in 2001.
