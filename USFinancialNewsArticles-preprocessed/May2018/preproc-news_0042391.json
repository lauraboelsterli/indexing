FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Scotland vs England - BT Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Britain - February 24, 2018 Scotland’s John Barclay celebrates with the Calcutta Cup trophy after victory over England Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith/File Photo\nBarclay sustained the injury while playing for Scarlets in the Pro14 semi-final win over Glasgow Warriors last week.\nThe 31-year-old flanker will miss Scotland’s autumn tests against Fiji, South Africa and Argentina in November and the start of the season with his new club Edinburgh.\n\"It's naturally disappointing to lose one of our key summer signings through injury but I'm more disappointed for the player, as I know how much he was looking forward to getting stuck into pre-season,\" Edinburgh coach Richard Cockerill told the club website www.edinburghrugby.org .\n“We’re still looking forward to welcoming a man of John’s calibre into the group this summer where I know he will help build on the culture and environment that we established last season.”\nBarclay was already rested by coach Gregor Townsend for Scotland’s tour of Canada, U.S, and Argentina next month.
