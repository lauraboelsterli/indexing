    "text": "PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Entercom Communications (NYSE: ETM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet revenues for the quarter were $300.6 million, compared to $99.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a same-station basis, net revenues for the quarter were $300.6 million compared to $324.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 Net loss per diluted share for the quarter was ($0.10), compared to net loss per diluted share of ($0.25) in the first quarter of 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $30.1 million, compared to $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2017\nDavid J. Field, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Since closing on our merger in November, we have moved quickly to implement rapid change and have made good progress on our various integration, synergy and transformation goals. We have built a terrific leadership team and are driving strong ratings growth and launching a number of revenue-driving initiatives to capitalize on our scale and compete far more effectively against other media for a larger share of ad spending. Earlier today, we announced the launch of the Entercom Audio Network which will enable us to use our scale to participate directly in the $1 billion network radio market. Our first quarter financial results were adversely affected by soft general local advertising conditions and a number of temporary factors, most notably the exclusion of $12 million in revenue due to financial issues at USTN. As these temporary factors abate and our growth initiatives take hold, we look forward to driving meaningful sustainable growth as we capitalize on the compelling brands, assets and capabilities of this exciting, emerging company.”\nAdditional Information\nToday the Company announced the launch of the Entercom Audio Network which will enable the company to capitalize on its scale and reach to participate directly in the $1 billion network radio business. Launching on July 1, 2018, the network will cover close to 90% of people 12+ in the top 50 markets.\nIn April, the Company entered into a new agreement with United States Traffic Network (“USTN”) which sells short duration advertising (sponsored traffic reports) and provides guaranteed revenue to the Company. USTN completed its separation from its former corporate parent and has moved quickly to establish a solid new business model.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding $1,452 million of senior debt under its credit facilities and $400 million in senior notes (both amounts exclude unamortized premium from purchase price accounting). In addition, the Company had $34.8 million in cash on hand.\nEarnings Conference Call and Company Information\nEntercom will hold a conference call regarding the quarterly earnings release on Tuesday May 8, 2018 at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. The public may access the conference call by dialing Toll Free: 888-889-0278 and Toll: 312-470-7365, passcode: Entercom (domestic and international callers).

A webcast replay of the conference call will be available beginning six hours after the call on the Company’s website for a period of two weeks. Additional information is available on the Company’s website at www.entercom.com .\nCertain Definitions\nAll references to per share data, unless stated otherwise, are presented as per diluted share. All references to shares outstanding, unless stated otherwise, are presented to exclude unvested restricted stock units. All references to net debt are outstanding debt net of cash on hand.\nSame Station Net Revenues consist of net revenues adjusted for material station acquisitions and dispositions as if these acquisitions and dispositions had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior period.\nStation Expenses consist of station operating expenses excluding non-cash compensation expense.\nCorporate Expenses consist of corporate general and administrative expenses excluding non-cash compensation expense.\nStation Operating Income consists of operating income (loss) before: depreciation and amortization; time brokerage agreement fees (income); corporate general and administrative expenses; non-cash compensation expense (which is otherwise included in station operating expenses); impairment loss; merger and acquisition costs, other expenses related to the refinancing; non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) available to common shareholders, adjusted to exclude: income taxes (benefit); income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes or benefit; total other income or expense; net interest expense; depreciation and amortization; time brokerage agreement fees (income); non-cash compensation expense (which is otherwise included in station operating expenses and corporate G&A expenses); other expenses related to the refinancing; impairment loss, merger and acquisition costs, preferred stock dividends; non-recurring expense recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs, and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets.\nPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude those costs incurred by the prior owner that were not assumed by the Company or were unusual in nature and adjustments for material acquisitions and divestitures as if these acquisitions and divestitures had occurred as of the beginning of the period presented.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow consists of operating income (loss): (i) plus depreciation and amortization; net (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets; non-cash compensation expense (which is otherwise included in station operating expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses); impairment loss; merger and acquisition costs; other expenses related to the refinancing; other income and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; income from discontinued operations (excluding income taxes or tax benefit); and (ii) less net interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or debt premium), preferred stock dividends, taxes paid, capital expenditures and amortizable intangibles.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) consists of net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted to exclude: (i) income taxes (benefit) as reported, including income taxes otherwise included in income from discontinued operations; (ii) gain/loss on sale of assets, derivative instruments and investments; (iii) non-cash compensation expense; (iv) other income; (v) impairment loss; (vi) merger and acquisition costs, other expenses related to the refinancing, loss on extinguishment of debt and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; and (vii) gain/loss on early extinguishment of debt. For purposes of comparability, income taxes are reflected at the expected statutory federal and state income tax rate of 30% and 40% without discrete items of tax for the years 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share - Diluted includes any dilutive equivalent shares when not anti-dilutive. Convertible Preferred Stock is treated as if it never converted for the purposes of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share - Diluted.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIt is important to note that station operating income, station expense, corporate expense, same station net revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share - Diluted and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management believes that these measures are useful as a way to evaluate the Company and the means for management to evaluate our radio stations’ performance and operations. Management believes that these measures are useful to an investor in evaluating our performance because they are widely used in the broadcast industry as a measure of a radio company’s operating performance.\nCertain adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are presented in this release (e.g., Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share - Diluted). The adjustments exclude gain/loss on sale of assets, derivative instruments, and investments; non-cash compensation expense, other income, impairment loss, merger and acquisition costs, other expenses related to the refinancing, and gain/loss on early extinguishment of debt and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs. For purposes of comparability, income taxes for 2018 and 2017 are reflected at the expected federal and state income tax rate of 30% and 40%, respectively, without adjustment for discrete tax adjustments.\nManagement believes these adjusted non-GAAP measures provide useful information to Management and investors by excluding certain income, expenses and gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating and financial results. Similarly, Management believes these adjusted measures are a useful performance measure because certain items included in the calculation of net income (loss) may either mask or exaggerate trends in the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, the reconciliations corresponding to these adjusted measures, by identifying the individual adjustments, provide a useful mechanism for investors to consider these adjusted measures with some or all of the identified adjustments.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures on an ongoing basis to help track and assess the Company's financial performance. You, however, should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), operating income, or any other measure for determining our operating performance that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The accompanying financial tables provide reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures provided in this release.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this news release is being widely disseminated in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD.\nThis news announcement contains certain forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and certain unaudited pro forma information that is presented for illustrative purposes only and involves certain risks and uncertainties within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
