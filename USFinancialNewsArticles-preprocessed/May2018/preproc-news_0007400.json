    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 12:56 PM / Updated 8 hours ago Britain intervenes in Daily Mirror-Express deal Reuters Staff 1 Britain ordered regulators on Tuesday to investigate the Daily Mirror publisher’s deal to buy the Express tabloids because of the potential impact on the titles’ editorial policies and the need for a range of views in newspapers. Britain's Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Matt Hancock arrives in Downing Street in London, May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\nTrinity Mirror ( TNI.L ) scooped up titles including the Daily Express, Daily Star and OK! magazine for 127 million pounds in February in the biggest shake up of Britain’s cut-throat newspaper industry in decades.\nMedia secretary Matt Hancock asked media regulator Ofcom to examine whether the deal would have any impact on the free expression of opinion and editorial decision marking. He asked the competition regulator to look at whether there would still be a sufficient plurality of views in the sector. Reporting by Kate Holton, Editing by Paul Sandle",
