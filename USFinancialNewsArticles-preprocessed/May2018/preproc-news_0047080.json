Mandatory Credit: Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports A five-time Memorial champion heading back to Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, for the first time since 2015, Woods will play the opening two rounds with Jason Dufner and England’s Justin Rose.\nDufner posted a three-shot win last year in the Memorial, while Rose is coming off a dominant victory Sunday in the Fort Worth (Texas) Invitational at Colonial Country Club.\nWoods was the Memorial champion in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2009 and 2012. The only events he has won more often are the Bridgestone Invitational (eight times), the Arnold Palmer Invitational (eight), the Farmers Insurance Open (seven), the Buick Invitational (six) and the WGC-American Express Championship/CA Championship/Mexico Championship (six times).\nIn his latest tournament, Woods tied for 11th at the Players Championship. The 42-year-old has appeared in eight events this year after recovering from back problems, and his best results were a tie for second at the Valspar Championship and a tie for fifth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.\nRose won the Memorial title in 2010.\nThe other featured pairings at Muirfield Village on Thursday and Friday:\nDustin Johnson, Australia’s Jason Day, Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy\nJordan Spieth, Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson\nJustin Thomas, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler\n—Field Level Media\n ",
