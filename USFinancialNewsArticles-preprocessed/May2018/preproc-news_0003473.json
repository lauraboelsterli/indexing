We consider these non-IFRS measures to be a meaningful supplement to net earnings. We also believe these non-IFRS measures are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance. These measures, which included direct operating expenses and net operating income do not have standardized meaning under IFRS. While these non-IFRS measures have been disclosed herein to permit a more complete comparative analysis of the Company’s operating performance and debt servicing ability relative to other companies, readers are cautioned that these non-IFRS measures as reported by TWC may not be comparable in all instances to non-IFRS measures as reported by other companies.\nThe glossary of financial terms is as follows:\nDirect operating expenses = expenses that are directly attributable to company’s business units and are used by management in the assessment of their performance. These exclude expenses which are attributable to major corporate decisions such as impairment.\nNet operating income = operating revenue – direct operating expenses\nNet operating income is an important metric used by management in evaluating the Company’s operating performance as it represents the revenue and expense items that can be directly attributable to the specific business unit’s ongoing operations. It is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of performance under IFRS. The most directly comparable measure specified under IFRS is net earnings.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Operating Highlights\nNet loss increased to $7,301,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from $3,615,000 in 2017 primarily due to a $2,104,000 gain on the sale of Grandview Resort recorded in 2017.\nBasic and diluted loss per share was 27 cents per share for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss of 13 cents per share in 2017.\nThe exchange rate used for translating US denominated earnings has changed to a quarterly average of 1.2648 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 1.3230 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar over the one year period.\nConsolidated operating revenue decreased 3.3% to $23,539,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from $24,347,000 in 2017, due in part to the stronger Canadian dollar used to translate the US based revenue.\nConsolidated operating expenses decreased 2.6% to $22,983,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from $23,589,000 in 2017.\nNet operating income for the Canadian golf club operations segment increased 24.6% to $2,986,000 in 2018 from $2,397,000 in 2017.\nNet operating income for US golf club operations segment decreased 32.8% to US $1,294,000 in 2018 from US $1,926,000 in 2017. The Florida golf market continues to be a very competitive market with discounting of green fee rates.\nNet operating loss for the rail and port operations changed slightly to US $2,609,000 from US $2,601,000 in 2017.\nConsolidated net operating income decreased 26.6% to $556,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from $758,000 in 2017.\nAmortization of membership fees decreased 13.8% to $1,654,000 from $1,918,000 in 2017 due to the completion of the amortization periods of revenue for members that joined in 2004. This was completed in 2017.\nInterest, net decreased 1.0% to $4,037,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from $4,078,000 in 2017 due primarily to a 4.0% decline in borrowings year over year offset by an increase in interest rates.\nThe overall effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 26.3% as compared to 49.2% in 2017 due to a decline in the US effective tax rate used for the Company's US operations.\nEligible Dividend\nToday, TWC Enterprises Limited announced an eligible cash dividend of 2 cents per share to be paid on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as at May 31, 2018.\nCorporate Profile\nTWC is engaged in golf club operations under the trademark, “ClubLink One Membership More Golf.” TWC is Canada’s largest owner and operator of golf clubs with 53.5 18-hole equivalent championship and 3.5 18-hole equivalent academy courses at 41 locations in Ontario, Quebec and Florida.\nTWC is also engaged in rail and port operations based in Skagway, Alaska, which operate under the trade name “White Pass & Yukon Route.” The railway stretches approximately 110 kilometres (67.5 miles) from Skagway, Alaska, to Carcross, Yukon.
