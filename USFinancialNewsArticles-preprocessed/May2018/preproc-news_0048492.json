    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westhaven Ventures Inc. (TSX-V:WHN) announces that Grenville Thomas will be moving into the role of Chairman of the Board. Mr. Thomas is the largest shareholder of Westhaven. Gareth Thomas, Westhaven’s founder and Director, will assume the roles of President & CEO. In addition, Hannah McDonald, LLB has joined Westhaven’s board as an independent Director.\nGrenville Thomas, Director of Westhaven stated, “Gareth, the founder of Westhaven, has been instrumental in building the Company and its dominant land package on the Spences Bridge Gold Belt. His continued commitment to proving the gold potential of this newly discovered gold belt is imperative to the long-term success of the Company.” Thomas adds, “We are very pleased to welcome Ms. McDonald to our Board. Her experience will add greatly to Westhaven’s management depth.”\nMs. McDonald has spent the majority of her career advising on land, resource issues and governance. Hannah graduated from the University of British Columbia Law School and holds an undergraduate degree in Communications from Simon Fraser University.\nThe Spences Bridge Gold Belt (SBGB)\nWesthaven owns a 100% interest in over 35,000 hectares within the prospective SBGB, which is situated within a geological setting similar to those which host other significant epithermal systems. It is close to existing transportation and infrastructure allowing for cost-effective exploration. The SBGB is a 110 kilometre northwest-trending belt of intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks dominated by the Cretaceous Spences Bridge group. Westhaven has been working on the SBGB since 2011 and believes these relatively underexplored volcanic rocks are highly prospective for epithermal style gold mineralization.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors\nWESTHAVEN VENTURES INC.\n\"Shaun Pollard\"\nShaun Pollard, CFO & Director\nAbout Westhaven Ventures Inc.\nWesthaven Ventures Inc. is a Canadian based exploration company focused on the acquisition and exploration of prospective resource properties.
