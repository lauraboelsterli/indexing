    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crescent Point Energy Corp. (\"Crescent Point\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:CPG) (NYSE:CPG) is pleased to announce its operating and financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nExceeded first quarter average production budget and currently ahead of expectations for second quarter 2018. Reduced 2018 capital expenditures by $25 million and targeting a total payout ratio of less than 100 percent. Finalizing agreement to dispose of approximately $225 million of assets with proceeds directed toward debt reduction. Expect 2018 exit net debt to funds flow from operations of less than 1.9 times, excluding proceeds from the disposition. Increased production and cash flow growth from U.S. assets and achieved strong initial East Shale Duvernay results. Nominated Mr. François Langlois to its Board of Directors, an independent director with over 35 years of direct oil and gas experience, most recently as Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production at Suncor Energy Inc.\n\"We had an excellent start to the year financially and operationally,” said Scott Saxberg, president and CEO of Crescent Point. “Our first half 2018 program, which is typically weighted to first quarter due to spring break-up, is under budget and has allowed for a $25 million reduction in annual expenditures. Our production results are also ahead of target and remain on track to meet or exceed guidance of seven percent exit growth. We expect to fund 2018 capital expenditures and dividends within funds flow, highlighting our financial discipline. We also plan to direct proceeds from the expected $225 million disposition to debt reduction.”\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFunds flow from operations totaled $428.9 million, or $0.78 per share diluted, based on an operating netback of $34.49 per boe or funds flow from operations of $26.71 per boe. First quarter 2018 netbacks were partially impacted by wider than normal oil differentials, which are expected to continue improving throughout the remainder of the year. The Company's payout ratio in the quarter, based on cash dividends paid of $0.09 per share, was 12 percent. Crescent Point spent $652.8 million on drilling and development activities during first quarter, drilling 314 (260.6 net) wells. Land, seismic and facilities capital expenditures totaled $80.2 million, primarily comprised of $62.8 million for new facilities in the Company's core areas. Crescent Point's revised 2018 capital expenditures guidance of $1.775 billion is $25 million less than its prior budget and expected to generate a total payout ratio of less than 100 percent, including dividends, based on current strip prices. Subsequent to the quarter, the Company closed a private placement of long-term debt in the form of senior guaranteed notes as part of its normal course issuance to add to its overall liquidity. The notes are unsecured and rank equally with Crescent Point’s obligations under its bank facilities. In total, US$143.5 million and CDN$80.0 million was raised through three separate series of notes at fixed Canadian dollar coupon rates ranging from 3.58 percent to 3.98 percent with maturities of five to seven years. Cross currency swaps were also entered into in order to remove foreign exchange risk for purposes of future principal and interest payments. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the Company's outstanding bank debt and other senior guaranteed note near-term maturities. Crescent Point retains a significant amount of liquidity with no material near-term debt maturities. As at March 31, 2018, cash and unutilized credit capacity was approximately $1.4 billion, including the subsequent closing of the private placement. At current strip prices, the Company expects to exit 2018 with net debt to funds flow from operations of less than 1.9 times, excluding proceeds from the disposition, which is expected to close near the end of second quarter. As part of its risk management program to protect cash flow and strength of its balance sheet, Crescent Point remained active on its hedging program during first quarter 2018. As at April 27, 2018, the Company had over 50 percent of its oil and liquids production, net of royalty interest, hedged for the remainder of 2018 at a weighted average market value price of approximately CDN$74.00/bbl. For the first three quarters of 2019, over 35 percent of its oil and liquids production is hedged at a weighted average market value price of approximately CDN$77.00/bbl. Crescent Point also has significant natural gas production hedged extending through 2019 at a weighted average price of CDN$2.73/GJ. Building on its robust ongoing board renewal process, the Company recently nominated Mr. François Langlois, a new independent member to its Board of Directors. This marks the seventh independent addition since 2014. To incorporate feedback and further align compensation with returns and capital allocation, the Board of Directors elected to add a drilling rate of return metric to Crescent Point's pay-for-performance plan.\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe Company achieved first quarter 2018 average production of 178,418 boe/d, comprised of approximately 90 percent oil and liquids. Crescent Point completed an active first quarter drilling program, which is expected to result in strong second quarter average production of over 182,000 boe/d, despite the seasonal impact of spring break-up. The Company significantly grew its U.S. operations, increasing production by approximately 60 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by high-impact wells from its Uinta Basin and North Dakota resource plays. As previously announced on April 3, 2018, Crescent Point completed a highly successful multi-zone stacked horizontal development program in the Uinta Basin during first quarter. Following these strong results, the Company completed a second stacked horizontal development program, which has been flowing for less than 30 days with positive initial results. Both programs targeted the horizontal development of the Castle Peak, Uteland Butte and Wasatch zones within the same drilling spacing unit. Crescent Point participated in two gross (one net) non-operated horizontal wells with a lateral length of one-and-a-half-miles in the East Shale Duvernay, as previously announced on April 3, 2018. The first well flowed at an impressive initial 30-day and 90-day rate of approximately 570 boe/d and 515 boe/d respectively, comprised of approximately 92 percent oil and liquids. The initial 30-day rate on the recently completed second well is similar to the first well, at approximately 535 boe/d. Production from these wells follows strong industry results in this early-stage resource play. The Company's capital expenditures budget currently includes four net operated East Shale Duvernay wells in the first half of 2018. In the Williston Basin and southwest Saskatchewan, Crescent Point's focus remained on low-risk, high-return infill development, step-out drilling to extend economic boundaries and its waterflood programs. Within the Flat Lake resource play in the Williston Basin, the Company also executed multi-well pad drilling for improved efficiencies and built new infrastructure to accommodate future growth. During first quarter 2018, Crescent Point's climate change and technology initiatives included advancing remote monitoring and field automation in the Uinta Basin, which are expected to reduce downtime, optimize wellbores and increase staff efficiency. The Company also installed its third solar power project and continued the use of cleaner fuel sources throughout its operations.\nOUTLOOK\nCrescent Point executed strong first quarter results and is currently ahead of expectations with second quarter average production expected to be over 182,000 boe/d. The Company remains on track to deliver seven percent exit production growth in 2018 and a monthly dividend to shareholders within funds flow from operations. This guidance follows the execution of an organic growth plan in 2017 that generated exit production growth of 10 percent per share.\n\"Throughout 2017, we increased the value of our company by identifying new high-impact drilling locations and increasing our strategic land position in the Uinta Basin, Flat Lake and emerging East Shale Duvernay resource plays for future organic growth,\" said Saxberg. \"These new locations increased our total corporate productive capacity, which further enhanced our five-year plan. We now require approximately 1,000 fewer net wells to be drilled in order to achieve a similar production profile while incurring lower total cumulative capital expenditures. We are following up on our successes in each of our core resource plays in 2018, including the East Shale Duvernay, which is not reflected in our current forecast.\"\nCrescent Point's recent expansion in the East Shale Duvernay resource play is aligned with its strategy of focusing on large oil-in-place pools with significant development upside. This light oil resource play, which the Company entered into at a low cost of approximately $315 per acre, is expected to provide scaleable economic growth with high-impact production and strong returns. This organic expansion is expected to be funded through the disposition of non-core assets.\n\"Subsequent to the quarter, we signed a non-binding letter of intent to dispose of approximately 3,200 boe/d of non-core assets for proceeds of approximately $225 million,\" said Saxberg. \"We remain disciplined financially and will allocate proceeds from this disposition toward debt reduction. Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected near the end of second quarter, we will provide an updated annual guidance.\"\nCrescent Point's expected non-core asset disposition of $225 million, annual capital expenditures reduction of $25 million and high-return capital allocation strategy, highlights its focus on maintaining a strong financial position. Proceeds from future non-core asset dispositions and excess funds flow from operations realized at higher commodity prices are expected to further enhance the Company's financial flexibility.\nCrescent Point has made, and continues to make, strategic decisions that are focused on creating long-term shareholder value. The Board of Directors and management remain committed to listening and engaging with all shareholders, as highlighted by its ongoing board renewal process and changes to its pay-for-performance compensation plan. The Company is focused on the execution of its five-year plan, with a priority on financial discipline, organic growth in its high-productivity resource plays and continued improvements in efficiencies.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\nCrescent Point's capital allocation strategy in 2018 continues to focus on returns and the long-term development of its core resource plays. Over 75 percent of net wells drilled in 2018 at US$55.00/bbl WTI, or approximately 90 percent at current strip prices, are expected to pay out in two years or less. Approximately 95 percent of the Company's 2018 capital expenditures budget is focused on three core areas in the Williston Basin, southwest Saskatchewan and Uinta Basin.\nSummary of Drilling Results\nThe following table summarizes Crescent Point’s drilling results for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 Gas Oil D&A Service Standing Total Net % Success Williston Basin (1) - 174 - 4 - 178 151.7 100 Southwest Saskatchewan - 109 - - - 109 89.3 100 Uinta Basin (1) - 19 - - - 19 11.6 100 Other - 8 - - - 8 8.0 100 Total - 310 - 4 - 314 260.6 100 (1) The net well count is subject to final working interest determination\nDuring first quarter 2018, over 70 percent of the Company's total capital expenditures program was allocated to the Williston Basin and southwest Saskatchewan and focused on low-risk, high-return infill development, step-out drilling and advancement of its waterflood programs. These assets are expected to continue to generate funds flow in excess of capital expenditures in 2018.\nIn the multi-zone Flat Lake resource play within the Williston Basin, Crescent Point had an active first quarter and drilled 81.7 net wells, up from 52.0 net wells in the prior year. The Company completed a step-out drilling program to further expand the economic boundaries of the Torquay zone and utilized multi-well pad drilling to increase efficiencies in the Ratcliffe zone. This resulted in an increase in year-over-year production of approximately 30 percent from these two zones. Crescent Point also added new infrastructure to accommodate future growth in the Flat Lake resource play.\nDuring first quarter 2018, approximately 20 percent of Crescent Point's total capital expenditures program was allocated to the Uinta Basin. As previously released on April 3, 2018, the Company completed its first stacked horizontal development within the same drilling spacing unit, targeting the Castle Peak, Wasatch and Uteland Butte zones with strong initial production rates. Following on this success, Crescent Point completed a second stacked horizontal development program, which has been flowing for less than 30 days with positive initial results. During the remainder of 2018 and in 2019, the Company plans to advance two-mile multi-well pad development, which is expected to drive unit capital cost reductions of over 10 percent in 2019.\nCrescent Point's first quarter 2018 waterflood program included the addition of over 50 injection wells. This included further implementation of injection control device (ICD) waterflood systems, which have demonstrated positive production results and increased water injectivity. Subsequent to first quarter, the Government of Saskatchewan granted technical approval for the Melrose unit, the third of the original four waterflood units within the Viewfield Bakken resource play. The Company has identified additional opportunities in the play for future waterflood expansion beyond these initial four units.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nCrescent Point management will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. MT (12:00 p.m. ET), to discuss the results and outlook for the Company.\nParticipants can access the conference call by dialing 844-231-0101 or 216-562-0389 and entering the code 7279066.

These terms do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures presented by other issuers.\nFunds flow from operations is calculated based on cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital, transaction costs and decommissioning expenditures. Funds flow from operations per share - diluted is calculated as funds flow from operations divided by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Transaction costs are excluded as they vary based on the Company's acquisition activity, and to ensure that this metric is more comparable between periods. Decommissioning expenditures are excluded as the Company has a voluntary reclamation fund to fund decommissioning costs. Management utilizes funds flow from operations as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to finance dividends, operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments. Funds flow from operations as presented is not intended to represent cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nThe following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to funds flow from operations:\nThree months ended March 31 ($ millions) 2018 2017 Cash flow from operating activities 462.0 416.2 Changes in non-cash working capital (44.1 ) 1.6 Transaction costs 0.7 0.5 Decommissioning expenditures 10.3 8.8 Funds flow from operations 428.9 427.1 Adjusted net earnings from operations is calculated based on net income before amortization of exploration and evaluation (\"E&E\") undeveloped land, impairment or impairment recoveries on property, plant and equipment (\"PP&E\"), unrealized derivative gains or losses, unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss on translation of hedged US dollar long-term debt, unrealized gains or losses on long-term investments and gains or losses on capital acquisitions and dispositions. Adjusted net earnings from operations per share - diluted is calculated as adjusted net earnings from operations divided by the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Management utilizes adjusted net earnings from operations to present a measure of financial performance that is more comparable between periods. Adjusted net earnings from operations as presented is not intended to represent net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nThe following table reconciles net income to adjusted net earnings from operations:\nThree months ended March 31 ($ millions) 2018 2017 Net income (loss) (90.7 ) 119.4 Amortization of E&E undeveloped land 38.8 31.0 Unrealized derivative (gains) losses 35.0 (89.1 ) Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss on translation of hedged US dollar long-term debt 124.0 (22.9 ) Unrealized loss on long-term investments 11.8 3.2 Gain on capital dispositions (0.9 ) - Deferred tax relating to adjustments (54.6 ) 20.3 Adjusted net earnings from operations 63.4 61.9 Net debt is calculated as long-term debt plus accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable and long-term compensation liability, less cash, accounts receivable, prepaids and deposits and long-term investments, excluding the unrealized foreign exchange on translation of US dollar long-term debt. Management utilizes net debt as a key measure to assess the liquidity of the Company.\nThe following table reconciles long-term debt to net debt:\n($ millions) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Long-term debt (1) 4,412.9 4,183.4 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 773.2 642.1 Dividends payable 16.9 16.5 Long-term compensation liability (2) 29.4 3.0 Cash (14.7 ) (85.8 ) Accounts receivable (382.5 ) (330.3 ) Prepaids and deposits (10.0 ) (10.9 ) Long-term investments (72.5 ) (32.6 ) Excludes: Unrealized foreign exchange on translation of hedged US dollar long-term debt (343.4 ) (397.7 ) Net debt 4,409.3 3,987.7 (1) Includes current portion of long-term debt.\n(2) Includes current portion of long-term compensation liability.\nNet debt to funds flow from operations is calculated as the period end net debt divided by the sum of funds flow from operations for the trailing four quarters. The ratio of net debt to funds flow from operations is used by management to measure the Company’s overall debt position and to measure the strength of the Company’s balance sheet. Crescent Point monitors this ratio and uses this as a key measure in making decisions regarding financing, capital spending and dividend levels.\nNetback is calculated on a per boe basis as oil and gas sales, less royalties, operating and transportation expenses and realized derivative gains and losses. Netback is a common metric used in the oil and gas industry and is used by management to measure operating results on a per boe basis to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis. The calculation of netback is shown in the Financial and Operating Highlights section in this press release.\nPayout ratio is calculated on a percentage basis as dividends declared divided by funds flow from operations. Payout ratio is used by management to monitor the dividend policy and the amount of funds flow from operations retained by the Company for capital reinvestment.\nTotal payout ratio is calculated on a percentage basis as development capital expenditures and dividends declared divided by funds flow from operations. Total payout ratio is used by management to monitor the Company's capital reinvestment and dividend policy, as a percentage of the amount of funds flow from operations.\nManagement believes the presentation of the Non-GAAP measures above provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis.\nAll financial figures are approximate and in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. This press release contains forward-looking information and references to non-GAAP financial measures. Significant related assumptions and risk factors, and reconciliations are described under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Forward-Looking Statements sections of this press release release, respectively.\nForward-Looking Statements and Other Matters\nAny \"financial outlook\" or \"future oriented financial information\" in this press release, as defined by applicable securities legislation has been approved by management of Crescent Point.
