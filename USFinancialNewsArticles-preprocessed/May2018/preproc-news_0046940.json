May 21, 2018; Montreal, Quebec, CAN; Los Angeles Galaxy forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic (9) gets a red card from referee Ismail Elfath during the first half of the game against the Montreal Impact at Stade Saputo. Mandatory Credit: Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports\nImpact defender Michael Petrasso stepped on the 36-year-old’s foot in the 40th minute of the match in Montreal and the towering Swede retaliated with a slap to the back of Petrasso’s head.\nBoth players fell to the ground in an apparent effort to win the sympathy of referee Ismail Elfath but after a review of the video, Petrasso was shown a yellow card and the former Juventus, Barcelona and Manchester United striker a red.\nDespite the Impact controlling the ball for 56 percent of the game and taking 15 more shots, Galaxy’s 10 men prevailed when Ola Kamara scored the only goal of the game in the 75th minute. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThe win ends a four-game skid for the Galaxy who are now 4-6-1 while the loss is the third straight for the 3-9-0 Impact, who will need to find some goals in the remaining 24 games of the season if they hope to make the playoffs.\nIbrahimovic made a Hollywood entrance during his first game for the Galaxy in March when he scored twice, including the winner, in a thrilling 4-3 victory over local rivals LAFC but has added only one more goal since.\nSweden’s record goalscorer, Ibrahimovic retired from international football after Euro 2016 and, despite flirting with a comeback, will miss this year’s World Cup in Russia.
