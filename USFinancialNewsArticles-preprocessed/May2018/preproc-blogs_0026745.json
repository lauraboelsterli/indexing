How long must he wait to first get a whole number of eggs at the close of a day? How many eggs does his farm produce in that time?\n(c) Jones has 300 hens. How many days must he wait to first get a whole number of eggs at the close of a day? How many eggs does his farm produce in that time?\nCornfield Planning\nA farmer has a square plot of land that measures 100 feet on each side. She plans to grow corn in the plot, and she will install a fence around the corn. Fencing is expensive, so she wants to grow the corn in a shape that will maximize the ratio of the area of the cornfield to its perimeter.\nWhat shape should the cornfield be?",
