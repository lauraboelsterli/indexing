    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSC Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LKSD) today reported financial results of 2018.\n1Q 2018 Highlights:\nNet sales of $929 million compared to $821 million of 2017, an increase of $108 million, or 13.2% Organic net sales decrease of 1.7% compared to the first quarter of 2017, an improvement in organic net sales trends GAAP net loss of $11 million, or $0.32 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share of 2017 Non-GAAP net loss of $4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share of 2017 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $53 million, or 5.7% of net sales, compared to $65 million, or 7.9% of net sales, of 2017 Company reaffirms full-year guidance\n“We are pleased with the overall revenue trends in the quarter and, as we expected given the sales mix, the first quarter’s margin comparisons were difficult. We anticipate margin improvements as we move through 2018, driven by improved sales mix, integration synergies and cost actions taken earlier this year,” said Thomas J. Quinlan III, LSC Communications’ Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. “In 2018, we have continued to execute on our strategic initiatives and are excited to add the Print Logistics component of RRD’s Logistics business to further strengthen our logistics infrastructure to drive growth in warehousing and distribution services. Additionally, we announced the sale of LSC’s retail offset printing facilities as we continue to focus on our adjacencies growth strategy.”\nNet Sales\nFirst quarter net sales were $929 million, up $108 million, or 13.2%, from the first quarter of 2017. After adjusting for acquisitions, changes in foreign exchange rates, pass-through paper sales, and the adoption of new revenue recognition standards, organic net sales decreased 1.7% from the first quarter of 2017 which represents an improvement in the Company’s organic net sales trend. This improvement was driven by sales performance in the Print segment, especially within the book reporting unit, that was more than offset by the impact of customer inventory reductions in the Office Products segment.\nGAAP Net Income\nFirst quarter 2018 net loss was $11 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of 2017. The first quarter 2018 net loss included after-tax charges of $7 million and first quarter 2017 net income included after-tax charges of $5 million, both of which are excluded from the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Additional details regarding the amount and nature of these adjustments and other items are included in the attached schedules.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of 2018 was $53 million, or 5.7% of net sales, compared to $65 million, or 7.9% of net sales, of 2017. The decrease in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to sales mix, pricing pressure and the impact of lower margins related to recent acquisitions partially offset by on-going productivity and cost control initiatives.\nNon-GAAP net loss totaled $4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of 2018 compared to non-GAAP net income of $4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share of 2017. Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are presented in the attached schedules.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms the following full-year guidance for 2018, which includes the estimated impact of its announced transactions assuming a closing date in the second quarter for the sale of LSC’s retail offset printing facilities and in the third quarter for the Print Logistics component of RRD’s Logistics business (1) :\nGuidance\nNet sales $3.8 to $3.9 billion Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (2) $320 to $360 million Depreciation and amortization $135 to $145 million Interest expense $72 to $76 million Non-GAAP effective tax rate 25% to 29% Capital expenditures $65 to $75 million Free cash flow (3) $120 to $160 million Diluted share count (4) Approximately 35 million (1)\nThe completion of each transaction is subject to customary closing conditions (2)\nConsistent with historical guidance and presentation, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes net pension income. Beginning in 2018, Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07 requires companies to disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit cost from other components of net benefit cost and present the service cost component with other employee compensation costs. All other components of net benefit cost will need to be presented outside of income from operations. As a result, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $49 million, $46 million and $45 million of net pension income for years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, out of income from operations to a line item outside of income from operations, resulting in no impact to net income or non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. (3)\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (4)\nThis guidance assumes no shares are repurchased under the Board of Director’s authorization to repurchase up to $20 million of the Company’s shares of common stock. Certain components of the guidance given in the table above are provided on a non-GAAP basis only, without providing a reconciliation to guidance provided on a GAAP basis. Information is presented in this manner, consistent with SEC rules, because the preparation of such a reconciliation could not be accomplished without \"unreasonable efforts.\" The Company does not have access to certain information that would be necessary to provide such a reconciliation, including non-recurring items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses on investments and business disposals, losses on debt extinguishment and other similar gains or losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company does not believe that excluding such items is likely to be significant to an assessment of the Company's ongoing operations, given that such excluded items are not indicators of business performance.\nConference Call\nLSC Communications will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its first-quarter results today, Thursday, May 3, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/loss and free cash flow, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information about the Company’s operating results and liquidity and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/loss and free cash flow allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/loss and free cash flow, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company’s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales, the Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP net income/loss can provide useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. By adjusting for the level of capital investment in operations, the Company believes that free cash flow can provide useful additional basis for understanding the Company’s ability to generate cash after capital investment and provides a comparison to peers with differing capital intensity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain \" \" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
