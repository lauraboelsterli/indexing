    "text": "The most important delivery breakthrough since Amazon Prime Sara Salinas Reblog Drone start-up Zipline International conducts 50 drone flights a day, delivering packages accurately and without damage, and is on its way to 500 flights daily. Zipline recently launched the world's fastest commercial drone.
