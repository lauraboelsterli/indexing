    "text": "GRAINS-Corn hits 6-day high as rains delay sowing Published 9 Hours Ago Reuters\nSYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures edged higher on Wednesday as forecasts for rains stoked concerns of planting delays, pushing prices to a six-day high.\nFUNDAMENTALS\n* The most active corn futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.1 percent to $4.02-3/4 a bushel by 0140 GMT, near the session high of $4.03-1/4 a bushel - the highest since May 10. Corn gained 1.5 percent in the previous session.\n* The most active soybean futures were down 0.4 percent to $10.14-1/4 a bushel, having firmed 0.1 percent on Tuesday.\n* The most active wheat futures were up 0.2 percent to $4.92-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.5 percent on Wednesday.\n* The U.S. Agriculture Department on Monday afternoon said the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated 36 percent good to excellent as of May 14, up 2 percentage points from a week earlier.\n* USDA pegged corn planting progress at 62 percent, up from 39 percent a week earlier. The five-year average for mid-May is 63 percent.\n* Forecasts call for rains across the U.S. Midwest, threatening sowing pace.\n* The U.S. soybean crush in April jumped by almost 16 percent from the same month a year ago as soybean plants processed their largest-ever volume of beans for the month of April, the National Oilseed Processors Association said.\nMARKET NEWS\n* The dollar hovered near a five-month high against a group of major currencies on Wednesday, as a surge in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield above 3 percent reignited a rally that had lost steam last week.\n* Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down by ample supplies despite ongoing output cuts by producer cartel OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran.\n* A surge in U.S. government bond yields to their highest level in almost seven years sent Wall Street shares sliding on Tuesday after strong retail sales data stoked inflation concerns and investors fretted about looming trade talks between the United States and China.\nDATA AHEAD (GMT)\n0130 China House prices Apr 1230 U.S. Housing starts Apr 1230 U.S. Building permits Apr 1315 U.S. Industrial production Apr\nGrains prices at 0140 GMT\nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 494.25 0.75 +0.15% +0.61% 498.98 45 CBOT corn 402.75 0.50 +0.12% +1.58% 397.85 67 CBOT soy 1014.25 -4.50 -0.44% -0.34% 1040.58 47 CBOT rice 12.51 $0.03 +0.20% +0.04% $12.98 50 WTI crude 70.98 -$0.33 -0.46% +0.03% $68.08 64\nCurrencies\nEuro/dlr $1.183 -$0.001 -0.10% -0.84% USD/AUD 0.7457 -0.001 -0.19% -0.90%\nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
