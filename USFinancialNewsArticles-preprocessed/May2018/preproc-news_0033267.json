    "text": "Hire points to increased growth and investment by the Company\nVANCOUVER, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - North American diamond retailer Spence Diamonds names Frank Hamlin as first-ever chief marketing officer. Founded in Vancouver 40 years ago with expansion to the U.S in 2016, Spence has radically reinvented the retail diamond shopping experience by elevating choice, transparency, education and customization. This defining move reflects a current focus on growth and increased investment in strategic marketing by the Company.\nAn unconventional choice for a diamond retailer, Frank brings a fresh perspective from more than 20 years of experience developing strategic business plans and executing hard-hitting marketing strategies and retail operations across leading retail brands. He joins Spence from Tailored Brands Inc (TBI), where he was EVP and CMO, overseeing the entire brand and integrated marketing function for the 1500-store retail chain across the U.S and Canada.\n\"Frank brings with him a proven track record for driving traffic, increasing brand engagement and enhancing customer loyalty,\" said Eric Lindberg, executive chairman, Spence Diamonds. \"His experience and leadership are what Spence needs as we continue to invest in growth, expanding locations across the U.S and Canada.\"\nPrior to TBI, Frank was CMO at GameStop Corp, and was executive vice president and general manager of marketing and e-commerce for Guitar Center, Inc.\n\"I've always approached retail marketing from the perspective of the customer,\" said Frank. \"For me, the appeal of Spence is that it provides a non-traditional diamond-buying experience in an inviting and un-intimidating environment that puts the customer firmly in control, whether they want ethically-sourced mined diamonds or stunning Artisan Created Diamonds. I can't wait to dig in on the brand to truly do diamonds differently.\"\nThis announcement follows significant investment in the development of a new brand marketing strategy, in partnership with Edelman across its New York and Toronto offices.\nAbout Spence Diamonds\nFounded in Vancouver B.C., Spence Diamonds has been in the diamond business for 40 years, giving hundreds of thousands of couples the confidence to find the diamond ring that represents their unique partnership. Featuring stores with more than 2,500 engagement ring designs in open display cases for customers to easily try on, the Spence model is built on transparency, choice and customization. Spence's Gemological Institute of America (GIA)-trained Diamond Consultants offer an unbiased, immersive education about cut, color, clarity, size, setting, and style.
