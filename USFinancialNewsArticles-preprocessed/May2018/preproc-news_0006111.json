(TSX: MFI) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nSales volume growth across the business, except in fresh pork with temporary supply interruption Adjusted EBITDA margins(1) of 10.1% Strong commercial and operating performance across the business, offset by less favorable market conditions Excellent momentum in our U.S platform and in plant protein Preparing for launch in core brand renovations in the second quarter\nFinancial Highlights\nMeasure (a)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nSales (b)\n$\n817.5\n$\n811.2\n0.8%\nNet Earnings\n$\n27.9\n$\n30.1\n(7.3)%\nBasic Earnings per Share\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.23\n(4.3)%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.1%\n10.8%\n-70 bps\nAdjusted Operating Earnings (2)\n$\n52.8\n$\n59.0\n(10.6)%\nAdjusted Earnings per Share (3)\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.33\n(12.1)%\nFree Cash Flow (4)\n$\n(3.3)\n$\n34.8\n(109.5)%\n(a)\nAll financial measures in millions except Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Basic and Adjusted Earnings per Share.\n(b)\n2018 sales include the impact of the adoption of new accounting standard IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Refer to note 2(b) of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for further details on the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards.\nNote: Several items are excluded from the discussions of underlying earnings performance as they are not representative of ongoing operational activities. Refer to the section entitled Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures at the end of this news release for a description and reconciliation of all non-IFRS financial measures.\n\"As anticipated, it was a more challenging start to the year in 2018 although we were pleased to have delivered EBITDA margins of 10.1% in these conditions, which reflects our balanced portfolio, brand strength and value-added product mix,\" said Michael H. McCain, President and CEO. \"We realized excellent commercial and operating gains in the prepared meat portfolio, offset by the much-anticipated headwinds of market conditions. We are now launching the most extensive food and brand renovation in our history, which will be one of our strategic growth foundations for years to come.\"\nOPERATING REVIEW\nThe following table summarizes the Company's total sales and Adjusted Operating Earnings for the quarter.\n($ thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nTotal Sales\n$\n817,509\n$\n811,185\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\n$\n52,772\n$\n59,030\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.1%\n10.8%\nSales and Earnings Review\nSales in the first quarter increased 0.8% to $817.5 million, or 2.4% after adjusting for the adoption of a new accounting standard, foreign exchange, and acquisitions. Sales were driven by prepared meats, which benefited from innovation and the Company's expansion in the U.S. market as well as pricing taken in fall of 2017. The Lightlife and Field Roast brands contributed to sales increases in the quarter. Sales in value-added fresh pork were impacted by lower market values and a transitory reduction in hog supply from PEDv in 2017.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings were $52.8 million compared to $59.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Positive trends and commercial performance in the underlying business were offset by market conditions in pork markets which were materially below prior year. First quarter earnings benefited from improvement in prepared meats related to volume growth, strong margins and increased supply chain efficiency. Performance in value-added poultry and pork and plant protein also contributed to our earnings.\nNet earnings for the first quarter were $27.9 million ($0.22 per basic share) compared to $30.1 million ($0.23 per basic share) in the first quarter of 2017.The decrease in net earnings was consistent with factors noted above and partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\nOther Matters\nOn May 2, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.13 per share payable June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 8, 2018. Unless indicated otherwise by the Company at or before the time the dividend is paid, this dividend will be considered an eligible dividend for the purposes of the \"Enhanced Dividend Tax Credit System\".\nConference Call\nAn investor presentation related to the Company's first quarter financial results is available at www.mapleleaffoods.com and can be found under Investor Information on the Investors page. A conference call will be held at 2:30 p.m. EDT on May 2, 2018, to review Maple Leaf Foods' first quarter financial results. To participate in the call, please dial 416-340-2216 or 1-800-273-9672.

Management believes that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors in measuring the financial performance of the Company for the reasons outlined below. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\nAdjusted Operating Earnings, a non-IFRS measure, is used by Management to evaluate financial operating results. It is defined as earnings before income taxes adjusted for items that are not considered representative of ongoing operational activities of the business and items where the economic impact of the transactions will be reflected in earnings in future periods when the underlying asset is sold or transferred. The table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings as reported under IFRS in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of net earnings to Adjusted Operating Earnings for the three months ended, as indicated below. Management believes that this basis is the most appropriate on which to evaluate operating results, as they are representative of the ongoing operations of the Company.\n($ thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet earnings\n$\n27,918\n$\n30,105\nIncome taxes\n11,507\n11,980\nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n39,425\n$\n42,085\nInterest expense and other financing costs\n1,653\n1,227\nOther (income) expense\n2,854\n2,704\nRestructuring and other related costs\n2,055\n6,490\nEarnings from operations\n$\n45,987\n$\n52,506\nDecrease (increase) in fair value of biological assets (5)\n7,097\n(2,797)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivative contracts (5)\n(312)\n9,321\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\n$\n52,772\n$\n59,030\nAdjusted Earnings per Share\nAdjusted Earnings per Share, a non-IFRS measure, is used by Management to evaluate financial operating results. It is defined as basic earnings per share and is adjusted on the same basis as Adjusted Operating Earnings. The table below provides a reconciliation of basic earnings per share as reported under IFRS in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of earnings to Adjusted Earnings per Share for the three months ended, as indicated below. Management believes this basis is the most appropriate on which to evaluate financial results as they are representative of the ongoing operations of the Company.\n($ per share)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.23\nRestructuring and other related costs (6)\n0.01\n0.04\nItems included in other income not considered representative of ongoing operations (7)\n0.02\n0.02\nChange in the fair value of biological assets (8)\n0.04\n(0.02)\nChange in the fair value of unrealized (gain) loss on derivative contracts (8)\n—\n0.05\nAdjusted Earnings per Share (9)\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.33\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest and income taxes plus depreciation and intangible asset amortization, adjusted for items that are not considered representative of ongoing operational activities of the business, and items where the economic impact of the transactions will be reflected in earnings in future periods when the underlying asset is sold or transferred. The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings as reported under IFRS in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of earnings to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended, as indicated below. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing the performance of the Company's ongoing operations and its ability to generate cash flows to fund its cash requirements, including the Company's capital investment program.\n($ thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet earnings\n$\n27,918\n$\n30,105\nIncome taxes\n11,507\n11,980\nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n39,425\n$\n42,085\nInterest expense and other financing costs\n1,653\n1,227\nItems included in other income not representative of ongoing operations\n2,690\n3,479\nRestructuring and other related costs\n2,055\n6,490\nChange in the fair value of biological assets and unrealized (gains) losses on derivative contracts\n6,785\n6,524\nDepreciation and amortization\n29,874\n28,062\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n82,482\n$\n87,867\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n10.1%\n10.8%\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow, a non-IFRS measure, is used by Management to evaluate cash flow after investing in the maintenance or expansion of the Company's asset base. It is defined as cash provided by (used in) operations, less additions to long-term assets. The following table calculates Free Cash Flow for the periods indicated below.\n($ thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n32,055\n$\n55,008\nAdditions to long-term assets\n(35,360)\n(20,255)\nFree Cash (Out) In Flow\n$\n(3,305)\n$\n34,753\nNet Cash (10)\nThe following table reconciles Net Cash to amounts reported under IFRS in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended, as indicated below.
