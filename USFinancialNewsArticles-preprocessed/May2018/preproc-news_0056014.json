    "text": "TORONTO and SPOKANE, WA, May 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Hydro One Limited (\"Hydro One\") (TSX: H) and Avista Corporation (\"Avista\") (NYSE: AVA) today announced the achievement of an important milestone in the regulatory approval process of their proposed merger. The companies have filed an all-parties, all-issues settlement agreement in the merger proceeding before the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (\"OPUC\"). This represents a full settlement which all parties have agreed is consistent with the public interest and will provide net benefits to Avista's Oregon customers. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the OPUC.\n\"This is yet another key milestone as we navigate the path toward completing this transaction,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. \"Once complete, this merger of two leading institutions will generate tremendous value for our organization, as well as our shareholders, employees and customers. We are very pleased by the progress we have been able to achieve in cooperation with all parties involved.\"\n\"This settlement agreement is a positive next step in the process to finalize our partnership with Hydro One, for the benefit of our customers in Oregon and all of our stakeholders,\" Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. \"With the broad support of all of the parties in Oregon, we believe the settlement agreement meets the standard for approval in Oregon and affirms the commitments we've made to continue to operate as we do today, with local decision-making and increased community support.\"\nThe settlement agreement in Oregon includes financial and non-financial commitments, and confirms Avista's commitment to its customers and the communities it serves. Under the settlement agreement, customers in Oregon would receive immediate financial benefits in the form of rate credits that would become effective at the close of the transaction, along with additional safeguards to assure the continued financial well-being of Avista.\nAs a result of this settlement agreement in Oregon, settlement agreements in Washington, Idaho and Alaska and commitments in Montana, the total financial commitment across all states, if approved, would be approximately $78.6 million. No costs associated with the transaction will be recovered from Avista or Hydro One customers.\nPlease refer to www.puc.state.or.us for the joint application and settlement agreement (which includes the complete list of commitments).\nIn addition to Hydro One and Avista, the parties to the merger proceeding in Oregon include the OPUC staff, Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, Alliance of Western Energy Consumers and the Oregon and Southern Oregon District Council of Laborers.\nApplications for regulatory approval of the transaction are still pending with utility commissions in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Montana. An all-parties, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission on March 27, 2018. An all-parties, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska on April 3, 2018. An all-parties, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission on April 13, 2018. A settlement agreement with the City of Colstrip was filed with the Montana Public Service Commission on May 15, 2018.\nHydro One and Avista received the Federal Communications Commission's consent on May 4, 2018 to close their merger and antitrust clearance on April 5, 2018 after the expiration of the waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The transaction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on January 16, 2018 and from Avista shareholders on November 21, 2017. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States completed its review of the proposed merger on May 18, 2018, and has concluded that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transaction. Also required is the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Hydro One and Avista continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nAbout Hydro One Limited\nWe are Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider with more than 1.3 million valued customers, over C$25 billion in assets and 2017 annual revenues of nearly C$6 billion.
