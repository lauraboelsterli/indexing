    "text": "BRUSSELS, May 14 (Reuters) - British companies cannot be directly involved in a new EU satellite navigation system after Brexit but Britain will have access to its signal, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Monday.\n“Third countries and their companies cannot participate in the development of security-sensitive matters,” Michel Barnier told an event in Brussels, referring to the Galileo programme.\n“These rules will not prevent the UK as a third country from using the encrypted signal of Galileo providing that the relevant agreements between the EU and the UK are in place.” (Reporting by Robin Emmott; editing by Andrew Roche)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
