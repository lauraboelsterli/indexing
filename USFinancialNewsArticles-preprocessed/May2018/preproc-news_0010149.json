    "text": "WATSEKA, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IF Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: IROQ) (the “Company”) the holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”), announced unaudited net income of $994,000, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $844,000, or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income was $4.3 million compared to $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The provision for loan losses decreased to $110,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $192,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest and dividend income increased to $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense increased to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $898,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest income increased to $937,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $839,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest expense increased to $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Provision for income tax decreased to $280,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $479,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a reduction in the federal income tax rate as per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017.\nThe Company announced unaudited net income of $1.2 million, or $0.34 per basic share and $0.33 per diluted share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.90 per basic share and $0.89 per diluted share for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, was impacted by an additional $1.3 million income tax expense due to a downward adjustment to our net deferred tax assets (“DTA”) related to the Tax Act. The Tax Act provided for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in the downward adjustment to our DTA. Excluding the $1.3 million impact of the adjustment to the DTA, the Company’s net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, would have been $2.6 million, or a decrease of $758,000 from the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Management believes that presenting net income on a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of the adjustment to the DTA in the 2018 period provides useful information for evaluating the Company’s operating results and any related trends that may be affecting the Company’s business. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income was $13.2 million compared to $13.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The provision for loan losses increased to $468,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, from $225,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Interest and dividend income increased to $16.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, from $16.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense increased to $3.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $2.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest income increased to $3.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, from $3.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest expense increased to $12.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $10.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Provision for income tax increased to $2.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, from $1.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $619.3 million compared to $585.5 million at June 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $10.0 million at March 31, 2018, from $7.8 million at June 30, 2017. Investment securities increased to $121.7 million at March 31, 2018, from $111.6 million at June 30, 2017. Net loans receivable increased to $458.3 million at March 31, 2018, from $440.3 million at June 30, 2017. Deposits increased to $478.8 million at March 31, 2018, from $439.1 million at June 30, 2017. Total borrowings, including repurchase agreements, decreased to $51.7 million at March 31, 2018 from $55.7 million at June 30, 2017. Stockholders’ equity decreased to $81.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $84.0 million at June 30, 2017.\nIF Bancorp, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”).
