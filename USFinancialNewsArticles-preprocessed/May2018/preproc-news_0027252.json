    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Imperial Metals Corporation (the “Company”) (TSX:III) reports financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as summarized in this release and discussed in detail in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis. The Company’s financial results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The reporting currency of the Company is the Canadian (“CDN”) Dollar.\nSelect Quarter Financial Information\nexpressed in thousands, except share and per share amounts Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 117,912 $ 115,749 Net loss $ 16,166 $ 18,752 Net loss per share $ 0.14 $ 0.20 Diluted loss per share $ 0.14 $ 0.20 Adjusted net loss (1) $ 4,754 $ 22,296 Adjusted net loss per share (1) $ 0.04 $ 0.24 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 36,392 $ 15,187 Working capital deficiency $ 743,096 $ 214,646 Total assets $ 1,662,528 $ 1,511,120 Total debt (including current portion) $ 829,698 $ 846,067 Cash flow (1)(2) $ 35,958 $ 15,065 Cash flow per share (1)(2) $ 0.31 $ 0.16 (1) Refer to Management’s Discussion & Analysis heading Non-IFRS Financial Measures for further details.\n(2) Cash flow is defined as the cash flow from operations before the net change in non-cash working capital balances, income and mining taxes, and interest paid. Cash flow per share is defined as Cash flow divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nRevenues increased to $117.9 million in the March 2018 quarter compared to $115.7 million in the 2017 comparative quarter, an increase of $2.2 million or 1.9%.\nRevenue from the Red Chris mine in the March 2018 quarter was $81.9 million compared to $54.6 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. This increase was attributable to a higher quantity of copper concentrate sold along with higher copper prices compared to the 2017 quarter.\nRevenue from the Mount Polley mine in the March 2018 quarter was $36.0 million compared to $61.0 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. The decrease was attributable to a lower quantity of copper concentrate sold.\nIn the March 2018 quarter, there were 4.0 concentrate shipments from Red Chris mine (2017-3.0 concentrate shipments) and 1.0 concentrate shipment from Mount Polley mine (2017-1.7 concentrate shipments). Variations in revenue are impacted by the timing and quantity of concentrate shipments, metal prices and exchange rates, and period end revaluations of revenue attributed to concentrate shipments where copper and gold prices will settle at a future date.\nThe London Metals Exchange cash settlement copper price per pound averaged US$3.16 in the March 2018 quarter compared to US$2.65 in the 2017 comparative quarter. The London Metals Exchange cash settlement gold price per troy ounce averaged US$1,329 in the March 2018 quarter compared to US$1,219 in the March 2017 quarter. The average CDN/US$ Dollar exchange rate was 1.265 in the March 2018 quarter, 4.38% lower than the exchange rate of 1.323 in the March 2017 quarter. In CDN dollar terms the average copper price in the March 2018 quarter was CDN$4.00 per pound compared to CDN$3.51 per pound in the 2017 comparative quarter and the average gold price in the March 2018 quarter was CDN$1,681 per ounce compared to CDN$1,613 per ounce in the 2017 comparative quarter.\nRevenue in the March 2018 quarter decreased by $5.6 million negative revenue revaluation compared to a $5.1 million positive revenue revaluation in the 2017 comparative quarter. Revenue revaluations are the result of the copper price on the settlement date and/or the current period balance sheet date being higher or lower than when the revenue was initially recorded or the copper price at the last balance sheet date.\nNet loss for the March 2018 quarter was $16.2 million ($0.14 per share) compared to net loss of $18.8 million ($0.20 per share) in the 2017 comparative quarter. The decrease in net loss of $2.6 million was primarily due to the following factors:\nIncome/loss from mine operations went from a loss of $5.7 million in March 2017 to income of $17.6 million in March 2018, a decrease in net loss of $23.3 million. Interest expense went from $18.2 million in March 2017 to $19.0 million in March 2018, an increase in net loss of $0.8 million. Foreign exchange gains/losses on current and non-current debt went from a gain of $3.4 million in March 2017 to a loss of $11.4 million in March 2018, an increase in net loss of $14.8 million. The Company’s equity loss in Huckleberry went from loss of $1.6 million in March 2017 to $nil in March 2018, a decrease in net loss of $1.6 million. Idle mine costs went from $nil in March 2017 to $1.4 million in March 2018, an increase in net loss of $1.4 million. Tax position went from a recovery of $5.0 million in March 2017 to $nil in March 2018, an increase in net loss of $5.0 million.\nThe March 2018 quarter net loss included foreign exchange loss related to changes in CDN/US Dollar exchange rate of $11.8 million compared to foreign exchange gain of $3.1 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. The $11.8 million foreign exchange loss is comprised of an $11.3 million loss on the senior notes, a $0.1 million loss on long term equipment loans, and a $0.4 million loss on operational items. The average CDN/US Dollar exchange rate in the March 2018 quarter was 1.265 compared to an average of 1.323 in the 2017 comparative quarter.\nCash flow was $36.0 million in the March 2018 quarter compared to cash flow of $15.1 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. Cash flow is a measure used by the Company to evaluate its performance, however, it is not a term recognized under IFRS. The Company believes Cash flow is useful to investors and it is one of the measures used by management to assess the financial performance of the Company.\nCapital expenditures were $9.1 million in the March 2018 quarter, down from $24.0 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. The March 2018 expenditures included $1.8 million for tailings dam construction, $5.0 million on mobile equipment and $2.3 million for other capital items. The 2017 quarter included $7.2 million of mobile equipment purchases as well as higher costs for tailings dam construction and other capital items.\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company reports four non-IFRS financial measures: Adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and cash cost per pound of copper produced which are described in detail below. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors because they are included in the measures that are used by management in assessing the financial performance of the Company.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow are not generally accepted earnings measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) and cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS. As there is no standardized method of calculating these measures, these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations are provided below.\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share\nAdjusted net loss in the March 2018 quarter was $4.8 million ($0.04 per share) compared to an adjusted net loss of $22.3 million ($0.24 per share) in the 2017 comparative quarter. Adjusted net loss reflects the financial results excluding the effect of items not settling in the current period and non-recurring items. Adjusted net loss is calculated by removing the gains or losses, resulting from mark to market revaluation of derivative instruments, net of tax, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on non-current debt, net of tax and other adjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA in the March 2018 quarter was $36.4 million compared to $15.2 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, taxes, depletion and depreciation, and as adjusted for certain other items.\nCash Flow and Cash Flow Per Share\nCash flow in the March 2018 quarter was $36.0 million compared to $15.1 million in the 2017 comparative quarter. Cash flow per share was $0.31 in the March 2018 quarter compared to $0.16 in the 2017 comparative quarter.\nCash flow and cash flow per share are measures used by the Company to evaluate its performance however they are not terms recognized under IFRS. Cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations before the net change in non-cash working capital balances, income and mining taxes, and interest paid and cash flow per share is the same measure divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.\nCash Cost Per Pound of Copper Produced\nThe cash cost per pound of copper produced is a non-IFRS financial measure that does not have a standardized meaning under IFRS, and as a result may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management uses this non-IFRS financial measure to monitor operating costs and profitability. The Company is primarily a copper producer and therefore calculates this non-IFRS financial measure individually for its three copper mines, Red Chris, Mount Polley and Huckleberry, and on a composite basis for these mines.\nThe cash cost per pound of copper produced is derived from the sum of cash production costs, transportation and offsite costs, treatment and refining costs, royalties, net of by-product and other revenues, divided by the number of pounds of copper produced during the period.\nVariations from period to period in the cash cost per pound of copper produced are the result of many factors including: grade, metal recoveries, amount of stripping charged to operations, mine and mill operating conditions, labour and other cost inputs, transportation and warehousing costs, treatment and refining costs, the amount of by-product and other revenues, the US$ to CDN$ exchange rate and the amount of copper produced. Idle mine costs during the periods when the Huckleberry mine was not in operation have been excluded from the cash cost per pound of copper produced.\nexpressed in thousands, except cash cost per pound of copper Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Red Chris Mount Polley Composite Cash cost of copper produced in US$ $ 34,260 $ 7,463 $ 41,723 Copper produced – pounds 19,725 5,372 25,097 Cash cost per lb copper produced in US$ $ 1.74 $ 1.39 $ 1.66 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Red Chris Mount Polley Composite Cash cost of copper produced in US$ $ 39,695 $ 10,852 $ 50,547 Copper produced – pounds 16,328 5,461 21,789 Cash cost per lb copper produced in US$ $ 2.43 $ 1.99 $ 2.32 OPERATIONS\nMetal production target ranges from Red Chris mine and Mount Polley mine for 2018 are 89-96 million pounds copper and 75-80 thousand ounces gold. At March 31, 2018, the Company has not hedged any copper, gold or CDN/US Dollar exchange. Quarterly revenues will fluctuate depending on copper and gold prices, the CDN/US Dollar exchange rate, and the timing of concentrate sales, which is dependent on concentrate production and the availability and scheduling of transportation.\nRed Chris Mine\nMetal production for the March 2018 quarter was 19.7 million pounds copper and 12,215 ounces gold, up 21% and 110% respectively from the 2017 comparative quarter.\nCopper recoveries were lower for the March 2018 quarter than the last quarter of 2017, as more high clay ore was found in the mineralized fault in the lower benches of the phase 3 pushback. Diagnostic and modelling work is underway to identify the extent of this zone, and whether special processing of these high clay zones may yield better recovery. The gold recovery improved significantly (about 26%) on higher gold grade.\nFive haul trucks from the Huckleberry mine are now in operation at Red Chris, and a new electric shovel is expected to arrive on site by mid-year. This equipment will enable an increased mining rate, and access to deeper higher grade ore.\nMining in the phase 3 pushback in the Main zone pit was completed. Mill feed for the remainder of 2018 will come from the phase 4 pushback of the Main zone.\nRed Chris Production Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Ore milled - tonnes 2,590,490 2,403,501 Ore milled per calendar day - tonnes 28,783 26,706 Grade % - copper 0.447 0.388 Grade g/t - gold 0.310 0.201 Recovery % - copper 77.22 79.49 Recovery % - gold 47.37 37.43 Copper – 000’s pounds 19,725 16,328 Gold – ounces 12,215 5,811 Silver – ounces 34,881 27,952 Exploration, development and capital expenditures were $4.9 million in the March 2018 quarter compared to $11.0 million in the comparative 2017 quarter.\nMount Polley Mine\nMetal production for the March 2018 quarter was 5.4 million pounds copper and 12,280 ounces gold, down 1.6% and 11% respectively from the 2017 comparative quarter.\nCompared to the 2017 fourth quarter, metal recoveries in the March 2018 quarter increased, with copper recovery at 75.67% compared to 56.77% and gold recovery at 73.75% compared to 62.47%. Throughput in the March 2018 quarter was 17,917 tonnes per day compared to 19,635 tonnes per day in 2017 fourth quarter. The decrease was the result of milling a greater proportion of harder but less oxidized ore from the lower benches of the Cariboo pit. Dredging of tailings from the Springer pit began this quarter.\nMount Polley Production Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 Ore milled - tonnes 1,612,486 1,692,762 Ore milled per calendar day - tonnes 17,917 18,808 Grade % - copper 0.200 0.205 Grade g/t - gold 0.321 0.355 Recovery % - copper 75.67 71.29 Recovery % - gold 73.75 71.55 Copper – 000’s pounds 5,372 5,461 Gold – ounces 12,280 13,811 Silver – ounces 8,965 10,877 Exploration, development and capital expenditures were $4.2 million in the March 2018 quarter compared to 13.0 million in the comparative 2017 quarter.\nThe collective agreement with the unionized workforce at the Mount Polley mine expired on December 31, 2017. Since late 2017 the Company has been in the process of negotiating a new contract. On May 7, 2018 the Company served the Union with 72 hour lockout notice. After expiry of the 72 hour period, the Company will have the legal right to lockout the employees at a date and time of the Company’s choosing.\nRefer to Imperial’s 2018 First Quarter Report on imperialmetals.com and sedar.com for detailed information.\nAn Earnings Announcement Conference Call\nis scheduled for Friday, May 11, 2018 at 10:00am PDT | 1:00pm EDT\nManagement will discuss the Company’s First Quarter 2018 Financial Results.
