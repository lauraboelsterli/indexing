    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 3:54 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago WRAPUP 6-Global stocks mixed amid Wall St profit taking, European rally, China moves Reuters Staff\n* European shares near four-month peak, Italy bond selloff relents\n* Dollar eases off highs while gold steadies\n* Oil rises to $80 per barrel (Updates with opening of U.S. markets, changes dateline; previous LONDON)\nBy Laila Kearney\nNew York, May 22 (Reuters) - Global stocks were mixed on Tuesday as Wall Street investors locked in recent gains while European shares approached four-month peaks as pressure eased on Italy’s debt markets and as China moved to further open up its economy.\nWashington neared an agreement to lift its ban on U.S. firms supplying to Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp, sources said, while Beijing said it would steeply cut import tariffs for automobiles and car parts.\nThat boosted auto stocks, with Ford, General Motors , and U.S.-listed shares of Fiat up between 1 percent and 2.4 percent.\nEurope’s big carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler jumped 1 to 1.6 percent too.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.25 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,004.04, the S&P 500 gained 6.02 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,739.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.49 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,407.52.lost 0.18\n“The market is taking very well to what appears to be the fact that (President Donald) Trump is able to maneuver the trade talks in our favor,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Jersey-based Janlyn Capital LLC, of the mostly upbeat tone. “We’re seeing a continuation of that positive momentum.”\nEarly European trading saw Italian government bond yields come off 14-month highs, after six days of heavy selling on concerns over high-spending policies mooted by a potential new ruling coalition.\nThe proposed tie-up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League has pushed Rome’s 10-year yields up nearly 70 basis points since the start of the month.\nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.36 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.46 percent.\nOil jumped to $80 a barrel, its highest since late 2014, on expectations Venezuelan crude output and a possible reduction in Iranian exports could further curb global supply.\nU.S. crude rose 0.64 percent to $72.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.25, up 1.3 percent.\nAfter six days of gains, the U.S. dollar retreated as Treasury yields dipped and investors sought incentives to buy after a 7 percent rally since mid-February.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 93.584. It was on track for its largest daily loss in two weeks.\nGold steadied as the dollar lost momentum, but risk appetite in the broader financial market cooled the metal’s gains.
