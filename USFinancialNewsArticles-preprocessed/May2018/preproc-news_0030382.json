    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 10:29 AM / in 43 minutes UPDATE 2-UK draws record 37 bln stg demand for new 2071 bond Reuters Staff\n(Updates with pricing details)\nBy David Milliken\nLONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Britain received record demand from investors at the launch of a new government bond which matures in 2071, as banks handling the sale took more than 37 billion pounds ($50 billion) of orders from investors.\nThe UK Debt Management Office said it would issue 6 billion pounds of the new bond, which was priced to yield 1.693 percent, a shade less than the 2068 gilt which it will overtake as the longest-maturity British government bond.\nThe sale confirms a picture of generally strong appetite for British government debt, which has shown little sign of slowing since June 2016’s Brexit vote.\nWithin an hour of books opening for the syndication of the 2071 gilt, which pays a coupon of 1.625 percent, the volume of orders beat the previous 26.4 billion pound record set a year ago at the sale of a new 40-year gilt.\nThe yield on the gilt is 0.5 basis points lower than the 2068 gilt, reflecting a price at the top end of the initial guidance range for the syndication, as is normal at gilt sales.\nThe 6 billion pounds nominal which will be issued is the highest for any gilt syndication since 2010, when the DMO sold 8 billion of 2040 conventional debt and then 6 billion pounds of 2040 index-linked gilts.\nUltra-long British government bonds typically draw strong demand from domestic life insurers and pension funds, who use the bonds to match long-term liabilities.\n“The syndication is an opportune time for pension schemes to accelerate or restructure their hedging programs,” said Rakesh Girdharlal, a senior portfolio manager at Aviva Investors.\nThe gilt’s coupon matched up well for hedging deferred pension liabilities, he added.\nMore broadly, British government bond prices were weaker on the day, reflecting a negative tone on euro zone debt and a slight knock from British data showing the fastest first-quarter job creation figures since late 2015.\nDespite the heavy issuance, ultra-long yields showed the smallest price falls. Fifty-year yields were around 1 basis point higher on the day, compared with a 3 basis point rise for benchmark 10-year debt.\nThe syndication was led by Barclays, Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs International and NatWest Markets, who acted as joint bookrunners.\nBritain’s DMO aims to raise at least 18.0 billion pounds through four gilt syndications this financial year, including at least 9.5 billion pounds via conventional issuance and 8.5 billion pounds through index-linked bonds.\nTotal gross gilt issuance for 2018/19 is pencilled in at 106 billion pounds. British public sector net borrowing fell last year to its lowest as a share of national income since 2001/02. ($1 = 0.7424 pounds) (Reporting by David Milliken Editing by Keith Weir)",
