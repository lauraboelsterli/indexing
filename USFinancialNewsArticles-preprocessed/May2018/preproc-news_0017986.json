    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 8:18 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Rugby-Bok blow as Marx ruled out of June series against England Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nJOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Reuters) - South Africa hooker Malcolm Marx will miss the June international series with England after being sidelined for at least six weeks by a hamstring injury, his Super Rugby the Lions confirmed on Wednesday.\n“Lions hooker Malcolm Marx has a high grade hamstring tendon tear. He does not require surgery and is not expected to recover for at least six weeks,” the team said in a statement.\nMarx, 23, was injured early in his side’s 28-19 away loss to the Wellington Hurricanes last Saturday and will miss the Springboks’ test against Wales in Washington on June 2, as well as the three-match home series against England that will be played on consecutive weekends thereafter.\nHis powerful performances in 2017 for the Springboks and the Johannesburg-based Lions, who were Super Rugby runners-up, led to Marx being named SA Rugby’s Player of the Year.
