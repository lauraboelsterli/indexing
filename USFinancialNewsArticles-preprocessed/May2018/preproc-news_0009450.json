    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 5:25 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago Boeing to buy aerospace parts maker KLX for about $3.2 billion Shubham Kalia 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Plane maker Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Tuesday it will buy aerospace parts company KLX Inc ( KLXI.O ) for about $3.2 billion (2.3 billion pounds) in cash to expand its aircraft services business.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nThe $63-per-share deal gives KLX an enterprise value of $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt.\nThe acquisition is contingent upon the successful divestment and separation of KLX’s Energy Services Group business, KLX said.\nKLX stock has risen about 24 percent since Dec. 22, when the company said it will review strategic alternatives including a potential sale.\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last week its services growth would be complemented by strategic acquisitions.\nThe plane maker said there will be no change to its 2018 guidance or capital deployment strategy and expects annual cost savings of about $70 million by 2021.\nLast year, Boeing launched a global services business which announced deals worth nearly $1 billion in February to capture more of the higher-margin services and spare-parts revenue.\nKLX will be part of Boeing Global Services and will be merged with Aviall, Boeing’s parts, equipment and services unit.\nThe combined business will provide a one-stop-shop that will benefit its supply chain and customers, said Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Global Services.\nGoldman Sachs advised KLX on the deal, while Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was its legal counsel.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the deal on Friday.
