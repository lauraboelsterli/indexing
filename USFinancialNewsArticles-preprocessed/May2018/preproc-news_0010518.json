    "text": "HOUSTON, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (NYSE:CHKR) (the \"Trust\") today announced that its common unit distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (which primarily relates to production attributable to the Trust's royalty interests from December 1, 2017 through February 28, 2018) will be $0.0469 per common unit. The distribution will be paid on May 31, 2018 to common unitholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018.\nDuring the three-month production period ended February 28, 2018, sales volumes and realized prices were both lower than initial Trust estimates.\nThe following table provides supporting documentation, as provided by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (\"Chesapeake\") to the Trust, for the calculation of distributable income available to unitholders for the production period from December 1, 2017 through February 28, 2018.\nSales volumes:\nOil (mbbl)\n24\nNatural gas (mmcf)\n608\nNatural gas liquids (mbbl)\n63\nTotal oil equivalent volumes (mboe)\n189\nAverage price received per production unit: (1)\nOil\n$\n59.96\nNatural gas\n$\n1.08\nNatural gas liquids\n$\n21.22\nDistributable income calculation (in thousands except per unit income):\nRevenue less production taxes (1)\n$\n3,154\nTrust administrative expenses\n(961)\nDistributable income available to unitholders\n$\n2,193\nCalculated distributable income per unit (2)\n$\n0.0469\n(1)\nIncludes the effect of certain marketing, gathering and transportation deductions.\n(2)\nBased on 46,750,000 common units issued and outstanding.\nDue to the timing of the payment of production proceeds to the Trust, quarterly distributions generally include royalties attributable to sales of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas for three months, including the first two months of the quarter just ended and the last month of the prior quarter.\nThe Trust was formed by Chesapeake Energy Corporation in June 2011 and owns royalty interests in certain oil and natural gas properties in the Colony Granite Wash play in Washita County, Oklahoma. The Trust is entitled to receive proceeds from the sale of production attributable to the royalty interests. As described in the Trust's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), the amount of Trust revenues and the quarterly distributions to Trust unitholders will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the sales volume of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas attributable to the Trust's royalty interests and the prices received for such sales and the amount of the Trust's administrative expenses, among other factors.\nFor additional information regarding the Trust and its results of operations and financial condition, please refer to the Trust's SEC filings.\nABOUT CHESAPEAKE GRANITE WASH TRUST:\nChesapeake Granite Wash Trust (NYSE:CHKR) is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Chesapeake to own certain royalty interests in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas wells in Washita County, Oklahoma producing from the Colony Granite Wash play within the broader Granite Wash formation of the Anadarko Basin. The common units do not represent interests in and are not obligations of Chesapeake. The common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CHKR. Further information is available at www.chkgranitewashtrust.com where the Trust routinely posts announcements, updates, investor information and news releases.\nPursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively connected to a U.S. trade or business allocated to foreign partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under Section 1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income from U.S. sources allocated to foreign partners should be made at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This release is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b) by the Trust, and while specific relief is not specified for Section 1441 income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. For distributions made to foreign partners, nominees and brokers should withhold at the highest effective tax rate.\nThis news release contains statements that are \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this news release, other than statements of historical facts, are \" \" for purposes of these provisions. The anticipated distribution discussed herein is based, in part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from Chesapeake with respect to the relevant quarterly period.
