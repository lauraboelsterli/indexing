    "text": "0 COMMENTS Marketing firm Didit is close to acquiring Gawker.com and if successful intends to relaunch the blog, known for publishing irreverent articles that were sometimes controversial, with a new editorial policy to only post content it considers to be positive.\nAdvisers liquidating the blog’s former publisher have a deal to sell the website to Didit for $1.13 million, an offer that is subject to higher offers at a potential auction, according to papers filed Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The agreement and terms of an auction must be approved by a judge. Based in Mineola, N.Y., Didit was founded in 1996.\nLiquidators have tentatively set a July 12 date for the auction assuming they receive other qualified bids for the blog. Gawker ceased publishing new articles in August 2016, months after losing in court to professional wrestler Hulk Hogan whose $140 million judgment against publisher Gawker Media LLC forced the company into bankruptcy . The case was settled in chapter 11 for $31 million. The Hogan case concerned publishing excerpts from a video of a sexual encounter with the wife of a former friend.\nDidit’s vision for Gawker is radically different than that of the blog’s founder Nick Denton , whose approach to adversarial journalism exposed the website to costly litigation. Gawker’s archives include an early expose on the drug bazaar Silk Road and articles published in 2014 and 2015 detailing allegations of sexual abuse against Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Denton wrote in Gawker’s final post that “It was a matter of pride that Gawker ran stories that couldn't be published elsewhere.”\nHulk Hogan, center, looks on in court moments after a jury returned its decision on March 21, 2016, in St. Petersburg, Fla. The professional wrestler’s $140 million judgment against Gawker Media forced the company into bankruptcy. Photo: Dirk Shadd/Press Pool Didit seeks to revive the blog with what it calls “Gawker for Good” — publishing what it considers positive news stories and “good gossip.” The firm would donate half of the advertising and sponsorship revenue it generates from new Gawker articles to non-profit organizations selected either by readers and people it partners with to develop content for the site, Didit co-founder Kevin Lee said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n“I think there is still a place for...good gossip. I don’t think you need to run a click baity, salacious gossip site,” Mr. Lee said.\nMr. Lee, 53 years old, said he began developing his idea for the new marketing platform in September and launched a separate Didit-owned site called BriefMe.com to test the idea. He said he had been looking for existing sites that would be recognizable to readers and decided “on a lark” to place a bid for Gawker after previously looking into acquiring the local news websites DNAInfo and Gothamist after they were shut down last year.\nMr. Lee said he didn’t expect he would get this close to acquiring Gawker when he initially considered bidding on the site and said he is interested in seeing if others will place bids on the blog.\nMr. Lee said he doesn’t have experience in journalism but said if the bid for Gawker succeeds, he would hire people who did. Didit describes itself as a fully integrated marketing and communications firm.\n“I do have concerns that it’s not going to be easy, but on the flip side, nothing really fun in life is easy,” Mr. Lee said. “It’s more fun to take on challenges that make you think all the time.”\nThe fate of Gawker is one of the last open questions in the publisher’s nearly two-year-old bankruptcy. Liquidators began shopping the blog in the fall but the sale process was slowed after billionaire Peter Thiel revealed his interest in acquiring the site . Mr. Thiel secretly funded Mr. Hogan’s legal case against Gawker. Mr. Hogan is entitled to 45% of the proceeds from the eventual sale of the Gawker site, according to his settlement.\nMr. Lee said he had been concerned about Mr. Thiel’s interest in Gawker as well as the involvement of lawyer Charles Harder who is representing plaintiffs in two defamation lawsuits against Gizmodo Media Group, a Univision Communications Inc. subsidiary that acquired the other Gawker Media blogs in 2016.\nMr. Harder in a September email to the Journal said “It would be the responsible thing to do for a new buyer to remove articles from Gawker.com that violate defamation laws, privacy laws or journalism ethics (Google ‘SPJ Code of Ethics’),”referring to the Society of Professional Journalists.\nDidit has agreed to make a copy of the existing Gawker archive, court papers say. Mr. Lee said he believes it’s important that a record of Gawker’s existing stories are preserved, saying “we don’t have the wherewithal to fight assaults on the archive.”\nJudge Stuart Bernstein earlier this month approved a standstill agreement between Mr. Thiel and Gawker Media. Mr. Thiel agreed to withdraw from the sale process and to provide the eventual buyer a legal release for articles in the Gawker archive. In exchange, lawyers representing the publisher dropped a potential legal case against Mr. Thiel.\nGregg Galardi, a Ropes & Gray LLP bankruptcy lawyer representing Gawker Media, said at a court hearing when the agreement was approved that the estate has received a handful of bids for the website. Assets for sale include the Gawker domain, social media accounts and nearly 200,000 published articles.\nA group of former Gawker Media employees launched a crowdfunding campaign late last year to fund a bid for the site but fell short of their $500,000 goal.\nWrite to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com",
