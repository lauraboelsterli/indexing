    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt on Monday strongly condemned what it said was Israel’s targeting of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, where at least 38 have been killed while demonstrating at the border, the foreign ministry said.\n“Egypt rejects the use of force against peaceful marches demanding legitimate and just rights, and warns of the negative consequences of this dangerous escalation in the occupied Palestinian territories,” the ministry said in a statement.\nReporting by Ali Abdelaty, writing by Sami Aboudi, Editing by William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
