It was forecast to earn 260 million shekels on revenue of 2.41 billion, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.\nBezeq was a long-time monopoly that began facing stiffer competition in 2015 after the government opened the market to smaller rivals offering far cheaper, though narrower, services.\nThe arrests in the past year of the company’s chairman, chief executive and other officers suspected of fraud, bribery other securities offenses has added uncertainty. They all deny wrongdoing.\nControlling-shareholder Shaul Elovitch was forced out as chairman last June at the outset of the investigation. His permanent replacement, Shlomo Rodav, was elected last month. CEO Stella Handler will officially step down on July 1 and no successor has been announced.\nActivist investor Elliott Advisors last week urged the board to appoint a new chief executive swiftly and to consider a share buy-back programme.\nBezeq’s shares have slid 23 percent in the past year, but were up 2 percent on Thursday, trading in Tel Aviv at 43.25 shekels.\n“Our group-wide results in the first quarter of 2018 continue to demonstrate the increased competition and changes in all areas of the telecommunications market,” Rodav said.\nHe said the company was “in the process of formulating a long-term strategy” while hoping the government would end a forced structural separation that keeps its mobile phone, fixed line, satellite TV and internet units as separate entities.\nBezeq also reported an 80-million-shekel early-retirement plan for 75 workers to be taken in the second quarter.\nIn the first quarter, Bezeq’s satellite TV business Yes saw its profit plunge 95 percent to 1 million shekels. Mobile phone unit Pelephone gained 21,000 subscribers to 2.546 million, but net profit fell 49 percent to 9 million shekels amid strong competition.\nBarclays analyst Tavy Rosner noted the quarterly results were in line with estimates, and that “looking ahead we continue to believe that most of the ‘bad news’ is in the stock and we see more upside than downside risk from here.” ($1 = 3.5692 shekels) (Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch Editing by Steven Scheer/Keith Weir)\n ",
