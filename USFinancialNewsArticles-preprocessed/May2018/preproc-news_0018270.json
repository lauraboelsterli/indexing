    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Instructure, Inc. (NYSE: INST), a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology company in education, learning and performance management, announced today the appointment of software industry veteran Dan Goldsmith as president, effective June 4, 2018. Goldsmith will have broad responsibilities overseeing sales, marketing, product, customer experience, engineering and business development.\nWith more than 20 years of experience in software and services, Goldsmith's career is marked by directing high-performing global teams and achieving outstanding penetration and growth in challenging markets. Goldsmith spent the last eight years as a senior executive at Veeva Systems, a cloud-based software company, where he started and ran Veeva's international business, led the company's strategy in new markets and products, and most recently was responsible for Veeva's global engagement and growth in strategic accounts.\n\"It is an exciting time for Instructure. We are well positioned for success as we focus on the continued growth of Canvas, expansion of Bridge, and international execution,\" said Josh Coates, CEO of Instructure. \"Dan's energy, creativity and proven track record in driving go-to-market strategies and rapidly scaling businesses make him a tremendous addition to Instructure at the perfect time to lead us through our next phase of growth.\"\nGoldsmith was one of the first 50 employees at Veeva. He helped lead the company through a successful IPO and a growth path to a $10 billion market cap. Prior to Veeva, he worked in various executive positions at top companies, including Accenture, PwC and IBM. During his years in management consulting, Goldsmith led initiatives in global markets and developed new offerings. Goldsmith will have an immediate impact on Instructure's strategy. His initial focus will be on market growth, with the sales leaders reporting directly to him.\n\"Disrupting an industry, as Instructure has done in education technology, carries with it a responsibility to continuously innovate and build successful programs and products at scale,\" said Goldsmith. \"This is an amazing opportunity to join an incredible team and an organization with a strong foundation, rooted in openness, intuitive products and excellent customer experiences. I could not be more excited to be part of the journey ahead.\"\nAs part of this new leadership structure, Mitch Macfarlane, Instructure's COO, has decided to leave the company to pursue new opportunities. He will assist with the transition until June 25, 2018. \"Mitch has played a foundational role in the growth of the company since joining Instructure in 2011,\" Coates said. \"We are deeply grateful for all his contributions and wish him the best.\"\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking\" statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Instructure's product strategy and growth.
