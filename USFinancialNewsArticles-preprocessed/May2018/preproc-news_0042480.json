    "text": "May 21 (Reuters) - A head-to-head trial showed that people with haemophilia B who received Novo Nordisk’s Refixia achieved greater total factor IX exposure than those treated with recombinant factor IX-Fc Fusion Protein, the Danish company said on Monday.\n* People with haemophilia B have congenital factor IX deficiency and are either missing or have a malfunctioning factor IX protein, which is needed for proper blood clotting\n* “These head-to-head data support the strong clinical profile of Refixia,” chief science officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in a press release.
