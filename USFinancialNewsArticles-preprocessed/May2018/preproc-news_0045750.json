    "text": "LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Turkey’s dollar-denominated bonds tumbled across the curve on Monday with some issues losing more than 2 cents while investors fretted over the central bank’s ability to rein in double-digit inflation as the lira plumbed fresh record lows.\nThe 2034 issue chalked up the steepest losses, dropping 2.377 cents, while the bond maturing in 2036 also lost more than 2 cents, according to Tradeweb data. Both issues were trading at record lows, with losses more pronounced at the longer end of the curve. (Reporting by Karin Strohecker; editing by Claire Milhench)\n ",
