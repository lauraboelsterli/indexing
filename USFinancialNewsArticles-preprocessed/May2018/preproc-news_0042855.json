    "text": "(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it had hired Snap Inc’s vice president of monetization engineering, Stuart Bowers, as VP of engineering.\nTesla said earlier this month that Doug Field, who is currently Senior VP of engineering, is taking a break from work but is not leaving the company.\nSnap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNews website Cheddar earlier reported that Tesla had hired Bowers from Snap, citing people familiar with the matter.\n(This version of the story corrects Bowers’ title to VP of monetization engineering from VP of monetization in paragraph 1 and Field’s title to Senior VP of Engineering from VP of Engineering in paragraph 2)\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
