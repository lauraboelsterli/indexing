    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 4:42 PM / in 21 minutes Remembering 'Mr Wales', soldiers look forward to Harry and Meghan's big day Alistair Smout 3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Soldiers involved in the marriage of Britain’s Prince Harry to Meghan Markle are no strangers to pomp and pageantry, but for Corporal Major Daniel Snoxell, it’s the wedding of an old colleague rather than a royal. Members of the Household Cavalry, which will provide ceremonial support to the forthcoming wedding of Britain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle, are inspected in the Regimental Square at the Hyde Park Barracks in London, Britain, May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe Household Cavalry have a ceremonial role to play in most major royal events, from the opening of parliament to “trooping the color,” a large parade to mark the Queen’s official birthday.\nBut Harry’s wedding this month will have extra meaning for members of the regiment who served with him during his 10-year army career, where he rose to be “Captain Wales” after his father, Charles, Prince of Wales.\n“We didn’t view him as Prince Harry. We viewed him as Mr Wales, our troop leader,” Snoxell, who will line the staircase for the departure of the wedding party, told Reuters at Hyde Park Barracks in London.\n“It just adds that next level of pride, on that personal level, knowing him, knowing that he’s found someone to settle down with and to be part of that special day.” State Trumpeters, who are members of the Household Cavalry who will provide ceremonial support to the forthcoming wedding of Britain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle, stand in their Hyde Park Barracks in London, Britain, May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nHarry, 33, joined the British army in 2005. After training at Britain’s top military academy in Sandhurst, he became an officer and undertook two tours of Afghanistan. He rose to the rank of captain before leaving the army in 2015.\nWhile Harry was at the Household Cavalry’s operational wing, based in Windsor, most of the soldiers Harry served with spent time in London’s Hyde Park, and many in the London barracks remember their time serving with him even now.\nCorporal of Horse John Brophy served in the same squadron as Harry in Helmand, Afghanistan, and will also form part of the staircase party at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, where Harry will marry former TV star Markle on May 19.
