REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo\nThe investigation concerns illegal practices that can influence prices such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders, Bloomberg said, citing four people familiar with the matter.\nFederal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the report added.\nNeither the Justice Department nor the CFTC were immediately available for comment.
