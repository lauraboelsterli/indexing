The roaring creatures return to cinema screens in “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”, the fifth instalment in the sci-fi movie franchise which began 25 years ago. Cast members (L to R) Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jeff Goldblum pose in front of a model dinosaur during a photocall to promote the forthcoming film 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' in London, Britain, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe sequel to 2015’s “Jurassic World” sees actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard reprise their roles as Owen and Claire and return to Isla Nublar, three years after its dinosaur theme park was devastated by the creatures escaping confinement.\nWith a volcanic eruption threatening the surviving dinosaurs on the island, Claire and Owen want to rescue them.\n“Jurassic World” successfully rebooted the “Jurassic Park” film franchise, which kicked off with the 1993 film directed by Steven Spielberg, taking $1.67 billion at the box office worldwide.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\nMaking the sequel, eagerly awaited by fans, was a “big responsibility”, director J.A. Bayona said at a London photocall to promote the film on Thursday.\n“You really need to do something that will satisfy them, but at the same time you’re looking for something to surprise them... That’s the most challenging thing about doing a sequel,” he told Reuters.

We feature these creatures that truly at one point walked the earth, which is mind-boggling... Kids love dinosaurs and so does the kid inside the adult.”\n“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” begins its worldwide cinema rollout from June 6.
