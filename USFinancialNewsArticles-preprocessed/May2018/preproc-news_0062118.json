May 27, 2018; Boston, MA, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) reacts in the last seconds of play against the Boston Celtics during the second half in game seven of the Eastern conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at TD Garden. Cleveland defeated the Celtics 87-79. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\nPaul could have one name in mind: his good friend, LeBron James.\nWhile the Cleveland Cavaliers star has yet to begin the quest for his fourth NBA championship in his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance — against the Golden State Warriors for the fourth consecutive season — Paul is reportedly laying the groundwork for bringing James to Houston.\n“Rest assured that the Rockets’ understandably devastated Chris Paul — who made a fast exit from Toyota Center late Monday night after being forced to watch the biggest game of his life (Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against Golden State) from the bench because of his hamstring injury — has already begun his recruitment of James to Houston,” Marc Stein wrote in The New York Times. May 26, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Houston Rockets guard James Harden (left) and guard Chris Paul (right) on the bench against the Golden State Warriors in the second half in game six of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Oracle Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nPaul and James are longtime friends, and the prospect of the two teaming up to contend for a championship has long been rumored. A big three consisting of James, Paul and James Harden could be enough to dethrone Golden State in the Western Conference.\nRumors of James’ second departure from Cleveland have gained steam as the season winds down. Houston, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers are all rumored destinations for James, who has a player option for the 2018-19 season with Cleveland.\nFor now, James will turn his attention to trying to beat the Warriors for the second time in four Finals meetings. He led the Cavs back from a 3-1 series deficit to beat Golden State in 2016 for Cleveland’s first professional sports title in 52 years.\n—Field Level Media",
