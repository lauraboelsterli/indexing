    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s business minister said the government understands the importance of avoiding friction in the automotive supply chain after Brexit, as ministers try to overcome differences as to what customs relationships Britain should have with the EU.\nBritain's Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark arrives for a Brexit subcommittee meeting at Downing Street in London, Britain, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay “I know… just how crucial it is that in the agreement that we reach with the European Union, that it respects the ability to continue those flourishing supply chain relationships by avoiding introducing new frictions,” Greg Clark said on Tuesday.\nPrime Minister Theresa May is trying to overcome deep divisions in her cabinet over the nature of Britain’s divorce with the EU and find agreement on a customs proposal to take to Brexit talks in Brussels.\nAsked about when ministers would decide, Clark said: “There’s a sub-committee of the cabinet that is looking at these things. There’s been no requirement to agree by tomorrow night or something like that. The work is going on.”\nReporting by Costas Pitas, editing by Alistair Smout\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. ",
