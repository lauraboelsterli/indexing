    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 4:16 AM / Updated 41 minutes ago Vinhomes share sale raises $1.35 billion in Vietnam's biggest issue - sources Anshuman Daga 3 Min Read\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - An initial equity offering of Vinhomes JSC, the residential property development unit of Vingroup JSC, raised about $1.35 billion in the country’s biggest-ever issue after being priced at the top end of an indicative range, sources told Reuters on Monday.

As the issue was not sold to retail investors, bankers refer to it as an initial equity offering.\nVietnam’s strong growth prospects, a privatisation drive by the government and successful private sector IPOs over the past two years have attracted many investors to the country.\nLast month, Singapore wealth fund GIC came in as a pre-IPO investor and took a roughly 7 percent stake in Vinhomes for about $853 million by buying shares from Vingroup and other shareholders, source said.\nVinhomes’ equity offering eclipsed an offering from Vietnam Technological and Commercial Joint Stock Bank, which was also priced at the top-end of an indicative range and raised roughly $922 million last month.\nThough local equity markets have dropped 15 percent from a record high struck last month, analysts view the correction as short-lived.\nGlobal and local investors such as Capital Research and Management Company, Dragon Capital and Mirae Asset Global Investments agreed to take up about three-quarters of Vinhomes’ equity offering, according to a termsheet of the issue.\nCitigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint global co-ordinators for the deal.\n($1 = 22,788.0000 dong)",
