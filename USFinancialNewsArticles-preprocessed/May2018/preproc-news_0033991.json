    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ominto, Inc. (Nasdaq:OMNT), a growth company with global operations in the e-commerce, marketing, and entertainment industries, today announced that it has notified the Nasdaq Stock Market of its intent to withdraw its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, from listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Nasdaq, a Form 25 relating to the delisting of its common stock on May 24, 2018. It is anticipated that the delisting will become effective June 3, 2018, ten days after filing the Form 25. As a result, the Company expects the last day of trading of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market will be on or about June 1, 2018. The Company has filed an application to have its shares Quote: d on the OTC Pink which is operated by OTC Market Groups Inc., under the symbol \"OMNT\" and anticipates that its shares will begin to trade on the OTC Pink effective June 4, 2018. The Company does not expect the transition to the OTC Pink to affect the Company's business operations.\nThe Company’s decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market is due to the fact that the Company has been unable to timely file its periodic reports for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and the quarter ended December 31, 2017. As previously disclosed, on each of January 3, 2018, February 22, 2018 and March 1, 2018 the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria outlined in Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and as of May 14, 2018, the Company has not regained compliance with the Nasdaq Rules.\nAbout Ominto, Inc.\nOminto is a growing company with global operations in the e-commerce, marketing, and entertainment industries.
