    "text": "May 10 (Reuters) - Spotify Technologies SA said on Thursday it is removing rhythm and blues singer R. Kelly’s music from its playlists and algorithmic recommendations, reflecting its new policy on hate content and hateful conduct.\nR. Kelly has denied here allegations made in U.S. media of sexual misconduct.\n“We don’t censor content because of an artist’s or creator’s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions - what we choose to program - to reflect our values,” a Spotify spokesperson said.\nReuters could not immediately reach the singer.\nThe music streaming service said his music will still be on Spotify, but it will not actively promote it.
