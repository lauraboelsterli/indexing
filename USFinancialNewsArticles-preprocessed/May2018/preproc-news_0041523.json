    "text": "TORONTO, May 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Symbility Solutions Inc. (\"Symbility\" or the \"Company\") (TSX.V: SY), a global software company focused on modernizing the insurance industry, today announced financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\n\"I am pleased to report another strong quarter as we continue to grow revenue and show profitability, a trend we expect to continue going forward,\" said James Swayze, CEO of Symbility Solutions. \"With the sale of Symbility Health, we have realigned our focus around our P&C Insurance platform and are looking to leverage our strengthened balance sheet to drive scale into the business.\"\nMr. Swayze continued, \"The success we are enjoying in the UK through the launch of new products last year is now translating into pipeline growth in multiple markets. Insurtech momentum is compelling top 10 companies to challenge the status quo of their operations and begin testing new claim submission and settlement products which is seen as Symbility's strength. Over the course of this year, we look forward to expanding the reach of our consumer-facing product LINK, as policyholders continue to demand more transparency from their insurance providers.\"\n2018 GUIDANCE\nIn 2018, Symbility estimates that it will generate revenue of $40 million, compared to $35.6 revenue in 2017 from continuing operations. This revenue growth is expected to generate Adjusted EBITDA 1 in the range of $4 million to $5 million, compared to $3.9 million Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 from continuing operations. The Company also expects to have positive cash flow.\nSYMBILITY HEALTH\nAs announced on May 8, 2018, Symbility Solutions sold its Symbility Health division for $16.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments. This divestiture allows Symbility to focus on the growth and expansion of its P&C Insurance platform which is now offered in eight countries on four continents. The cash proceeds of this deal give Symbility a strengthened balance sheet in excess of $20 million which will allow the company to contemplate further transformative M&A as it continues to strategically review growth and scale opportunities.\nFIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS\nConsolidated revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 ended March 31, 2018 was $8.6 million compared to $7.7 million in the same period in 2017 from containing operations, an increase of 11 per cent.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $0.8 million in first quarter of 2018 compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($0.4) million in the first quarter of 2017, an improvement of 325 per cent.\nNet income and comprehensive income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.1 million compared to a net loss of ($1.1) million for the same period in 2017.\nThe Company had income per share 2 of $0.00 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a loss per share of ($0.00) in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company had a cash balance of $10.9 million as at March 31, 2018 compared to a cash balance of $8.2 million as at December 31, 2017.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nin thousands of dollars\nthree months ended March 31,\nContinuing Operations\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$8,552\n$7,738\nCost of Sales\n$2,121\n$2,322\nExpenses\n$6,340\n$6,535\nNet Income (Loss)\n$100\n($1,130)\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$829\n($369)\nIncome (Loss) per share 2\n$0.00\n($0.00)\nAs at\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$10,942\n$8,238\nTotal Assets\n$39,679\n$37,971\nTotal long-term liabilities\n$6\n$389\nthree months ended March 31,\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\n2018\n2017\nIFRS Net Income (Loss)\n$175\n($1,134)\nDiscontinued operations\n(75)\n4\nFinance income, net\n(17)\n(4)\nDepreciation and amortization\n454\n604\nStock-based compensation\n159\n146\nTransaction Related Expense\n125\n-\nIncome tax expense\n8\n15\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 (Continuing Operations)\n$829\n($369)\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and is calculated as earnings before interest income, taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, stock-based compensation, and other non-recurring gains or losses including transaction costs related to acquisition and restructuring cost. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure that facilitates period-to-period operating comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings (loss) prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. All other financial measures referenced herein have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards unless stated otherwise.\n2 In Canadian dollars, rounded to the nearest cent.\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL\nSymbility will host a live webcast and conference call Friday, May 18, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time to review highlights of its quarterly results, recent transaction news, discussion on guidance and general business update.
