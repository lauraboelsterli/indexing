    "text": "TORONTO, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GrowMax Resources Corp. (the “ Company ” or “ GrowMax Resources ”) (TSX-V:GRO) announces that it has filed its Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim MD&A – Quarterly Highlights relating to its first quarter 2018 results. These filings can be accessed on SEDAR’s website at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at www.growmaxcorp.com .\nSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe following Summary of Selected Financial Highlights have been derived from the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim MD&A – Quarterly Highlights. Readers are encouraged to review the entire Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim MD&A – Quarterly Highlights. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\n($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents 38,489 39,157 Working capital (1) 38,166 39,560\nThree months ended March 31 ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 General and administrative expenses\n(excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation) 713 822 Foreign exchange (gain) loss (1,157 ) 593 Capital expenditures, net 1,059 1,430 Net cash used by operating activities 705 1,589 Notes:\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets (March 31, 2018 - $42.4 million; December 31, 2017 - $43.3 million) less current liabilities (March 31, 2018 - $4.2 million; December 31, 2017 - $3.7 million). Working capital is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. Working capital is used to assess liquidity and general financial strength. Working capital does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. It is unlikely for non-GAAP measures to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Working capital should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than current assets or current liabilities as determined in accordance with IFRS.\nStephen Keith, President and CEO of GrowMax Resources, stated “GrowMax remains focused on preserving its strong cash position while simultaneously seeking out accretive acquisitions that will bring value to our shareholders in the near term. GrowMax’s Management and Board are keenly aware of the lack of news flow from its projects over the past several months, as well as the continued weakness in global prices for phosphate rock. The Company’s Management and Board firmly believe that the best strategy is to focus on opportunities in the specialty fertilizer and/or nutrient space that can deliver cash flow and growth to the Company and its shareholders.”\nFor more information, please contact:\nStephen Keith, P.
