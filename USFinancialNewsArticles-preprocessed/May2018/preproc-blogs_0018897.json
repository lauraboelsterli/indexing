    "text": "0 COMMENTS Bring back the fat cats!\nKindred Biosciences , a biotech startup focused on developing medicines for pets, announced on Monday that the Food and Drug Administration has approved Mirataz, a drug that helps manage weight loss in felines.\n“Based on our market research, we estimate that veterinarians in the U.S. see as many as 9 million cats each year with unintended weight loss due to various underlying conditions.” CEO Richard Chin said in a press release.\nThat hefty number suggests a large market opportunity. Of course, Kindred will need to convert optimism into sales if it wants to maintain the momentum in the company’s stock price, which is up about 45% so far this year.\nA celebrity pitchman, or better yet pitchcat, might help. There was no word yet as of Monday morning-whether Garfield is available.\nShare this: Biotech Heard on the Street Overheard Previous The Warren Buffett-Elon Musk Feud Isn't Over Yet Next Stocks to Watch: Berkshire, Starbucks, Apple, Mondelez, Wells Fargo, Nvidia, Exxon, Blackstone",
