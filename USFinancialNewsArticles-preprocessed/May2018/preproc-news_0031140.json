(NYSE MKT: ONP) (\"Orient Paper\" or the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer and distributor of diversified paper products in North China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMr. Zhenyong Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Orient Paper, commented, \"Our disappointing first quarter results reflected the impact of a temporary suspension of production due to government-mandated restrictions on the supply of natural gas that lasted for most of the first quarter. However, production at our manufacturing facilities has been back to normal since mid-March and we anticipate a strong rebound in our business in the second quarter.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Unaudited Financial Results\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nRevenues\n1.9\n25.3\n-92.5%\nRegular Corrugating Medium Paper (\"CMP\")*\n0.9\n19.5\n-95.3%\nLight-Weight CMP**\n0.7\n2.2\n-70.5%\nOffset Printing Paper\n0.3\n2.9\n-88.8%\nTissue Paper Products\n0.0\n0.7\n-100.0%\nGross profit (loss)\n-0.7\n5.7\n-112.3%\nGross profit (loss) margin\n-36.8%\n22.4%\n-59.2 pp\nRegular Corrugating Medium Paper (\"CMP\")*\n-20.2%\n22.3%\n-42.5 pp\nLight-Weight CMP**\n-59.5%\n23.3%\n-82.8 pp\nOffset Printing Paper\n-37.7%\n25.5%\n-63.2 pp\nTissue Paper Products\nNM\n7.9%\nNM\nOperating income (loss)\n-4.5\n2.9\n-257.4%\nNet income (loss)\n-4.1\n1.7\n-339.3%\nEBITDA\n-0.5\n6.5\n-107.5%\nBasic and Diluted earnings (loss) per share\n-0.19\n0.08\n-337.5%\n* Products from PM6\n** Products from PM1\n*** pp represents percentage points\nRevenue\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenue decreased by $23.4 million, or 92.5%, to $1.9 million from $25.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in total revenue was mainly due to decreases in sales volume across all product categories and partially offset by an increase in blended ASP. In late January, 2018, the Company temporarily suspended its production due to government-mandated restrictions on the natural gas supply. The company resumed production on March 14, 2018. As a result, both the production and sales volume decreased significantly in the first quarter of 2018. The following table summarizes revenue, volume and ASP by product for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue ($'000)\nVolume (tonne)\nASP ($/tonne)\nRevenue ($'000)\nVolume (tonne)\nASP ($/tonne)\nRegular CMP\n908\n1,672\n543\n19,452\n47,792\n407\nLight-Weight CMP\n652\n1,251\n521\n2,210\n5,023\n440\nOffset Printing Paper\n329\n379\n867\n2,925\n4,756\n615\nTissue Paper Products\n-\n-\n-\n703\n558\n1,260\nTotal\n1,888\n#\n3,302\n572\n25,290\n58,129\n435\nRevenue from CMP, including both regular CMP and light-Weight CMP, decreased by $20.1 million, or 92.8%, to $1.6 million and accounted for 82.6% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $21.7 million, or 85.7% of total revenue, for the same period of the prior year. The Company sold 2,923 tonnes of CMP at an ASP of $534/tonne in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 52,815 tonnes at an ASP of $410/tonne in the same period of the prior year.\nOf the total CMP sales, revenue from regular CMP decreased by $18.5 million, or 95.3%, to $0.9 million, resulting from sales of 1,672 tonnes at an ASP of $543/tonne, during the first quarter of 2018, compared to revenue of $19.5 million, resulting from sales of 47,792 tonnes at an ASP of $407/tonne, for the same period of the prior year. Revenue from light-weight CMP decreased by $1.6 million, or 70.5%, to $0.7 million, resulting from sales of 1,251 tonnes at an ASP of $521/tonne for the first quarter of 2018, compared to revenue of $2.2 million, resulting from sales of 5,023 tonnes at an ASP of $440/tonne for the same period of the prior year.\nRevenue from offset printing paper decreased by $2.6 million, or 88.8%, to $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, from $2.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The Company sold 379 tonnes of offset printing paper at an ASP of $867/tonne in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4,756 tonnes at an ASP of $615/tonne in the same period of the prior year.\nProduction of tissue paper was suspended in September and October 2017 for the replacement of coal boilers, and intermittent production resumed in the following months due to volatility in the price of tissue paper. We had no revenue from tissue paper products for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.7 million, resulting from sales of 558 tonnes at an ASP of $1,260/tonne, for the first quarter of 2017. We expect to resume and increase production of tissue products once the market condition becomes more favorable.\nGross Profit (loss) and Gross (Loss) Margin\nTotal cost of sales decreased by $17.1 million, or 86.8%, to $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, from $19.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Cost of sales per tonne was $782 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $338 for the same period of the prior year. The increase in overall cost of sales per tonne was mainly due to increased unit cost of manufacturing overhead due to the production suspension in the first quarter of 2018, as well as higher average unit purchase costs of recycled paper board and recycled scrap binding. Costs of sales per tonne for regular CMP, light-weight CMP, offset printing paper, and tissue paper products were, $653, $831, $1,194, and $nil, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $316, $337, $458, and $1,161, respectively, for the same period of the prior year.\nGross loss was $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to gross profit of $5.7 million for the same period of the prior year. Overall gross loss margin was 36.8% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to gross profit margin of 22.4% for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin were mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and increase in unit cost of recycled paper board and recycled scrap binding and partially offset by the increase in ASP as discussed above. Gross loss margins for regular CMP, light-weight CMP, offset printing paper, and tissue paper products were 20.2%, 59.5%, 37.7%, and nil, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to gross profit margin of 22.3%, 23.3%, 25.5%, and 7.9%, respectively, for the same period of the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased by $1.0 million, or 37.1%, to $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $2.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was mainly due to the depreciation of idle equipment during the suspension of production in the first quarter of 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A was 202.0% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 11.0% for the same period of the prior year.\nIncome (loss) from Operations\nLoss from operations was $4.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to income from operations of $2.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above. Operating loss margin was 239.4% for the first quarter of 2018, compare to operating profit margin of 11.4% for the same period of the prior year.\nNet Income (loss)\nNet loss was $4.1 million, or net loss of $0.19 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or net earnings of $0.08 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of the prior year.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA was negative $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $6.5 million for the same period of the prior year.\nNote 1: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, this press release includes a discussion of EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our results and make strategic decisions. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because it is an indicator of operational performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, and should not be viewed as an alternative to measures of financial performance or changes in cash flows calculated in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA\n(Amounts expressed in US$)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n-4.1\n$\n1.7\nAdd: Income tax\n-0.5\n0.5\nNet interest expense\n0.4\n0.7\nDepreciation and amortization\n3.7\n3.6\nEBITDA\n$\n-0.5\n$\n6.5\nCash, Liquidity and Financial Position\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt (including related party loan), notes payable and long-term debt (including related party loans) of $0.7 million, $19.7 million, $4.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively, compared to $2.9 million, $13.6 million, $6.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively, at the end of 2017. Net accounts receivable was $0.8 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2017.

This compared to current assets of $20.0 million, current liabilities of $21.8 million and working capital deficit of $1.8 million at the end of 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 million for the same period of the prior year.
