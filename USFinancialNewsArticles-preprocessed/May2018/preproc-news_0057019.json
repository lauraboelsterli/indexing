    "text": " 13 minutes ago Egypt detains prominent opposition leader, former Sisi supporter - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have detained prominent opposition leader Hazim Abdelazim, three security sources told Reuters on Sunday, the latest development in what rights groups say is a campaign to silence government critics. FILE PHOTO: A Cairo street sign showing Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ahead of the presidential election, March 25, 2018. REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo\nEgypt has in recent weeks arrested several prominent activists in a crackdown on critics that followed small protests against hikes in metro fares.\nAbdelazim was arrested at his home in Cairo late on Saturday night on suspicion of publishing false news and inciting against the state, one source said.\nOnce a deputy telecoms minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Abdelazim was later heavily involved with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s 2014 election campaign where he chaired the youth committee.\nHe later described the experience on his Twitter profile as his “biggest sin.”\nThe interior ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.\nLast week, Egyptian authorities arrested award-winning blogger and journalist Wael Abbas, accusing him of involvement with an illegal organisation and publishing false news.\nAbbas’s arrest followed those of at least three other prominent opposition figures.\nRights groups say Egypt’s human and civil rights record has deteriorated under Sisi, but his supporters say his tough security policy is needed to ensure stability as Egypt recovers from years of political chaos and tackles economic challenges and an Islamist insurgency.\nSisi won a second term in office in a March election that featured only one other candidate - himself an ardent Sisi supporter - after all serious opposition contenders halted their campaigns citing intimidation and several arrests.
