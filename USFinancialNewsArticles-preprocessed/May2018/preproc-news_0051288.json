    "text": "Eddie Bauer and Pacific Sunwear of California are exploring a merger to consolidate their store footprint and weather a prolonged downturn in the U.S. brick-and-mortar retail sector, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nThe two sporty retailers have previously succumbed to bankruptcy and are searching for growth. In a merger, the companies could whittle down their store counts from their current total of nearly 700 together, the sources said.\nEddie Bauer and Pacific Sunwear are controlled by a common owner, private equity firm Golden Gate Capital. Golden Gate Capital has not yet decided whether to combine the two companies and its plans for the retailers could still change, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.\nGolden Gate and Eddie Bauer declined to comment. Pacific Sunwear could not be reached for comment.\nScott Olson | Getty Images Eddie Bauer More than 20 U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers have filed for bankruptcy since mid-2016 as consumers moved a lot of their spending online and sought choice and convenience that is often not offered in physical stores or malls.\nLast year, Bellevue, Washington -based Eddie Bauer hired investment banks to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, sources said at the time.\nEddie Bauer, which sells outdoor gear and apparel, is at risk of not keeping up with fashion changes, according to credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service. It has a $218 million term loan and a $200 million revolving credit line.\nThe company's same-store sales are up 5 percent so far this year, one of the people said.\nGolden Gate acquired Eddie Bauer out of bankruptcy protection in 2009 with a cash bid of $286 million. The retailer had been in bankruptcy five years.\nAnaheim, California-based Pacific Sunwear emerged from bankruptcy in 2016 under the ownership of Golden Gate after the buyout firm converted its debt into equity in the restructuring. It emerged with a $100 million revolving line of credit from Wells Fargo.\nThe retailer has seen store sales rise 9 percent this year, one of the sources said. Both Eddie Bauer and Pacific Sunwear saw a 6 percent increase in same-store sales in 2017, the source added.",
