    "text": "TOKYO, May 30 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices rose across the board on Wednesday as an unfolding political crisis in Italy drove investor demand for safe-haven debt.\nThe five-year JGB yield fell half a basis point to minus 0.125 percent and the 10-year yield was also half a basis point lower at 0.025 percent.\nThe 30-year yield declined 2 basis points to a six-week low of 0.695 percent.\nSuper-long JGBs also drew demand from index-following investors, who tend to extend the duration of their bond portfolios at the turn of each month.\nJapan’s Nikkei fell to a six-week low amid the global market turmoil, supporting JGBs.
