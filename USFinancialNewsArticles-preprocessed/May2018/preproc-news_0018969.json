    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi security forces shot dead a man wanted for an attack which killed four officers at a checkpoint in southwestern Asir province late last month, the Interior Ministry reported on Monday.\nAccording to the announcement carried by state news agency SPA, the man shot, Khaled Mohammed Ali al-Shahri, was surrounded in his family home in the town of al-Wahda on Saturday night but refused to surrender and attacked security forces with a knife.\nThe motive for the April 20 attack he was accused of having committed was not clear. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported at the time that one gunman was killed and two were detained.\nAsir province borders Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is battling the armed Houthi group, but it was not immediately clear if the incident was related to that three-year war.\nReporting by Noah Browning; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
