    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 11:09 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Sealed with a kiss: newlyweds Harry and Meghan process through Windsor Guy Faulconbridge , Michael Holden 7 Min Read\nWINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his American bride Meghan set off on a carriage procession around the town of Windsor after marrying on Saturday in a dazzling ceremony in front of British royalty, celebrities and a global TV audience of millions.\nThe couple kissed on the steps of St George’s Chapel before climbing into a 19th-century open horse-drawn coach for a tour of Windsor, where tens of thousands of cheering well-wishers crammed the streets to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.\nHarry and Meghan were pronounced husband and wife at the chapel in the medieval Windsor Castle by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.\nTheir glittering union brings a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the monarchy, reflected in a ceremony that combined modernity and the ancient rituals of a royal house that traces its line back to 1066.\nMarkle entered the chapel unescorted, dressed in a flowing white wedding gown created by British designer Clare Waight Keller and wearing a veil and diamond tiara.\nPrince Charles, heir to the throne and Harry’s father, accompanied Markle to the altar from the middle of the chapel, with her father too ill to attend.\nHarry, looking nervous, appeared to say: “Thanks Pa” to Charles and “You look amazing!” to his beaming bride. Markle’s mother, Doria Ragland, 61, shed tears. A gospel choir sang American soul singer Ben E. King’s 1960s hit “Stand by me”.\n“There’s power in love,” black U.S. bishop Michael Bruce Curry told a congregation that included Queen Elizabeth, senior royals and celebrities such as U.S. mogul Oprah Winfrey, singer Elton John and former soccer star David Beckham.\n“Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love knows what I mean,” Curry told the congregation in an energetic, passionate address that quoted U.S. civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King.\nThe newlyweds will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, putting them in the senior ranks of British royalty.\nAlongside tradition, there was innovation, by British royal standards. Markle, 36, did not vow to obey her husband; Harry, three years her junior, will wear a wedding ring - unlike other senior male royals.\nThe world’s media have been gripped by the occasion, and television channels beamed the ceremony across the world.

Police armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling streets and watching from rooftops.\nAmong the celebrity guests, American actor George Clooney and his wife Amal were joined by Beckham, his fashion designer wife Victoria and James Corden, British host of the American TV chat show “The Late Late Show”.\nOther guests included tennis ace Serena Williams, the siblings of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana, Elton John, who sang at Diana’s 1997 funeral, British actor Idris Elba, and two of Harry’s ex-girlfriends.\nThe chapel was garlanded with white roses, Diana’s favorite flowers.\n“This is a moment when we can all celebrate the rebirth of the royal family,” said Kenny McKinlay, 60, who had come down from Scotland for the wedding. “It’s a time when all the nation can come together rather than being divided. It’s a day when you can be proud to be British.” Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on the steps of St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding. Saturday May 19, 2018. Ben Birchall/Pool via REUTERS LOVE IN A TENT\nThe royal couple, who met on a blind date in 2016 and fell in love in a tent under the stars in Botswana, tied the knot in a castle that has been home to 39 English monarchs since 1066.\nWith security tight, tens of thousands of visitors had to pass through police search points set up around the castle to cram into Windsor’s narrow roads.\n(Click for a graphic of the wedding tmsnrt.rs/2IhvlgJ )\nMarkle’s own father Thomas Markle, 73, a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the ceremony this week, telling the U.S. celebrity website TMZ he had had heart surgery on Wednesday.\nConfusion over his attendance marred the build-up to the wedding, which had been choreographed for months by royal aides, and his name was still present in the order of service.\nAfter watching the ceremony from California, he told TMZ it had been “emotional and joyful”:\n“My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there and I wish them all my love and all happiness.”\nThe service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor with Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Anglican Church, overseeing the exchange of vows.\nLady Jane Fellowes, Diana’s sister, delivered the reading.\nA reception will be held in the castle’s St George’s Hall before 200 guests join the couple at an evening event at the nearby Frogmore House mansion.\nHarry and Meghan will carry out their first official engagement as husband and wife next week.\nThe British remain broadly supportive of the monarchy, albeit with a sense of mild irony about the pomp and pageantry that accompanies it, though most have deep respect for Queen Elizabeth after her 66 years of service as head of state.\nHarry, along with brother William and his wife Kate, are at the forefront of efforts to modernize the monarchy by talking openly about their feelings.
