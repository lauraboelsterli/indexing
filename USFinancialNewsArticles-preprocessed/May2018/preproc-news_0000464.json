    "text": "Performance Driven by Strength in OEM and International Businesses\nHighlights:\nFirst Quarter 2018 revenue of $69.9 million First quarter EBITDA of $2.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million Completed acquisition of Zyga Technology, a leading spine-focused medical device company\nALACHUA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RTI Surgical, Inc. (Nasdaq:RTIX), a global surgical implant company, reported operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\n“2018 is off to a positive start with the acquisition of Zyga at the very beginning of the year and a solid financial performance this quarter,” said Camille Farhat, chief executive officer. “The continued strength of our OEM and International franchises demonstrates the importance of our overall portfolio toward the achievement of our long-term strategic goals. With our senior team in place for the first full quarter, our strategic transformation is accelerating and we continue to deliver on our commitments.”\nFarhat added, “Thanks to the hard work of numerous people across the Company, we successfully completed the acquisition of Zyga Technology and are well ahead of plan on the integration. The Zyga team hit the ground running, are a strong cultural fit with RTI and have maintained their focus and positive procedural momentum. In addition to differentiated product technology supported by strong clinical evidence, we gained a tremendous team with many individuals taking broader leadership roles at RTI.”\nFirst Quarter 2018\nRTI’s worldwide revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $69.9 million, comparable with the prior year first quarter. First quarter revenues were driven by growth in the OEM and International lines of business, which were partially offset by declines in Sports and Spine and a $3.2 million reduction from the sale of substantially all the assets of the cardiothoracic closure business completed in August 2017. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $33.7 million, or 48.2% of revenues, compared to $35.8 million, or 51.2% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was impacted by an inventory charge of $1.0 million from the write-off of inventory related to our international restructuring and $0.2 million due to the purchase accounting step-up of Zyga inventory.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, RTI incurred non-recurring pre-tax charges to support the ongoing strategic transformation of the business. The company incurred $0.9 million in severance and restructuring charges primarily in support of initiatives to reduce the complexity of its international organizational structure; $0.1 million related to asset impairment and abandonments of certain long-term assets as part of efforts to reduce complexity and improve operational excellence; and $0.8 million in expenses related to the January 2018 acquisition of Zyga Technology to support the acceleration of growth. During the first quarter of 2017, the company incurred $4.4 million of non-recurring pre-tax charges.\nNet loss applicable to common shares was $1.9 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted common share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $2.8 million, or $0.05 per fully diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017. As outlined in the reconciliation tables that follow, excluding the impact of the various non-recurring charges, adjusted net income applicable to common shares was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per fully diluted common share in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.8 million, or 11% of revenues compared with $6.5 million, or 9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by the reduction in operating expenses associated with efforts to reduce complexity and increase operational excellence implemented during 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nBased on our recent financial results and current business outlook, the Company is reiterating financial guidance for 2018, originally issued on January 5, 2018:\nThe Company expects full year revenues in the range of $280 million and $290 million. The Company expects full year Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $32 million to $38 million.\nFarhat explained, “As we continue to reduce the complexity of our operations, we remain committed to evaluating our portfolio and exploring partnership opportunities with organizations that are well positioned to be better stewards of selected assets. Our efforts to drive operational excellence focus on implementing lean manufacturing across facilities, as we continue to strengthen the organization and invest in the company. With our senior team in place and now operating efficiently, I am shifting more of my energy towards accelerating growth, by starting to rebuild the R&D pipeline and actively seeking attractive M&A opportunities at logical valuations.”\nThe Company noted the following assumptions are included in its guidance:\nRelatively stable market conditions and regulatory environment; Positive revenue contribution from the acquisition of Zyga Technology – announced January 4, 2018; Ongoing positive impact of efforts to reduce complexity and implement operational excellence; and Continued marketing of map3® cellular allogeneic bone graft and minimal negative revenue impact related to recent FDA warning letter.\nConference Call\nRTI will host a conference call and audio webcast at 9:00 a.m. ET today.

Amount Per Diluted Share may not foot due to rounding. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share - Diluted. The calculation of the tax effect on the adjustments between GAAP net loss applicable to common shares and non-GAAP net income applicable to common shares is based upon our estimated annual GAAP tax rate, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP net loss applicable to common shares in calculating Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares-Diluted. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the tables listed above.\nThe following is an explanation of the adjustments that management excluded as part of adjusted measures for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as the reason for excluding the individual items:\nSeverance and restructuring costs – This adjustment represents costs relating to the reduction of our organizational structure. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.\nAcquisition and integration expenses – This adjustment represents charges relating to acquisition and integration expenses due to the purchase of Zyga. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.\nInventory purchase price adjustment – This adjustment represents the purchase price effects of acquired Zyga inventory that was sold during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.\nInventory obsolescence charge – This adjustment represents charges relating to inventory obsolescence due to the rationalization of our international distribution infrastructure. Management removes the amount of these costs from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance.\nMaterial Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share - Diluted should not be considered in isolation, or as a replacement for GAAP measures.\nUsefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors\nThe Company believes that presenting EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share - Diluted in addition to the related GAAP measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial decision-making. The Company further believes that providing this information better enables the Company’s investors to understand the Company’s overall core performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to assess and measure such performance.\nRTI SURGICAL, INC.
