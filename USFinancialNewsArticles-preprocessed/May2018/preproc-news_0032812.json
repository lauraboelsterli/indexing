FILE PHOTO: A container ship is seen at the shipping terminal Eurokai in the Port of Hamburg, Germany November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\nExports of goods from the 19-country bloc fell by 2.9 percent, while imports were 2.5 percent lower than a year ago, the European Union statistics agency Eurostat said on Friday.\nThe World Trade Organization said on Thursday that trade tensions may be starting to hold back global merchandise trade, as it published an outlook indicator showing growth was above trend this quarter but slowing down.\nThe euro zoneâ€™s trade surplus was 26.9 billion euros (23.5 billion pounds) in March, compared with 18.9 billion euros in February and 28.5 billion euros in March 2017.\nAdjusted to take into account seasonal effects, exports were up 0.8 percent month-on-month, while imports were 0.7 percent higher. However, both seasonally adjusted exports and imports in March were below the levels of November, December and January. Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop",
