    "text": "Phoenix, AZ, May 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- No Borders, Inc. (NBDR) through its wholly-owned subsidiary Lannister Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), announces that it is commencing the filing of its pre-merger financials with OTC Markets today, and that the Company will begin work on corporate actions with the State of Nevada & FINRA in order to institute Name and Ticker Symbol Changes.\nJoseph Snyder, President and CEO of NBDR, commented that: “Getting to this day has taken more time, effort and capital than we originally anticipated, and we are very happy to begin uploading the financials on the OTC Markets today! We have an aggressive internal schedule of filing the remaining pieces as well as the required legal opinions in rapid succession as we take steps on our journey of not only removing the OTC stop sign, but also having these past two years of financials audited to achieve our goal of being a fully SEC reporting company and up-listing on the OTC Markets. We are immensely grateful for all of the effort and work that our financial and legal teams have put in to get us to this day, additionally the effort and time from the previous company management was vital to our being able to complete these pieces. At this time, we are comfortable announcing that we do intend to apply for a Name Change and Ticker Symbol Change with the State of Nevada and FINRA, to some extent we do not control the outcome of these efforts, but we believe we have done the proper steps to be successful barring any unknown issues that may arise. Through all these changes we hope to be able to keep on growing our company and to create strong shareholder value.”\nInitial Batch Of Financial Filings\nThese initial filings cover the year of 2015 and the first Quarter of 2016 of the pre-merger financials of No Borders, Inc. Subsequent quarters through 2016, 2017 & 1st Qtr 2018 as well as the post-merger financials for Lannister Holdings, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of No Borders, Inc. are being compiled and prepared at this time and will be uploaded along with relevant legal filings as soon as feasible. The company maintains a strategic focus on maintaining current, audited financials in the future with a goal of up listing on the OTC Market and becoming a fully reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as expediently as possible.\nName & Symbol Update\nNo Borders, Inc. intends to begin the process of applying with the State of Nevada and FINRA to change the company name from “No Borders, Inc.” to “Lannister Holdings, Inc.” as soon as the company is current with OTC Markets as well as requesting a Ticker Symbol change from “NBDR” to one of several Symbol options of which “LANN” and “LNHD” are both under consideration along with several other options should those be unavailable for any reason.\nTradename; Lannister Development\nAs previously disclosed, Lannister Holdings, Inc. an Arizona Corporation has been approved to use the Trade Name “Lannister Development” for the company’s client facing blockchain and software development/consulting divisions. The company’s goal, once and if the aforementioned name change with the State of Nevada and FINRA is approved will be to update the name of “Lannister Holdings, Inc.” in Arizona to “Lannister Development, Inc.” The company intends to maintain operations through our Arizona subsidiaries and maintain a corporate and community identity as “Based in Phoenix Arizona” for the foreseeable future. The company strives to maintain a strong community, political and physical presence in the State of Arizona due to the strong legislative support of emerging technologies and blockchain specifically in the State of Arizona.\nContact: Morissa Schwartz – Public Relations\nEmail: contact@LannisterHoldings.com\nWebsite: www.LannisterHoldings.com\nForward-Looking Statement\nThis press release may include forward-looking information based on current expectations.
