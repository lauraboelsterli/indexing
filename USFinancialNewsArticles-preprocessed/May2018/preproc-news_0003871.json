    "text": "WASHINGTON, Geeks Without Frontiers (GEEKS), an award-winning Non Governmental Organization (NGO) focused on addressing global connectivity challenges with a view to closing the Digital Divide and facilitating the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is delighted to announce the appointment of David Hartshorn as Chief Executive Officer with effect from July 1, 2018.\nGeeks Without Frontiers (GEEKS) names David Hartshorn as CEO\nMr. Hartshorn, who will be supported by Angie Mar in her new role as GEEKS’ International Program Director, brings more than 25 years of experience tackling global communications issues including helping to build and lead the Global VSAT Forum (GVF), an international association focused on all aspects of improving access to satellite-based connectivity.\nGEEKS co-founder Michael Potter said, “GEEKS has achieved a lot in the last three years with the launch of its Model Law on DigOnce! , the success of its Community Connect initiative and GEEKS’ appointment to a working group of the Federal Communications Commission’s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee (a new body focused on accelerating the deployment of broadband Internet access in the USA). We have ambitious plans for the future, and David and Angie’s skills and experience will enable us to accelerate our connectivity programs.”\n“Since GEEKS’ inception, I have admired the Founders’ vision and the strategic approach of the team and their advisors,” Mr. Hartshorn said. “I’m honored to have the opportunity, at this moment in history, to pursue the organization’s goal of positively impacting the lives of a billion people through the innovative use of technology, connectivity and sustainable social enterprise models. In addition to helping to expand and accelerate the rollout of GEEKS’ current initiatives, I look forward to establishing a global community and platform to help close the digital divide by bringing communications-enabled health, education, security and other solutions to unserved and underserved global communities.”\nGEEKS’ co-founder John Morris said, “David has extensive experience of the satellite eco system, the broader communications sector and the global NGO community and this, together with Angie’s international experience at Intelsat and GVF, will help GEEKS to build on its previous successes and to move forward at a faster and more informed rate.”\nGEEKS’ co-founder Chris Stott said, “In recognizing the vital role of broadband in building and transforming economies and societies and achieving the SDGs, governments are increasingly willing to collaborate and work in innovative ways with the private sector. The GEEKS team is committed to working together with all stakeholders who have a shared interest in achieving a more connected and inclusive world.”\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/72c0d297-3223-4fbc-b832-0850952cfb44\nAbout Geeks Without Frontiers\nThe GEEKS’ goal is to positively impact the lives of a billion people through the innovative use of technology, connectivity and sustainable social enterprise models.\nGEEKS’ annual “Connectivity is the Revolution!” conference will be held on Friday, October 19, 2018 in Washington D.C.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GeeksWF #Internet4all #ConnectivityWeek #ConnectivitytheRevolution\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GeeksWithoutFrontiers/\nLinkedIN: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6942010\nWeb: www.GeeksWF.org\nContact: info@GeeksWF.org\nSource: Geeks Without Frontiers",
