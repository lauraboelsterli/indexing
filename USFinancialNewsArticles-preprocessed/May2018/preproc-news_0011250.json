Futures for the Nasdaq tech benchmark were half a percent higher.\nTech gains were less marked in Asia, where markets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all closed weaker. Campling said the Apple results had raised some “red flags”, including high inventory levels and a lower average selling price for its handsets.\n“It’s a strange thing to do, to increase inventory so sharply. There will be more questions about ‘where do we go from here’,” he said.\nThat uncertainty about future profits, alongside the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates, is weighing on other sectors too, even though S&P500 companies posted 10 percent earnings growth in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.\nOil and metals prices near multi-year highs are a major concern, leaving market players wondering if “perhaps this is as good as it’s going to get,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.\nFED U.S. 10-year yields hovered just below recent four-year highs above 3 percent. German yields, dragged to six-week highs by the U.S. bond selloff, stood just below those levels.\nThe Fed is likely to announce at 1800 GMT that it is holding interest rates steady. But it will probably encourage expectations of a rate increase in June.\nThose expectations were strengthened after a survey on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures were building .\nA hawkish-sounding Fed could further boost the dollar, which has roared higher in recent weeks erasing its year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. The gains came amid signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise rates in the coming months.\n“It is this concern around inflation and the robustness of the U.S. economy that is likely to dominate when the Fed concludes its meeting,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n“It will offer policymakers a decent opportunity to critique the health of the U.S. economy.”\nIn contrast to the United States, rate rise expectations elsewhere have receded after disappointing economic data.\nExpectations of a Bank of England rate rise this month have virtually been priced out. The European Central Bank and central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have all hinted that policy tightening remains some way off.\nFresh data confirmed that expectation for the euro zone, showing first-quarter growth at 0.4 percent, below the 0.7 percent quarterly increases seen in the past three quarters . HSBC analysts said the data showed the euro zone was experiencing “a slowdown not a slump” but they added that with inflation staying weak, “there is every reason for the ECB to maintain a dovish stance for the time being”.\nThe euro was flat, staying just off 3 1/2-year lows hit to the dollar on Tuesday.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in Singapore, Helen Reid and Dhara Ranasinghe in London; Editing by Larry King\n ",
