The decline accelerated after the North Korea-U.S. summit cancellation.\nShares of European and Asian automakers skidded on the possibility of import tariffs, while U.S. automakers gained.\nFord was up 1.3 percent and General Motors gained 0.8 percent. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat fell 2.3 percent, while those of Ferrari dipped 0.6 percent.\nEnergy stocks declined as oil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks on rising expectations that OPEC could wind down an output deal that has been in place since the start of 2017 due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran.\nFinancials stocks dropped after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting tempered expectations of faster interest rate hikes.\nBest Buy Co tumbled 6.3 percent as investors focused on slowing online sales growth over the better-than-expected quarterly comparable sales.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 23 new lows.
