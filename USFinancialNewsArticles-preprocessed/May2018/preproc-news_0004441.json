    "text": "10 COMMENTS Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.43% said more than one million small businesses in the U.S. sell their wares on its online marketplace, providing the number for the first time amid criticism from some politicians over its business practices and economic impact.\nThe Seattle-based retailer has previously said that it had more than two million total third-party sellers world-wide, but hadn’t given a breakdown in the U.S. In its release on Thursday, it also listed the number of smaller merchants by state, saying California had the most with more than 175,000, followed by New York with more than 81,000, and Florida with more than 75,000.\nAmazon said it based its count on a U.S. Small Business Administration guideline of having $7.5 million or less in annual revenue. It said it issued the figures timed to National Small Business Week.\nThe disclosure comes as the retail giant and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, have drawn increased scrutiny in recent weeks, including tweets by President Donald Trump criticizing Amazon for its impact on traditional retailers and tax issues . Amazon’s rapid growth—it is now the second-largest company by market value behind Apple Inc. —also has made it a target for people worried about the technology industry’s outsize clout.\nRelated Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Amazon has parried such criticism with other announcements to draw attention to its contributions to the U.S. economy, such as its declaration last year that it planned to create more than 130,000 full- and part-time jobs .\nAmazon relies on independent merchants to generate more than half of all units sold on its site. Those sales are frequently more profitable for Amazon than sales of items from its own inventory, and help it avoid inventory risk.\nThose sellers also have also drawn more scrutiny recently, as states seek to ensure they are paying sales tax . A case to decide whether to update federal law on the matter recently went before the Supreme Court.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com",
