Thank God I saved him.”\nMacron congratulated Gassama for “an exceptional act” and said France would give him a job in the emergency services.\n“We’ll obviously be setting all your papers straight and if you wish it, we will start the process of naturalization so that you can become French,” he added.\nGassama told Macron he tried to cross the Mediterranean in March 2014 to reach Italy, but was caught by police.\nEurope has faced a migrant crisis since 2015 following wars in Libya and Syria and more than 1 million people from Africa and the Middle East have tried to reach the continent via Turkey or by sea.\nMacron’s government has said it wants to be both firm and fair on immigration but it took a tougher stance lately, with parliament approving a bill that tightens asylum rules.\n“What you have done corresponds with what firefighters do; if this fits your wishes, you could join the firefighters’ corps so that you can do (such acts) on a daily basis,” he said.\nGassama told Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo by phone on Sunday he arrived from Mali a few months ago and wished to stay in France.\n“I replied that his heroic gesture was an example for all citizens and that the City of Paris will obviously be keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France,” Hidalgo said.\nThe boy’s father was arrested and told police he had left his son alone to go shopping and returned home later than planned because he was playing Pokemon Go, an enhanced reality game, on his smartphone.\n“His behaviour constitutes an offence, failing to honour parental responsibilities, which carries a possible sentence of two years in jail,” Molins said.\nGassama is being offered a spell of community service work at the Paris emergency services. An official website says the work pays about 480 euros ($557.76)a month for a fixed 11-month period. ($1 = 0.8606 euros) (Reporting by Bate Felix, Michel Rose; Marine Pennetier and Julie Carriat; Writing by Mathieu Rosemain and Brian Love Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n ",
