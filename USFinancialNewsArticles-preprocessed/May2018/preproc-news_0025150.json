Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses the Parliament for the first time since his reelection in Budapest, Hungary, May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\nOrban, a maverick anti-immigration nationalist, won re-election for a third straight four-year term last month and is already the longest-serving premier in Hungary’s post-Communist history. Related Coverage Hungary PM Orban sets out conservative vision at start of new four-year term\nHis populist rhetoric and strong criticism of EU policies have put Orban at odds with older, western members of the bloc but won him a landslide victory at home, as his nationalist line proved popular with voters.

As a first step it must change its thinking about migration.”\nOrban also said the era of liberal democracy had ended.\n“We have replaced a shipwrecked liberal democracy with a 21st-century Christian democracy, which guarantees people’s freedom, security,” Orban, in power since 2010, told parliament.\n“It supports the traditional family model of one man and one woman, keeps anti-Semitism at bay, and gives a chance for growth,” he added.\nOrban also outlined broad plans for the next 12 years entailing rapid economic and social progress under a conservative ideology.
