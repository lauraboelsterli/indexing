Akle, 43, who was Unaoil’s territory manager for Iraq, was charged with one offence, the SFO said.\nAkle and Al Jarah have been told to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 23.\nAkle and Jarah were charged in November by requisition with conspiracy to make corrupt payments to secure contracts in Iraq to Unaoil’s client SBM Offshore between June 2005 and August 2011.\nUnaoil did not respond to an immediate request for comment.
