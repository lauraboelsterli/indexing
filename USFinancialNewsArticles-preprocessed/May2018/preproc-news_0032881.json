    "text": "(Reuters) - A judge sided on Thursday with Shari Redstone in her battle to retain control over CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) and dealt a setback to the U.S. media company’s plans to strip her voting power.\nChancellor Andre Bouchard, the judge on Delaware’s Court of Chancery, denied a request by CBS for a temporary restraining to bar Redstone from amending bylaws or sacking directors ahead of a board meeting at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday.\nAt that meeting the CBS board will consider issuing a special dividend that would dilute Redstone’s vote to 17 percent, from 80 percent, an act of defiance aimed at preventing a merger with sister company, Viacom Inc ( VIAB.O ).\nFears that Redstone would replace CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves sent CBS shares down as much as 6 percent after the ruling.\nIt was unclear which bylaws would govern the meeting scheduled to take place at CBS’ offices in New York City with Redstone in attendance, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nOn Wednesday, Redstone used her control to amend CBS’s bylaws to require a supermajority, or 90 percent, of directors to approve the issuance of a special dividend, essentially allowing her to block the move.\nCBS plans to challenge that in court, two other sources told Reuters on Thursday, and Bouchard said in his ruling he could set aside Redstone’s bylaw amendments if CBS shows they are invalid or unfair.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “The ruling clearly recognizes that we may bring further legal action to challenge any actions by NAI that we consider to be unlawful,” CBS said in a statement.\nThe Redstone family controls both CBS and Viacom through the National Amusements Inc (NAI) movie theater company and has said it wants to merge them if both companies support the deal. NAI welcomed Thursday’s ruling, and said CBS’ special committee had breached its fiduciary obligations to CBS shareholders.\nBouchard said he denied the temporary restraining order because any action that Redstone takes will be subject to his review and “extensive power” to correct. He said CBS had already shown it had a non-frivolous claim against Redstone for a breach of fiduciary duty for her alleged interference with CBS.\nA lawyer for National Amusements dismissed the allegations against Redstone in court on Wednesday.\nThe fast-moving battle for control of the CBS boardroom was put in motion on Sunday, when CBS’s special committee determined the merger with Viacom long-favored by Shari Redstone was not in the interest of CBS shareholders.\nNational Amusements believes a deal is needed for the two media companies to gain scale and compete with the likes of video-streaming company Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ).\nShares of CBS ended down 4.1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.61 while shares of Viacom slipped 0.4 percent to $28.16 on Nasdaq.\nReporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown\n ",
