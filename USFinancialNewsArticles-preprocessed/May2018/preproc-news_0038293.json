    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: CLMT) (the \"Partnership,\" \"Calumet,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\"), a leading independent producer of specialty hydrocarbon and fuel products, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Dollars in millions, except per unit data)\nNet loss\n$\n(4.8)\n$\n(6.2)\nLimited partners' interest basic and diluted net loss per unit\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n(0.08)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n75.0\n$\n78.7\nThe Partnership's $4.8 million net loss and $75.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2018 included, but were not limited to, the following: a $3.1 million favorable lower of cost or market (\"LCM\") inventory adjustment; $3.7 million of expense related to enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system costs; $2.1 million of realized hedging losses; and $4.0 million in acquisition costs. Excluding these impacts, Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 would have been $81.7 million.\nFor detailed information on Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented above, please see the sections of this release entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Net Loss To EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow.\"\nManagement Commentary\n\"I am pleased to report that Calumet has delivered another solid quarter of results,\" said Tim Go, Chief Executive Officer of Calumet. \"Continued strength in our Branded Products division, coupled with solid execution against our self-help initiatives, have allowed Calumet to continue the positive momentum we established over the last six quarters. Adjusting for divestitures from our portfolio, our first quarter results represent a significant improvement to the first quarter last year. Further, we were able to increase our gross profit per barrel in both our specialty and fuels segments, despite heavy turnaround and maintenance activity at a few of our facilities and the continued upward trajectory of crude prices.\"\nGo concluded, \"We remain intently focused on progressing our strategic priorities this year. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce leverage on our balance sheet, enhance our cash flows, and position Calumet for continued sustainable growth. We strengthened our balance sheet by completing the early redemption of our high interest senior secured notes and by extending our corporate revolving credit facility another five years. In addition, we partnered with The Heritage Group to make a commitment to renewable base oil technology through the acquisition of Biosynthetic Technologies, LLC, which is representative of our long-term vision of producing innovative value-enhancing specialty products for our customers. The partners intend to explore a range of alternatives to maximize the value of the acquired estolides technology. This could include internal or external licensing or the sale of the technology for applications across a diverse portfolio of products and solutions in a variety of end-markets. One of the first potential uses of this proprietary technology is commercial production of renewable esters at our Missouri plant. In summary, we look forward to building on the momentum we created, as we continue to transform our specialty products business.\"\nSpecialty Products Segment | Results Summary\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Dollars in millions, except per barrel data)\nSpecialty products segment gross profit\n$\n69.6\n$\n82.3\nSpecialty products segment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n37.7\n$\n45.6\nSpecialty products segment gross profit per barrel\n$\n33.11\n$\n31.85\nSpecialty products TTM Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n13.9\n%\n13.7\n%\nThe specialty products segment gross profit of $69.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $37.7 million were down compared to $82.3 million and $45.6 million in the year-ago period, respectively. This includes the impact of turnaround and maintenance activity at the Shreveport facility and $4.0 million in acquisition-related costs. Specialty products segment gross profit per barrel of $33.11 increased approximately 4% compared to $31.85 in the year-ago period, driven in part by the growing contribution from the higher-margin Branded Products division and despite the over 21% rise in the price of crude oil year-over-year. Inclusive of the $4.0 million acquisition related costs, negative impacts of higher crude prices and lower volumes due to downtime at Shreveport, the specialty segment trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA Margin results of 13.9% improved compared to 13.7% one year ago.\nFuel Products Segment | Results Summary\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Dollars in millions, except per barrel data)\nFuel products segment gross profit\n$\n43.6\n$\n47.2\nFuel products segment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n38.7\n$\n36.8\nFuel products segment gross profit per barrel\n$\n7.49\n$\n5.19\nFuel products segment gross profit of $43.6 million declined year-over-year, but Adjusted EBITDA of $38.7 million increased over 5% compared to the reported figures from the year-ago period despite the divestiture of the Superior refinery that took place in fourth quarter 2017, as well as turnaround and maintenance activity at both the Great Falls and Shreveport facilities. Notwithstanding, the heavy downtime and maintenance activity during the quarter, gross profit per barrel of $7.49 marked an improvement of approximately 44% relative to the year-ago results, benefiting from the 14% improvement in the benchmark Gulf Coast 211 crack spread, and the widening WTI/WCS crude differentials, partially offset by realized hedging losses of $2.1 million. First quarter results also include benefits related to lower the Partnership's Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") market prices and a reduction in our 2017 RINs obligation.\nPartnership Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Partnership had total liquidity of $458.4 million, comprised of $146.6 million of unrestricted cash and availability under the revolving credit facility of $311.8 million. As of March 31, 2018, Calumet had a $351.4 million borrowing base, $39.6 million in outstanding standby letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings. The Partnership believes it will continue to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity and other means by which to meet its financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures.\nFinancial Guidance\nFull-Year 2018 Capital Spending Forecast\nThrough the first quarter of 2018, total capital spending was $22.5 million, primarily related to maintenance and turnaround activity. For the full-year 2018, the Partnership continues to anticipate total capital expenditures to come within range of its previously stated annual guidance of $80 to $90 million.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Timing Expectations\nWest Griffin, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of Calumet, concluded, \"We continue to make good progress in addressing our ERP issues. The reduced spend from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $3.7 million this quarter reflects the reduction in the amount of effort to process items in the system. While our front-end processes are no longer a hindrance to the business, the residual effects from the issues we encountered in going live on the system are still being dealt with in the back office, resulting in delays in our filings. That said, we are cautiously optimistic that these effects should largely be resolved by the end of June. While we cannot assure that we will file within the normal timeline, we are very encouraged by the progress made to date. Regarding our second quarter filing expectations, we plan to issue our earnings release concurrent with the filing of the fiscal second quarter 10-Q deadline. As always, our first priority is maintaining the integrity of our numbers; secondarily we will prioritize the timely reporting of our results within SEC guidelines. We continue to work closely with our implementation partner to capture the system's full benefits and enable us to capitalize on new categories of self-help, including opportunities to optimize transportation and procurement, improve sales and optimize product mix.\"\n2018 Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") Compliance Impact Forecast\nThe Partnership records its outstanding RINs obligation as a balance sheet liability. This liability is marked-to-market on a quarterly basis to reflect the market price of RINs on the last day of each quarter. The Partnership expects its gross estimated annual RINs obligation, which includes RINs that are required to be secured through either blending or through the purchase of RINs in the open market, will be up to 85 million RINs for the full-year 2018, excluding the potential for any hardship waivers that may or may not be granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") to any of the Partnership's fuel refineries at a later time, and excluding the impact of the Superior refinery divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017. Calumet expects to be able to satisfy a portion of its 2018 gross RINs obligation through internal blending efforts.\nOperations Summary\nThe following table sets forth information about the Partnership's combined operations from continuing operations. Facility production volume differs from sales volume due to changes in inventories and the sale of purchased fuel product blendstocks such as ethanol and biodiesel and the resale of crude oil in the Partnership's fuel products segment.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In bpd)\nTotal sales volume (1)\n88,033\n129,856\nTotal feedstock runs (2)\n84,492\n132,165\nFacility production: (3)\nSpecialty products:\nLubricating oils\n10,031\n15,160\nSolvents\n7,984\n7,345\nWaxes\n1,239\n1,477\nPackaged and synthetic specialty products (4)\n2,438\n2,566\nOther\n1,706\n2,048\nTotal\n23,398\n28,596\nFuel products:\nGasoline\n17,848\n37,568\nDiesel\n23,049\n33,011\nJet fuel\n3,747\n6,763\nAsphalt, heavy fuel oils and other\n16,929\n29,413\nTotal\n61,573\n106,755\nTotal facility production (3)\n84,971\n135,351\n(1)\nTotal sales volume includes sales from the production at the Partnership's facilities and certain third-party facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements, sales of inventories and the resale of crude oil to third-party customers. Total sales volume includes the sale of purchased fuel product blendstocks, such as ethanol and biodiesel, as components of finished fuel products in the Partnership's fuel products segment sales.\nThe decrease in total sales volume for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, is due primarily to the divestiture of the Superior Refinery in November 2017, turnaround activities at the Shreveport refinery and certain third-party processing facilities and maintenance activities.\n(2)\nTotal feedstock runs represent the barrels per day (\"bpd\") of crude oil and other feedstocks processed at the Partnership's facilities and at certain third-party facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements.\nThe decrease in total feedstock runs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, is due primarily to the divestiture of the Superior refinery in November 2017, turnaround activities at the Shreveport refinery and certain third-party processing facilities and maintenance activities.\n(3)\nTotal facility production represents the bpd of specialty products and fuel products yielded from processing crude oil and other feedstocks at the Partnership's facilities and at certain third-party facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements. The difference between total facility production and total feedstock runs is primarily a result of the time lag between the input of feedstocks and production of finished products and volume loss.\nThe change in total facility production for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, is due primarily to the operational items discussed above in footnote 2.\n(4)\nRepresents production of branded and packaged specialty products including the products from the Royal Purple, Bel-Ray and Calumet Packaging facilities.\nDerivatives Summary\nThe following table summarizes the derivative activity reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In millions)\nRealized loss on derivative instruments\n$\n(2.1)\n$\n(4.9)\nUnrealized gain on derivative instruments\n2.0\n10.6\nTotal derivative gain (loss) reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations\n$\n(0.1)\n$\n5.7\nTotal loss on commodity derivative settlements\n$\n(2.1)\n$\n(4.9)\nWebcast Information\nA conference call is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. ET on May 16, 2018 to discuss the financial and operational results for the first quarter 2018.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe include in this press release the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We provide reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net loss, our most directly comparable financial performance measure. We also provide a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to Net cash used in operating activities, our most directly comparable liquidity measure. Both Net loss and Net cash used in operating activities are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess:\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness; our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to analysts and investors as they exclude transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze our ability to pay distributions and interest costs. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully analyze trends and performance of our core cash operations.\nWe define EBITDA for any period as net income (loss) plus interest expense (including debt issuance costs), income taxes and depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA for any period as: (1) net income (loss); plus (2)(a) interest expense (including debt issuance and extinguishment costs); (b) income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) impairment; (e) unrealized losses from mark-to-market accounting for hedging activities; (f) realized gains under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss); (g) non-cash equity-based compensation expense and other non-cash items (excluding items such as accruals of cash expenses in a future period or amortization of a prepaid cash expense) that were deducted in computing net income (loss); (h) debt refinancing fees, premiums and penalties; (i) any net loss realized in connection with an asset sale that was deducted in computing net income (loss) and (j) all extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain or loss, or revenue or expense; minus (3)(a) unrealized gains from mark-to-market accounting for hedging activities; (b) realized losses under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss) and (c) other non-recurring expenses and unrealized items that reduced net income (loss) for a prior period, but represent a cash item in the current period.\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow for any period as Adjusted EBITDA less replacement and environmental capital expenditures, turnaround costs, cash interest expense (consolidated interest expense less non-cash interest expense), income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates, net of cash distributions and income tax expense (benefit).\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nThe definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow that are presented in this release are consistent with the calculation of \"Consolidated Cash Flow\" contained in the indentures governing our 7.625% senior notes due January 15, 2022, that were issued in November 2013 (the \"2022 Notes\"), our 6.50% senior notes due April 15, 2021, that were issued in March 2014 (the \"2021 Notes\") and our 7.75% senior notes due April 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"), that were issued in March 2015. We are required to report Consolidated Cash Flow to the holders of our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes and Adjusted EBITDA to the lenders under our revolving credit facility, and these measures are used by them to determine our compliance with certain covenants governing those debt instruments. Please see our filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional details regarding the covenants governing our debt instruments.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to Net loss, Operating income, Net cash used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measurements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are only three of several measurements that management utilizes. Moreover, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow in the same manner. The following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net loss, our most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, and Distributable Cash Flow to Net cash used in operating activities, our most directly comparable GAAP liquidity measure, for each of the periods indicated.\nCALUMET SPECIALTY PRODUCTS PARTNERS, L.P.\nUNAUDITED
