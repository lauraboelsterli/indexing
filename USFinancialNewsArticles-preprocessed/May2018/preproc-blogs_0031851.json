Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nThe Canary Wharf financial district in London is shown in November 2017. Reuters\nGood morning. An attempt by the man who runs Barclays PLC to unmask a whistleblower will cost him the equivalent of $1.5 million in penalties and foregone pay, The Journal’s Max Colchester reports . U.K. regulators found Friday that Chief Executive Jes Staley made a “serious error of judgement,” in trying to identify the author of a letter criticizing a hire Barclays made. The report ends a year-long probe.\nBoards need to be aware they have to pay attention to the risk of C-suite misconduct, said Scott Killingsworth, a compliance attorney. “Nobody else controls the C-suite,” he said. “The board has got to do it; it’s a nondelegable duty. Those are the people that avoid all other controls, they don’t report to anybody.”\nThe Barclays case likely won’t lead to legal changes in whistleblower protections but it still will make a difference, Mr. Killingsworth said. “A lot of people have read these headlines and seen what can happen to you if try to interfere in the whistleblower process,” he said. “This is consciousness-raising.”\nBarclays conducted an internal review of its systems after the whistleblowing affair became public, said a person familiar with the matter. That resulted in additional training for staff and changes in procedure to keep letters from whistleblowers from being shared among multiple executives, as happened in the Staley matter, the person said.\nBarclays’s board said it was pleased U.K. regulators have finished investigating; Mr. Staley said it was inappropriate for him to have been personally involved in the matter. A probe by New York state’s financial-services regulator continues.\nOther companies should take action as well, said Shiva Rajgopal, an accounting professor at the Columbia Business School who looks at areas such as corporate governance, culture, bank boards and whistleblowers. “Boards need to go back and check” how such issues are handled, he said. “Boards need to order an audit looking at what is the process of dealing with whistleblower complaints.”\nA proper audit would look at what channels are available to whistleblowers, whether enough complaints are coming in and who deals with issues raised, Mr. Rajgopal said.\nIt would make sure a third party, such as a board committee, provides a cross-check on how allegations are handled. Ideally, a company would consider reporting data to regulators, either confidentially or publicly, on how its complaints system is functioning, he said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nRussia remains key sanctions risk. The risk of breaching Russian sanctions remains a top concern for European banks, corporations and wealthy individuals despite market tensions surrounding the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal, sanctions experts said Friday.\nCOMPLIANCE\nTrump gives a lifeline to ZTE. President Donald Trump said he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to keep ZTE Corp. in business. The Chinese telecommunication giant has been laid low by an order banning U.S. companies from selling components to the Chinese business, the WSJ reports Mr. Trump in a tweet Sunday said he is working with Chinese President Xi to keep ZTE in business.

U.S. national security adviser John Bolton warned Sunday that the U.S. is prepared to impose sanctions on European companies if their governments don’t heed President Donald Trump’s demand to stop dealing with Iran, the WSJ reports.\nU.S., U.A.E. reach air-travel deal. A deal to be unveiled Monday commits Dubai-based Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi to improve financial disclosures and avoid cross-subsidization by government-owned service suppliers. It falls short of demands by U.S. carriers to curb the expansion of the state airlines, the WSJ reports.\nWHO presses against trans fats.

Xerox said it will back out of its merger deal with Fujifilm Holdings as it reached a new settlement with two of its biggest shareholders, activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, the latest twist in a monthslong tug of war over the future of the iconic American company, the WSJ reports.\nREPUTATION\nAirAsia chief apologizes for election video.

A court on the Dutch island of Curaçao has authorized a unit of U.S. oil giant ConocoPhillips to seize $636 million of assets held there by Petróleos de Venezuela SA . Conoco is seeking to recover $2 billion in a dispute over the expropriation of its Venezuelan oil projects by the nation’s socialist government, the AP reports,\nNRA sues New York state. The National Rifle Association on Friday sued New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and financial regulators, accusing the state of an unconstitutional “political blacklisting campaign” to stop banks and insurers from doing business with the group, the WSJ reports.
