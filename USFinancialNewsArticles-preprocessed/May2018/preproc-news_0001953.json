(“Costamare” or the “Company”) (NYSE:CMRE) today reported unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted Net Income available to common stockholders of $13.4 million or $0.12 per share for the three-months ended March 31, 2018. Acquired two 2008-built 1,300 TEU sister containerships, Michigan and Trader , on April 12, 2018 and April 18, 2018, respectively. Accepted delivery on April 27, 2018 of the 3,800 TEU containership Polar Brasil ( ex Hull No. YZJ2015-1207 ). The vessel, upon its delivery, commenced its seven-year charter with Maersk Line.

Declared dividend of $0.10 per share on our common stock and dividends on all four classes of our preferred stock.\nSee “Financial Summary” and “Non-GAAP Measures” below for additional detail\nNew Business Developments\nA. New acquisitions\nOn April 12, 2018 and April 18, 2018 we acquired two 2008-built 1,300 TEU sister containerships, Michigan and Trader, respectively. Both acquisitions were funded with available cash.\nB. Newbuild vessel deliveries\nOn April 27, 2018, we accepted delivery of the 3,800 TEU containership Polar Brasil (ex Hull No. YZJ2015-1207) , which was acquired pursuant to our joint venture with York Capital Management. The vessel commenced its seven-year charter with Maersk Line. Costamare holds a 49% interest in the entity that owns the vessel. The vessel’s acquisition has been funded with debt and equity.\nC.

The new facility matures in June 2021 and has a balloon payment at expiry of $88.0 million. The new amortization schedule and the terms of the new facility result in lower projected debt service repayments and improved liquidity of about $65.0 million until its maturity.\nIn February 2018, we extended the maturity of the credit facility (original balloon payment of $13.1m) for Niledutch Panther until February 2019.\nD.

Upon delivery the vessel commenced its seven-year time charter to Maersk Line.\nIn April we acquired the 2008-built 1,300 TEU sister containerships, Michigan and Trader .

Insiders have decided, as has been the case since June 2016, to reinvest in full their cash dividends in new shares.”\nFinancial Summary\nThree-months ended\nMarch 31,\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data): 2017 2018 Voyage revenue $ 105,524 $ 92,754 Accrued charter revenue (1) $ (2,791 ) $ (2,564 ) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (2) $ 102,733 $ 90,190 Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders (3) $ 20,774 $ 13,366 Weighted Average number of shares 91,036,935 108,802,614 Adjusted Earnings per share (3) $ 0.23 $ 0.12 Net Income $ 23,015 $ 19,167 Net Income available to common stockholders $ 17,866 $ 12,289 Weighted Average number of shares 91,036,935 108,802,614 Earnings per share $ 0.20 $ 0.11 (1) Accrued charter revenue represents the difference between cash received during the period and revenue recognized on a straight-line basis. In the early years of a charter with escalating charter rates, voyage revenue will exceed cash received during the period and during the last years of such charter cash received will exceed revenue recognized on a straight line basis.\n(2) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis represents Voyage revenue after adjusting for non-cash “Accrued charter revenue” recorded under charters with escalating charter rates. However, Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We believe that the presentation of Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis is useful to investors because it presents the charter revenue for the relevant period based on the then current daily charter rates. The increases or decreases in daily charter rates under our charter party agreements are described in the notes to the “Fleet List” below.\n(3) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of these financial measures additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. The tables below set out supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, voyage revenue or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures include (i) Voyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (reconciled above), (ii) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and (iii) Adjusted Earnings per Share.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders\nand Adjusted Earnings per Share\nThree-month period ended\nMarch 31, (Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data) 2017 2018 Net Income $ 23,015 $ 19,167 Earnings allocated to Preferred Stock (5,149 ) (6,878 ) Net Income available to common stockholders 17,866 12,289 Accrued charter revenue (2,791 ) (2,564 ) Non-cash general and administrative expenses 984 934 Amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net 2,158 2,009 Realized (gain)/loss on Euro/USD forward contracts (1) 32 (255 ) Loss on sale / disposals of vessels (1) 3,638 - Swaps’ breakage costs - 1,234 Gain on derivative instruments, excluding interest accrued and realized on non-hedging derivative instruments (1) (1,113 ) (281 ) Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders $ 20,774 $ 13,366 Adjusted Earnings per Share $ 0.23 $ 0.12 Weighted average number of shares 91,036,935 108,802,614 Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share represent Net Income after earnings allocated to preferred stock, but before non-cash “Accrued charter revenue” recorded under charters with escalating charter rates, realized gain on Euro/USD forward contracts, loss on sale / disposal of vessels, swaps’ breakage costs, non-cash general and administrative expenses, amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net and non-cash changes in fair value of derivatives. “Accrued charter revenue” is attributed to the timing difference between the revenue recognition and the cash collection. However, Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful to investors because they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful in evaluating our ability to service additional debt and make capital expenditures. In addition, we believe that Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity position compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share generally eliminates the effects of the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, certain hedging instruments and other accounting treatments, items which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and liquidity. In evaluating Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders and Adjusted Earnings per Share should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\n(1) Items to consider for comparability include gains and charges. Gains positively impacting Net Income available to common stockholders are reflected as deductions to Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders. Charges negatively impacting Net Income available to common stockholders are reflected as increases to Adjusted Net Income available to common stockholders.\nResults of Operations\nThree-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017\nDuring the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an average of 53.0 and 52.0 vessels, respectively, in our fleet. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, we sold the container vessels Romanos and Marina with an aggregate capacity of 8,401 TEU. In the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our fleet ownership days totaled 4,770 and 4,678 days, respectively. Ownership days are one of the primary drivers of voyage revenue and vessels’ operating expenses and represent the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet is owned.\n(Expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,\nexcept percentages) Three-month period\nended March 31, Percentage\n2017 2018 Change Change Voyage revenue $ 105.5 $ 92.8 $ (12.7 ) (12.0%) Voyage expenses (0.7 ) (1.1 ) 0.4 57.1% Voyage expenses – related parties (0.8 ) (0.8 ) - - Vessels’ operating expenses (25.3 ) (26.1 ) 0.8 3.2% General and administrative expenses (1.2 ) (1.5 ) 0.3 25.0% Management fees – related parties (4.7 ) (4.7 ) - - Non-cash general and administrative expenses (1.0 ) (0.9 ) (0.1 ) (10.0%) Amortization of dry-docking and special survey costs (1.9 ) (1.5 ) (0.4 ) (21.1%) Depreciation (24.1 ) (22.8 ) (1.3 ) (5.4%) Amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net (2.2 ) (2.0 ) (0.2 ) (9.1%) Gain/(Loss) on sale of vessels (3.6 ) - (3.6 ) n.m.

The decrease is mainly attributable to decreased charter rates for certain of our vessels and revenue not earned by three vessels sold for demolition in 2017 which was partly off-set by revenue earned by four secondhand vessels acquired during the second and fourth quarter of 2017.\nVoyage revenue adjusted on a cash basis (which eliminates non-cash “Accrued charter revenue”), decreased by 12.2%, or $12.5 million, to $90.2 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, from $102.7 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Accrued charter revenue for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, amounted to $2.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses were $1.1 million and $0.7 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Voyage expenses mainly include (i) off-hire expenses of our vessels, primarily related to fuel consumption and (ii) third party commissions.\nVoyage Expenses – related parties\nVoyage expenses – related parties were $0.8 million for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Voyage expenses – related parties represent (i) fees of 0.75% in the aggregate on voyage revenues charged by Costamare Shipping Company S.A. (“Costamare Shipping”) and by Costamare Shipping Services Ltd. (“Costamare Services”) pursuant to the Framework Agreement between Costamare Shipping and us dated November 2, 2015 (the “Framework Agreement”), the Services Agreement between Costamare Services and our vessel-owning subsidiaries dated November 2, 2015 (the “Services Agreement”) and the individual ship-management agreements pertaining to each vessel and (ii) charter brokerage fees payable to Blue Net Chartering GmbH & Co. KG (“Blue Net”) pursuant to the Agreement Regarding Charter Brokerage dated January 1, 2018 between Costamare Shipping and Blue Net.\nVessels’ Operating Expenses\nVessels’ operating expenses, which also include the realized gain / (loss) under derivative contracts entered into in relation to foreign currency exposure, were $26.1 million and $25.3 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.5 million and $1.2 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and both include $0.63 million which is part of the annual fee that Costamare Services receives based on the Services Agreement.\nManagement Fees – related parties\nManagement fees paid to our managers pursuant to the Framework Agreement were $4.7 million for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNon-cash general and administrative expenses\nNon-cash general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $0.9 million, representing the value of the shares issued to Costamare Services on March 30, 2018, pursuant to the Services Agreement. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, the respective amount was $1.0 million, representing the fair value of the shares issued to Costamare Services on March 30, 2017, pursuant to the Services Agreement.\nAmortization of Dry-docking and Special Survey Costs\nAmortization of deferred dry-docking and special survey costs was $1.5 million and $1.9 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, four vessels underwent and completed their special survey and one was in process of completing its special survey. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 one vessel underwent and completed its special survey.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expense decreased by 5.4% or $1.3 million, to $22.8 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, from $24.1 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly attributable to depreciation expense not charged during the three -month period ended March 31, 2018, due to the sale of three vessels during 2017; partly off-set by the depreciation charged during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, due to the acquisition of four secondhand vessels in the second and the fourth quarters of 2017.\nAmortization of Prepaid Lease Rentals, net\nAmortization of prepaid lease rentals, net was $2.0 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. Amortization of prepaid lease rentals, net was $2.2 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nInterest Income\nInterest income amounted to $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInterest and Finance Costs\nInterest and finance costs were $14.6 million and $17.9 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is partly attributable to the decreased average loan balance during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nSwaps’ Breakage Costs\nDuring the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we terminated three interest rate derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and we paid the counterparties breakage costs of $1.2 million.\nEquity Gain on Investments\nDuring the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an equity gain on investments of $2.3 million representing our share of the net gain of 18 jointly owned companies pursuant to the Framework Deed dated May 15, 2013, as amended and restated on May 18, 2015 (the “Framework Deed”), between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary on the one hand, and York Capital Management Global Advisors LLC and an affiliated fund (collectively, together with the funds it manages or advises, “York”) on the other hand. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, we recorded an equity gain on investments of $0.2 million also relating to investments under the Framework Deed. The increase is mainly attributable to the income generated by certain newbuild vessels that were delivered from the shipyard during 2017 and commenced their charters.\nGain / (Loss) on Derivative Instruments\nThe fair value of our 14 interest rate derivative instruments which were outstanding as of March 31, 2018 equates to the amount that would be paid by us or to us should those instruments be terminated. As of March 31, 2018, the fair value of these 14 interest rate derivative instruments in aggregate amounted to a net asset of $8.4 million. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the interest rate derivative instruments that qualified for hedge accounting is recorded in “Other Comprehensive Income” (“OCI”) while the ineffective portion is recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
