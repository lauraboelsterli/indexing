The logo of Avast Software company is seen at its headquarters in Prague, Czech Republic, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/David W Cerny/Files\nPriced at 250 pence per share, the private equity-backed firm was trading at 243.5 pence as of 0801 GMT.\nBankers typically price initial public offerings (IPOs) aiming for a slight rise in the first days of trading.\nThe company had set the offer at the bottom end of its guidance, having already reduced the expected price range, in a market in which scores of IPOs have been cancelled.\nThe offer size of $816.6 million included gross proceeds of approximately $200 million and represented around 25 percent of the shares of the company. It was the biggest IPO on the LSE since July 2017.\nBased on the offer price, the company had a market capitalisation of 2.4 billion pounds.\nAvast is 46 percent-owned by its founders, Czech entrepreneurs Pavel Baudis and Eduard Kucera.\nCVC Capital Partners has a 29 percent stake and Summit Partners hold 7 percent.\nIn 2017, Avast reported adjusted cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $451 million on adjusted revenue of $780 million.\nMorgan Stanley and UBS led the transaction.\n($1 = 0.7382 pounds)",
