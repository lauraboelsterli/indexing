REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin “Both parties agreed to remain in close contact on these issues and to deepen cooperation,” Martina Fietz, a spokeswoman for the German government, said in a statement.\nMerkel held talks with President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, on Friday, and stressed the need for the continuation of gas transit via Ukraine even after the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which will circumvent the country.\nReporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
