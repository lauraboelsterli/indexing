    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iRhythm Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:IRTC), a leading digital health care solutions company focused on the advancement of cardiac care, today reported financial results for the three months ending March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nFirst quarter revenue was $30.6M, up 51% compared to prior year pro forma Q1 adjusted for ASC 606 and up 43% over reported revenue prior to adoption of ASC 606 First quarter gross margin was 71.8%, a year over year improvement of 310 basis points as compared to the prior year pro forma Q1 gross margin as adjusted for ASC 606 and 140 basis points over reported gross margin (prior to adoption of ASC 606) Results of the mSToPs study at one year showed that that Atrial Fibrillation was newly diagnosed in 6.3% of patients who were actively monitored by the Zio service versus only 2.3% in the observational control group receiving routine care Appointed UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Professor C. Noel Bairey Merz, M.D. to Board of Directors\n“2018 is off to a great start with strong first quarter revenue growth and increased gross margins,” said Kevin King, CEO. “Our track record of growing revenue within new and existing accounts continued into the first quarter, and the exceptional progress in salesforce hiring will strengthen our ability to meet the increasing demand for Zio XT and Zio AT. We believe the one-year readout of the mSToPS study is an important indicator of the benefit of testing for atrial fibrillation in high risk asymptomatic populations and points to a large future market expansion opportunity.”\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted a new revenue recognition standard (\"ASC 606\"), which primarily impacted the company’s recognition of revenue related to patient claims paid by third-party commercial and governmental payors. The company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, which means that the total amount of revenue reported for first quarter 2017 has not been restated in the current financial statements. In the interest of comparability during the transition year, the company has provided revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and net loss information for the first quarter 2017 on a non-GAAP, pro-forma basis as if ASC 606 had been applied in addition to as originally reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“2017 GAAP”).\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $30.6 million. The 51% increase over adjusted Q1 2017 ASC 606 revenue was primarily due to increased volume of the Zio XT service. First quarter 2017 GAAP revenue was $21.4 million, while adjusted 2017 ASC 606 revenue was $20.3 million. Gross profit for 2018 was $22.0 million, or 71.8% gross margin. Adjusted Q1 2017 ASC 606 gross profit was $13.9 million, or gross margin of 68.7%. Q1 2017 GAAP gross profit was $15.1 million, or 70.4% gross margin. First quarter 2018 operating expenses were $32.6 million. First quarter adjusted 2017 ASC 606 operating expenses were $19.5 million, while Q1 2017 GAAP operating expenses were $19.8 million. The first quarter 2018 operating expenses increase was driven primarily by heavy investment in research and development, personnel-related costs primarily related to our sales team expansion, and costs associated with our annual audit and continued auditor attestation work associated with SOX Section 404(b). First quarter 2018 net loss was $11.1 million. First quarter adjusted ASC 606 net loss was $6.1 million. First quarter 2017 GAAP net loss was $5.3 million.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\niRhythm projects revenue for the full year 2018 to range from $128.5 to $133.5 million, inclusive of ASC 606, which represents 36-41% growth over the company’s prior year, as adjusted and presented on a non-GAAP basis to show the effects of ASC 606. Gross margins for the full year 2018 are expected to range from 71.5% to 72.5% and operating expenses for the full year 2018 to be between $127 and $132 million. This compares to previous revenue guidance of $126 to $131 million, inclusive of ASC 606; gross margins of 70% to 72% and operating expenses of $124 to $129 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\niRhythm’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET.

The tables below presents a summary of the cumulative change of ASC 606 and includes the impact to the quarterly results for 2017.\nASC 606 Impact (Unaudited) Year ended December 31, 2017 2014 2015 2016 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Cumulative Accrual revenue / cash receipts, net $ 771 $ 2,612 $ (840 ) $ (1,010 ) $ (547 ) $ (64 ) $ (160 ) $ (1,781 ) $ 762 Bad debt expense (14 ) (32 ) (357 ) (166 ) (402 ) (619 ) (1,093 ) (2,280 ) (2,683 ) Total revenue adjustments 757 2,580 (1,197 ) (1,176 ) (949 ) (683 ) (1,253 ) (4,061 ) (1,921 ) Operating Expenses (14 ) (31 ) (357 ) (334 ) (569 ) (727 ) (1,243 ) (2,873 ) (3,275 ) Net income (loss) adjustments $ 771 $ 2,611 $ (840 ) $ (842 ) $ (380 ) $ 44 $ (10 ) $ (1,188 ) $ 1,354 In this release, the company refers to non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 Revenue, non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 Gross Margin, non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 operating expense and non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 Net Income. Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method, which means that the total amount of revenue reported from first quarter 2017 has not been restated in the current financial statements. The company has provided comparable information on revenue, gross profit and margin, operating expenses and net income in accordance with ASC 606 to allow investors comparability to the prior year results. However, for periods beginning before the adoption date of ASC 606, those adjusted financial measures are considered not to be calculated in accordance with GAAP and are thus presented as non-GAAP financial metrics.\nThe company believes this additional information is vital during the transition year to allow readers of its financial statements to compare financial results from the preceding financial year given the absence of restatement of the prior period. The company’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered an addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe table below presents reconciliations of non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 revenue to 2017 GAAP revenue, non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 gross profit to 2017 GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 operating expenses to 2017 GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP 2017 ASC 606 net income to 2017 GAAP net income, in each case from the first quarter and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the case of each respective metric.\n2017 As Reported Non-GAAP Adjustment Adjusted for ASC 606 Revenue $ 21,437 $ (1,176 ) $ 20,261 Gross profit $ 15,100 $ (1,176 ) $ 13,924 Selling, general and administrative $ 17,224 $ (334 ) $ 16,890 Total operating expenses $ 19,845 $ (334 ) $ 19,511 Loss from operations $ (4,745 ) $ (842 ) $ (5,587 ) Net loss $ (5,303 ) $ (842 ) $ (6,145 )\nSource: iRhythm",
