    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) has the right to walk away from an agreed deal to break up Innogy ( IGY.DE ) should it sell single assets worth more than 150 million euros ($179 million) or assets worth a combined 450 million, RWE’s ( RWEG.DE ) finance chief said.\nTalking to analysts during a call on Tuesday to discuss first-quarter results, Markus Krebber said that two assets were excluded from this clause, including Npower, Innogy’s British retail unit, which is to be merged with the local unit of SSE ( SSE.L ).\nInnogy’s Czech gas network activities, which have fetched interest from Macquarie ( MQG.AX ) and Czech investment group KKCG, are also excluded from the deal.\nReporting by Christoph Steitz\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
