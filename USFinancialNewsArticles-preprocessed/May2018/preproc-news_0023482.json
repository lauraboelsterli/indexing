    "text": "Houston right fielder George Springer had two hits and two RBIs, Alex Bregman homered, and Lance McCullers beat Oakland for the second time in 11 days as the visiting Astros defeated the A’s 4-2 on Tuesday.\nSpringer hit a two-out, two-run double for a 3-2 lead in the fifth inning to continue his hot series. He is 8-for-10 with a walk, four runs and five RBIs in the first two games in Oakland after going 6-for-6 with a homer, a double and four singles Monday. His batting average, which was .264 through the weekend, is up to .297.\nMarcus Semien had two hits and scored twice, and Khris Davis had his 31st RBI on a sacrifice fly for Oakland, which had won three of four.\nMcCullers (5-1) gave up five hits and two runs in five innings, with three strikeouts and four walks, as Houston improved to 13-6 on the road.\nMarwin Gonzalez and Yuli Gurriel added two hits apiece for Houston, and Gonzalez’s RBI single made it 4-2 in the sixth inning.\nKen Giles got a double-play grounder after a one-out single in the ninth inning for his fourth save.\nOakland left-hander Sean Manaea (4-4) gave up seven hits and four runs in 5 2/3 innings, with three strikeouts and no walks. Manaea has given up four runs in each of his past two starts after giving up five earned runs total in his first six starts.\nSemien walked to open the first inning and scored for a 1-0 lead on a wild pitch, a fly ball that moved him to third, and another wild pitch.\nBregman tied it with his third homer in the second inning.\nThe A’s loaded the bases with no outs in the third inning but scored only one run, on Davis’ sacrifice fly. McCullers got out of the inning on a double-play grounder to keep it at 2-1.\nIn the fifth, Brian McCann was hit by a pitch and Jake Marisnick doubled before Springer doubled in both for a lead the Astros never lost.\nA’s right fielder Stephen Piscotty was 1-for-3 with a single in his first game since his mother died Sunday from Lou Gehrig’s disease. Piscotty was given a standing ovation before singling in his first plate appearance in the second inning, with players from both teams joining in from the dugouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
