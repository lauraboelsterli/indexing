A staff member sets up Chinese and U.S. flags for a meeting during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao at China's Ministry of Transport in Beijing, China April 27, 2018.

REUTERS/Jason Lee\nIn the document, the United States asked China to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. by $200 billion by 2020 and to cut tariffs on all products to levels no higher than those of the U.S., according to the tweet.\nA U.S. trade delegation is in Beijing this week to discuss a wide range of U.S. complaints about Chinaâ€™s trade practices, from accusations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development.
