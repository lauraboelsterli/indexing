    "text": "May 27, 2018 / 5:29 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago Zverev in the pink as he leaves Berankis floundering Pritha Sarkar 3 Min Alexander Zverev rocked up at the French Open on Sunday looking like one of the ballboys with his salmon pink shirt but once he started wielding his racket, it was clear he was not there to follow orders as he thrashed Ricardas Berankis 6-1 6-1 6-2. Germany's Alexander Zverev with Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nWith the ballboys wearing strikingly similar shirts, the German would not have looked out of place if he had swapped places with one of them and stood to attention at the rear hoardings or crouched down on both knees near the net posts.\nBut the 21-year-old left Lithuania’s Berankis to do all the scrambling as he fired down 11 aces and 29 winners to wrap up victory in 69 blistering minutes to set up a second-round showdown with either Jiri Vesely or Dusan Lajovic.\nSeeded second at a major for the first time in his career, Zverev is billed to meet 10-times champion Rafael Nadal in the June 10 final.\nBut having failed to progress beyond the fourth round at any of the slams so far, the man tipped as a future Grand Slam champion was not about to read too much into his seeding.\n“It’s nice. It means that you’ve been playing well throughout the whole year, and you deserve that spot a little bit. But the seedings don’t matter,” the world number three told reporters.\n“It doesn’t mean anything as there are a lot of great players wanting to stop me.\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re ranked No. 2 in the world or if you’re ranked 50 or 80 in the world... you try to beat the guy who is on the other side.”\nAlthough the German has been promoted one spot in the seedings due to Roger Federer’s decision to skip the entire claycourt season, his place at the bottom of the draw is no fluke.\nHe has enjoyed a sizzling build-up to Paris by contesting three claycourt finals and winning two of them.\nThe only blip, if it can be called that, was a semi-final defeat by Kei Nishikori in the Monte Carlo Masters.\n“On clay especially I have been playing well. During all the tournaments I have played on clay so far, the worst I did was semi-finals in Monaco. That’s not a bad preparation,” the champion in Munich and Madrid said with a grin.\n“I have won two tournaments, made the finals in Rome again, losing to Rafa in a close match. I feel good and today was a good start to the tournament. I’m happy the way it’s going so far.” Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Clare Fallon",
