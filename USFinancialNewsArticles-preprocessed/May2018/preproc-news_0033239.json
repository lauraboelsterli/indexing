    "text": "Former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid undergoes surgery for cancer Published 23 Mins Ago Getty Images Former Senate Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2016.\nFormer Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is recovering after undergoing surgery Monday to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas.\nThe 78-year-old Reid will undergo chemotherapy.\nReid's family says he is in good spirits and resting with his family. They say doctors caught the tumor early during a routine screening and his prognosis is good.\nThe former Senate Democratic leader declined to seek re-election in 2016 after more than three decades in Congress. He suffered an accident in 2015 that left him blind in one eye.\nNevada's longest-serving senator helped propel the passage of President Barack Obama 's signature health care law, blocked the development of a nuclear waste dump in Nevada and built a well-organized Democratic machine in the state.",
