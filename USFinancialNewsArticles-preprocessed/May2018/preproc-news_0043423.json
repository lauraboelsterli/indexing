    "text": "Brandon Belt and Nick Hundley hit back-to-back homers in the seventh inning to give the San Francisco Giants the lead for good in a wild 9-5 win over the Colorado Rockies at AT&T Park.\nWith their second straight win, the Giants salvaged a split of the four-game series and kept the Rockies from moving into first place in the National League West.\nGorkys Hernandez, who began the Giants’ comeback with a two-run homer in the fifth, led off the seventh by singling against Bryan Shaw (1-2). Evan Longoria drew a one-out walk, after which left-hander Jake McGee entered to face the left-handed-hitting Belt. But Belt beat the percentages by homering on a 1-0 pitch for his first round-tripper against a southpaw this season.\nHundley homered on a 3-2 pitch to add the final blow in a back-and-forth affair that included two lead changes and two ties.\nLongoria’s sacrifice fly gave the Giants a first-inning lead before the Rockies scored twice apiece in the fourth and fifth thanks to Trevor Story (RBI double in the fourth, RBI fielder’s choice in the fifth) and Noel Cuevas (run-scoring single in the fourth, run-scoring walk in the fifth).\nBut the Giants wasted no time beginning their comeback. After Hernandez’s homer closed the gap to 4-3, Kelby Tomlinson gave San Francisco the lead with a two-RBI triple in the sixth.\nNolan Arenado tied the game again with an RBI single in the top of the seventh before the Giants answered with their winning rally in the bottom of the inning.\nSam Dyson (2-0) earned the win despite giving up the tying run in the seventh.\nBelt, Hernandez, Tomlinson and Austin Jackson had two hits each for the Giants.\nStory and Arenado were both 3-for-5 for the Rockies while Cuevas and Pat Valaika had two hits apiece.\nGiants starter Ty Blach allowed four runs on eight hits and two walks while striking out one over 4 1/3 innings. Rockies starter Tyler Anderson gave up five runs on six hits and one walk while striking out four over 5 1/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
