    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italyâ€™s President Sergio Mattarella said on Sunday he had rejected demands by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League to name an economy minister because he might have pushed Italy out of the euro.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella speaks to media after a meeting with Italy's Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy, May 27, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi His move effectively scuttled efforts at forming a coalition government, opening the way for possible early elections in the autumn following an inconclusive vote in March.\nIn a televised address, a somber Mattarella said he was not to blame for the impasse, adding that he had proposed alternatives for the key economy ministry position, but his suggestions had been spurned by 5-Star and the League.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Riuchard Balmforth\n ",
