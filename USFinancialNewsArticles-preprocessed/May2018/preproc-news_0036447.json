REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nThat would translate to about 3,500 Model 3s per week, up quite a bit from the weekly production rate of 2,270 it hit in the last week of April.\nEarlier this month, Tesla said its Model 3 production target remains on track, expecting about 5,000 per week in about two months.\nMusk said on Tuesday if anyone knew of any specific bottlenecks that would prevent the carmaker from achieving that production rate, they should come to him this week, according to the report, citing an email from Musk to employees. Related Coverage Factbox: Tesla executive departures since 2016\nTesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nThe news comes a day after Musk said Tesla was undergoing a “thorough reorganization” as it contends with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars.\nTesla will still rapidly hire people to fill critical positions “to support the Model 3 production ramp and future product development,” Musk said on Monday.\nTesla is at a critical juncture as it tries to fix an inauspicious launch of the Model 3 sedan, a mid-market car crucial to its success and future profitability that has been plagued by early production problems.
