    "text": "U.S. stocks traded in a tight range on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said a highly anticipated summit with North Korea may not happen after all.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both traded just above the flatline, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55 points.\n\"Whether or not it happens, you'll be knowing pretty soon,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. The summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty right now and that's reflected in the tight trading band we've been in for the past few months,\" said Jennifer Ellison, principal at Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough.\nStocks traded higher earlier in the session after China said it will reduce levies on automakers and car parts. China's Finance Ministry said tariffs on certain vehicles will come down to 15 percent from as much as 25 percent while levies on some parts will be brought down to 6 percent effective July 1.\nShares of Ford and General Motors rose on the news, gaining 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Tesla initially rose more than 1 percent before sliding 3.1 percent.\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty Images \"We may already be getting some relief on one of the major issues that has weighed on the market since early February, when President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the US's major trading partners,\" Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.\nThe announcement by China comes after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday the U.S. has made \"very meaningful progress\" with China on trade matters, noting: \"Now it's up to both of us to make sure that we can implement it.\"\nMnuchin's comments helped push the Dow up nearly 300 points as Wall Street interpreted the remarks as tensions between the U.S. and China easing. The Dow also closed above 25,000 for the first time since March on Monday.\nRising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with rising rates and inflationary fears, pushed stocks off of record highs earlier this year. Since then, the major indexes have recovered slightly from those losses.\nHowever, Steve Chiavarone of Federated Investors said he was not too worried about the rising tensions between the two giant economies, noting the amount of money in tariffs proposed is far smaller than the benefit of lower taxes. \"It's like 20 to 1,\" the firm's assistant vice president said.\nWatch: The market's 'fear gauge' may be signaling caution for stocks show chapters The market’s ‘fear gauge’ may be signaling caution for stocks 21 Hours Ago | 01:19",
