Traders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nA bounce in auto stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark rise 0.4 percent by 0716 GMT after ending at an eight-day low on Thursday. The index was down 0.6 percent on the week.\nAutos .SXAP rose 0.7 percent after US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose import tariffs drew strong criticism with U.S. business groups and members of his own party warning of damage to the industry and American interests.\nShares in German carmakers BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) rose between 0.3 and 1.1 percent.\nBiggest gainers on the STOXX were Pennon Group ( PNN.L ), up 6.1 percent, following its trading update, and SimCorp ( SIM.CO ), up 4.6 percent, after a price target upgrade.\nGVC Holdings ( GVC.L ) rose 3.7 percent after the British gambling company forecast higher cost synergies from its 4 billion pound acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral.\nItaly's FTSE MIB .FTMIB hovered near 7-week lows, down 0.1 percent, as the prospect of a eurosceptic government prompted investors to pull money out of the country's equity funds.
