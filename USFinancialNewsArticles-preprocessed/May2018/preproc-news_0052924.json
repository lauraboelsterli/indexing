    "text": "ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Russia and OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia may act together to prevent a further oil price spike, Russia’s top state investment official said on Friday.\nKirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF and one of the architects of a joint deal between Moscow and OPEC to cut production, told Reuters joint coordinated action to cool prices would make sense.\nThe comment came as Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al Falih came to St Petersburg for talks with Russian peer Alexander Novak.\nFalih also met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of Russia’s top economic conference together with other foreign executives and officials.\n“Russia really benefited from this pact with Saudi Arabia and our budget received 3 trillion roubles ($48.7 billion) of additional income from that deal,” Dmitriev told Reuters television.\n“There is no doubt that Russia and Saudi Arabia will continue this strategic cooperation going forward.”\n“Current issues with Iran and other countries could produce some oil spikes. So joint coordinated action to avoid oil spikes to ensure that there is sufficient market balancing definitely makes sense,” Dmitriev said.\nDmitriev helped design the current deal under which Russia and OPEC agreed to reduce supplies by 1.8 million barrels per day from 2017.\nOPEC meets in Vienna on June 22.\nReporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Katya Golubkova; editing by Maria Kiselyova\n ",
