We believe we can continue to invest in key growth initiatives while delivering improving profitability over time, and our first quarter results represent good progress against those objectives.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $31.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11 percent compared with total revenue of $28.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss was $(3.2) million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with GAAP net loss of $(8.1) million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss per share was $(0.12) in the first quarter of 2018, based on 26.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with GAAP net loss per share of $(0.31) in the year-ago period, based on 26.1 million weighted average shares then outstanding.\nNon-GAAP net loss, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation in 2018 and 2017 and a one-time charge in 2017 in connection with entering into voluntary disclosure agreements (\"VDAs\") related to sales tax obligations, was $(0.4) million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $(2.6) million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $(0.8) million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation, amortization, income tax expense, interest income (expense), stock-based compensation expense and the one-time charge for VDAs related to sales taxes described above.\nCash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $54.7 million, compared with $53.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRecent Business Highlights\nAverage revenue per customer, calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, increased 10 percent to $43,920 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, compared with $40,051 for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017.\nFixed subscription fees were 76 percent of total revenue and variable subscription fees were 24 percent of total revenue for the first quarter of 2018.

The company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, and for budgeting and planning purposes. The company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and that it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nManagement of the company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the company’s financial statements. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP results. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results and guidance prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. ChannelAdvisor urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly named non-GAAP measures differently than we do, which limits their usefulness in comparing our financial results with theirs.\nAbout ChannelAdvisor\nChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM) is a leading e-commerce cloud platform whose mission is to connect and optimize the world’s commerce.
