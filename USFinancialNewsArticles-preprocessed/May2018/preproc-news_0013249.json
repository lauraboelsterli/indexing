I made the mistake in not being able to come to a conclusion where I really felt that at the present prices that the prospects were far better than the prices indicated.\"\nIt took Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to tell him to stop using Altavista as a search engine and use Google instead, he said. And he should have been more aware because Berkshire subsidiary Geico was paying Google \"a lot of money\" at the time of its initial public offering.\nshow chapters Bill Gates follows this part of Warren Buffettâ€™s investing philosophy 12:43 PM ET Tue, 13 Dec 2016 | 00:56 The Oracle of Omaha also admitted he underestimated Amazon's ability to disrupt retail and cloud computing at the same time with such a rapid pace.\n\"I had very very very high opinion of Jeff's [Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon] ability when I first him, and I underestimated him,\" he added. \"I've watched Amazon from the start. I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle ... The problem is when I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it. It would have been far better obviously if I had some insights into certain businesses.\"\nshow chapters Watch CNBC's full interview with Warren Buffett 3:59 PM ET Fri, 4 May 2018 | 13:27",
