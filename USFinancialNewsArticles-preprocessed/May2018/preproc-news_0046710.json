    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro is expelling the top U.S. diplomat in Venezuela and his deputy for allegedly conspiring against his government.\nMaduro made the announcement in a televised address, giving Todd Robinson and his deputy Brian Naranjo 48 hours to leave the country.\nTensions have mounted mount between the two countries following Maduro's victory in disputed presidential elections on Sunday. The White House has branded the election a \"sham.\"\nFederico Parra | AFP | Getty Images Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro addresses supporters after the National Electoral Council (CNE) announced the results of the voting on election day in Venezuela, on May 20, 2018 in Caracas. Robinson is a career diplomat who previously served as ambassador to Guatemala. Venezuela and the U.S. haven't exchanged ambassadors since 2010.\nThere was no immediate reaction from Robinson or the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.",
