    "text": "JACKSON, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teen Health Mississippi (THMS) is excited to announce the selection of Dr. Hope L. Crenshaw to serve as Executive Director. Dr. Crenshaw officially joined the team in her new role on May 15, 2018. THMS advisory board, with the generous help of a volunteer search committee, led the search process.\n“With Hope’s selection, Teen Health Mississippi takes its next step in becoming a stand-alone teen health organization. Hope has been a great asset to our team over the past eighteen months in her role as Director of Education and Training, and we are excited to support her in this new position as Executive Director,” said Marni von Wilpert, Chair of the Teen Health Mississippi Advisory Board.\nHope L. Crenshaw is a native of Crenshaw, Mississippi. She graduated from M.S. Palmer High School in Marks, Mississippi, before receiving her B.A. in Sociology/Anthropology from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota. Hope also received her M.A. in Sociology from Minnesota State University—Mankato. After six Minnesota winters, she returned to the warmth of the Mississippi Delta and served as a high school English and Social Studies instructor for four years at M.S. Palmer. During this time, she earned her Ed.S. in Educational Leadership from the University of Mississippi. Determined to learn more about equity and serving underserved communities, Hope pursued and completed her Ph.D. in Education Policy Studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana—Champaign, with a focus on equity and data-driven decision-making.\nHope has served as the Director of Education and Training at THMS since October 2016. As Director of Education and Training, she led the Mississippi Sex Education Training Cadre, a 15-member team of professional trainers who provide workshops to current and future sex educators. She also designed training modules to build healthy youth-adult interactions and developed relationships with Mississippi community leaders, school districts, colleges/universities, and faith leaders to rally their support for youth sexual and reproductive health.\nDr. Hope Crenshaw states, “I am excited about this new opportunity and challenge. My years of education and work experience paired with my dedication and commitment to the state of Mississippi have prepared me for my new role. I look forward to continuing to bring resources and knowledge to underserved communities to support the overall health and wellness of youth.”\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180522006110/en/\nTeen Health Mississippi\nMacKenzie Hines\nDirector of Communications and Operations\nmackenzie@mississippifirst.org\nSource: Teen Health Mississippi",
