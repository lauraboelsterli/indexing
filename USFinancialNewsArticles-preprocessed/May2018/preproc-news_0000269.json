    "text": "LANHAM, Md., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 2U, Inc. (Nasdaq: TWOU) , a global leader in education technology, today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue was $92.3 million, an increase of 42% from $64.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $(14.9) million, or $(0.28) per share, compared to $(3.4) million, or $(0.07) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net loss was $(6.1) million, or $(0.12) per share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(1.5) million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Our short course business has emerged as a powerful contributor to our growth story. When combined with the expected growth of our Graduate Program Segment, revenue guidance is up about $8 million over our prior guidance,\" said CEO and Co-Founder Christopher \"Chip\" Paucek. \"In addition, the annual number of launched graduate programs has increased substantially over the past few years and shows no signs of slowing down. Our pipeline also continues to be strong, giving us confidence in our revenue expectations in that core segment in future years.\"\nProgram Developments\nToday, 2U is announcing the following:\nA new Domestic Graduate Program with Pepperdine University Graziadio Business School for Business@Pepperdine, a suite of online graduate business degrees expected to launch in 2019. A partnership with Rice University for business-focused online short courses expected to launch in fall 2018.\n2U recently announced a new partnership with Baylor University for three new Domestic Graduate Programs:\nEducation@Baylor, an online Doctor of Education in Learning and Organizational Change, expected to launch in August 2018. MPH@Baylor, an online Master of Public Health with a specialization in Community Health, expected to launch in April 2019 pending accreditor approval. MSW@Baylor, an online Master of Social Work, expected to launch in May 2019 pending accreditor approval.\nFinancial Outlook\nBased on information available as of today, 2U is issuing the following guidance for second quarter and full-year of 2018. This guidance assumes foreign exchange rates as of March 31, 2018, including a U.S. dollar/South African rand rate of 11.83.\n2Q 2018\nFY 2018\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\n$95.1 - $96.1\n$406.6 - $410.6\nNet loss\n$(22.1) - $(21.6)\n$(46.6) - $(44.7)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n$(0.42) - $(0.41)\n$(0.87) - $(0.84)\nAdjusted net loss\n$(11.6) - $(11.1)\n$(7.2) - $(5.3)\nAdjusted net loss per share\n$(0.22) - $(0.21)\n$(0.13) - $(0.10)\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, basic\n53.4\n53.5\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss)\n$(6.2) - $(5.7)\n$16.1 - $18.0\nStock-based compensation expense\n$9.3 - $9.5\n$34.0 - $34.5\nNote that, in the first quarter of 2018, better than expected enrollment in early presentations of several new short courses was the primary factor in 2U's revenue overperformance in that quarter. Based on this demonstrated demand, 2U plans on increasing the expected number of presentations of these courses for the remainder of the year. Expected incremental enrollment from these additional presentations is the primary driver of the increased revenue guidance that 2U is providing.\n2U expects that of the revenue it recognizes in the second half of 2018, approximately 48% will be recognized in the third quarter. Further, we expect to experience meaningful margin variability between periods driven by significant revenue growth combined with cost seasonality. For the second half of the year, we currently expect:\nA net loss margin of between (4.4)% and (3.7)%, and of that dollar net loss, approximately 127% to 128% is expected to be generated in the third quarter. An adjusted net income margin of between 4.8% and 5.4%, and of that dollar adjusted net income, approximately 112% to 113% is expected to be generated in the fourth quarter. An adjusted EBITDA margin of between 10.8% and 11.3%, and of that dollar adjusted EBITDA, approximately 18% to 19% is expected to be generated in the third quarter.\nNote that cost seasonality in the second and fourth quarters typically reduces margins in the first half of each year and improves margins in the second half of each year, so second-half margins should not be viewed as being a run rate for the first half of the following year.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency gains or losses, acquisition-related gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense. Some or all of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nWe define adjusted net income (loss) as net income or net loss, as applicable, before foreign currency gains or losses, acquisition-related gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted net income (loss) per share is calculated as adjusted net income (loss) divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for periods which result in adjusted net income, and basic weighted-average shares outstanding for periods which result in an adjusted net loss.\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. These non-GAAP measures are key metrics Company management uses to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures also provide useful information to investors and analysts relating to 2U's financial condition and results of operations. These financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nFor more information on 2U's non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of such measures to the nearest GAAP measures, see the reconciliation tables on the last page of this press release under the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\" 2U urges investors to review these reconciliations and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\nConference Call Information\nWhat:\n2U, Inc.'s first quarter 2018 financial results conference call\nWhen:\nThursday, May 3, 2018\nTime:\n5 p.m. ET\nLive Call:\n(877) 359-9508\nWebcast:\ninvestor.2U.com\nAbout 2U, Inc.
