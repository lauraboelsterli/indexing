    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday Iran’s “reckless actions” pose a threat to regional security and urged other countries to press Tehran to change its behavior.\n“It is time for responsible nations to bring pressure on Iran to change this dangerous behavior,” the White House said in a statement. It cited rockets fired at Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria and a missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the Saudi capital Riyadh this week.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ",
