Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Analytics startup ThoughtSpot raised $145 million in new funding as data-driven decision-making moves closer to the corporate mainstream. The company, co-founded in 2012 by Nutanix co-founder Ajeet Singh, provides an analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze enterprise data.\nAfter creating a cache of corporate information spanning sales, HR and other sources, the platform allows users to type in a phrase such as “product sales state last quarter” and generate a visualization. A new product, SpotIQ, uses machine learning to identify trends or relationships among different data sources.\nCustomers include three of the Fortune 5, Mr. Singh tells CIO Journal’s Steven Norton . Other customers include Capital One Financial Corp. , Chevron Corp ., diamond firm De Beers , Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and BT Group PLC , CIO Journal reports. Analytics and business intelligence was an $18.3 billion market in 2017, according to Gartner Inc. By 2022, it’s expected to grow to nearly $28 billion.\nConnectivity pays. MuleSoft Inc. founder Ross Mason managed a double exit with Salesforce.com Inc.’s $6.5 billion deal coming a little over a year after API firm’s initial offering. But the work is not over as long as companies struggle to unlock data trapped in older systems for use in newer tools, he tells CIO Journal’s Angus Loten . “Every increment in efficiency, or providing better services and products to consumers, or having better employee services, hinges on being able to unlock data and capabilities around the enterprise,” he says.\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS\nSlack said its number of paid users jumped 50% from last September. Photo: SASCHA STEINBACH/EPA/SHUTTERSTOCK\nSlack Passes 3 Million Paid Users. Slack Technologies Inc. has surpassed 8 million daily active users and 3 million paid users. The company behind the popular workplace messaging app saw its daily active user number increase by roughly a third from last September. Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield tells the Journal’s Rolfe Winkler that the top two customers are International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Inc.\nWhite House to discuss future of AI . The White House on Thursday will host a meeting on artificial intelligence with leaders from Silicon Valley and representatives from various federal agencies expected to take part, Reuters reports . Expected participants include I ntel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich and the CTOs of Ford Motor Co. and Boeing Co. , according to Reuters.\nGamers vs. AI researchers vs. cryptos in GPU battle. Graphics processing units, designed originally to provide video games with increasingly realistic graphics, reached a new level of coolness as AI researchers tapped GPU processing power for their own efforts. But now the GPU supply is getting squeezed as cryptocurrency miners find the chips useful for processing the math required for digital mining. “The chips are simply going out of stock,” Matt Scott, founder of AI company Malong tells the New York Times . “And the problem is getting worse.”\nRussian hackers that interfered with U.S. presidential election threatened military families. Fancy Bear, the Russian hacking group linked to the 2016 theft of emails belong to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, sent death threats U.S. military wives in 2015, the Associated Press reports . The group claimed to by members of CyberCaliphate and the incidents were credited in media to the possible work of Islamic State militants.\nWalmart groceries by Uber fails to deliver. Reuters reports that grocery-delivery partnerships between Walmart Inc. and ride-hailing services Lyft and Uber Technologies Inc. have ended. Says one source: “It is incredibly hard to deliver people and packages together.”\nBut Uber is partnering with Army on flight tech. The ride-hailing company, which has made known its desire to one day launch an air taxi service, is working with the U.S. Army on quiet aircraft rotor technology that could be used on a vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, Reuters reports .\n…and NASA too. In the company’s second agreement with the space agency, Uber will share data related to passenger and cargo air transportation within urban areas, Reuters reports . Earlier the two organizations said they were were on software for managing flying taxi routes.\nDid debut of bitcoin futures trigger crash in price? The WSJ’s Alexander Osipovich reports on a new research note from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that finds that the Dec. 17 launch of bitcoin futures at exchange giant CME Group triggered a collapse in the digital currency by making it easier to “short” bitcoin–or bet on its price falling.\nWorst job in America: Responding to irate tweets from NYC straphangers. Life on the receiving end of 2,500 often profanity-laced tweets a day from angry commuters venting to @MTA can be intense, reports the Journal’s Mike Vilensky .\nMANAGEMENT\nLongtime executive Chris Cox will oversee Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.

Facebook is overhauling its management structure in one of the most extensive corporate makeovers in its 14-year history, with more than a dozen executives changing roles, the Journal’s Deepa Seetharaman reports . A new blockchain group created in the shuffle will be helmed by David Marcus, who previously ran Messenger, and staffed with a “few key Instagram executives,” Recode reports . In a Facebook post, Mr. Marcus wrote , “I’m setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.”\nGOOGLE I/O\nGoogle CEO Sundar PIchai spoke Tuesday about a company initiative to help Andoid users with their ‘digital well being.’ Photo: JAAP ARRIENS/NURPHOTO/ZUMA PRESS\nIt happened at the Google I/O conference. CEO Sundar Pichai in his keynote speech Tuesday acknowledged the responsibility that comes with developing artificial intelligence systems, the New York Times reports . ““We know the path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right,” he said. But the NYT adds that he did not dwell on the existential. Among the highlights:\nDigital well being. Google announced a new version of its Android mobile operating system would tell users how much time they’ve spent on various apps, says the WSJ’s Douglas MacMillan .\nMachine Learning. TechCrunch reports on a new software developmenet kit announced by Google that lets developers integrate Google machine learning models into their apps.\nAI in everything. Mr. Pichai demonstrated Google AI helping a disabled person communicate and shared news on how AI can do better than doctors in deciding when a hospital patient needs to be readmitted, the FT reports .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nPresident Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear dea l with Iran deals a political blow to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who faces a challenge from hard-line opponent. (WSJ)\nDonald Trump’s lawyer received $500,000 in 2017 from an investment fund linked to Russian oligarch.\nMedian pay reached $12.1 million for CEOs of the biggest U.S. companies in 2017, a new post-recession high\nBritain’s Vodafone agreed to a nearly $23 billion deal to buy operations in four European countries from John Malone’s Liberty Global.
