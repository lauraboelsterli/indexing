The only other time all three newcomers have stayed up in the Premier League era was Fulham, Blackburn and Bolton Wanderers in 2001-02.\nBut, uniquely, this year the survival pattern has been replicated throughout the league pyramid with Sheffield United, Millwall and Bolton staying up in the Championship, Portsmouth, Plymouth Albion and Doncaster Rovers surviving in League One and Lincoln City and Forest Green Rovers maintaining their League Two status.\nEven AFC Fylde, Ebbsfleet, Maidenhead and Halifax stayed in the fifth tier National League after winning promotion the previous season.
