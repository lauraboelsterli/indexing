    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The government has proposed to Brazilian state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA that the Treasury compensate it for up to 1 billion reais ($274.04 million) in losses if it maintains a 10-percent reduction in diesel prices for 60 days, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\nTruckers are protesting across Brazil because of increases in fuel costs, paralyzing many vital sectors of Latin America’s largest economy.\nEarlier, a former minister of President Michel Temer’s government who is negotiating with truckers said that the government wants Petrobras to adjust fuel prices on a monthly basis, which would change its current policy of daily changes.\nReporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Writing by Brad Brook; editing by Grant McCool\n ",
