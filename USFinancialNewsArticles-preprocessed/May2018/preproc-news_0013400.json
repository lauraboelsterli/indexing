    "text": "May 4th, 2018 South America\nBrazilian investigators conducted one of their largest operations against graft ever on Thursday, targeting a money laundering ring linked to powerful politicians and businessmen that moved $1 billion through offshore accounts in 52 countries.\nFederal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro said that arrest warrants were issued for 53 people, nearly all of them black-market money changers. The information on illicit transactions for major companies and politicians those suspects have is certain to be “explosive,” one prosecutor said.\nAuthorities noted at a news conference that the “Car Wash” corruption investigation that began in 2014 and has morphed into one of the world’s largest anti-graft efforts began with the arrest of a single money changer.\n reuters.com",
