In total, 56% of our customers are now using Targeted Threat Protection. A total of 31% of customers used Mimecast in conjunction with Microsoft ® Office 365™ during the fourth quarter compared to 21% in the fourth quarter of 2017. More than 9,500 customers of all sizes have selected Mimecast to enhance their security, archive their data, and to provide uptime assurance for their Office 365 investments. Christina Van Houten joined Mimecast in the role of Chief Strategy Officer. She is responsible for corporate development, product management, and market strategy. Christina is a veteran of the enterprise technology industry, bringing more than two decades of experience with some of the world’s largest firms including Oracle, IBM, Infor Global Solutions, Netezza and ProfitLogic. Mimecast announced enhanced email cyber resilience with new detection, remediation and threat intelligence capabilities for Targeted Threat Protection. New features include supply chain impersonation protection, similar domain detection, the integration of automated intelligence feeds and the introduction of automated threat remediation capabilities.\nBusiness Outlook\nMimecast is providing guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2019.\nFirst Quarter 2019 Guidance:\nFor the first quarter of 2019, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28% and revenue is expected to be in the range of $76.3 million to $77.1 million. Our guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30, 2018 and includes an estimated positive impact of $2.8 million resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $9.0 million to $10.0 million.\nFiscal Year 2019 Guidance:\nFor the full year 2019, revenue is expected to be in the range of $327.0 million to $338.0 million or 23% to 27% revenue growth in constant currency. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations are positively impacting this guidance by an estimated $6.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $49.0 million to $51.0 million.\nGAAP net loss is the most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA differs from GAAP net loss in that it excludes depreciation, amortization, disposals and impairments of long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange (expense) income and includes rent paid in the period related to locations which are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities. Mimecast is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of these exclusions without unreasonable effort. Therefore, Mimecast has not provided guidance for GAAP net loss or a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMimecast will host a conference call to discuss these financial results for investors and analysts at 4:30 pm EDT (UTC-05:00) on May 14, 2018.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nRevenue Constant Currency Growth Rate. We believe revenue constant currency growth rate is a key indicator of our operating results. We calculate revenue constant currency growth rate by translating revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using the comparable foreign currency exchange rates from the prior fiscal period. To determine projected revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis for the first quarter and full year 2019, expected revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s monthly average foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin . We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key indicators of our operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude: depreciation, amortization, disposals and impairments of long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange (expense) income predominantly related to the elimination of intercompany balances and includes rent paid in the period related to locations which are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over revenue in the period.\nNon-GAAP net (loss) income. We define non-GAAP net (loss) income as net loss less share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, restructuring expenses and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of share-based compensation expense, certain other “one-time” charges and related income tax effects so that our management and investors can compare our recurring core business net results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net (loss) income versus net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. For example, as noted above, non-GAAP net (loss) income excludes share-based compensation expense, certain other “one-time” charges and related income tax effects. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP net (loss) income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net (loss) income and evaluating non-GAAP net (loss) income together with net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow . We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property, equipment and capitalized software, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow facilitates management’s comparisons of our operating results to competitors’ operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating our company is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and in the liquidity and capital resources discussion included in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release regarding management’s future expectations, beliefs, intentions, goals, strategies, plans or prospects, including, without limitation, the statements relating to our progress on achieving long-term financial targets, the future success of new products and services, and Mimecast’s future financial performance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis under the heading “Business Outlook” above, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws.

The key performance indicators that we monitor are as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, Year Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) Revenue constant currency growth rate (1) 33 % 45 % 38 % 39 % Revenue retention rate (2) 110 % 111 % 110 % 111 % Total customers (3) 30,400 26,400 30,400 26,400 Gross profit percentage 73 % 74 % 73 % 73 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 7,223 $ 3,554 $ 25,752 $ 11,802\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rates to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. (2) We calculate our revenue retention rate by annualizing constant currency revenue recorded on the last day of the measurement period for only those customers in place throughout the entire measurement period. We include add-on, or upsell, revenue from additional employees and services purchased by existing customers. We divide the result by revenue on a constant currency basis on the first day of the measurement period for all customers in place at the beginning of the measurement period. The measurement period is the trailing twelve months. The revenue on a constant currency basis is based on the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. (3) Reflects the customer count on the last day of the period rounded to the nearest hundred customers.
