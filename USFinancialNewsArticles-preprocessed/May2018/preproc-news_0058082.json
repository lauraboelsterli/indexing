    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 5:21 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Bayer says EU approves BASF as buyer of antitrust divestments Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nFRANKFURT, May 29 (Reuters) - Bayer said on Tuesday said the European Commission had approved BASF as a suitable buyer of the businesses Bayer will divest to win regulatory approval for the planned acquisition of Monsanto.\nThe EU commission, which is Europeâ€™s antitrust regulator, ruled in March that the assets Bayer agreed to shed are sufficient to approve the Monsanto deal, but it had yet to give a final nod on whether BASF would sufficiently stoke competition as new owner.\nBayer is close to wrapping up the Monsanto deal following months of delays. Earlier on Tuesday it won conditional U.S. antitrust approval for the $62.5 billion transaction. Reporting by Ludwig Burger Editing by Mark Heinrich",
