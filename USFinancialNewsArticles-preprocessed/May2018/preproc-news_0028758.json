The selling stockholders will receive all of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock sold by them in the offering. Virtu will retain no net proceeds from the offering.\nIn connection with the public offering, the underwriters have been granted an option to purchase up to 450,000 additional shares of Class A common stock from Havelock and up to 1,800,000 additional shares of Class A common stock from Virtu.
