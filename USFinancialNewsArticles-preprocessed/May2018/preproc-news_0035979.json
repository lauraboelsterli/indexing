    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New Pacific Metals Corp. (TSX-V:NUAG) (OTCQX:NUPMF) (“New Pacific” or the “Company”) today announced its unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for the corresponding period, which have been posted under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company's website at www.newpacificmetals.com . All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD) unless otherwise stated.\nFINANCIALS\nNet loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $258,719 or $0.00 per share (three months ended March 31, 2017 - net income of $1,570,466 or $0.02 per share). The Company’s financial results were mainly impacted by the following: (i) loss from investments of $35,551 compared to income of $2,420,122 in the prior year; (ii) foreign exchange gain of $474,432 compared to foreign exchange loss of $153,676 in the prior year; and, (iii) operating expenses of $748,893 compared to $698,410 in the prior year.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company was $2,906,517 or $0.02 per share compared to net income of $2,924,118 or $0.04 per share for nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nLoss from investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $35,551 (three months ended March 31, 2017 - income of $2,420,122). Within the loss from investments, loss of $76,987 from fair value change and interest earned on bonds was partially offset by gain of $40,235 on the Company’s equity investments.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, loss from investments was $543,962 compared to income of $3,741,354 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $748,893 (three months ended March 31, 2017 - $698,410). For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, operating expenses were $2,487,090 (nine months ended March 31, 2017 - $1,350,664).

The Company holds a large portion of cash and cash equivalents and bonds in US dollars while the Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the US dollar appreciated by 2.8% against Canadian dollar (from 1.2545 to 1.2894) while during the three months ended March 31, 2017 the US dollar depreciated by 0.8% against Canadian dollar (from 1.3427 to 1.3322).\nFor nine months ended March 31, 2018, foreign exchange loss was $64,763 (nine months ended March 31, 2017 – foreign exchange gain of $445,152).\nSILVER SAND PROJECT\nThe Company started the preparation work for the planned exploration program after the acquisition of the Silver Sand Project. In October 2017, the Company successfully received exploration permits required by the relevant Bolivian government authorities and immediately commenced a 30,000 metre exploration drilling program on the property. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, total expenditures of $2,292,123 and $3,646,522, respectively, were capitalized under the property.
