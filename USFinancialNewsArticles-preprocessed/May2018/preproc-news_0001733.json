    "text": "ROCKAWAY, N.J., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sussex Bancorp (Nasdaq:SBBX) announced today its corporate name change to SB One Bancorp. SB One Bancorp is the holding company for SB One Bank, a full-service, commercial bank that operates regionally with 14 branch locations in New Jersey and New York. In addition, the Company announced today the name change of its subsidiary Tri-State Insurance Agency, Inc. to SB One Insurance Agency, Inc.\nThe corporate name change was voted and approved during the shareholder meeting on April 25, 2018. The name changes were a part of a larger rebrand effort undertaken by Sussex Bank which merged with Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ earlier this year.\n“Now with an expanded footprint in the northern New Jersey market and increased potential for regional growth, it made sense to step back and evaluate our existing brand,” said Anthony Labozzetta, president and CEO of SB One Bank. “We determined that as a newly joined organization we wanted a new name and look for our Bank.”\nSB One Bank recently began rolling out its new brand identity in all of its locations as well as on its website and social media accounts. A print and digital advertising campaign has been launched to help build awareness around the Bank’s new name and appearance.\nFor more details on SB One Bank visit: www.SBOne.bank\nAbout SB One Bancorp\nSB One Bancorp (Nasdaq:SBBX), is the holding company for SB One Bank, a full-service, commercial bank that operates regionally with 14 branch locations in New Jersey and New York.
