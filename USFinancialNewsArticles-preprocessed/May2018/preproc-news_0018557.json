(NYSE:CBB), today announced financial results for its first quarter, ended March 31, 2018. For the first quarter, revenue increased from the prior year, driven by strong demand for fiber-based products and the contribution from the OnX Enterprise Solutions acquisition. Fioptics internet subscribers totaled 232,800 at the end of the first quarter, up 25,500 compared to a year ago. Fioptics video subscribers totaled 146,300, up 5,200 compared to the same period in 2017. During the quarter, the Company passed an additional 8,600 addresses with Fioptics, which is now available to 580,800 homes and businesses, expanding Cincinnati Bell's fiber network to reach more than 70% of Greater Cincinnati.\nLeigh Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cincinnati Bell, commented, \"Our solid first quarter performance reflects the continued execution of our strategy to expand our fiber network while advancing our digital-based products and services. The strength of our Fioptics suite of products and Enterprise Fiber network is evidence our strategy is working and further supports our ongoing investments in fiber densification.”\nMr. Fox continued, “In our IT services business, the integration of OnX is progressing well and we are confident we can leverage our extensive product portfolio and expanded footprint to tap into increased demand for strategic IT solutions across a diversified customer base.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nConsolidated revenue totaled $296 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 18% from the prior year.\nOperating income was $24 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $2 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $79 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $73 million in the prior year period.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $8 million, resulting in diluted loss per share of $0.26.\nEntertainment and Communications Segment\nEntertainment and Communications revenue of $174 million decreased $1 million year-over-year as growth in Fioptics and Enterprise Fiber partially offset Legacy revenue declines Fioptics revenue of $83 million, up $9 million year-over-year Enterprise Fiber revenue of $21 million, up $1 million year-over-year Operating income of $29 million, up $26 million year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA of $70 million, up $1 million year-over-year\nThe combination with Hawaiian Telcom represents an important step toward scaling Cincinnati Bell’s network of high-quality fiber assets, having the capacity to meet the demands of the growing IoT ecosystem, and delivering on the promise of 5G. The pending merger recently received approval from the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, and the regulatory review process is underway with the Federal Communications Commission. The Company continues to expect the transaction to close in the early second half of 2018.\nIT Services and Hardware Segment\nIT Services and Hardware revenue of $128 million, up $47 million year-over-year, reflecting a $45 million contribution from the OnX acquisition Consulting revenue of $38 million, up $21 million year-over-year Cloud revenue of $23 million, up $2 million year-over-year Communications revenue of $41 million, up $4 million year-over-year Infrastructure Solutions revenue of $26 million, up $19 million year-over-year Operating income of $1 million, consistent with the prior year period Adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, up $5 million year-over-year\nThe combination of CBTS and OnX supports the Company’s transformation to a leading North American hybrid IT solutions provider, with an expanded footprint of 20+ IT sales offices and the addition of approximately 2,000 new customers throughout the United States and Canada. The combined company’s hosted and managed IT services portfolio coupled with its enhanced scale enables Cincinnati Bell to capitalize on significant market opportunities in Unified Communications, Cloud, and Security services.\nCash Flow and Financial Position\nOperating cash flows totaled $59 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $54 million in the prior year. Free cash flow totaled $33 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $10 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $55 million in the same period last year with the expectation that full year 2018 capital expenditures will be between $190 million and $210 million.\nOn April 5, 2018, Cincinnati Bell amended its Credit Agreement, including the Tranche B Term Loan and revolving facility, dated October 2, 2017, to reduce the LIBOR interest rate spread by 50 basis points from the previous 3.75% per annum to 3.25% per annum.\n2018 Outlook\nCincinnati Bell reaffirms its previous 2018 financial guidance provided on February 15, 2018:\nCategory 2018 Guidance Range Revenue $1,200M - $1,275M Adjusted EBITDA $320M - $330M As a reminder, this revenue guidance reflects the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, effective January 1, 2018, and presents Infrastructure Solutions sales net of product cost. For reference, had the revenue standard not been effective, the Company’s revenue guidance range would have been $1,700 million to $1,775 million.\nThe Company's 2018 guidance does not include any contribution from the pending merger with Hawaiian Telcom.\nMr. Fox concluded, “We will continue to invest where we are winning while maintaining a disciplined approach to managing both our balance sheet and capital allocation to deliver long-term value for our shareholders and customers. We remain focused on growing our two distinct businesses, and creating platforms for sustainable free cash flow as we drive towards increasing valuation multiples associated with our fiber and IT services businesses.”\nChange in Segment Reporting and Revenue Recognition Standard\nAs previously announced, Cincinnati Bell has changed its segment and business unit financial reporting to align more closely with the Company’s broader strategy and how it manages business operations. Effective January 1, 2018, revenue is reported as follows in the Entertainment and Communications segment: Fioptics, Enterprise Fiber, and Legacy. In the IT Services and Hardware segment, revenue is reported by product practices, including Consulting, Cloud, Communications, and Infrastructure Solutions.\nIn addition to these changes, commercial Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (\"CLEC\") revenue, which was previously included in the Entertainment and Communications segment, is now reported within the IT Services and Hardware segment to consolidate all company-wide Voice over Internet Protocol (\"VoIP\") sales. Following the adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, effective January 1, 2018, Infrastructure Solutions sales are presented net of product cost.\nPrior period information has been adjusted to reflect the changes in segment presentation and adoption of the new revenue accounting standard.\nConference Call/Webcast\nCincinnati Bell will host a conference call on May 9, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its results for the first quarter of 2018.

These are non-GAAP financial measures used by Cincinnati Bell management when evaluating results of operations and cash flow. Management believes these measures also provide users of the financial statements with additional and useful comparisons of current results of operations and cash flows with past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures. Detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures have been included in the tables distributed with this release and are available in the Investor Relations section of www.cincinnatibell.com .\n1 Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of operational performance. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP operating income plus depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation, restructuring and severance related charges, (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets, transaction and integration costs, asset impairments, and other special items. During the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company revised its methodology to calculate Adjusted EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation expense to align more closely with its peer group. In addition, the presentation of EBITDA is adjusted for the amended accounting guidance adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018 and implemented retrospectively, which requires pension and postretirement benefit costs (excluding current service cost component) to be reported below operating income. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to comparable GAAP measures of profitability and may not be comparable with the measure as defined by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin provides a useful measure of operational performance. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as an alternative to comparable GAAP measures of profitability and may not be comparable with the measure as defined by other companies.\n2 Free cash flow provides a useful measure of operational performance, liquidity and financial health. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities, adjusted for capital expenditures, restructuring and severance related payments, transaction and integration payments, and preferred stock dividends. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flow from operating activities, or the change in cash on the balance sheet and may not be comparable with free cash flow as defined by other companies. Although the company feels there is no comparable GAAP measure for free cash flow, the attached financial information reconciles cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\nNet debt provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial health. The company defines net debt as the sum of the face amount of short-term and long-term debt, unamortized premium and/or discount and unamortized note issuance costs, offset by cash and cash equivalents.\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding special items in total and per share provides a useful measure of operating performance. Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders excluding special items should not be considered as an alternative to comparable GAAP measures of profitability and may not be comparable with net income (loss) excluding special items as defined by other companies.\nAbout Cincinnati Bell Inc.\nWith headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati Bell Inc.
