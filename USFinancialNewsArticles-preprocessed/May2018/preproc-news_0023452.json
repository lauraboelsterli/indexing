    "text": "A new video Tesla posted to YouTube shows an image of an unnamed vehicle partially hidden by a sheet, and footage of passengers reacting to the acceleration of Tesla's planned second-generation Roadster.\nThe video, posted Wednesday, first pointed out by electric vehicle blog Electrek , is a stab at generating hype around Tesla's brand days after CEO Elon Musk behaved antagonistically toward Wall Street analysts during the company's first-quarter earnings conference call.\nSome of the viewers on the video and in other venues are speculating the vehicle under the sheet is the planned Model Y , a crossover based on the Tesla Model 3 sedan, a $35,000 mass-market vehicle which is in high demand, but which Tesla has struggled to produce.\nTesla was not immediately available for comment.\nTesla On the call, Musk said Tesla will make the Model Y easier to produce than previous products. The Model 3 has been plagued both by repeatedly missed production targets, and reports of a high volume of flawed parts and extensive rework on vehicles .\n\"There's no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to produce than we have,\" Musk said. \"I think Model Y is going to be a manufacturing revolution.\"\nTesla is so far planning to begin production on the Model Y in 2020, Musk said on the call, later than the 2019 production date Reuters had previously reported .\nTesla plans to choose a facility for the Model Y no later than the fourth quarter, but will not be making it at Tesla's Fremont, California, production plant, which is already \"jammed to the gills,\" Musk said on the call.\nThe second-generation Roadster was unveiled along with the Tesla Semi in November of last year. Among other things, the Roadster is supposed to go from 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds. Tesla is currently taking $50,000 reservations for the Roadster, which will have a $200,000 base price.",
