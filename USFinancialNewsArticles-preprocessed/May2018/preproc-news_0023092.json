    "text": "NEW YORK, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--HempAmericana, Inc. (OTC:HMPQ) (“HempAmericana” or the “Company”) is excited to announce that it has acquired 4,000 lbs of high-quality Hemp Flower for processing at its new fully operational state-of-the-art CBD Oil extraction and production facility in Augusta, Maine. The Company expects the revenue in excess of $1mm from the 4k lbs.\nManagement now anticipates an imminent commencement of production activity. The company plans to use this initial 4,000 lbs of high-quality Hemp Flower as its initial production run for the Vitalis RL-245 high-capacity supercritical CO2 CBD Oil extraction machine (installed at the facility in April). The principal output will be CBD Isolate (cannabidiol in its purest form possible).\nThe CBD isolate extraction process begins with the production of a botanical concentrate comprised of elements including the base cannabinoid foundation, along with other ingredients including lipids and organics from the hemp plant. The next step is to further purify this compound to remove essentially everything but the CBD through a proprietary process. The result is an isolate powder comprised of 99% pure Cannabidiol.\nHempAmericana CEO, Salvador Rosillo, commented, “We are very grateful to our committed team and stakeholders for their support, patience, and vision over the past year. With the installation of key capital equipment at the Augusta facility and our new acquisition of top-tier hemp flower input for production activity, we are finally ready to do what we came here to do: make high quality CBD product for entry into this growing market, make it efficiently, and establish a high standard for a market that is still in its early stage of development.”\nThe Company is currently in late stage negations to secure an ample supply of follow-on product of blue-chip hemp flower for late 2018 production, as noted in its release of April 23, 2018.\nAbout HempAmericana, Inc.\nHempAmericana is currently in the rolling paper and CBD oil business using the brand name Weed Got Oil. Search Rolling Thunders hemp papers on YouTube for a product demonstration of the Company's papers. The company owns an extraction machine and now plans to become a leader in the CBD oil market by establishing three laboratories for the extraction and research of the oils contained in the hemp plant. HempAmericana also researches, develops and sells products mad of industrial hemp.
