    "text": "Precision medicine company names Chief Medical Officer, Chief Business Officer and Chief Technology Officer\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gemini Therapeutics , a biotechnology company pioneering precision therapeutics for patients with high-risk genetic profiles linked to dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and rare systemic diseases, today announced the appointment of Claude Knopf as chief business officer and Sandra Rojas-Caro, M.D., as chief medical officer. In parallel, the company also announced the promotion of senior vice president for process development and manufacturing, Scott Lauder, Ph.D., to chief technology officer.\nGemini’s first-in-class therapeutic candidates are matched to molecular abnormalities found in patients with high-risk genetic profiles. The company’s multimodal pipeline includes monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and AAV-mediated gene therapies.\n“I am extremely proud of the strong leadership team we are building at Gemini,” said James McLaughlin, CEO, president and co-founder of Gemini Therapeutics. “Sandra and Claude bring deep expertise and Scott has been an invaluable contributor to our early progress. Their combined skill and experience will be crucial as we harness genetic insights and technology to develop precision therapeutics for AMD and rare complement-mediated genetic diseases.”\nA seasoned executive and biotech veteran, Mr. Knopf joins Gemini from Pieris Pharmaceuticals, where he served as senior vice president and chief business officer and helped close key transformative partnering deals. Prior to that, he was senior vice president BD&L/M&A for Baxter Bioscience, and the spin-off Baxalta, where he helped expand the Oncology business and pipeline and strengthened the company’s Hematology and Immunology divisions. He also spent 12 years at Novartis in various leadership, business development and licensing roles in Europe and the United States. As chief business officer, Mr. Knopf will lead corporate development and oversee key operational functions as Gemini continues its growth trajectory and transitions to the next stage of its focused business model.\nDr. Rojas-Caro brings more than 20 years of experience across all phases of drug development, including successful global submissions, applied technology and translational biology environments. She was previously chief medical officer for Aeglea BioTherapeutics, a biotechnology company developing enzyme-based therapeutics to treat rare diseases and cancer. Prior to Aeglea, she served as group vice president of clinical research and development at Synageva BioPharma, where she played a key role in obtaining FDA approval of Kanuma for the treatment of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Dr. Rojas-Caro has also served as vice president and R&D project team leader for the Metabolic Rare Diseases Unit at Alexion following the acquisition of Synageva. As chief medical officer, Dr. Rojas-Caro will oversee the development and implementation of clinical and regulatory strategy and operations as Gemini advances multiple product development programs into the clinic.\nDr. Lauder is a protein chemist with a deep background in biologics CMC development—from discovery through manufacturing. Prior to joining Gemini, Dr. Lauder served as vice president of process sciences and clinical manufacturing at Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and global head of the Protein and Cell Sciences group at EMD Serono. Dr. Lauder has deep experience with a broad array of biologic formats including monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, as well as bispecifics and engineered fusion proteins, advancing many to clinical proof of concept. In his new role as chief technology officer, Dr. Lauder will oversee Gemini’s CMC team and development of translational technology for the company’s precision therapeutics.\nGemini Therapeutics\nGemini Therapeutics is a precision medicine company focused on creating first-in-class, disease-modifying precision therapeutics for high-risk genetically-defined patient populations. Our therapeutic candidates are matched to molecular abnormalities found in patients with high clinical need. Launched with funding from leading life science investors and powered by academic partnerships around the world, we are pioneering precision therapeutics for dry AMD and rare complement-mediated genetic diseases.\nFor more information, visit www.GeminiTherapeutics.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005400/en/\nTen Bridge Communications\nPaul Goldsmith, 617-697-3479\nPaul@Tenbridgecommunications.com\nSource: Gemini Therapeutics",
