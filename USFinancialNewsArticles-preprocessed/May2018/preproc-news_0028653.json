    "text": "TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE: 6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced the consolidated financial forecasts for the six months ending June 30, 2018 and forecasts of cash dividends.\n1. Consolidated forecasts for the six months ending June 30, 2018\n(January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018)\nIn millions of yen\nNet Sales Operating\nIncome\nOrdinary\nIncome\nNet Income\nAttributable to\nShareholders\nof Parent\nCompany\nNet\nIncome\nper Share\n(Yen)\nOriginal forecasts --- --- --- --- --- Forecasts as of May 11, 2018 382,000 35,000 32,000 34,000 20.39 Increase (decrease) --- --- --- --- --- Percent change --- --- --- --- --- Reference:\nCorresponding period of the previous year\n(January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017)\n374,553 31,560 30,456 36,281 21.76 The figures of the consolidated forecasts for the six months ending June 30, 2018 are sum of the results of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the forecasts of the three months ending June 30, 2018.\nThe consolidated forecasts for the six months ending June 30, 2018 are calculated at the rate of 107 yen per USD and 131 yen per Euro.\n2. Forecasts of cash dividends for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018\nDividends per share At the end\nof first\nquarter\nAt the end\nof second\nquarter\nAt the end\nof third\nquarter\nAt the end\nof year\nTotal Previous forecasts － － － － － Forecasts as of May 11, 2018\n0.00 － － － Results for the year ending December 31, 2018 －\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2017\n－ 0.00 － 0.00 0.00 For the year ending December 31, 2018, while the Group expects to post net income (net income attributable to shareholders of parent company) for the six months ending June 30, 2018, the Group regrettably will forego interim dividend payment for this period.\nThe Group will divert its retained earnings for strategic investment opportunities that will enable the Group to respond to rapid environmental changes to thrive in the global marketplace, and will aim to increase shareholder profit by improving corporate value. Based on a long-term standpoint, the Group aims to realize stable and sustained growth in profits to allow dividends to be reinstated.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the plan for year-end dividend payments remain undecided, and the Group will immediately announce it when the decisions are made.\nRefer to Renesas Electronics' press release “Renesas Electronics Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018” issued on May 11, 2018 for more details.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this press release with respect to the plans, strategies and financial outlook of Renesas Electronics and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively “we”) are forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. We caution you in advance that actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements due to several important factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions in our markets, which are primarily Japan, North America, Asia, and Europe; demand for, and competitive pricing pressure on, products and services in the marketplace; ability to continue to win acceptance of products and services in these highly competitive markets; and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly between the yen and the U.S. dollar. Among other factors, downturn of the world economy; deteriorating financial conditions in world markets, or deterioration in domestic and overseas stock markets, may cause actual results to differ from the projected results forecast.\nAbout Renesas Electronics Corporation\nRenesas Electronics Corporation ( TSE: 6723 ) delivers trusted embedded design innovation with complete semiconductor solutions that enable billions of connected, intelligent devices to enhance the way people work and live—securely and safely.
