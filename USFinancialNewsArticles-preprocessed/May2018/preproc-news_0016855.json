    "text": "DALLAS and FORT WORTH, Texas, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:NEOS), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative extended-release (XR) products using its proprietary modified-release drug delivery technologies, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided a business update.\n“Our unique and differentiated commercial ADHD franchise continued to perform well and was driven by the sales growth of our two leading products, Adzenys XR-ODT® and Cotempla XR-ODT®. In fact, our net product sales in 2018 grew 91% over the same period last year and reached over $10 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. As we continue our efforts to take a greater share of the ADHD market, we are very pleased to report that we have now completed the transition of bringing our sales force in house as Neos employees, thereby gaining cost and operating efficiencies,” said Vipin K. Garg, Ph.D., President and CEO of Neos Therapeutics. “With the February launch of Adzenys ER™, we are focused on the commercial success of all three products as well as developing our pipeline using our high-value proprietary modified-release drug delivery technology.”\nCommercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA\nNeos’ three commercial Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) products are Adzenys XR-ODT ® , Cotempla XR-ODT ® and Adzenys ER™ which launched in May 2016, September 2017 and February 2018, respectively. In order to most accurately represent the number of prescriptions filled, going forward the company will be utilizing cumulative TRx numbers verses EUTRx (Extended Units), which was formerly used and based on dispensed pills.\nCumulative TRx (1Q18) Cumulative TRx (1Q17) Year-over-year increase Cumulative TRx since launch\n(as of 4/27/18) Patients switching from another medication\n(as of 4/20/18) Adzenys XR-ODT ® 60,334 31,122 93.9 % 288,405 71 % Cotempla XR-ODT ® 32,829 N/A N/A 55,096 77 % TOTAL 93,163 31,122 199.3 % 343,501 N/A Additional Commercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA\nPrescription Trends for Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT Continuing to Grow: The cumulative total number of TRx combined for the two XR-ODT products, Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT, were 93,163 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 33.6% over the 69,745 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Cotempla XR-ODT Launch is off to a Solid Start: Prescriptions for Cotempla XR-ODT grew rapidly during the three months ended March 31, 2018, reaching 13,634 monthly TRx for March 2018. Monthly prescriptions for Cotempla XR-ODT have grown 73.8% since its launch in September 2017. The Number of Prescribers of Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT Continues to Grow : As of December 31, 2017, 10,870 health care providers had written prescriptions for Adzenys XR-ODT since its launch, and 1,949 health care providers had written prescriptions for Cotempla XR-ODT since its launch. As of the week ended April 13, 2018, those numbers had increased to 12,518 and 5,029, respectively. Patient Switching from Another ADHD Medication Continues to be an Important Driver of Product Uptake : Doctors are continuing to switch patients over from other ADHD medications to both Adzenys XR-ODT (71% switching) and Cotempla XR-ODT (77% switching).\nCorporate Updates\nOn April 1, 2018, the Company completed the transition of bringing its sales force in house as Neos employees. The Company continues to have Neos representatives in approximately 125 territories nationwide. As discussed at the Company’s analyst day in March 2018, the Company plans to advance its drug candidate for the treatment of nausea and vomiting into the clinic in the second half of 2018 and to identify one additional branded product candidate in CNS or gastroenterology in 2018.\nSelect Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company now recognizes branded product net revenue at the point in time it delivers product to the wholesalers, including estimates of product returns. Previously, branded product net revenue was recognized based on filled prescriptions, which did not have a product return component.\nTotal product revenues were $10.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, total product revenues were $8.8 million for the Company’s ADHD products and $1.9 million for generic Tussionex.\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change Adzenys XR-ODT $ 5.0 $ 3.1 61.3 % Cotempla XR-ODT $ 3.6 N/A N/A Adzenys ER $ 0.2 N/A N/A Generic Tussionex $ 1.9 $ 2.5 (24.0 )% Total $ 10.7 $ 5.6 91.1 % The Company reported a gross profit of $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a gross profit of $0.9 million for the same period in 2017. Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $1.7 million and remained flat compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses were $13.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. The first quarter increase was principally due to marketing expenses to support the launches of Cotempla XR-ODT and Adzenys ER which commenced on September 5, 2017, and February 26, 2018, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $3.3 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2017. The Company reported a net loss of $14.4 million, or $0.50 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $17.2 million, or $0.88 per share, for the same period in 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company held $37.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nConference Call Details\nNeos management will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss results and provide a company update at 8:30 a.m. ET today.
