EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable compensation of its employees. EXL believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in accordance with GAAP for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, EXL’s inability to predict its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the currency fluctuations and associated tax impacts: as such EXL presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. EXL also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.\nThe information provided on a constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency rates. EXL’s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian Rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine Peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the Indian Rupee decreased from 66.46 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to 64.64 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, representing appreciation of 2.7%. The average exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the Philippine Peso increased from 50.05 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to 51.85 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, representing a depreciation of 3.6%. The average exchange rate of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar increased from 1.24 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to 1.40 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, representing appreciation of 12.9%. This information is provided because EXL believes that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s operating performance.\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, and the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA (Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net Income/(loss) (GAAP) $ 23,158 $ 16,788 $ (9,355 ) add: Income tax (benefit)/expense (4,453 ) 3,560 28,944 subtract: Interest expense, foreign exchange gain, net, loss from equity-method investment and other income, net (3,555 ) (3,136 ) (3,289 ) Income from operations (GAAP) $ 15,150 $ 17,212 $ 16,300 add: Stock-based compensation expense (a) 5,074 5,956 6,270 add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (b) 3,947 3,498 3,483 add: Provision for litigation settlement (c) 2,400 — — Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP) $ 26,571 $ 26,666 $ 26,053 Adjusted operating income margin as a % of Revenues (Non-GAAP) 12.8 % 14.6 % 13.2 % add: Depreciation 6,557 5,874 6,577 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 33,128 $ 32,540 $ 32,630 Adjusted EBITDA margin as a % of revenue (Non-GAAP) 16.0 % 17.8 % 16.5 % (a) To exclude stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718.\n(b) To exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\n(c) To exclude provision for litigation settlement during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income/(loss) (GAAP) $ 23,158 $ 16,788 $ (9,355 ) add: Stock-based compensation expense (a) 5,074 5,956 6,270 add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (b) 3,947 3,498 3,483 add: Effect of tax impact from Tax Reform Act (c) (4,836 ) — 29,185 subtract: Tax impact on stock-based compensation expense (d) (5,913 ) (4,260 ) (5,063 ) subtract: Tax impact on amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (726 ) (951 ) (947 ) add: Provision for litigation settlement, net of tax (e) 1,788 — — Adjusted net income (Non-GAAP) $ 22,492 $ 21,031 $ 23,573 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 0.64 $ 0.60 $ 0.67 (a) To exclude stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718.\n(b) To exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\n(c) To include impact related to the Tax Reform Act. The Company recognized a one-time income tax expense of $29,185 during the three months ended December 31, 2017, comprised of a provisional deemed repatriation tax expense of $27,236 and a provisional net deferred tax expense of $1,949. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded adjustment of $4,836 reducing the provisional transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. The one-time incremental income tax expense reflects certain assumptions based upon the Company’s interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Reform Act evolves over time. Any further changes would be reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment in the period in which they are recorded.\n(d) Tax impact include $4,827 and $2,057 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively, and $2,627 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 related to discrete benefit recognized in income tax expense on adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\n(e) To exclude provision for litigation settlement during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nContact: Steven N.
