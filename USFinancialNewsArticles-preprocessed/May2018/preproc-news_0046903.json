    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 4:26 PM / in 34 minutes Global M&A hits record $2 trillion in year to date Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions have already reached $2 trillion in 2018, a record for the value of deals in the period, Thomson Reuters data showed on Tuesday.\nA flurry of deals at the start of the week, particularly in the United States with the $11.1 billion merger of GE’s ( GE.N ) transportation business and rail equipment maker Wabtec ( WAB.N ), helped reach the milestone.\nThe last two periods when M&A reached similar levels were in 2007 ($1.8 trillion), a year before the financial crisis and in 2000 ($1.5 trillion), just before the bursting of the dot.com bubble of technology and internet related stocks.\nAbout $28 billion in U.S. deals were announced on Monday, with activity in power, financials, and real estate.\nEurope has also seen a deals boom, with April recording the highest value of monthly deals in 10 years, Thomson Reuters data shows, while M&A activity between the United States and Britain hit a 19-year high of $89.6 billion.\nAnd globally, M&A shows no sign of pausing, with Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) saying on Tuesday it would pay $2.3 billion for control of EMI, becoming the world’s largest music publisher.\nMeanwhile, German conglomerate Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) is closing in on a $62.5 billion takeover of U.S. Monsanto ( MON.N ).\nTo view a graphic on MNA, click: reut.rs/2GI5RmS Reporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Alexander Smith",
