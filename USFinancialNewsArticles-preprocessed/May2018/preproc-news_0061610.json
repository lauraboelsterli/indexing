The bank’s shares have been sliding since it launched a rights issue in mid-May with an issue price of 3.11 dirhams per new share. The rights trading period ends on May 30.\nIn Saudi Arabia, the index rose 0.5 percent, lifted by gains in banking and petrochemical shares. Alinma Bank and Bank Aljazira rose 0.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Blue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corporation climbed 1.7 percent.\nThe Qatari index closed flat, after surging earlier this week because of rising blue-chip stocks and government plans to allow full foreign ownership of companies.\nIn Abu Dhabi, banking shares such as First Abu Dhabi Bank and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank gained 1.2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. The index rose 0.6 percent.\nSAUDI ARABIA * The index gained 0.5 percent to 8,000 points.\nDUBAI * The index fell 0.2 percent to 2,925 points.\nABU DHABI * The index increased 0.6 percent to 4,575 points.\nQATAR * The index was flat at 9,126 points.\nKUWAIT * The index gained 0.4 percent to 4,712 points.\nBAHRAIN * The index edged up 0.2 percent to 1,263 points.\nOMAN * The index climbed 0.2 percent to 4,598 points.\nEGYPT * The index went up 1.3 percent to 17,006 points.\n$1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
