(“Paycom”) (NYSE: PAYC), a leading provider of comprehensive, cloud-based human capital management software, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"Our momentum continued into 2018,\" said Chad Richison, Paycom's founder and chief executive officer. \"We performed well across all aspects of our business, deploying several enhancements to our solution, expanding our sales organization and developing our internal talent to assume even more responsibility and leadership. I am encouraged by our achievements and believe they position us well for success throughout the year.”\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nTotal Revenues of $153.9 million represented a 29% increase compared to total revenues of $119.5 million in the same period last year. Recurring revenues of $151.9 million increased 29% from the comparable prior year period and constituted 99% of total revenues.\nGAAP Net Income was $41.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $33.7 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the same period last year, as adjusted 1 .\nAdjusted EBITDA 2 was $80.7 million, compared to $60.3 million in the same period last year, as adjusted 1 .\nNon-GAAP Net Income 2 was $55.8 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to $35.5 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the same period last year, as adjusted 1 .\nCash and Cash Equivalents were $68.1 million as of March 31, 2018.\nTotal Long-Term Debt was $35.3 million as of March 31, 2018.\n1 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (Topic 606)” (”ASU 2014-09”). All prior period amounts and disclosures have been recast to comply with the new standards, as indicated by the “as adjusted” footnote.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the discussion below under the heading \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures.\nFinancial Outlook\nPaycom provides the following expected financial guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 and the year ending December 31, 2018. Please note that this guidance reflects the January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU 2014-09:\nQuarter Ending June 30, 2018\nTotal Revenues in the range of $123.0 million to $125.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the range of $43.0 million to $45.0 million.\nYear Ending December 31, 2018\nTotal Revenues in the range of $545.0 million to $547.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the range of $220.0 million to $222.0 million.\nWe have not reconciled the Adjusted EBITDA ranges for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 or the year ending December 31, 2018 to net income because applicable information for future periods, on which this reconciliation would be based, is not readily available due to uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, taxes, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of our interest rate swap and other items. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these Adjusted EBITDA ranges to net income is not available at this time without unreasonable effort.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we consider and have included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess the performance of our core business operations and for planning purposes. We define (i) Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses, loss on early repayment of debt, that are not core to our operations (if any) and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap and (ii) non-GAAP net income as net income plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations (if any), loss on early repayment of debt and the change in fair value of our interest rate swap, all of which are adjusted for the effect of income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are metrics that provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core business operations across periods on a consistent basis, as well as comparisons with the results of peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement results under GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure that provides useful information to management about the amount of cash available for reinvestment in our business, repurchasing common stock and other purposes. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures presented in this press release, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP net income in isolation, nor as a substitute for net income or other consolidated statements of income data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income may not be comparable to similar titled measures of other companies, and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.\nConference Call Details:\nIn conjunction with this announcement, Paycom will host a conference call today, May 1, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its financial results.
