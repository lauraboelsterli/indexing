    "text": "PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zoe's Kitchen, Inc. (\"Zoës Kitchen\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:ZOES) today reported financial results for the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018.\nResults for the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018, as compared to the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017:\nTotal revenue increased 12.7% to $102.1 million. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.3%. 11 new Company-owned restaurants opened. Income from operations decreased from $1.7 million to a loss from operations of $1.8 million. Restaurant contribution* decreased 8.2% to $16.5 million, or 16.2% of restaurant sales. Net loss of $3.6 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $19.0 thousand, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share. Adjusted net loss* of $2.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA* decreased 30.9% to $5.6 million.\n(*) Restaurant contribution, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income (loss) are non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of restaurant contribution to income (loss) from operations; EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) to GAAP net income (loss); and why the Company considers these non-GAAP measures useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.\nKevin Miles, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zoës Kitchen, commented, “Our results in the first quarter were challenged as comparable restaurant sales declined 2.3%. Weather and calendar shifts aside, trends softened sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to decelerating dine-in traffic. Early results in the second quarter have not shown significant improvement, necessitating a downward revision to our annual guidance.”\nMiles continued, “While we are encouraged by results coming from investments in digital, delivery, and menu innovation, it is imperative that we take aggressive actions to re-focus our efforts on building sales and improving financial performance. To do so, we will slow our future new unit growth and conduct a thorough review of under-performing restaurants. Additionally, we are taking steps to reduce our G&A infrastructure and will re-allocate resources towards marketing and technology initiatives to drive sales.\"\nMiles concluded, “We have a strong foundation of success at Zoës Kitchen, built on high-quality fresh food, inspired by the Mediterranean lifestyle and delivered with hospitality. We are fully committed to reversing our traffic trends and our team is laser focused on operational execution and sales driving initiatives. We believe the steps we are taking are right for the long-term health of the brand and to maximize shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue, which includes restaurant sales from Company-owned restaurants and royalty fees, increased 12.7% to $102.1 million in the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018, from $90.6 million in the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017. Restaurant sales for the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018 were $102.0 million, an increase of 12.7% from $90.5 million in the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017.\nComparable restaurant sales decreased 2.3% during the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018, consisting of a 4.4% decrease in transactions and product mix offset by a 2.1% increase in price. The comparable restaurant base includes those restaurants open for eighteen full periods or longer and included 199 restaurants as of April 16, 2018.\nRestaurant contribution decreased 8.2% to $16.5 million in the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018, from $18.0 million in the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017. As a percentage of restaurant sales, restaurant contribution margin decreased 3.7% to 16.2% as increases in labor and store operating expense rates were partially offset by lower cost of goods rates.\nThe increase in labor and store operating expense rates was driven by the dilutive effect on margins from our newest restaurants, which, on average, initially operate at less than system-wide average sales volumes and incur some inefficiencies for a short period of time. In addition, labor rates increased because of hourly wage rate inflation while store operating expense rates increased due to costs related to marketing.\nNet loss for the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018 was $3.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $19.0 thousand, or $0.00 per diluted share, for the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017. Adjusted net loss was $2.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018, compared to adjusted net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the sixteen weeks ended April 17, 2017.\nDevelopment\nThe Company opened 11 new Company-owned restaurants during the sixteen weeks ended April 16, 2018. As of April 16, 2018, there were 251 Company-owned restaurants and three franchised restaurants. As of May 24, 2018, the Company has opened four additional restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 258.\nFY 2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, the Company is revising its outlook as follows:\nTotal revenue between $345 million and $352 million (revised from $358 million to $368 million). Comparable restaurant sales of negative 2.0% to negative 4.0% (revised from flat to 2.0%). Approximately 25 Company-owned restaurant openings (unchanged from previous guidance). Restaurant contribution margin between 16.0% and 17.0% (revised from 17.3% to 18.4%). General and administrative expenses between 10.8% and 11.0% of total revenue, inclusive of $3.7 million of non-cash equity based compensation expense (revised from 10.6% to 10.8%).\nThe Company is initiating certain strategic actions to improve operations and financial performance. The full financial impact of these actions has not yet been determined and is not currently included in the Company’s revised outlook. These actions will include slowing new unit growth, evaluating under-performing restaurants, reducing general and administrative expenses, and increasing marketing and technology investments. These actions will likely have a material impact to our financial statements in fiscal year 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Hosting the conference call will be Kevin Miles, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sunil Doshi, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 877-407-3982 or for international callers by dialing 201-493-6780.

A restaurant becomes comparable in its 18th full fiscal period of operation. The Company presents comparable restaurant sales on a fiscal calendar basis. As a result, our comparable restaurant sales calculation may not correspond exactly to the related calendar periods.\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs, which are cost of sales, labor, and store operating expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is restaurant contribution as a percentage of restaurant sales.\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as EBITDA plus loss from disposal of equipment and pre-opening costs.\nAdjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) plus the provision for income taxes; less an estimated tax rate of 24%.\nOur first fiscal quarter consists of sixteen weeks and each of our second, third and fourth fiscal quarters consists of twelve weeks, except for a fifty-three week year when the fourth quarter has thirteen weeks.\nAbout Zoës Kitchen\nFounded in 1995, Zoës Kitchen is a fast-casual restaurant group serving a distinct menu of fresh, wholesome, made-from-scratch, Mediterranean-inspired dishes delivered with warm hospitality.
