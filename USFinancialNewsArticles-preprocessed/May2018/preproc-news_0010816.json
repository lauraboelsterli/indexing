    "text": "TULSA, Okla., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ONE Gas, Inc. (NYSE: OGS) today announced financial results for its first quarter 2018; declared its quarterly dividend; and affirmed its 2018 financial guidance.\nHighlights include:\nFirst-quarter 2018 net income was $90.8 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, compared with $76.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017; First-quarter results include a $0.05 per diluted share contribution from the share-based compensation accounting standard adopted in the first quarter 2017; Actual heating degree days across the company's service areas were 5,262 in the first quarter 2018, 1 percent warmer than normal and 31 percent colder than the same period last year; and The board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 cents per share, or $1.84 per share on an annualized basis, payable on June 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018.\n\"Our first-quarter results reflect our continued emphasis on investing in our natural gas distribution systems, while effectively controlling expenses,\" said Pierce H. Norton II, president and chief executive officer. \"The safety and reliability of natural gas delivery to our more than 2 million customers remains our focus. We also continue to work with our regulators to determine the effect of tax reform and begin returning the benefit to our customers.\"\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nONE Gas reported operating income of $130.3 million in the first quarter 2018, compared with $129.4 million in the first quarter 2017.\nNet margin increased by $0.8 million compared with first quarter 2017, which primarily reflects:\nA $5.1 million increase from new rates primarily in Texas and Kansas; A $2.5 million increase from the impact of the weather-normalization mechanisms in Kansas and Oklahoma; A $2.5 million increase due primarily to higher transportation volumes; A $1.2 million increase attributed to net residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas; A $0.9 million increase due to a compressed natural gas excise tax credit that was enacted in February 2018 and retroactive to 2017; and A $0.8 million increase in rider and surcharge recoveries due to a higher ad-valorem surcharge in Kansas, which is offset with higher regulatory amortization expense; offset by A $12.3 million decrease related to the deferral of potential refund obligations from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFirst-quarter 2018 operating costs were $118.8 million, compared with $120.8 million in the first quarter 2017, due primarily to a $1.1 million decrease in outside service expenses.\nFirst-quarter 2018 depreciation and amortization expense was $38.9 million, compared with $37.0 million in the first quarter 2017, due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense from capital investments placed in service and an increase in the amortization of the ad-valorem surcharge rider in Kansas.\nResults for the first quarter 2018 reflect lower income tax expense of approximately $16.2 million due primarily to the decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate to 21 percent in 2018 from 35 percent in 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nCapital expenditures were $86.6 million for the first quarter 2018, compared with $70.5 million in the first quarter 2017, due primarily to increased system integrity activities and extending service to new areas.\nThe company ended the first quarter 2018 with $44.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $415.3 million of credit available under its $700 million credit facility. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2018, was 42 percent, and the ratio of long-term debt to capitalization was 37 percent.\nKey Statistics: More detailed information is listed in the tables.\nActual heating degree days in the Oklahoma service area were 1,870 in the first quarter 2018, 5 percent colder than normal and 34 percent colder than the same period last year; Actual heating degree days in the Kansas service area were 2,489 in the first quarter 2018, 2 percent warmer than normal and 25 percent colder than the same period last year; Actual heating degree days in the Texas service area were 903 in the first quarter 2018, 10 percent warmer than normal and 44 percent colder than the same period last year; Residential natural gas sales volumes were 61.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the first quarter 2018, up 38 percent compared with the same period last year; Total natural gas sales volumes delivered were 79.8 Bcf in the first quarter 2018, up 38 percent compared with the same period last year; Natural gas transportation volumes were 64.9 Bcf in the first quarter 2018, up 6 percent compared with the same period last year; and Total natural gas volumes delivered, including transportation volumes, were 144.8 Bcf in the first quarter 2018, up 22 percent compared with the same period last year.\n> View earnings tables\nREGULATORY ACTIVITY\nOklahoma\nIn March 2018, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its second annual Performance-Based Rate Change (PBRC) application following the general rate case that was approved in January 2016. The filing was based on a calendar test year of 2017. The PBRC filing identified a $5.6 million credit to base rates primarily due to the reduction in the corporate federal statutory income tax rate. If approved as filed, the credit will be applied to customers' bills over a 12-month period following receipt of an order. The filing also requested an energy-efficiency program true-up and a utility incentive adjustment of approximately $2.1 million. An order is expected in the third quarter 2018.\nTax Reform:\nIn compliance with the order approved in January 2018, Oklahoma Natural Gas' March 2018 PBRC filing contained two deferred liabilities subject to review and potential refund. First, a regulatory liability has been established reflecting the revaluation of accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) for the change in the federal corporate income tax rate. This liability will be returned to customers over an amortization period in compliance with tax normalization rules included in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An additional $2.9 million liability, which includes interest, has been established for the estimated impact on customer rates of the reduced tax rate for the period between January 9, 2018, and the date new rates are expected to go into effect following receipt of an order in the PBRC filing.\nKansas\nIn April 2018, a bill expanding the scope of the Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) statute was approved. Beginning January 1, 2019, the scope of projects eligible for recovery under the statute will include all expenditures to replace, upgrade or modernize obsolete facilities, as well as projects that enhance the integrity of pipeline system components or extend the useful life of such assets. Safety-related investments will also include expenditures for physical and cyber security. Additionally, the cap on the monthly residential surcharge will increase to $0.80 from $0.40.\nTax Reform:\nIn March 2018, Kansas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) Staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the period between January 1, 2018, and through the date on which the KCC issues a final order in Kansas Gas Service's next general rate case, Kansas Gas Service will accrue monthly, as a regulatory liability on its general ledger, the portion of its revenue representing the difference between the 21 percent and 35 percent corporate tax rate. The annual amount of the regulatory liability is $14.1 million, excluding interest. The agreement also established the interest rate to be applied as the customer deposit interest rate, currently 1.62 percent. The disposition of the amount accrued as a regulatory liability will be determined by the KCC in its final order at the completion of Kansas Gas Service's next general rate case filing. Through the agreement, Kansas Gas Service has also established a regulatory liability to account for the revaluation of ADIT for the change in the federal corporate income tax rate. Issues regarding the treatment of the regulatory liability will be determined in Kansas Gas Service's next general rate proceeding. As part of the agreement, Kansas Gas Service will file a general rate case no later than 150 days from the date of a KCC order approving the settlement agreement.\nKansas Gas Service expects to file a rate case by July 2018 based on a 2017 test year, with new rates effective in 2019.\nTexas\nWest Texas Service Area:\nIn March 2018, Texas Gas Service made filings under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) for all customers in the West Texas service area requesting an increase of $3.5 million. If approved, new rates are expected to become effective in July 2018.\nTax Reform:\nIn March 2018, Texas Gas Service requested a $4.7 million decrease to rates for customers in the West Texas service area due to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, and a one-time refund of $2.4 million for changes to the corporate income tax rate for the period between January 1, 2018, to the date new rates are implemented. If approved, new rates are expected to become effective in July 2018.\nRio Grande Valley Service Area:\nIn March 2018, the Texas Railroad Commission approved an increase in revenues of $0.5 million for the unincorporated areas of the Rio Grande Valley service area, with new rates effective in April 2018. The settlement reflects a corporate federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent and requires Texas Gas Service to calculate, defer and begin refunding to customers $0.1 million associated with the changes to the corporate income tax rate for the period between January 1, 2018, to the implementation of new rates in April 2018.\nTax Reform:\nIn March 2018, Texas Gas Service requested a $1.5 million decrease to rates for customers in the incorporated areas of the Rio Grande Valley service area due to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, and a one-time refund of $0.4 million for changes to the corporate income tax rate for the period between January 1, 2018, to the implementation of new rates in April 2018.\nCentral Texas Service Area:\nIn March 2018, Texas Gas Service made GRIP filings for all customers in the Central Texas service area requesting an increase of $3.3 million. If approved, new rates are expected to become effective in July 2018.\nTax Reform:\nIn March 2018, Texas Gas Service requested a $4.9 million decrease to rates for customers in the Central Texas service area due to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, and a one-time refund of $2.5 million for the reduction in the corporate tax rate for the period between January 1, 2018, to the date new rates are implemented. If approved, new rates are expected to become effective in July 2018.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE AFFIRMED\nONE Gas affirmed its 2018 financial guidance, with net income expected to be in the range of $156 million to $168 million, or approximately $2.96 to $3.20 per diluted share.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be $375 million in 2018, with 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects.\nRate base in 2018 is expected to average $3.4 billion, with 42 percent in Oklahoma, 30 percent in Kansas and 28 percent in Texas. ONE Gas expects to achieve a 7.3 percent return on equity in 2018, which is calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nThe ONE Gas executive management team will conduct a conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (10 a.m. Central Daylight Time).
