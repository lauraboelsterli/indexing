    "text": "0 COMMENTS S&P Global is searching for potential bolt-on acquisitions. Photo: AP\nS&P Global Inc. is on the hunt for smaller, bolt-on deals and is considering whether to buy or build a presence in China, said Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen.\nThe New York-based ratings and information provider is looking for acquisition targets for under $100 million to add to its data analysis capabilities.\n“I could see us doing more acquisitions in this space,” Mr. Steenbergen said in an interview with CFO Journal.\nMr. Steenbergen is looking for a company that can analyze unstructured datasets, similar to Panjiva Inc., a machine-learning and analytics firm that S&P Global bought in February for an undisclosed sum.\nS&P Global plans to expand its suite of benchmarks and indexes and to extend the offering of its fixed income business, particularly in areas such as environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) and smart beta, a type of exchange-traded fund, Mr. Steenbergen said.\nThe company also is preparing to make a decision on whether to acquire a credit ratings firm in China or to set up its own presence there. “We are currently not present in the domestic market in China,” said Mr. Steenbergen.\nChinese authorities recently relaxed the rules around foreign ratings firms in China, a shift that presents S&P with the choice to either buy an existing domestic ratings firm or start up its own, Mr. Steenbergen said.\n“Chinese regulators want the market to become more mature,” he said, adding that foreign players like S&P Global could help achieve that goal.\nA decision could be made soon, Mr. Steenbergen said, without providing more detail. He is traveling to China this week, his second trip this year.\nS&P Global also plans to take a minority stake in several emerging markets ratings firms, Mr. Steenbergen said. S&P Global already owns stakes in ratings companies in India, Taiwan and Thailand, he said.\nShare this: MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS Previous CFO Moves: United, Blue Apron, Ferrari, Dunelm ",
