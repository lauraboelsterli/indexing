Morgan Asset Management. ** Transport firms, in particular shipping companies, led the rally on the mainland, with Cosco Shipping Holdings closing up 7.4 percent. Analysts said the “ceasefire” of the trade war is positive for shipping demand and port throughput. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was firmer by 0.22 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed 0.31 percent higher. ** At 0700 GMT, the yuan was Quote: d at 6.3859 per U.S. dollar, 0.14 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3767. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Inner Mongolia Lantai Industrial Co Ltd up 10.05 percent, followed by Jiangsu Zhongtian Technology Co Ltd gaining 10.04 percent and Hunan Salt Industry Co Ltd up by 10.02 percent. ** The largest percentage losers in the Shanghai index were Shandong Tyan Home Co Ltd down 5.01 percent, followed by Harson Trading China Co Ltd losing 4.33 percent and Future Land Holdings Co Ltd down by 3.41 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 2.8 percent, the CSI300 has fallen 2.7 percent, while China’s H-share index listed in Hong Kong is up 5.8 percent. Shanghai stocks have risen 4.29 percent this month. ** About 16.45 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 116.9 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 14.07 billion shares a day.
