    "text": "MANILA, May 8 (Reuters) - The Philippinesâ€™ agricultural production rose 1.47 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, driven by gains in crop, livestock and poultry sectors, the statistics agency said on Tuesday ahead of the release of GDP data on May 10.\nThat marks the fifth straight quarter of increased output in agriculture, although the percentage gain was the smallest of those five periods, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed.\nCrop output, accounting for 54 percent of total agricultural production, grew 1.8 percent, with the paddy rice harvest up 4.6 percent. Livestock was up 2.1 percent and poultry climbed 5.2 percent, but fisheries output contracted 4.6 percent.\nAgricultural output has accounted for about a tenth of gross domestic product in recent quarters.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz Editing by Joseph Radford\nOur ",
