    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels wants to improve the image of the stalls selling one of its most famous delicacies, the potato fry, aiming to make the often downtrodden establishments more appealing to tourists.\nFritkot owner Kemal Vucitrna tosses fries in a fries stand in Brussels, Belgium, May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Belgians take great pride in their fries, traditionally sold doused in mayonnaise and in a paper cone from so-called “fritkots”, shacks found near the larger squares and main avenues of the city.\nBut the stalls are not always as appealing as their produce.\n“Tourists may think ‘Well, actually, would I like to buy something there? It looks a bit shabby,’” said Thomas Hick, one of the architects that city authorities have asked to revamp the outlets.\nThe new fritkots will feature a reflective aluminium facade, tiled interior and be equipped with rooftop solar panels and a rainwater harvesting system to make them more environmentally sustainable.\nThey are set to be in place by late 2019.\nThere are about 5,000 fritkots over Belgium, making them 10 times more common, per capita, than McDonald’s restaurants in the United States.\nOn busy days, popular Brussels establishments such as Maison Antoine and Frit Flagey can attract very long queues.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Reporting by Verity Crane; Writing by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
