    "text": "Highlights\nVolume of 143.8 million pounds, an increase of 7.4% year-over-year; First quarter 2018 earnings include Alumet, while 2017 earnings include $3 million related to recovery of insurance proceeds; Net income and diluted earnings per common share decreased $1.7 million to $15.8 million and $0.08 per share to $0.71 per share, respectively; Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.2 million to $34.0 million year-over-year; Adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased to $0.82 from $0.73 in the prior year period; The Company reaffirms 2018 full-year guidance; and The Company declares a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share.\nSCHAUMBURG, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BRSS) (“GBC” or the “Company”) reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Operating Results\nVolume for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 9.9 million pounds, or 7.4%, to 143.8 million pounds compared to 133.9 million pounds in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in volumes includes 14.2 million pounds of incremental volume from our Alumet acquisition. A.J. Oster grew base volumes in the automotive, electronics / electrical components, and stamping markets. A.J. Oster and Chase Brass both experienced decreased demand in the building and housing market. Olin Brass grew volumes in the reroll market, but that was more than offset by decreases in the munitions, coinage and automotive markets.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. A.J. Oster continues to improve operationally and the integration with Alumet is achieving targeted results. Olin Brass effectively managed product profitability and operational costs to achieve solid productivity and profitability improvement despite lower volumes. Chase Brass posted solid financial performance and continued to create unique value by providing their customers with outstanding quality and service. Our cash position continues to be strong and we remain focused on driving profitable growth,” said John Wasz, GBC's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $471.8 million from $419.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the metal cost recovery component stemming from increased metal prices and Alumet activity. Adjusted sales, our non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the value-added premium over metal replacement cost recovery, increased $14.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to our Alumet acquisition ($13.7 million). A reconciliation of net sales to adjusted sales is provided later in this press release.\nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. for the first quarter was $15.8 million in 2018, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $17.5 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, in 2017. The decrease can be attributed to the net of the following:\nUnfavorable fluctuations in unrealized gains / losses on derivative contracts of $1.6 million; Increased depreciation expense of $0.6 million; Increased tax expense of $0.3 million; Increased income generated from Alumet, a business we acquired in November 2017; Costs incurred of $0.7 million associated with an environmental incident at an Olin Brass facility; Decreased share based compensation expense of $0.8 million; Decreased interest expense of $0.4 million; Favorable scrap spreads resulting in decreased cost of goods sold; The absence of a $3.0 million benefit recorded in cost of goods sold in the prior year related to the recovery of insurance proceeds associated with our 2016 production outage; and Approximately $2.3 million more of expense recorded in the prior year for unusual costs associated with our transition to an HSA medical plan, increased costs of goods sold due to inventory reductions at Olin Brass, and costs incurred at A.J. Oster related to its ERP implementation.\nAdjusted EBITDA, our non-GAAP measure of consolidated profitability, was $34.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. As compared to the prior year's first quarter and excluding the $3.0 million of income related to the recovery of insurance proceeds, our Adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.8 million as we had approximately $2.3 million more of unusual costs in the prior year, as mentioned above, we generated $1.5 million from our Alumet acquisition, and our variable conversion costs increased at Chase Brass.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share, another non-GAAP measure, was $0.82 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.73 in the prior year. A reconciliation of diluted net income attributable to GBC per common share to adjusted diluted earnings per common share is provided later in this press release. Adjusted diluted earnings per share fluctuated for reasons similar to the fluctuation in Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to a decrease in interest expense.\nCash Flow and Leverage\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we generated $13.7 million of cash from operating activities largely due to cash from earnings, partially offset by cash outflows for working capital.\nWe ended the quarter with cash of $57.9 million, $315.2 million outstanding under our term loan facility, and $195.4 million available under our asset-based revolving loan facility.\n2018 Guidance\nWe affirm our full-year 2018 guidance and expect:\nShipment volumes to range from 570 million pounds to 610 million pounds; and Adjusted EBITDA to range from $127 million to $137 million.\nDue to the forward looking nature of Adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, as we are unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular unrealized gains / losses on derivative contracts, LIFO liquidation gains / losses and lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, for future periods due to market volatility.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company’s common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend will be paid on May 25, 2018 to stockholders of record on the close of business on May 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference and webcast at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Friday, May 4, 2018 to review the results. To listen to the live call, individuals can access the webcast approximately 10 minutes before the scheduled start time at the investor relations portion of the Company's website at http://ir.gbcholdings.com , or by dialing 855-878-0250, passcode #7076548.

Our US GAAP-based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude the following:\nunrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in support of our balanced book approach; unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative contracts related to energy and utility costs; impact associated with lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory; gains and losses due to the depletion of a last-in, first out (“LIFO”) layer of metal inventory; share-based compensation expense; refinancing costs; restructuring and other business transformation charges; inventory step-up costs related to acquisition accounting; specified legal and professional expenses; and certain other items.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA represents a meaningful presentation of the financial performance of our core operations because it provides period-to-period comparisons that are more consistent and more easily understood. We also believe it is an important supplemental measure that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the key metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate segment performance in a way that we believe reflects our core operating performance, and in turn, incentivizes members of management and certain employees. For example, we use adjusted EBITDA per pound in order to measure the effectiveness of the balanced book approach in reducing the financial impact of metal price volatility on earnings and operating margins, and to measure the effectiveness of our business transformation initiatives in improving earnings and operating margins. However, our adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In addition, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by using adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with US GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such US GAAP measurements include operating income and net income.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share\nDiluted net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. per common share is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted diluted earnings per common share. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is defined as diluted net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. per common share adjusted to remove the per share impact of the add backs to EBITDA in calculating adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents a meaningful presentation of the financial performance of our consolidated results because it provides period-to-period comparisons that are more consistent and more easily understood. We also believe it is an important supplemental measure that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is the key metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the Company’s performance, and in turn, incentivize members of management and certain employees.\nWe believe that adjusted diluted earnings per common share supplements our US GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the results of our business, and we believe it is useful to our investors and other parties for these same reasons. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by US GAAP.\nAdjusted sales\nNet sales is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure to adjusted sales, which represents the value-added premium we earn over our conversion and fabrication costs. Adjusted sales is defined as net sales less the metal cost of products sold. We use adjusted sales on a consolidated basis to monitor the revenues that are generated from our value-added conversion and fabrication processes excluding the effects of fluctuations in metal costs. We believe that adjusted sales supplements our US GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the results of our business, and we believe it is useful to our investors and other parties for these same reasons.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “projects,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions.
