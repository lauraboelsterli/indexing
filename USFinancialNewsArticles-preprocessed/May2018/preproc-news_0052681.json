    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 7:52 PM / a few seconds ago UPDATE 1-Chile's Pinera taps businessman Benavides as Codelco chairman Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Adds background on Benavides, upcoming challenges faced by Codelco, mining minister’s comment)\nSANTIAGO, May 25 (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera named Juan Benavides, a former chief executive officer of Chile retail leader Falabella, as chairman of the board of directors at Codelco, the world’s top copper producer, the government said on Friday.\nBenavides was currently serving as chairman at Chilean private pension fund manager AFP Habitat.\nThe 60-year-old Benavides had previously led Falabella, one of Latin America’s largest retailers with operations spanning department stores, supermarkets, malls and financial services.\nBenavides will help guide Codelco, which produces nearly 10 percent of the world’s copper, through a critical period of transition as it seeks financing from the government for a $39 billion, 10-year overhaul of its sprawling but aging mines.\nSeveral of those projects, including work on the century-old El Teniente and Chuquicamata mines, now face delays for technical reasons and rising costs.\nChile mining minister Baldo Prokurica said Benavides’ appointment “responded to the need to modernize the company, generate profitability for the state and improve labor conditions for its workers.”\nThe state-run miner last year delivered $3 billion in profits to Chile’s coffers and accounted for 16 percent of the South American nation’s exports. It is responsible for more than a third of Chile’s copper production.\nA conservative billionaire who took office in March, Pinera has promised stable financing, improved management and efficiency at Codelco.\nUnder center-left President Michelle Bachelet, Codelco advanced a mine project in Ecuador and eyed investments as far off as Mongolia. But slumping copper prices until mid-2017 complicated financing at home and abroad.\nCurrent CEO Nelson Pizarro and outgoing board Chair Oscar Landerretche, both appointed by Bachelet, together spearheaded a belt-tightening program at Codelco that has allowed the company to maintain productivity despite a 9 percent drop in ore grades since 2013.\nIt is still unclear whether Pizarro will keep his job or whether the new board will pick a fresh face.\nPinera earlier this month appointed former mining minister Hernan de Solminihac and Ignacio Briones, a professor at Adolfo Ibanez University, to Codelco’s board.
