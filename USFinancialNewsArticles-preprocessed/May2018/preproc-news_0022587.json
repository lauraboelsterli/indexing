Merapi Volcano spewing smoke and ash in Boyolali, Central Java, Indonesia May 11, 2018, in this still image obtained from a video by social media. Instagram @Febriacs/via REUTERS\nThe Mount Merapi volcano on densely populated Java island is one of the most active in Indonesia and a series of eruptions in 2010 killed more than 350 people.\nA disaster mitigation agency told residents living within a 5 km (3 mile) radius of the mountain to move to shelters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.\nHe said that 120 people who had been hiking up Merapi were safe.
