    "text": "8 COMMENTS Anyone watching last week’s carefully choreographed meeting between China’s President Xi Jinping and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be forgiven for forgetting that barely eight months earlier the two nations’ troops had a tense 72-day border standoff in the Himalayas.\nIn the central Chinese city of Wuhan—where Mao Zedong once swam across the Yangtze River along with 5,000 followers—Mr. Xi and his guest struck a series of poses that suggested bonhomie and goodwill between the leaders of the world’s two most populous countries.\nStanding beneath a stone arch, they admired vivid pink plum blossoms. They sipped tea together on a boat. At a local museum, a classical Chinese orchestra serenaded Messrs. Modi and Xi with a 1980s Bollywood tune. Between these excursions, the two leaders held talks, flanked by dark-suited officials.\nFor India, which seeks to be seen as China’s peer, the visit hit the right public notes. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement referred repeatedly to the two countries’ celebrated “oriental civilizations.” A Chinese official pointed out that Mr. Xi had only stepped out of Beijing twice to host a foreign leader—both times for Mr. Modi.\nAhead of the visit, an op-ed in China’s state-owned Global Times declared a “new chapter in Sino-Indian relations.” During last year’s Himalayan standoff, the same newspaper launched a series of diatribes against impertinent India.\nIf China and India were indeed in the midst of a reset, to borrow the overused term, the consequences would ripple across the region and beyond. The Trump administration would need to reconsider casting India as one of two “bookends of stability” (along with the U.S.) of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” Smaller nations, long used to Beijing and New Delhi jostling for influence, would have to adapt.\nIn reality, however, even the best Chinese orchestra cannot serenade away the deep-rooted problems between the two countries.\n“The Wuhan summit is not an entirely new path. It’s more like getting back to an even keel,” says Tanvi Madan, an expert on India-China ties at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “India and China have tried this before, and it hasn’t changed things.”\nIndian suspicion toward communist China dates back to 1962, when the two countries fought a brief but bitter border war, which China won. Despite 20 rounds of talks, their 2,200-mile border remains disputed. Over the decades China has helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons and missile expertise.\nMore recently, China has stalled India’s entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a consortium of nations that governs trade in civilian nuclear technology. China has also prevented the United Nations Security Council from blacklisting Masood Azhar, the Pakistan-based founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The group was implicated in a 2001 attack on India’s Parliament and has long been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.N. and the U.S. State Department.\nMeanwhile China continues to make inroads in South Asia, vying to displace Indian influence in smaller countries such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Last year’s Himalayan crisis, in which Indian troops blocked Chinese efforts to build a road on territory claimed by Indian ally Bhutan, was widely viewed in New Delhi as a Chinese bid to increase its influence in the tiny Himalayan kingdom.\nOn the whole, Mr. Modi has appeared more willing to play hardball with China than his predecessors. India was the only major country to skip last year’s glittering Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. The U.S. and European nations later echoed some of New Delhi’s concerns about Chinese infrastructure projects, including the contention that they often place an unsustainable debt burden on poor countries.\nChinese expansionism has pushed India closer to the U.S. and Japan. Last year India allowed the revival of the so-called Quad, a loose grouping of the region’s four leading democracies: the U.S., Japan, Australia and India. And New Delhi publicly shares international concerns about maintaining open sea lanes in the South China Sea despite Beijing’s expansive territorial claims in the region.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Wuhan visit contained an undeniable element of Indian kowtowing. In order not to offend Beijing, India appears to have swallowed its concerns about the Maldives’ tilting toward China. India has also turned down an Australian request to give the Quad teeth by joining this year’s Malabar naval exercises with India, the U.S. and Japan. In February, the Indian government issued a circular advising government officials to skip Tibetan commemorations marking 60 years of the Dalai Lama’s exile in India.\nIn an interview in Washington last month, Lobsang Sangay, president of the Dharamsala, the India-based Tibetan government in exile, said the circular sent a mixed message to neighboring countries. “It appears that the Chinese put a lot of pressure and India gave a concession,” Mr. Sangay said.\nWhether intentionally or not, Mr. Modi’s visit signals weakness. Several analysts speculate that the prime minister worries about a border skirmish with China jeopardizing his re-election prospects next year.\nNonetheless, making nice with a powerful neighbor at a sensitive time is a lot easier than reorienting an entire country. Nearly 60 years of India-China rivalry cannot be reversed by even the prettiest photo opportunities.",
