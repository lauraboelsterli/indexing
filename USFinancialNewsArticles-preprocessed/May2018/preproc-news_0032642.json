(Reuters) - Brooks Koepka made the second albatross at the par-five 16th in the history of the Players Championship when he holed a “little” six-iron during the final round on Sunday.\nThe feat helped the reigning U.S. Open champion match the course record of nine-under-par 63 at TPC Sawgrass.\nKoepka found himself 206 yards from the 16th hole after a 300-yard drive.\nWith the hole located only six yards from a water hazard to the right, Koepka aimed slightly left and hit a big, high shot that landed softly, took one bounce and disappeared into the cup.\n“It was just a three-quarter six-iron,” Koepka said, meaning he swung softly.\n“We thought it was perfect. I was aiming 15 feet left and just kind of started it a little bit left and it faded with the wind right on line.”\nThe only previous albatross at the hole was by Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello last year.\nKoepka finished tied for 11th at 11-under 277, seven strokes behind winner Webb Simpson.\nKoepka was delighted with his performance in his third event back after missing more than three months with a left wrist injury.\n“I’ve been knocking on the door,” said the American.\n“It’s just sometimes when you’re off for four months you come back, you need to play a little bit, get some rhythm and it’s nice to finally shoot a low one.\n“There’s nobody more excited to be here than me. To get back out it felt like it took forever. The days were very long.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Toby Davis / Ian Ransom",
