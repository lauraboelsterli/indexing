    "text": "NEW YORK, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P. Carey Inc. (NYSE: WPC) (W. P. Carey or the Company), a net lease real estate investment trust, today reported its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal Company\nNet income attributable to W. P. Carey of $65.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share\nAFFO of $138.4 million, or $1.28 per diluted share\nQuarterly cash dividend raised to $1.015 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $4.06 per share\nAffirm 2018 AFFO guidance range of $5.30 to $5.50 per diluted share\nBusiness Segments\nOwned Real Estate\nSegment net income attributable to W. P. Carey of $45.3 million\nSegment AFFO of $114.9 million, or $1.06 per diluted share\nAcquisitions and completed capital investment projects totaling $106.2 million\nTen active capital investment projects for a total commitment of $139.3 million at quarter end\nGross disposition proceeds totaling $35.5 million\nPortfolio occupancy of 99.7%\nWeighted-average lease term of 9.7 years\nInvestment Management\nSegment net income attributable to W. P. Carey of $20.0 million\nSegment AFFO of $23.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share\nBalance Sheet and Capitalization\nIssued €500 million of 2.125% Unsecured Senior Notes due 2027\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"For the 2018 first quarter, we generated AFFO per diluted share of $1.28, up 2.4% from the same period last year, and we are affirming our full year guidance range of between $5.30 and $5.50 per diluted share based on the current strength of our pipeline and the breadth of opportunities available to us,\" said Jason Fox, Chief Executive Officer of W. P. Carey. \"We also continued to make progress executing on our strategy to create long-term shareholder value by maximizing recurring revenue streams, continuing to improve the overall quality of our portfolio, simplifying our business and managing our balance sheet to reduce risk and enhance our cost of capital.\"\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAs previously announced, as a result of its decision to exit non-traded retail fundraising activities in June 2017, the Company revised its segment presentation recognizing equity income earned through its ownership interests in the Managed REITs and its special member interests in the operating partnerships of the Managed REITs within its Investment Management segment. Prior to the 2017 second quarter, these items were recognized within its Owned Real Estate segment. For purposes of comparability, segment financial statements for all periods presented have been revised to reflect this change.\nRevenues\nTotal Company: Revenues excluding reimbursable costs (net revenues) for the 2018 first quarter totaled $190.3 million, up 1.2% from $188.1 million for the 2017 first quarter.\nOwned Real Estate: Owned Real Estate net revenues for the 2018 first quarter were $171.4 million, up 4.8% from $163.5 million for the 2017 first quarter, due to higher lease revenues resulting primarily from a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar and rent escalations, partially offset by the impact of planned dispositions.\nInvestment Management: Investment Management net revenues for the 2018 first quarter were $18.9 million, down 23.2% from $24.6 million for the 2017 first quarter, due primarily to the cessation of dealer manager fees resulting from the Company's exit from non-traded retail fundraising and lower structuring revenues.\nNet Income Attributable to W. P. Carey\nNet income attributable to W. P. Carey for the 2018 first quarter was $65.3 million, up 13.6% compared to $57.5 million for the 2017 first quarter, due primarily to a higher aggregate gain on sale of real estate.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\nAFFO for the 2018 first quarter was $1.28 per diluted share, up 2.4% from $1.25 per diluted share for the 2017 first quarter, due primarily to rent escalations, lower interest expense and a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower structuring revenues.\nNote: Further information concerning AFFO, a non-GAAP supplemental performance metric, is presented in the accompanying tables and related notes.\nDividend\nAs previously announced, on March 15, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.015 per share, equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of $4.06 per share. The dividend was paid on April 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 29, 2018.\nAFFO GUIDANCE\nFor the 2018 full year, the Company affirms that it expects to report AFFO of between $5.30 and $5.50 per diluted share, based on the following key assumptions:\n(i) investments for the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $500 million and $1 billion;\n(ii) dispositions from the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio of between $300 million and $500 million; and\n(iii) total general and administrative expenses of between $65 million and $70 million.\nNote: The Company does not provide guidance on net income. The Company only provides guidance on AFFO and does not provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to net income due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain items necessary to provide such reconciliation as a result of their unknown effect, timing and potential significance. Examples of such items include impairments of assets, gains and losses from sales of assets and depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CAPITALIZATION\nEuro-Denominated Bond Issuance\nAs previously announced, on March 6, 2018, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of €500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Senior Notes due April 15, 2027. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to repay its term loans, reduce secured mortgage debt and reduce amounts outstanding under its unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOWNED REAL ESTATE\nInvestments\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, the Company completed total investments of $106.2 million, comprised of two acquisitions totaling $85.2 million and one build-to-suit project placed into service at a total cost of $21.0 million, including transaction-related costs and fees.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had ten active capital investment projects for an expected total investment of approximately $139.3 million, of which $88.5 million is currently expected to be completed during 2018.\nDispositions\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, the Company disposed of five properties for total gross proceeds of $35.5 million.\nComposition\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's Owned Real Estate portfolio consisted of 886 net lease properties, comprising 85.4 million square feet leased to 208 tenants, and two hotel operating properties. As of that date, the weighted-average lease term of the net lease portfolio was 9.7 years and the occupancy rate was 99.7%.\nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT\nW. P.
