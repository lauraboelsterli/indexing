Net loss was negatively impacted by a $0.7 million increase in income tax expense or ($0.03) per basic and ($0.03) per diluted common share in 2018 compared to the same period on 2017. Revenue was $25.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $21.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.8 million or 17.4%. Combined UK and Other Foreign Market Segments revenue was $9.8 million for the period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.5 million or 5.6%. Cash sales were $27.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $24.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.2 million or 13.1%. Total operating costs and expenses were $26.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $22.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.5 million or 15.5%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing a period-over-period decrease of $0.4 million. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in current liabilities for deferred revenue in 2018.\n\"We continue to execute on our key business initiatives, resulting in continued increases in revenue, customer fulfillment, and cash sales growth; while continuing to make progress in our new brand development and enhanced course delivery capabilities during the first quarter of 2018,” said Anthony Humpage, Legacy Education Alliance CEO. “As we begin this 25 th year of service, we are focused on maintaining our leadership as a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate, and financial markets investing strategies and techniques.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 VERSUS FIRST QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nRevenue was $25.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $21.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue increased $3.8 million or 17.4% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in revenue was due to increased attendance (i.e. fulfillment) of $2.7 million or 14.1% and from expired contracts of $1.1 million or 37.9%.\nTotal operating costs and expenses were $26.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $22.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $3.5 million or 15.5%. The increase was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in direct course expenses, a $1.0 million increase in advertising and sales expenses, a $0.7 million increase in royalty expense and a $0.5 million increase general and administrative expenses.\nNet loss was ($0.9) million or ($0.04) per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of ($0.3) million or ($0.01) per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase in net loss of ($0.6) million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted common share. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was partially offset by the increase in revenue primarily due to increased attendance (i.e. fulfillment) of $2.7 million or 14.1% and from expired contracts of $1.1 million or 37.9%. Net loss was negatively impacted by a $0.7 million increase in income tax expense or ($0.03) per basic and ($0.03) per diluted common share in 2018 compared to the same period on 2017.\nCASH FLOW AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing a period-over-period decrease of $0.4 million.
