    "text": "ENCINO, Calif., May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Research Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB: RSSS), a provider of workflow efficiency solutions for R&D-driven organizations, reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Highlights vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nTotal revenue increased 10% to $7.3 million. Platform revenue up 81% to $489,000, with a 79% increase in total Platform deployments to 208. Annual recurring revenue was up 76% to $2.0 million. Transaction revenue up 7% to $6.8 million, with customer count up 8% to 1,059. Transaction count up 3% to 219,607. Total gross margin up 240 basis points to 26.3%. Net loss from continuing operations was $0.3 million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or $(0.03) per share.\nManagement Commentary\n\"Our third quarter demonstrates the continued momentum in our strategy to deliver unique workflow efficiency solutions to research-driven organizations in life sciences, technology and academia,\" said Peter Derycz, president and CEO of Research Solutions. \"This can be seen in our fourth consecutive quarter of approximately 10% total revenue growth and annual recurring revenue in our SaaS Platforms business that has surpassed $2 million.\n\"We expect our momentum to continue in the remainder of 2018 as we launch version 2.1 and 2.2 of our Platform framework, supported by powerful weekly releases or improvements to smart applications we develop called 'gadgets.' This will be supported by a sales and marketing team that we are reconstructing to drive optimum efficiency and investment returns.\"\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased 10% to $7.3 million compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter.\nPlatform subscription revenue increased 81% to $489,000 compared to $271,000 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to a 79% increase in the total number of paid Platform deployments to 208. The quarter ended with annual recurring revenue up 76% to $2.0 million (see the company's definition of annual recurring revenue below).\nTransaction revenue increased 7% to $6.8 million compared to $6.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. Total active customers increased 8% from 985 to 1,059, and transaction count increased 3% from 213,000 to 220,000 (see the company's definition of active customer accounts and transactions below).\nTotal gross margin increased 240 basis points to 26.3% from 23.9% in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by a 100 basis point increase in Transactions gross margin and a revenue mix shift to the higher-margin Platforms business.\nTotal operating expenses decreased to $2.2 million compared to $2.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the continued optimization of sales and marketing resources and open positions.\nNet loss from continuing operations improved to $0.3 million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or $(0.03) per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $(0.1) million compared to $(0.6) million in the year-ago quarter (see definition and further discussion about the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, below).\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $4.8 million compared to $5.8 million at June 30, 2017. There were no outstanding borrowings under the company's $2.5 million revolving line of credit. Apart from a $0.2 million office lease liability due to new accounting guidance for leases, the company had no long-term liabilities or other debt.\nFurther details about these results are available in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is available in the investor relations section of the company's website at www.researchsolutions.com.\nConference Call\nResearch Solutions President and CEO Peter Derycz and CFO Alan Urban will host an investor conference call to discuss these results and the company's outlook, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Tuesday, May 15, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational dial-in number: 1-631-891-4304\nConference ID: 10004686\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

The quantity of customers per month is defined as customers with at least one transaction during the month.\nA transaction is an order for a unit of copyrighted content fulfilled or managed in the Platform.\nThe company defines annual recurring revenue as the value of contracted Platform subscription recurring revenue normalized to a one-year period.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measure â€“ Adjusted EBITDA\nResearch Solutions' management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the company's operating results.\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense, other income (expense), foreign currency transaction loss, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, income from discontinued operations, gain on sale of discontinued operations, and other potential adjustments that may arise.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss):\nQuarter Ended March 31,\nNine Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet Income (loss)\n$ (195,987)\n$ (637,490)\n$ 441,503\n$ (1,593,532)\n$ (1,891,116)\n$ 297,584\nAdd (deduct):\nInterest expense\n(2,000)\n3,000\n(5,000)\n4,000\n9,000\n(5,000)\nOther income (expense)\n(13,769)\n(10,143)\n(3,626)\n(37,883)\n(20,277)\n(17,606)\nForeign currency translation loss\n(9,737)\n6,272\n(16,009)\n(22,609)\n27,227\n(49,836)\nProvision for income taxes\n10,531\n5,544\n4,987\n32,098\n28,486\n3,612\nDepreciation and amortization\n32,768\n33,906\n(1,138)\n119,666\n96,801\n22,865\nStock-based compensation\n114,340\n112,326\n2,014\n715,147\n518,012\n197,135\nIncome from discontinued operations\n-\n(141,616)\n141,616\n-\n(460,131)\n460,131\nGain on sale of discontinued operations\n(69,277)\n-\n(69,277)\n(205,779)\n-\n(205,779)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ (133,131)\n$ (628,201)\n$ 495,070\n$ (988,892)\n$ (1,691,998)\n$ 703,106\nAbout Research Solutions\nResearch Solutions, Inc.
