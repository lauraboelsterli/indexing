    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - The United States is not seeking a trade war with China and top U.S. officials are looking to make a deal with Beijing, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday as talks between the two nations were set to resume.\nKudlow also said that the United States and China should both take down trade barriers as part of any agreement. “Everyone is looking for some kind of deal,” he told Politico in an interview, adding that no agreement had been reached yet.
