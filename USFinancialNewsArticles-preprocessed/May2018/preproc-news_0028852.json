    "text": "Florida-Based Healthcare, Technology and Tele-Pharmacy Services Provider Shows 24% Increase in Prescriptions Filled\nReports March 2018 Revenue of $1.9M as Largest Single Month in Company History\nMIAMI, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB:RXMD), a healthcare services and technology organization providing prescription pharmaceuticals, compounded medications, health risk management and tele-pharmacy services, today announced financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, and provided an overview of recent operational highlights along with updates on the Company’s strategies.\nThe Company dispensed a total of 64,000 prescriptions in Q1, a 24% increase over Q1 2017. Revenue for the month of March 2018 was the largest single month in the Company’s history, totaling $1.9 million. For the period ending March 31, 2018, Progressive Care showed net revenue of $5,147,345, which was an increase of 7.36% year-over-year. Progressive Care’s total assets were $3,846,041 as of March 31, 2018, compared to $2,581,113 as of March 31, 2017 -- an increase of 49%.\nThe Company continues to grow its patient base by marketing to doctors' offices and clinics who refer their patients to the pharmacy. Healthcare providers are increasingly recommending Progressive Care subsidiary PharmCo because of its high standards of patient care and attention to performance measurements and their implications. Based on the performance in the first quarter, management expects that future growth will be driven by continued expansion into new market territories, concentrated efforts toward developing our compliance and adherence services provided to medical providers, and enhancement of technological opportunities that boost loyalty and customer satisfaction.\n“The first quarter was a time of momentous growth for the Company,” said S. Parikh Mars, CEO of Progressive Care Inc. “During the first three months of the year we were able to secure a Palm Beach County location, recognize record revenues and prescriptions filled, and deliver increased value to our shareholders. We believe that our unique breadth of services and expanding penetration with customers in new markets will help us maintain sustainable growth in the future.”\nMars continued: “We are proud to have achieved clarity and efficiencies this year in an industry that is very difficult to navigate. We have come a long way since December 2017, but the hardest work is still ahead.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Progressive Care Inc. achieved the following milestones and significant events:\nReported record-breaking sales and growth numbers\nIn March 2018, the Company reported $1.9 million in revenue, the largest single month in its history to date. Progressive Care also experienced increases in prescriptions filled, reporting an 18% year-over-year increase in February, 2018, and 34% increase in January, 2018, as compared to the same months last year. As a result of the Company’s four-pillar structure (expertise in healthcare, patient care, pharmaceutical management, and customer service), Progressive Care reported a record $20 million in sales in 2017.\nOfficially began accepting Bitcoin for pharmacy sales\nAs part of Progressive Care’s plans to evolve its retail pharmacy’s technology and operations and enhance its e-commerce platform use, the company became one of the few pharmacies in the country to enable and accept cryptocurrency for daily purchases. PharmCo, LLC will use external payment providers, such as BitPay, to process all Bitcoin payments. This will allow the pharmacy to reach more customers who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies for daily purchases.\nFurthered growth and expansion plans through pharmacy acquisition\nThe Company signed a letter of intent to acquire a Touchpoint RX pharmacy in Palm Beach County and executed definitive agreements to close in the second quarter of 2018. The acquisition will facilitate the Company’s growth plans by increasing the delivery radius into Martin County, which includes Jupiter and Stuart, and will decrease costs of expansion and increase prescription dispensing efficiency.\nInvestor analyst upgraded Company’s price target to $0.35 per share\nAs a result of the Company’s significant progress with license applications in new markets, expansion in Palm Beach, and continued innovations in tele-pharmacy and the acceptance of Bitcoin for payment, SeeThruEquity initiated updated coverage and increased its price target to $0.35 per share.\nMaintained steady investor relations activity\nThe Company actively communicated with its customers and shareholders through various investor announcements and also maintained a presence at industry events. These efforts included: Released an open letter to shareholders from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, S. Parikh Mars, in January, 2018, highlighting significant achievements, key highlights in 2017, and a forward-looking statement for opportunities in 2018 Provided a progress report and outlook for investors in an audio interview with SmallCapVoice.com to discuss the business model, current market, achievements and goals for the Company Company CEO S. Parikh Mars participated in an interview with Everett Jolly on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” Podcast to discuss its uplisting to the OTCQB\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet Revenue: For the period ending March 31, 2018, Progressive Care showed net revenue of $5,147,345, as compared to revenue of $4,794,376 for the period that ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 7.36%.\nBalance Sheet: Total Assets for the company were $3,846,041 as of March 31, 2018, compared to $2,581,113 as of March 31, 2017, an increase of 49%.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Operating cash flow increased from $-8,641 to $309,827 year-over-year, which is an increase of over 3,000%.\nFor more information about Progressive Care, please visit the company’s website .
