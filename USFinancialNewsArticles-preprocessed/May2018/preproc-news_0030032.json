FILE PHOTO: A black bear stands in a wooded area in Newton, New Jersey, July 12, 2015. New Jersey, the U.S. State most densely populated by humans, is also thick with black bears, and wildlife officials are set to vote on August 11, 2015 on a plan to expand hunting season months after the state's first fatal attack. Photo taken July 12, 2015. REUTERS/Barbara Goldberg/File Photo\nThe attack happened about 2:30 a.m on Sunday, when the child went outside to check on a noise she thought her dog had made.\nThe girl’s mother heard screaming. “When she went outside to investigate, she witnessed a large black bear dragging her ...daughter,” the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) agency said in a statement.\nThe bear dropped the child after her mother yelled at it, officials said.\nThe child, whose name was not released, was in a fair condition early Monday at a local hospital, NBC affiliate KKCO said.\n“Our officers are actively searching for the bear and will do so overnight and as long as it takes,” said Mike Porras, a spokesman for the CPW’s Northwest Region office.\nWildlife agents were hunting for the bear with tracking hounds and had set traps to catch it. If captured, the animal would be killed, Porras said.\nThe attack took place in East Orchard Mesa, a small community near the Colorado River and about 250 miles (400 km) west of Denver.
