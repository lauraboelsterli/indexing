    "text": "ATLANTA, May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CHILDS Advisory Partners – a leading provider of middle-market investment banking services and The M&A Advisor's 2016 \"Boutique Investment Banking Firm of the Year\" – announced today that it is changing its corporate name to Bowstring Advisors. The name change reflects the vision of founder and CEO, Jim Childs, and the evolution of the firm's expanding team of senior bankers, which has executed 77 M&A transactions since 2014.\n\"We're the same dedicated, middle-market experts who pride ourselves on being a humble, hungry and smart team. The only difference is our name,\" said Childs. \"A bowstring joins the two ends of the bow and launches the arrow. The new name better describes our mission to give clients guidance and counsel that propels them and their companies forward.\"\nThe change is effective immediately, and the new name and logo were unveiled yesterday at the company's 9 th annual conference at the St. Regis in Atlanta, Georgia. Over 500 company owners, private equity firm executives and media representatives were among the first to see the new logo and branding elements and hear the implementation strategy.\n\"It's exciting to see firsthand how well-received the announcement was among the people who matter the most – the clients we advise and partners we work with on a daily basis. The name change wasn't something that we took lightly,\" said Childs. \"One thing we know for certain is that there is an awareness and appreciation of our values, and that's something we will absolutely preserve and even build upon with the new brand. Our commitment to always be straightforward with our counsel and smart with our approach remains the same.\"\nThe name change is the culmination of a nearly year-long effort that involved outside research and more than 80 one-on-one interviews with employees, private companies, private equity firms and past prospects. \"It's always a fine line to walk when considering a name change, and we were cognizant of that throughout the process,\" said Kara Petracek, Vice President of Marketing & Strategy. \"Jim's mandate was clear. Any name change or rebranding should be necessary and satisfy a rationale. It should be clear, it should be reflective of our mission and it should be additive to our go-to-market strategy. Our leadership team felt that a transition to Bowstring Advisors met the mark.\"\nThe change comes as the organization continues to expand and demonstrate an ability to bring tailor-made solutions that deliver the best possible outcomes.\nTo learn more about Bowstring Advisors, contact info@bowstringadvisors.com .\nAbout Bowstring Advisors\nSame trusted advisors.
