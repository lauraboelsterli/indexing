The downtown area of Haikou city is pictured in Hainan province, China May 6, 2018. China Daily via REUTERS\nChi Fulin, the head of the Hainan-based China Institute for Reform and Development, told a forum on Saturday that the visa-free access policy would be expanded to tourists from all countries that have diplomatic ties with China.\n“(The implementation) of the policy won’t take long,” Chi was quoted as saying by the state media.\nUnder the current arrangement, tourists from 59 countries, including the United States, can visit Hainan visa-free and stay there for up to 30 days.\nHe said he expected Hainan’s population to grow to around 15 million from around 9 million now.\nChina aims to establish a free trade zone in Hainan by 2020 and will encourage multinational companies to set up their international and regional headquarters there as part of its plans to open the province’s economy up to foreign investors.
