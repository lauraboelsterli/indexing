I am also extremely pleased and proud to report that we generated positive operating cash flow in the first quarter, a full quarter earlier than expected. First quarter revenue would have been $4.22 million, but we instituted Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (606) for our SaaS business model and did not recognize $107,000 of deferred revenue in the first quarter. All of our profitability metrics improved dramatically; Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA, operating loss and cash flow from operations. Key performance indicators of connections, backlog conversion, connection values, revenue per employee and churn continue to all move in the right direction and give us confidence in our overall strategy and business execution. We also invested in product development and sales and marketing during the quarter, as we prepare to scale our business for expected growth and profitability. Our TEUM remains laser focused on converting backlog to revenue, servicing our clients, selling into new geographical markets and creating shareholder value,\" said Hal Turner, Pareteum's Founder, Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer.\nRaised 2018 Outlook to At Least 60% Revenue Growth:\nBased on our 36-month contractual revenue backlog of $200 million, as of March 31, 2018, and 2,200,000 connections, we are raising our 2018 outlook. The Company now expects 2018 revenue growth of at least 60% over 2017, up from the previous provided guidance of 50%. Also, with its current cost structures, Pareteum expects positive, EBITDA, and cash from continuing operations for the full year 2018. As we convert backlog to connections, our revenue will increase and for every incremental dollar of revenue, we expect contribution to our bottom line. Our target gross margins are 70-75%.\nHighlight Key Performance Indicators and Trends (as of March 31, 2018):\n36-month contractual revenue backlog of $200 million.\nConnections of 2,200,000, up from 1,711,000 at the end of the fourth quarter 2017 and 1,140,000 at the end of 2016; increased 94% versus the end of the first quarter 2017 and 30% from the sequential fourth quarter of 2017; with an additional conversion increase of 70% versus the expected in the 36-month contract backlog for connections.\nBacklog conversion of revenue 103%.\nLifetime connection value of $277, up from $224 at the end of the fourth quarter 2017 and $157 at the end of the first quarter 2017; increased 76% versus the end of the first quarter 2017 and 24% from the sequential fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage annualized revenue per employee of $256,000, up from $233,000 at the end of the fourth quarter 2017 and $177,000 at the end of the first quarter 2017; increased 45% versus the end of the first quarter 2017 and 10% from the sequential fourth quarter of 2017; increased 412% versus the end of the fourth quarter 2015.\nConnections Churn by month at an average of 0.21% for the first quarter 2018\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018:\nRevenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $4,112,570, an increase of $1,317,627 or 47%, compared to $2,794,943 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase was attributable mainly due to the services deployment of signed sales contracts into billable revenues (backlog conversion) and growth in volumes of connections from our existing customer base; in addition to revenues from our Managed Services Platform (MSP), we benefited from Global Cloud Services (GCSP) and Application Exchange Platform (TEAX) revenues are coming into service. We fully implemented in Q1 2018 Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (606); this resulted the a onetime non-recognition of $107,000 for Q1; implementation of ASC 606 helps us in fully recognizing future revenues converted from our 36 Month Contractual Revenue Backlog.\nWith GCSP and TEAX playing an increasingly predominant role in our growth, Global Cloud Services revenue represents 11.7% of total revenue in 1Q18, showing the acceptance of our new product offerings.\nIt is also significant that \"connections\" (our term representing devices, subscribers and their variable usage), which are a lead indicator of revenue, rose to 2,220,000 as of March 31, 2018.

This change was primarily the result of our continued operational austerity measures, and a decrease of $1,019,670 in interest expense relating to debt discount and conversion feature which was $29,566 for the three months ending March 31, 2018, compared to $1,049,236 for the three months ending March 31, 2017.

The Pareteum multi-year Software-as-a-Service agreements include service establishment and implementation fees, guaranteed minimum monthly recurring fees, as well as contractually scheduled subscribers, in some cases including subscriber usage, during the term of the agreement, and, their resulting monthly contractual revenue. There can be no assurances that we reach the total contract revenue backlog. Timing of revenue recognition may vary from actual results.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nPareteum's management believes that the non-GAAP measures of (1) \"EBITDA\" (2) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and (3) Contract Revenue Backlog enhance an investor's understanding of Pareteum's financial and operating performance by presenting (i) a focus on core operating performance and (ii) comparable financial results over various periods. Pareteum 's management uses these financial measures for strategic decision making, forecasting future financial results and operating performance. The presentation of non-GAAP (\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\") financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Definition:\n\"EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP measure defined by Pareteum as \"EBITDA\" excluding stock based compensation, restructuring charges, nonrecurring expenditures and certain software and non-cash adjustments made during the 2016 restructuring that are not applicable in 2017 and 2018.\nPareteum Investor Relations Contacts:\nTed O'Donnell\nChief Financial Officer\n(212) 984-1096\nInvestorRelations@pareteum.com\nStephen Hart\nHayden IR\n917-658-7878\nCarrie Howes\nRayleigh Capital\nDubai- London\nT UAE: +971 (0) 55 997 0427 | T UK: +44 (0) 870 490 5443 | T CAN: +1 416 900 3634\nPARETEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands except for per share amounts)\nThree Month Period Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nREVENUES\n$ 4,113\n$ 2,795\nCOST AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of revenues\n1,195\n842\nProduct development\n727\n285\nSales and marketing\n689\n319\nGeneral and administrative\n2,297\n2,365\nRestructuring charges\n74\n129\nDepreciation and amortization of intangibles assets\n965\n844\nTotal cost and operating expenses\n$ 5,947\n$ 4,784\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n$ (1,834)\n$ (1,989)\nTotal other income (expense)\n(301)\n698\nLOSS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n(2,135)\n(1,291)\nProvision for income taxes\n$ -\n$ 1\nNET LOSS\n$ (2,135)\n$ (1,292)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nForeign currency translation (loss) gain\n$ 104\n$ (27)\nCOMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n$ (2,031)\n$ (1,319)\nNet loss per common share\n$ (0.04)\n$ (0.14)\nWeighted average shares - basic\n50,062,434\n9,322,228\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nThree Month Period Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nNET LOSS\n$ (2,135)\n$ (1,292)\nTotal interest and other income (expense)\n301.00\n(698.00)\nDepreciation and amortization\n965.00\n844.00\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n1.00\nEBITDA\n$ (869)\n$ (1,145)\nNonrecurring and restructuring costs\n74.00\n129.00\nStock based compensation\n1,078.00\n818.00\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 283\n$ (198)\nPARETEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 15,759\n$ 13,538\nRestricted cash\n230\n200\nAccounts receivable\n1,954\n2,058\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n1,154\n900\nTotal current assets\n19,097\n16,696\nTotal assets\n27,199\n25,326\nTotal current liabilities\n7,562\n7,538\nTotal liabilities\n10,212\n9,904\nTotal stockholders' equity\n16,987\n15,422\nPARETEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INFORMATION\n(In thousands)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES:\n$ 29\n$ (1,238)\nCASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES:\n(434)\n(31)\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES:\n2,525\n1,631\nEFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES\n101\n221\nNET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS\n2,221\n583\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pareteum-announces-record-first-quarter-2018-results-300643911.html\nSOURCE Pareteum Corporation",
