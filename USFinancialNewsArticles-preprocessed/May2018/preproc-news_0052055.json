FILE PHOTO: The logo of the European Central Bank (ECB) is pictured outside its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n“On the stock, I hope that reason will prevail,” said Roberto Gualtieri, the chairman of the EU Parliament’s committee on economic and monetary affairs, to which the ECB is accountable.\n“An additional push on the stock has to be done bank by bank,” the Italian socialist added.\nHe warned that applying the same guidelines that the ECB adopted for new unpaid loans to legacy credit would threaten the stability of the banking sector.
