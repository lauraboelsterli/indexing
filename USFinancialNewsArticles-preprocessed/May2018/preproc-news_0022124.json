(B) Normalized FAD, which does not reflect debt principal payments and certain other expenses, does not represent cash available for distribution to shareholders. FIRST QUARTER 2018 GAAP RESULTS\nNew Senior recorded GAAP net loss of $13.3 million, or $(0.16) per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to GAAP net loss of $9.9 million, or $(0.12) per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The year over year decrease was primarily driven by no gain on sale of assets recognized during the first quarter of 2018 compared to a $4.2 million gain on sale of assets recognized during the first quarter of 2017.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE\nTotal NOI decreased 14.9% to $47.1 million compared to $55.4 million for 1Q 2017. Total same store cash NOI decreased 1.0% vs. 1Q 2017.\nFor the managed portfolio, same store average occupancy decreased 160 basis points to 85.4% compared to 87.0% for 1Q 2017, and same store RevPOR increased 1.6% to $3,113 compared to $3,063 for 1Q 2017. Year-over-year, same store cash NOI decreased 4.8% to $22.9 million compared to $24.1 million for 1Q 2017.\nFor the triple net portfolio, same store cash NOI increased 3.5% to $20.6 million compared to $19.9 million for 1Q 2017. Same store triple net average occupancy decreased 210 basis points to 87.4% compared to 89.5% for 1Q 2017. Same store EBITDARM coverage as of March 31, 2018 was 1.15x, down from 1.20x as of March 31, 2017. Triple net average occupancy and EBITDARM coverage are presented one quarter in arrears on a trailing twelve month basis.\nUPDATE ON REVIEW OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES\nAs previously announced on February 23, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors, together with its management team and legal and financial advisors, is exploring a full range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. The strategic review is ongoing.\nAs part of the strategic review process, on May 9, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) to terminate its triple net leases with affiliates of Holiday Retirement (collectively, “Holiday”). In exchange, the Company will receive $116 million of total consideration, including a $70 million termination payment and $46 million of retained security deposits. The effectiveness of the lease termination is subject to the Company completing a refinancing of the existing debt on the portfolio, which had an outstanding face amount of approximately $666 million as of March 31, 2018 and a current coupon of 4.15%, on or before May 21, 2018. The Company expects to refinance the existing debt with a one-year $720 million secured loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4.0% for the first six months and increasing by 50 basis points after the sixth monthly payment date and by an additional 50 basis points after the ninth monthly payment date. If the Company is successful in refinancing the existing debt, the Company is expected to incur approximately $65 million of prepayment fees and expenses. The refinancing is expected to close in May, but it has not been completed and there can be no assurances that it will be completed on the expected terms or at all.\nIn addition, the parties have agreed to enter into property management agreements (collectively, the “Management Agreements”), concurrently with the termination of the leases, pursuant to which the Company will pay a management fee equal to (x) a monthly base fee in the amount of 5% of Effective Gross Income (as defined in the Management Agreements) in the first year and 4.5% of Effective Gross Income for the remainder of the term, and (y) provided the portfolio achieves certain performance thresholds, an annual incentive fee in an amount not to exceed 2% of the portfolio’s Effective Gross Income. The Management Agreements are freely terminable without penalty after the first year of the term.\nThe Termination Agreement and the Management Agreements were negotiated and unanimously approved by a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Special Committee was composed entirely of independent and disinterested members of the Board of Directors, and the Special Committee was advised by independent legal and financial advisors. Holiday is majority owned by private equity funds managed by the Company's manager.\nFIRST QUARTER DIVIDEND\nThe Board continues to evaluate our dividend policy in light of the ongoing strategic review, our results of operations, liquidity needs and other factors. We expect the Board to make a final determination on the amount of the first quarter dividend by June 1, 2018 and, consistent with past practice, to maintain the payment date as June 22. While the amount of such dividend has not yet been determined, it may be less than dividends declared in prior quarters, and such difference could be material.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nFor additional information that management believes to be useful for investors, please refer to the presentation posted in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, www.newseniorinv.com .\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nManagement will host a conference call on May 10, 2018 at 9:00 A.M.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe tables above set forth reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nA non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not excluded from or included in the most comparable GAAP measure. We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. GAAP accounting for real estate assets assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, even though real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions. As a result, many industry investors look to non-GAAP financial measures for supplemental information about real estate companies.\nYou should not consider non-GAAP measures as alternatives to GAAP net (loss) income, which is an indicator of our financial performance, or as alternatives to GAAP cash flow from operating activities, which is a liquidity measure, nor are non-GAAP measures necessarily indicative of our ability to satisfy our funding requirements. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP net (loss) income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this report. Moreover, the comparability of non-GAAP financial measures across companies may be limited as a result of differences in the manner in which real estate companies calculate such measures, the capital structure of such companies or other factors.\nBelow is a description of the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein.\nNOI and Cash NOI\nThe Company evaluates the performance of each of its two business segments based on NOI. The Company defines NOI as total revenues less property-level operating expenses, which include property management fees and travel cost reimbursements. The sum of the NOI for each segment is total NOI, which the Company uses to evaluate the aggregate performance of its segments.\nThe Company defines cash NOI as NOI excluding the effects of straight-line rent, amortization of above / below market lease intangibles and amortization of deferred community fees and other, which includes the net change in deferred community fees and other rent discounts or incentives. We believe that NOI and cash NOI serve as useful supplemental measures to net income because they allow investors, analysts and management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results between periods and to the operating results of other real estate companies on a consistent basis.\nSame store NOI and same store cash NOI include only properties owned for the entirety of comparable periods. Properties acquired, sold, transitioned to other operators or classified as held for sale during the comparable periods are excluded from the same store amounts.\nFFO and Other Non-GAAP Measures\nWe use Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") and Normalized FFO as supplemental measures of our operating performance. We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate assets and impairment charges of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not account for debt principal payments and is not intended as a measure of a REIT’s ability to satisfy such payments or any other cash requirements.\nNormalized FFO, as defined below, measures the financial performance of our portfolio of assets excluding items that, although incidental to, are not reflective of the day-to-day operating performance of our portfolio of assets. We believe that Normalized FFO is useful because it facilitates the evaluation of our portfolio’s operating performance (i) between periods on a consistent basis and (ii) to the operating performance of other real estate companies. However, comparability may be limited because our calculation of Normalized FFO may differ significantly from that of other companies, or because of features of our business that are not present in other companies.\nWe define Normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items, as applicable: (a) acquisition, transaction\nand integration related costs and expenses; (b) the write off of unamortized discounts, premiums, deferred financing costs, or additional costs, make whole payments and penalties or premiums incurred as the result of early repayment of debt (collectively\n“Gain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt”); (c) incentive compensation recognized as a result of sales of property; (d) the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and (e) other items that we believe are not indicative of operating performance, generally reported as “Other (income) expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nManagement also uses AFFO and Normalized FAD as supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance.\nWe define AFFO as Normalized FFO excluding the impact of the following: (a) straight-line rents; (b) amortization of above / below market lease intangibles; (c) amortization of deferred financing costs; (d) amortization of premium on mortgage notes payable and (e) amortization of deferred community fees and other, which includes the net change in deferred community fees and other rent discounts or incentives. We believe AFFO is useful because it facilitates the evaluation of (i) the current economic return on our portfolio of assets between periods on a consistent basis and (ii) our portfolio versus those of other real estate companies that report AFFO. However, comparability may be limited because our calculation of AFFO may differ significantly from that of other companies, or because of features of our business that are not present in other companies.\nWe define Normalized FAD as AFFO less routine capital expenditures, which we view as a cost associated with the current economic return. Normalized FAD, which does not reflect debt principal payments and certain other expenses, does not represent cash available for distribution to shareholders.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005575/en/\nNew Senior Investment Group Inc.\nDavid Smith, 212-515-7783\nSource: New Senior Investment Group Inc.",
