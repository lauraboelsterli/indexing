    "text": "* Over half of Flipkart's minority investors could seek IPO - filing\n* IPO should not be at lower valuation than Walmart investment\n* Walmart to initially appoint five directors to Flipkart's board (Updates to add detail, potential Google investment)\n e-commerce\nThe deal now awaits clearance from India's anti-trust regulator and is expected to close later this year.\nAs part of the deal, Walmart will initially appoint five directors to Flipkart's board, two directors will be named by minority shareholders while Bansal will take one board seat, according to the filing.\nWalmart said it may, in future, appoint a sixth board member with the approval of the majority of the Flipkart directors.\nIt also said it could appoint or replace Flipkart's chief executive and other key executives of group companies in consultation with Bansal and the board.\nWalmart or its units could ask Flipkart to issue new ordinary shares of up to $3 billion before the close of the \"transactions and on or before the first anniversary of the closing\", it said.\nReuters previously reported that Google-parent Alphabet was in talks to invest about $3 billion for a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart.\nThat deal could be sealed before the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction or immediately after, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the talks are private.\nWalmart also said no party would be liable to pay a termination fee if a share issuance or purchase agreement with Flipkart were terminated.\nThe Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Japan's SoftBank Group, which owns a roughly 20 percent stake in Flipkart, was rethinking its exit due to tax liabilities and because it saw further value in Flipkart.\nSoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said that their investment in Flipkart had grown to almost $4 billion. That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart.\nA spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment.\nFormer Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.
