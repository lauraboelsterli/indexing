    "text": "CALGARY, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nComparable EBITDA (1) was up $19 million, or 8%, to $259 million; Free cash flow (1) from ongoing operations increased 2% to $81 million; Total consolidated net debt was reduced by almost $300 million during the quarter; and Receipt of $157 million in early termination payments from the Balancing Pool.\nTransAlta Corporation (\"TransAlta\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: TA; NYSE: TAC) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results, with free cash flow (2) of $238 million for the quarter and funds from operations (2) of $318 million, up $142 and $116 million respectively. The increase in free cash flow and funds from operations was primarily driven by the receipt of $157 million from the Balancing Pool for the early termination of the Sundance B and C Power Purchase Arrangements (\"PPAs\"), and the receipt of $17 million (our net share after non-controlling interest) from the Ontario Electrical Financial Corporation (\"OEFC\") during the first quarter of 2017 relating to the settlement of an indexation dispute. Excluding these two unusual payments in 2018 and 2017, our free cash flow would have been $81 million and $79 million, respectively, while our funds from operations would have been $161 and $168 million, respectively.\nComparable EBITDA (2) for the quarter increased $142 million compared to last year, also mainly due to the one-time cash flows in 2017 and 2018. Results in the first quarter for Alberta Coal, compared to last year, were impacted by the expiry of the Sundance A PPA and our decision to shut down Sundance Unit 1 and mothball Sundance Unit 2. During the first quarter last year, comparable EBITDA generated by these two units totalled $12 million.\n\"Results for the first quarter were strong and a great way to start 2018,\" said Dawn Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We progressed our strategy with the announcement of two wind projects, the repayment of US$500 million of debt, and the advancement of a gas pipeline to our plants in Alberta.\"\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTransAlta Renewables, through a subsidiary of TransAlta, entered into an arrangement to acquire two construction ready wind projects, consisting of a 90 MW project in Pennsylvania and a 29 MW project in New Hampshire, supported by long-term contracts with highly creditworthy counterparties.\nRepaid our 6.650 per cent US$500 million senior notes, due May 15, 2018, with cash on hand and by drawing down our credit facility.\nPurchased and cancelled 374,900 common shares at an average price of $6.97 per share through our Normal Course Issuer Bid which commenced March 14, 2018.\nReceived $157 million in compensation from the Balancing Pool for the early termination of the Sundance B and C PPAs. We are seeking a further $56 million in compensation from the Balancing Pool for the early termination.\nMothballed Sundance Units 3 and 5 as part of our optimization plan for the Sundance facility in 2018 and 2019, which will ensure that the two remaining Sundance coal units operate at high capacity utilizations with lower costs through the period to 2020.\nSubsequent Events\nDonald Tremblay, Chief Financial Officer, decided to leave the Company effective May 8, 2018 and will be relocating to eastern Canada to be closer to his family. TransAlta thanks Mr. Tremblay for his contributions and leadership during the past four years, particularly his role managing the company's debt reduction initiative. TransAlta has commenced a recruitment process for a new Chief Financial Officer. Brett Gellner, Chief Investment Officer, and former Chief Financial Officer, will act as Interim Chief Financial Officer, in addition to his current role.\n2018 Outlook\nDue to strong performance in the first quarter we are revising our 2018 financial targets as presented below. This guidance excludes the impact of the $157 million termination payment received from the Balancing Pool during the first quarter.\nMeasure\nLow\nHigh\nComparable EBITDA\n$1,000 million\n$1,050 million\nFunds from operations\n$750 million\n$800 million\nFree cash flow\n$300 million\n$350 million\nSustaining and Productivity Capital\n$215 million\n$235 million\nRange of key power price assumptions:\nMarket\nPower Prices ($/MWh)\nAlberta Spot\n$50 to $60\nAlberta Contracted\n$35 to $40\nMid-C Spot (US$)\n$20 to $25\nMid-C Contracted (US$)\n$47 to $53\nOther assumptions relevant to 2018 outlook:\nCanadian Coal Capacity Factor\n65% to 75%\nHydro/Wind Resource\nLong term average\nSummary of Credit Agency Reviews\nDBRS Limited reaffirmed our Unsecured Debt rating and Medium-Term Notes rating as BBB (low), the Preferred Shares rating as Pfd-3 (low), and Issuer Rating as BBB (low).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Review by Segment\nComparable EBITDA\n(in CAD$ millions)\n3 Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nCanadian Coal\n222 (a)\n91\nU.S. Coal\n27\n10\nCanadian Gas\n65\n88 (b)\nAustralian Gas\n31\n31\nWind and Solar\n65\n68\nHydro\n17\n14\nEnergy Marketing\n9\n(4)\nCorporate\n(20)\n(24)\nTotal Comparable EBITDA\n416\n274\na) Includes $157 million in compensation from the Balancing Pool for the early termination of the\nSundance B and C PPAs.\nb) Includes $34 million payment from the OEFC relating to the settlement of an indexation dispute.\nCanadian Coal: Comparable EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $131 million compared to 2017. Comparable EBITDA for the quarter was positively impacted by the $157 million termination payment related to the Sundance B and C PPAs, while gross margin was negatively impacted by the expiry of the Sundance A PPA.\nU.S. Coal: Comparable EBITDA increased $17 million compared to 2017, primarily due to our ability to purchase lower cost power to fulfill our contract and hedge obligations, as well as favourable changes to the mark-to-market value of certain forward financial contracts.\nCanadian Gas: Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by $23 million compared to 2017, mainly due to the $34 million contract indexation dispute settlement received in 2017. This was partially offset by higher margin received in 2018 as a result of the Mississauga re-contracting and the settlement of contract indices adjustments at Sarnia.\nAustralian Gas: Comparable EBITDA for the first three months of 2018 was in line with the same period in 2017. The addition of South Hedland was largely offset by the loss of the contribution from the Solomon Power Station contract.\nWind and Solar: Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was down $3 million compared to 2017 mainly due to the recognition of unrealized mark-to-market losses this period.\nHydro: Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter this year increased $3 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in revenues from ancillary services, which more than offset the lower generation.\nEnergy Marketing: Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter was $13 million higher than last year, reflecting a return to typical returns after weak performance in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate: Our Corporate overhead costs of $20 million were $4 million lower, due to lower incentive payments, than the comparable period in 2017.\nConsolidated Earnings Review\nNet earnings attributable to common shareholders during the quarter was $65 million higher than last year mainly due to the $157 million received from the early termination of the Sundance B and C PPAs.\nNo planned major maintenance capital was invested in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in total sustaining capital for the quarter being $22 million lower than Q1 2017.\nOperating Review\nAdjusted availability for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 93.9 per cent compared to 88.5 per cent for the same period in 2017. There were no planned outages in the first quarter of 2018 and the number of unplanned outages was reduced compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nProduction for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 1,880 GWh compared to 2017, despite higher availability, due to the retirement of Sundance Unit 1 and the mothballing of Sundance Unit 2 as well as higher paid curtailments on units under contract.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nIn $CAD millions, unless otherwise stated\n3 Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nAdjusted availability (%) (3,4)\n93.9\n88.5\nProduction (GWh) (4)\n7,171\n9,051\nRevenue\n$588\n$578\nComparable EBITDA\n$416\n$274\nNet earnings attributable to common shareholder\n$65\n-\nFunds from operations\n$318\n$202\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\n$425\n$281\nFree cash flow\n$238\n$96\nNet earnings per common share attributable to common\nshareholders\n$0.23\n-\nFunds from operations per share\n$1.10\n$0.70\nFree cash flow per share\n$0.83\n$0.33\nDividends declared per common share\n$0.04\n-\nTransAlta is in the process of filing its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, as well as the associated Management's Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\").
