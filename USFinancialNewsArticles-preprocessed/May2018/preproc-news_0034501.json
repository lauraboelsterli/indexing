    "text": "SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RLJ Entertainment, Inc. (\"RLJ Entertainment,\" \"RLJE\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: RLJE), today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nDigital Channels paying subscribers increased 44.2% from the first quarter of 2017 to over 750,000. Digital Channels segment revenues increased 45.4% to $8.7 million from $6.0 million in first quarter 2017. Total net revenue increased 33.8% year-over-year to $18.6 million, primarily driven by the increase in Digital Channels revenue. Wholesale Distribution segment revenue also increased 24.9% year-over-year. Gross profit increased 84.6% year-over-year to $8.8 million and gross margin of 47.4% expanded 13 percentage points from 34.3% last year. These profit improvements were driven by growth in Digital Channels revenue as well as revenue growth and gross margin expansion in Wholesale Distribution. Equity earnings from Agatha Christie Limited (ACL) increased 42.3% year-over-year to $0.8 million driven by ACL's film and publishing business segments. Net loss was $6.5 million compared to $6.1 million in first quarter 2017, of which $3.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, was attributable to non-cash warrant expense driven by the appreciation of the RLJE stock price. Adjusted EBITDA increased substantially to $1.5 million from $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to growth of (i) higher-margin Digital Channels revenue and (ii) Wholesale Distribution segment revenue and gross margin.\nRobert L. Johnson, Chairman of RLJ Entertainment , stated, \"As viewership continues to grow across the OTT landscape, brand differentiation becomes increasingly important. Our uniquely positioned channels offer compelling and exclusive programming that are driving sustained subscriber growth, enhancing our brand in the market and ultimately delivering incremental value to all stakeholders.\"\nMiguel Penella, Chief Executive Officer of RLJ Entertainment , stated, \"2018 is off to a terrific start. Our increased investments in unique and original content, expanded consumer awareness and broader distribution resulted in a strong first quarter. Our Digital Channel subscribers surpassed three quarters of a million. In our Wholesale Distribution segment, digital sales led the growth as we continue to transform the business from physical to digital. Our IP licensing segment continued to benefit from Agatha Christie's film and publishing performance. With continued investments in Digital Channels' compelling programming, powerful marketing, and distribution expansion, every quarter brings us closer to our 1 million subscriber target. As announced previously, Nazir Rostom, our CFO, is leaving on May 11, 2018. The Board joins me in thanking him for his tremendous accomplishments and contributions to RLJE over the past two years. We wish him the very best in his career.\"\nNazir Rostom, Chief Financial Officer of RLJ Entertainment , commented, \"We delivered another solid quarter of growth and margin expansion across all our segments. We are executing our strategy of growing our Digital Channel subscriptions and expanding our gross profit, which is positioning us for another great year.\"\nConference Call Information\nRLJE will hold a conference call today at 11:30 a.m. ET to discuss these results.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful indicator of our performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it removes material non-cash items that allows investors to analyze the operating performance of the business using the same metric management uses. The exclusion of non-cash items better reflects our ability to make investments in the business and meet obligations. Presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. Management uses this measure to assess operating results and performance of our business, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to our business segments. While management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of comparative operating performance, it should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and the measure, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of our consolidated U.S. GAAP net loss to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet loss\n$\n(6,525)\n$\n(6,122)\nInterest expense\n2,291\n1,886\nProvision for income tax\n213\n161\nDepreciation and amortization\n885\n873\nBasis-difference amortization in equity earnings of\naffiliate\n125\n111\nChange in fair value of stock warrants and other\nderivatives\n2,967\n2,892\nStock-based compensation\n689\n154\nRestructuring\n224\n(615)\nForeign currency exchange gain on intercompany\naccounts\n7\n(283)\nNon-cash royalty expense\n596\n1,040\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,472\n$\n97\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rlj-entertainment-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300645997.html\nSOURCE RLJ Entertainment, Inc.",
