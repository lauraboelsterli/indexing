    "text": "PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - Air France KLM shares slumped on Monday after the company’s chief executive said he would resign following the rejection of a pay deal by the airline’s staff.\nAir France KLM shares were down by around 12.8 percent at 7.06 euros ($8.42) in early session trading, touching their lowest level since April 2017.\nThe stock is down by around 50 percent since the start of 2018, underperforming a 3.7 percent gain on the broader Paris SBF-120 index and a 4 percent fall on the pan-European STOXX 600 Travel & Leisure index.\nLate on Friday, CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said he would resign after staff rejected a pay deal, plunging the airline into turmoil amid a wave of strikes at its French brand that has so far cost the company 300 million euros.\nAirline staff are planning further strikes on May 7 and May 8.\n$1 = 0.8377 euros Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Richard Lough\nOur ",
