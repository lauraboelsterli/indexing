    "text": "ZURICH, May 1 (Reuters) - Austrian Airlines and labour representatives have agreed a wage deal through 2021 for flight staff that increases pay while making working conditions more flexible, the unit of Deutsche Lufthansa said on Tuesday.\nSalaries for cabin crew and pilots are set to increase by 5.5 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019, 1.83 percent in 2020 and by at least 1.4 percent in 2021, it said in a statement.\nStarting salaries for flight attendants are to increase by 10.7 percent to 1,700 euros a month.\n“At the same time, flight duty regulations are to be made more flexible in order to better compensate seasonal fluctuations in passenger demand,” it said.\nAustrian Airlines employs around 7,000 people, including more than 1,200 pilots and 2,400 flight attendants.
