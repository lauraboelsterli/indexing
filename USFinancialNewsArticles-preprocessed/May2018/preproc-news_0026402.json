    "text": "Revenue increased 203% compared to the three-month period in the prior year\nCall scheduled for today, May 10, at 4:30 pm ET\nTUCSON, Ariz., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HTG Molecular Diagnostics , Inc. (Nasdaq:HTGM) (HTG), a provider of instruments, reagents and services for molecular profiling applications, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Accomplishments & Highlights:\nEntered into a third statement of work for a new clinical assay development program under its Master Assay Development, Commercialization and Manufacturing Agreement (the “Governing Agreement”) with QIAGEN Manchester Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V.\nAnnounced the second amendment to the first statement of work for next phase development activities under the Governing Agreement, representing low, single-digit millions of dollars in development fees and profit sharing payments.\nEntered into a non-exclusive license and supply agreement with Firalis S.A. (“Firalis”) enabling Firalis to develop and commercialize a theranostic test to predict a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient’s response to anti‑TNFα therapy, the primary therapy for millions of RA patients. The new assay using Firalis’ gene expression signature, BIOPRED, would be commercialized on the HTG EdgeSeq platform. Announced a new Precision Immuno-Oncology panel of over 1,300 genes with an expected Q3 2018 availability, to be featured at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. Completed an underwritten public offering of 13,915,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.90 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $37.7 million. Entered into a senior debt facility for up to $30.0 million with MidCap Financial (MidCap), a healthcare technology firm, to replace its existing senior credit facility and provide additional working capital for the Company. Announced the promotion of John Lubniewski to President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Lubniewski has served as HTG’s chief business officer for the past seven years, bringing over three decades of experience in the life science industry.\n“We are off to a solid start in 2018 and executing well, but continue to expect uneven quarterly revenue,” said TJ Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of HTG. “Our BioPharma programs are progressing as expected, we are launching an exciting new immuno-oncology panel early in the third quarter of 2018, and believe we have additional, potential catalysts in front of us.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.2 million, an increase of 203% over the same period in the prior year. The increase in current year revenue is primarily due to our BioPharma development programs and steady growth of our RUO profiling services.\nProduct and product-related services revenue was $1.7 million, compared to $1.4 million to the same period in 2017. Collaborative development services revenue was approximately $2.4 million compared to $0 for the same period in 2017.\nGross margin was $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $76,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.2 million compared to $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share was $(0.22) for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $(0.73) for the first quarter of 2017.\nHTG ended the first quarter with $45.6 million including cash, cash equivalents and short term, available-for-sale securities investments.\n2018 Revenue Guidance:\nHTG is increasing the lower end of the Company’s full-year revenue guidance to $21.0 to $25.0 million. Previous guidance was $20.0 to $25.0 million.\nConference Call and Webcast:\nHTG will host an investment community conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
