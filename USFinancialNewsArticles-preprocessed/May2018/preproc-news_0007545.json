    "text": "MOSCOW, May 1 (Reuters) - Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan on Tuesday called on his supporters to launch a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience after the ruling party blocked his bid in parliament to become prime minister.\nPashinyan, addressing tens of thousands of supporters in a square in the Armenian capital, said that starting from Wednesday morning, his supporters would launch a general strike and block roads, railways stations and airports.\nHe said the protest would be peaceful, and called on police to put down their shields and join his movement.
