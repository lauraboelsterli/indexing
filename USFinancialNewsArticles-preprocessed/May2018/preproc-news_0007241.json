Apple shares were up 4.9 percent.\nThe MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS shed 0.24 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.9663 percent, down from 2.976 percent late on Tuesday.\nIn the oil market, U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 68 cents to settle at $67.93 a barrel, while Brent LCOcv1 gained 23 cents to settle at $73.36.
