    "text": "STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by the Board of Directors of MTGE Investment Corp. (Nasdaq: MTGE) (“MTGE” or the “Company”) relating to the proposed buyout of MTGE by Annaly Capital Management, Inc. in a transaction valued at approximately $900 million.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, shareholders of MTGE may elect to receive: (a) $9.82 in cash and 0.9519 shares of Annaly common stock; (b) $19.65 in cash (the “Cash Consideration Option”); or (c) 1.9037 shares of Annaly common stock (the “Stock Consideration Option”). MTGE shareholders who elect the Cash Consideration Option or Stock Consideration Option will be subject to proration, in each of the exchange offers and the subsequent second step merger, so that the aggregate consideration will consist of approximately 50% of Annaly’s common stock and approximately 50% in cash.\nThe firm’s investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company’s Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company’s shares of common stock.\nIf you currently own common stock of MTGE and believe that the proposed buyout price is too low, and you would like to learn more about the investigation being conducted, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005705/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
