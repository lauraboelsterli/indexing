All of these endeavors represent progress towards the goal of strengthening our global investment management franchise and becoming more balance sheet-lite as we focus on maximizing shareholder value from a total return perspective.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results and Investment Activity by Segment\nColony NorthStar holds investment interests in six reportable segments: Healthcare Real Estate; Industrial Real Estate; Hospitality Real Estate; CLNC; Other Equity and Debt; and Investment Management.\nHealthcare Real Estate\nAs of March 31, 2018, the consolidated healthcare portfolio consisted of 413 properties: 192 senior housing properties, 108 medical office properties, 99 skilled nursing facilities and 14 hospitals. The Company’s equity interest in the consolidated Healthcare Real Estate segment was approximately 71% as of March 31, 2018. The healthcare portfolio earns rental and escalation income from leasing space to various healthcare tenants and operators. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for rent and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments. The healthcare portfolio also generates operating income from healthcare properties operated through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly through structures permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).\nDuring the first quarter 2018, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(10.4) million, Core FFO was $23.1 million and consolidated NOI was $81.3 million. In the first quarter 2018, healthcare same store portfolio sequential quarter to quarter comparable revenue increased 2.0% and net operating income increased 6.5% primarily attributed to an approximately $3 million early lease termination fee received from a former medical office building tenant and approximately $1 million of hurricane Harvey expenses not covered by insurance that was incurred in senior housing properties during the fourth quarter 2017. Compared to the same period last year, first quarter 2018 same store revenue grew 1.2% and net operating income increased 5.5% primarily attributable to the previously referenced early lease termination fee and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The healthcare same store portfolio is defined as properties in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison and included 413 properties in the sequential quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons.\nThe following table presents NOI and certain operating metrics by property types in the Company’s Healthcare Real Estate segment:\nConsolidated CLNS OP Same Store NOI Share NOI (1) Consolidated NOI Occupancy % (2) TTM Lease Coverage (3) ($ In millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2018 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 12/31/17 9/30/17 Senior Housing - Operating $ 17.5 $ 12.6 $ 17.5 $ 15.8 86.4 % 87.4 % N/A N/A Medical Office Buildings 16.6 11.5 16.5 13.4 83.2 % 83.4 % N/A N/A Triple-Net Lease: Senior Housing 15.5 11.0 15.5 15.2 83.2 % 82.9 % 1.4x 1.4x Skilled Nursing Facilities 26.8 19.3 26.9 26.8 82.7 % 82.6 % 1.2x 1.2x Hospitals 4.9 3.4 4.9 5.2 55.3 % 58.4 % 3.5x 2.5x Healthcare Total/W.A. $ 81.3 $ 57.8 $ 81.3 $ 76.4 82.8 % 83.1 % 1.5x 1.4x (1) CLNS OP Share NOI represents first quarter 2018 Consolidated NOI multiplied by CLNS OP’s ownership interest as of March 31, 2018.

Asset Dispositions and Financing\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the consolidated healthcare portfolio disposed of three non-core skilled nursing facilities for an aggregate $14 million and one medical office building, which was encumbered by a $3 million mortgage and consensually transferred to the respective lender.\nIndustrial Real Estate\nAs of March 31, 2018, the consolidated industrial portfolio consisted of 378 primarily light industrial buildings totaling 45.6 million rentable square feet across 18 major U.S. markets and was 94% leased. During the first quarter 2018, the Company closed on $70 million of new third-party capital. As a result, the Company’s equity interest in the consolidated Industrial Real Estate segment decreased to approximately 40% as of March 31, 2018 from 41% as of December 31, 2017. Total third-party capital commitments were approximately $1.2 billion compared to cumulative balance sheet contributions of $750 million as of March 31, 2018. The Company continues to own a 100% interest in the related operating platform. The Industrial Real Estate segment is comprised of and primarily invests in light industrial properties in infill locations in major U.S. metropolitan markets targeting multi-tenant buildings of up to 500,000 square feet and single tenant buildings of up to 250,000 square feet with an office buildout of less than 20%.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, this segment’s net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.3 million, Core FFO was $12.5 million and consolidated NOI was $44.6 million. In the first quarter 2018, industrial same store portfolio sequential quarter to quarter comparable revenue grew 4.5% and net operating income decreased (1.1)%, primarily due to higher snow removal expense. Compared to the same period last year, first quarter 2018 same store revenue grew by 5.4% and net operating income grew 3.5%. The Company’s industrial same store portfolio consisted of the same 305 buildings that were stabilized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. Properties acquired, disposed or held for sale during these periods are excluded. Stabilized properties are defined as properties owned for more than one year or are greater than 90% leased as of the beginning of the January 1, 2017.\nThe following table presents NOI and certain operating metrics in the Company’s Industrial Real Estate segment:\nConsolidated CLNS OP Same Store NOI Share NOI (1) Consolidated NOI Leased % (2) ($ In millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2018 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Industrial $ 44.6 $ 17.9 $ 35.3 $ 35.7 95.1 % 95.7 % (1) CLNS OP Share NOI represents first quarter 2018 Consolidated NOI multiplied by CLNS OP’s ownership interest as of March 31, 2018. (2) Leased % represents the last day of the presented quarter. Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the consolidated industrial portfolio acquired ten industrial buildings totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet and land for development for approximately $179 million and disposed of one non-core building totaling approximately 0.2 million square feet for approximately $11 million.\nSubsequent to the first quarter 2018, the consolidated industrial portfolio acquired four industrial buildings totaling approximately 1.0 million square feet for approximately $138 million.\nHospitality Real Estate\nAs of March 31, 2018, the consolidated hospitality portfolio consisted of 167 properties: 97 select service properties, 66 extended stay properties and 4 full service properties. The Company’s equity interest in the consolidated Hospitality Real Estate segment was approximately 94% as of March 31, 2018. The hospitality portfolio consists primarily of premium branded select service hotels and extended stay hotels located mostly in major metropolitan markets, of which a majority are affiliated with top hotel brands. The select service hospitality portfolio, referred to as the THL Hotel Portfolio, which the Company acquired through consensual transfer during the third quarter 2017, is not included in the Hospitality Real Estate segment and is included in the Other Equity and Debt segment.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(10.1) million, Core FFO was $25.9 million and consolidated EBITDA was $59.2 million. Compared to the same period last year, first quarter 2018 hospitality same store portfolio revenue increased 1.6% and EBITDA decreased (3.3)%, primarily due to increased utility costs related to a colder first quarter 2018 and increased wages. The Company’s hotels typically experience seasonal variations in occupancy which may cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues and therefore sequential quarter to quarter revenue and EBITDA result comparisons are not meaningful. The hospitality same store portfolio is defined as hotels in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison and included 167 hotels in the year to year comparison.\nThe following table presents EBITDA and certain operating metrics by brands in the Company’s Hospitality Real Estate segment:\nSame Store Consolidated CLNS OP Share Avg.

(“CLNC”)\nOn February 1, 2018, Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc., a leading commercial real estate credit REIT, announced the completion of the combination of a select portfolio of the Company’s assets and liabilities from the Other Equity and Debt segment with NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“NorthStar I”) and NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. (“NorthStar II”) in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the closing, CLNC completed the listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CLNC.” The combination creates a permanent capital vehicle, externally managed by the Company, with approximately $4.9 billion in assets, excluding securitization trust liabilities, and $3.1 billion in equity value as of March 31, 2018. The Company owns 48.0 million shares, or 37%, of CLNC and earns an annual base management fee of 1.5% on stockholders’ equity and an incentive fee of 20% of CLNC’s Core Earnings over a 7% hurdle rate. During the first quarter 2018, this segment’s net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(3.4) million and Core FFO was $13.4 million, which reflects two months of the Company’s 37% share of CLNC’s net loss and Core Earnings. The financial results related to the assets and liabilities contributed to CLNC for the period January 1, 2018 to January 31, 2018 are included in the Other Equity and Debt segment.\nOther Equity and Debt\nThe Company owns a diversified group of strategic and non-strategic real estate and real estate-related debt and equity investments. Strategic investments include our 10% interest in NorthStar Realty Europe (NYSE: NRE) and other investments for which the Company acts as a general partner or manager (“GP Co-Investments”) and receives various forms of investment management economics on the related third-party capital. Non-strategic investments are composed of those investments the Company does not intend to own for the long term including net leased assets; real estate loans; other real estate equity including the THL Hotel Portfolio and the Company’s interest in Albertsons; limited partnership interests in third-party sponsored real estate private equity funds; and multiple classes of commercial real estate (“CRE”) securities. During the first quarter 2018, this segment’s aggregate net income attributable to common stockholders was $49.1 million and Core FFO was $77.8 million.

Investment Management\nThe Company’s Investment Management segment includes the business and operations of managing capital on behalf of third-party investors through closed and open-end private funds, non-traded and traded real estate investment trusts and registered investment companies. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $27.5 billion of third-party AUM compared to $26.9 billion as of December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the capital raised in the co-sponsored digital real estate infrastructure vehicle, capital raised in the industrial open-end fund and the successful syndication of an approximately 30% interest in an Irish non-performing loan portfolio acquired in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, Fee-Earning Equity Under Management (“FEEUM”) was $16.2 billion compared to $15.4 billion as of December 31, 2017. During the first quarter 2018, this segment’s aggregate net loss attributable to common stockholders was $(80.5) million and Core FFO was $31.4 million.

(3) REIM: Real Estate Investment Management Liquidity and Financing\nAs of May 7, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity through cash-on-hand and availability under its revolving credit facility.\nCommon Stock and Operating Company Units\nAs of May 7, 2018, the Company had approximately 496.8 million shares of Class A and B common stock outstanding and the Company’s operating partnership had approximately 30.6 million operating company units outstanding held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors provided authorization for the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its outstanding common stock.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 42.3 million shares of its Class A common stock at an average price of $5.82 per share, or $246 million, and another approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $5.65 per share, or $33 million, subsequent to the first quarter 2018 resulting in aggregate year-to-date 2018 repurchases of approximately 48.2 million shares at an average price of $5.79 per share, or $279 million.\nCommon and Preferred Dividends\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of Class A and Class B common stock for the first quarter of 2018, which was paid on April 16, 2018 to respective stockholders of record on March 29, 2018.

AUM is based on reported gross undepreciated carrying value of managed investments as reported by each underlying vehicle at March 31, 2018. AUM further includes a) uncalled capital commitments and b) includes the Company’s pro-rata share of each affiliate non wholly-owned real estate investment management platform’s assets as presented and calculated by the affiliate. Affiliates include the co-sponsored digital real estate infrastructure vehicle, RXR Realty LLC, SteelWave, LLC, American Healthcare Investors and Hamburg Trust. The Company's calculations of AUM may differ materially from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\nCLNS OP\nThe operating partnership through which the Company conducts all of its activities and holds substantially all of its assets and liabilities. CLNS OP share excludes noncontrolling interests in investment entities.\nFee-Earning Equity Under Management (“FEEUM”)\nEquity for which the Company and its affiliates provides investment management services and derives management fees and/or performance allocations. FEEUM generally represents a) the basis used to derive fees, which may be based on invested equity, stockholders’ equity, or fair value pursuant to the terms of each underlying investment management agreement and b) the Company’s pro-rata share of fee bearing equity of each affiliate as presented and calculated by the affiliate. Affiliates include the co-sponsored digital real estate infrastructure vehicle, RXR Realty LLC, SteelWave, LLC, American Healthcare Investors and Hamburg Trust. The Company's calculations of FEEUM may differ materially from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”)\nThe Company calculates funds from operations (\"FFO\") in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Included in FFO are gains and losses from sales of assets which are not depreciable real estate such as loans receivable, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as investments in debt and other equity securities, as applicable.\nThe Company computes core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") by adjusting FFO for the following items, including the Company’s share of these items recognized by its unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures: (i) gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate within the Other Equity and Debt segment, net of depreciation, amortization and impairment previously adjusted for FFO; (ii) gains and losses from sales of businesses within the Investment Management segment and impairment write-downs associated with the Investment Management segment; (iii) equity-based compensation expense; (iv) effects of straight-line rent revenue and straight-line rent expense on ground leases; (v) amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease values; (vi) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums and discounts; (vii) unrealized fair value gains or losses and foreign currency remeasurements; (viii) acquisition-related expenses, merger and integration costs; (ix) amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangibles related to investment management contracts and customer relationships; (x) gain on remeasurement of consolidated investment entities and the effect of amortization thereof; (xi) non-real estate depreciation and amortization; (xii) change in fair value of contingent consideration; and (xiii) tax effect on certain of the foregoing adjustments. Beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s Core FFO from its interest in Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate (NYSE: CLNC) and NorthStar Realty Europe (NYSE: NRE) represented its percentage interest multiplied by CLNC’s Core Earnings and NRE’s Cash Available for Distribution (“CAD”), respectively. Refer to CLNC’s and NRE's respective filings for the definition and calculation of Core Earnings and CAD.\nFFO and Core FFO should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income as indications of operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity, nor as indications of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. FFO and Core FFO should not be used as supplements to or substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s calculations of FFO and Core FFO may differ from methodologies utilized by other REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other REITs.\nThe Company uses FFO and Core FFO as supplemental performance measures because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs. The Company also believes that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs, FFO and Core FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO and Core FFO exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of the Company’s properties that resulted from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of its properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact the Company’s results from operations, the utility of FFO and Core FFO as measures of the Company’s performance is limited. FFO and Core FFO should be considered only as supplements to GAAP net income as a measure of the Company’s performance.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”) / Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”)\nNOI for healthcare and industrial segments represents total property and related income less property operating expenses, adjusted for the effects of (i) straight-line rental income adjustments; (ii) amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease adjustments to rental income; and (iii) other items such as adjustments for the Company’s share of NOI of unconsolidated ventures.\nEBITDA for the hospitality real estate segment represents net income from continuing operations of that segment excluding the impact of interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that NOI and EBITDA are useful measures of operating performance of its respective real estate portfolios as they are more closely linked to the direct results of operations at the property level. NOI also reflects actual rents received during the period after adjusting for the effects of straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below- market leases; therefore, a comparison of NOI across periods better reflects the trend in occupancy rates and rental rates of the Company’s properties.\nNOI and EBITDA exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, which are based on different useful life estimates depending on the age of the properties, as well as adjust for the effects of real estate impairment and gains or losses on sales of depreciated properties, which eliminate differences arising from investment and disposition decisions. This allows for comparability of operating performance of the Company’s properties period over period and also against the results of other equity REITs in the same sectors. Additionally, by excluding corporate level expenses or benefits such as interest expense, any gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes, which are incurred by the parent entity and are not directly linked to the operating performance of the Company’s properties, NOI and EBITDA provide a measure of operating performance independent of the Company’s capital structure and indebtedness.\nHowever, the exclusion of these items as well as others, such as capital expenditures and leasing costs, which are necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company’s properties, and transaction costs and administrative costs, may limit the usefulness of NOI and EBITDA. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, the Company’s methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with other companies.\nEarnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”)\nRepresents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent for facilities accruing to the tenant/operator of the property (not the Company) for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDAR in determining TTM Lease Coverage for triple-net lease properties in its Healthcare Real Estate segment. EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool. EBITDAR does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, EBITDAR does not represent a property's net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. The Company utilizes EBITDAR as a supplemental measure of the ability of the Company's operators/tenants to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.\nTTM Lease Coverage\nRepresents the ratio of EBITDAR to recognized cash rent for owned facilities on a trailing twelve month basis. TTM Lease Coverage is a supplemental measure of a tenant’s/operator’s ability to meet their cash rent obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDAR.\nThe information related to the Company’s tenants/operators that is provided in this press release has been provided by, or derived from information provided by, such tenants/operators. The Company has not independently verified this information and has no reason to believe that such information is inaccurate in any material respect. The Company is providing this data for informational purposes only.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss the financial results on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. PT / 10:00 a.m. ET.
