    "text": "MEXICO CITY, May 25 (Reuters) - Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday he saw a 40-percent chance of concluding the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) before Mexico’s presidential election on July 1.\n“I think there’s a 40 percent probability of being able to conclude it before,” he told Mexican television. “After July 1 and before the U.S. (mid-term) elections (in November), I would place the probability at another 40 percent.”\nThat meant there was about an 80 percent chance of being able to conclude the deal before the U.S. mid-terms, he said.\nFor a deal to be reached between Mexico, the United States and Canada on reworking the 24-year-old trade accord, U.S. negotiators would need to show flexibility, he said.
