    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bojangles’, Inc. (Bojangles’) (NASDAQ:BOJA) today announced financial results for the 13-week first fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2018. Bojangles’ also reiterated its annual guidance for the 52-week fiscal year 2018 ending on December 30, 2018.\nHighlights for the First Fiscal Quarter 201 8 Compared to the First Fiscal Quarter 201 7*\nTotal revenues increased 2.7% to $137.5 million from $133.9 million in the prior year fiscal quarter; System-wide comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%, while company-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.8% and franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 0.2%; 6 system-wide restaurants were opened, consisting of 1 company-operated restaurant and 5 franchised restaurants, while 8 franchised restaurants were closed; Net Income was $4.7 million as compared to $7.5 million in the prior year fiscal quarter; Diluted Net Income per Share was $0.12 as compared to $0.19 in the prior year fiscal quarter; Adjusted Net Income** was $6.7 million as compared to $7.6 million in the prior year fiscal quarter; Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share** was $0.18 as compared to $0.20 in the prior year fiscal quarter; and Adjusted EBITDA** was $16.4 million as compared to $18.9 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\n* Certain amounts for the first fiscal quarter of 2017 have been restated to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. See “Adoption of New Accounting Standard” for further details.\n** Descriptions of Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures are provided in this release under “Use and Definition of Non-GAAP Measures,” and reconciliations to GAAP figures are provided in the tables at the end of this release.\n“We are pleased our system-wide comparable restaurant sales trends improved sequentially during the first fiscal quarter 2018 relative to the fourth fiscal quarter 2017 and turned slightly positive in our March fiscal period,” said Bojangles’ Interim President and CEO Randy Kibler. “Going forward, our key areas of focus will be on well-run restaurants, communicating and promoting our core menu items, and incorporating these key signature products into our value messaging. We believe that these efforts will resonate with our customers,” concluded Mr. Kibler.\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nSystem-wide comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6%, consisting of a 1.8% decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales and a 0.2% increase in franchised comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease at company-operated restaurants was composed of a decrease in transactions, partially offset by increases in price and mix.\nTotal revenues increased 2.7% to $137.5 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from $133.9 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily due to a net additional 34 system-wide restaurants at April 1, 2018 compared to March 26, 2017 and a slight increase in comparable restaurant sales at our franchised restaurants, partially offset by a comparable restaurant sales decline at our company-operated restaurants.\nCompany-operated restaurant revenues increased 1.9% to $127.2 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from $124.8 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. Franchise royalty revenues increased 5.4% to $6.9 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from $6.5 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nOperating income was $8.9 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $13.4 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nCompany-operated restaurant contribution, a non-GAAP measure, was $18.2 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $20.1 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. As a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenues, company-operated restaurant contribution margin, a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 14.3% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from 16.1% in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.6 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $9.0 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was due primarily to executive separation expenses, stock-based compensation and headcount added to support an increased number of restaurants in our system.\nNet Income was $4.7 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $7.5 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. Diluted Net Income per Share was to $0.12 in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $0.19 in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, was $6.7 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $7.6 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share was $0.18 in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $0.20 in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $16.4 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as compared to $18.9 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year 201 8 Guidance\nBojangles’ has reiterated its annual outlook for the 52-week period ending on December 30, 2018:\nTotal revenues of $550.0 million to $560.0 million (including approximately $11.0 million of franchise marketing and co-op advertising contribution revenues due to the change in the revenue recognition rules); System-wide comparable restaurant sales of negative low-single digits to flat; The opening of 30 to 40 system-wide restaurants, comprised of 6 to 10 company-operated restaurants and 24 to 30 franchised restaurants; Company-operated restaurant contribution margin of 14.0% to 14.5%; General and administrative expenses of $43.0 million to $43.5 million; Cash capital expenditures of $11.5 million to $12.5 million; Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share of $0.64 to $0.72; and Adjusted EBITDA of $64.0 million to $68.0 million.\nOur guidance does not include the potential impact of restaurant portfolio optimization, which may include the refranchising of company-operated restaurants and/or additional restaurant closures. In addition, we have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share or Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measures because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance for revenue recognition related to contracts with customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. We adopted this new guidance in fiscal year 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, which resulted in restating each prior reporting period presented in the year of adoption, including the first fiscal quarter 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on Company-operated restaurant revenues or Franchise royalty revenues. The new guidance requires Bojangles’ to recognize initial and renewal franchisee fees on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise agreement, which impacts Other franchise revenues. In addition, funds contributed by franchisees to the advertising funds actively managed by Bojangles’, as well as the associated advertising fund expenditures, are reported on a gross basis, and the advertising fund revenues and expenses may be reported in different periods. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard impacted the Company’s previously reported results as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThirteen Weeks Ended March 26, 2017 As\nReported Adjustments As\nAdjusted Franchise marketing and co-op advertising contribution revenues $ - 2,532 2,532 Other franchise revenues 200 (140 ) 60 Franchise marketing and co-op advertising costs - 2,532 2,532 Income tax benefit (expense) (4,169 ) 53 (4,116 ) Net income 7,617 (87 ) 7,530 Net income per diluted share 0.20 (0.01 ) 0.19\nDecember 31, 2017 As\nReported Adjustments As\nAdjusted Other current liabilities $ 651 283 934 Deferred income taxes 71,190 (980 ) 70,210 Other noncurrent liabilities 13,458 3,774 17,232 Retained earnings 157,383 (3,077 ) 154,306 Conference Call and Webcast Today\nBojangles’ will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the first fiscal quarter 2018 results, as well as fiscal year 2018 guidance today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

For more information, visit www.bojangles.com or follow Bojangles’ on Facebook and Twitter.\nUse and Definition of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe utilize certain non-GAAP measures when assessing the operational strength and the performance of our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures assist our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance, on a consistent basis from period to period, by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary significantly among similar companies. Bojangles’ cautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, reported GAAP results.\nCompany-operated restaurant contribution represents our operating income excluding the impact of franchise royalty revenues, franchise marketing and co-op advertising fund contribution revenues and associated costs, properties and equipment rental revenues, other franchise revenues, general and administrative expenses, costs associated with properties and equipment rentals, depreciation and amortization, impairment and (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment and other, as identified by the reconciliation table below. Company-operated restaurant contribution margin is defined as company-operated restaurant contribution as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenues. Company-operated restaurant contribution and company-operated restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our company-operated restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Company-operated restaurant contribution and company-operated restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Included with the reconciliations to GAAP figures provided in the tables at the end of this release is a reconciliation of our operating income to our company-operated restaurant contribution.\nAdjusted Net Income represents company net income before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance as identified in the reconciliation table below. Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share represents company diluted net income per share before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nEBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance and certain non-cash items, as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains All statements other than statements of historical or current facts included in this release are Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations, projections and guidance relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business.
