    "text": "(Adds details)\nMay 24(Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc on Thursday reported first-quarter comparable store sales that missed analysts' estimates as sales growth slowed at its traditionally strong performing Old Navy brand.\nShares of the San Francisco-based company fell 6 percent to $31 in extended trading after its profit also missed estimates.\nOld Navy, which sells lower priced apparel, reported same-store sales rise of 3 percent, missing expectations of 3.9 percent for the first time in four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nIts Gap brand's same-store sales also fell well below analysts' expectations.\nOverall same-store sales rose 1 percent in the three months ended May 5, while analysts were expecting a rise of 1.67 percent.\nThe company's net income rose to $164 million, or 42 cents per share, in the reported quarter from $143 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue rose to $3.78 billion from $3.44 billion.
