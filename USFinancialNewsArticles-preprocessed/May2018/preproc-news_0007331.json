    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday said it was implementing new rules requiring additional inspections of fan blades in engines similar to the one that failed in a deadly Southwest Airlines accident last month in Pennsylvania.\nThe new rules follow an emergency directive issued last month by the FAA and European regulators requiring the inspection of nearly 700 engines CFM56-7B worldwide within 20 days on Boeing 737 NG airplanes. The FAA said another group of CFM56-7B engines will need to be inspected by August under the regulation. The FAA also said it is requiring repeat inspections of engines as part of Tuesdayâ€™s action. The announcement comes the same day President Donald Trump is set to meet with passengers and the flight crew at the White House of Southwest Flight 1380.
