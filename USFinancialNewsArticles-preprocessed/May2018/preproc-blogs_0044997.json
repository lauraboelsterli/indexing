    "text": "Royal Caribbean : \"People are too worried about raw costs. They're too worried about the idea that there are too many ships coming on. They're wrong. I think it's a buy.\"\nAllergan Plc : \"I have said that that has been my worst stock in about a decade. I still would like to believe, but it is just not acting well and I'm not going to tell you to buy any more here.\"\nTyson Foods, Inc. : \"I think the stock's come down a lot, but I have no catalysts and people did not like that last quarter, to be candid. I hesitate to go where everybody else is fleeing in that food group. It's so darned hard. So I'm not going to pull the trigger here.\"\nCarrizo Oil & Gas : \"It's too late, unless oil's going to go to $90. Carrizo had this incredible move, raised some capital. Really well-run company. I wish they'd come back on. They're smarter than the average bear in oil, but you know what? As much as I'm bullish on the management, I have to say don't buy because of the incredible move.\"\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International : \"No, [don't ring the register]. [CEO] Joe Papa's doing a great job. Now, it is not going to run fast, OK? But it has had a great move, Joe is doing so much good, he's got a good pipeline, fixing the balance sheet, got 'em out of legal trouble. I can't tell you to take profits. I think it could still go higher.\"\nOkta, Inc. : \"I can't tell you to pull the trigger. It's up almost 100 percent. It's a very good company, but that is way too much for me to be able to come in and say buy, so I'm going to say hold.\"\nCrispr Therapeutics : \"Oh jeez, it's another one that has just run so much. I know this is going to sound like I've gotten bearish, but here's a stock that's up 175 percent. I'm not saying this ship has sailed. I am saying that it would be irresponsible for me to come in and say now is the time to buy Crispr, so I'm not going to do that.\"\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. : \"I think it's too low to sell. My inclination is much more to be a buyer down here than a seller. I think that it's overly hated, so I am going to say buy, buy, buy.\"\nThe Southern Company : \"Southern's come down too much, as has Dominion . I just gave you a two-fer. Both of those are down too much and they presume interest rates are going to 3.5 [percent] immediately. That's the 10-year. I don't think so.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: The bears are wrong about cruise ship stocks 20 Hours Ago | 05:55 ",
