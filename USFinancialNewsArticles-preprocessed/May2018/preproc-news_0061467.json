    "text": "Dollar General missed Wall Street forecasts for same-store sales on Thursday as the discount store chain faced weaker demand for apparel and home products because of cold weather.\nThe news drove the company's shares down 6.4 percent to $90.35 in premarket trading.\nCustomer traffic at established stores was hit by unseasonably cold and damp weather, the Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company said, adding that it still saw steady demand for food items.\nSales at Dollar General stores open for more than a year rose 2.1 percent in the three months ended May 4, less than the 3.24 percent increase expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company's net income rose to $364.9 million from $279.5 million year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Dollar General earned $1.36 per share, falling short of analysts' expectations of $1.40.\nNet sales rose to $6.11 billion, but missed estimates.\nThe company maintained its full-year sales and earnings targets.",
