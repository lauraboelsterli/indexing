    "text": "Jose Ramirez and Michael Brantley homered and drove in two runs apiece, and the Cleveland Indians cruised to a 7-3 win over the visiting Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night at Progressive Field.\nJason Kipnis had a solo home run, and Francisco Lindor and Yonder Alonso drove in one run apiece for the Indians. Cleveland won its fourth game in a row, which is the team’s longest winning streak since early April.\nDaniel Palka finished 2-for-4 with a double and a home run to lead the White Sox at the plate. Chicago has lost three straight and five of six.\nIndians right-hander Mike Clevinger (4-2) earned his first victory in his past three starts. He limited the White Sox to one run on four hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out seven.\nWhite Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (3-6) struggled for the second straight outing. He gave up five runs on nine hits in six innings. He walked none and fanned three.\nCleveland set the tone with two runs in the bottom of the first. Ramirez ripped a one-out double to drive in Brantley, and he scored two batters later when Alonso singled to right field.\nTim Anderson singled home Palka to cut the deficit to 2-1 in the second.\nIn the third, Brantley put the Indians back on top by a pair of runs with a solo shot to center field. That marked his ninth home run of the season, matching his total from all of 2017.\nAfter a run-scoring single by Lindor in the fifth, Ramirez clubbed his team-leading 16th home run to make it 5-1. Ramirez has gone deep twice in his past three contests.\nBrantley added his second RBI in the seventh on a single that drove in Roberto Perez.\nKipnis hit a solo shot in the eighth for his third homer of the season.\nPalka clubbed a solo homer in the ninth. Trayce Thompson ended the scoring with a bloop hit to drive in Adam Engel.\nCleveland will go for a three-game sweep on Wednesday afternoon. Indians right-hander Corey Kluber (7-2, 2.17 ERA) will square off against White Sox right-hander Reynaldo Lopez (1-3, 2.93).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
