    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Piper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC), a leading investment bank and asset management firm, is pleased to announce the hiring of David Warnke as a managing director in equity sales & trading. Based in the New York office, Warnke will focus on healthcare, one of the firm’s longstanding focus sectors.\nPrior to joining Piper Jaffray, Warnke spent 18 years at Cowen & Company, most recently as a managing director trading large-cap pharmaceutical, med-tech and small-cap biotech stocks. Prior to Cowen & Company, Warnke worked as a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley and Prudential Securities.\n“David brings a breadth of sales and trading experience within the healthcare vertical. His experience in building and maintaining trusted client relationships makes him an excellent fit to lead this group,” said Thomas O’Kane , co-head of global equities at Piper Jaffray. “Warnke’s addition continues a series of new hires for the firm. As other sell-side equity platforms continue to shed high-quality talent, we’ve been adding strong performers and we’re seeing our clients respond favorably.”\nAbout Piper Jaffray\nPiper Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC) is a leading investment bank and asset management firm.
