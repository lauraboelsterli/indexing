FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United vs Watford - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - May 13, 2018 Manchester United's Paul Pogba Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nUnited, whose leading players include David de Gea, Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku, finished second in the 20-team English Premier League on Sunday behind City.\nUnited could end the season with another trophy if they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday.\nThe club, controlled by the American Glazer family, is targeting between 575-585 million pounds of revenue and adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) of between 175-185 million pounds for the year to the end of June.\nInjecting a note of caution, Chief Financial Officer Cliff Baty told analysts the EBITDA figure was likely to come in towards the lower end of the range.\nUnited failed to progress beyond the last 16 of the Champions League after defeat by Spain’s Sevilla in March, ending their run in the lucrative European competition.\nUnited shares, which are listed in New York, slid 4.7 percent to $20.10 by 1435 GMT. They floated at a price of $14 almost six years ago.\nExecutive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward said talk of the creation of a 24-team Club World Cup tournament illustrated the importance of the game to broadcasters.\n“We believe live sports content will become increasingly more valuable in the future,” Woodward told analysts.\nUnited have won the English league title a record 20 times but their performance has slipped in the recent seasons. However, finishing second in the English Premier League is enough to guarantee a place in next season’s Champions League.\nUnited actually took a slightly larger share of Premier League income than City based on having more of their matches shown live.\nThe club’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation for the three months to March 31 rose to 36.1 million pounds from 30 million pounds a year ago.\nRevenue for the period rose 8.1 percent to 137.5 million pounds.
