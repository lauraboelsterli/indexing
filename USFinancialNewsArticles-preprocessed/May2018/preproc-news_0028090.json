REUTERS/Ashlee Espinal\nNg, 69, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick, who also ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, representing assets used in his crimes, and to pay a $1 million criminal fine.\nProsecutors had sought a sentence of more than six years, while Ng’s lawyers had urged Broderick to impose a sentence of time served and let Ng return to China.\nAndrew Genser, a lawyer for Ng, said in court he would seek to have Ng remain free on bail while he appeals his conviction. Broderick is expected to hear arguments on bail later on Friday.\nGenser was not immediately available for comment after the sentencing hearing.\nNg has been under house arrest in a Manhattan apartment since shortly after his arrest in 2015. He was found guilty by a jury last July of charges including bribery and money laundering.\nProsecutors said during Ng’s four-week trial last year that Ng paid more than $1 million in bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a former deputy ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John Ashe, a former U.N. General Assembly president and ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda.\nThe prosecutors said that with the two ambassadors’ support, Ng hoped to build a conference centre in Macau that would turn the former Portuguese territory into the “Geneva of Asia,” while winning “fame and more fortune” for himself. The centre was never built.\nLorenzo pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering, and he testified against Ng at his trial after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors.\nAshe was also criminally charged but died accidentally at home in June 2016 after dropping a barbell on his neck.
