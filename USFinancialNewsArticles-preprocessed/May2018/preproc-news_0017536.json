    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two people previously convicted of trying to defraud the U.S. Export-Import Bank could stand to lose their U.S. citizenship, after the Justice Department filed denaturalization lawsuits against them on Tuesday.\nGuillermo Oscar Mondino, 55, a native of Argentina, and Norma Borgono, 63, a native of Peru, were convicted in 2010 and 2011, respectively, on charges related to a scheme to defraud the Ex-Im Bank of more than $24 million.\nThe Justice Department said it was now taking steps to strip them of their U.S. citizenship, a move that comes as part of a broad immigration crackdown under Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nReporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
