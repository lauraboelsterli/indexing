Listen to the call live via the Events & Presentations page of investors.tdsinc.com .\nTelephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS) reported total operating revenues of $1,225 million for the first quarter of 2018, versus $1,238 million for the same period one year ago. Net income available to TDS shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $39 million and $0.34, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $37 million and $0.33, respectively, in the same period one year ago.\n\"The TDS family of companies, in total, made a strong start to the year,\" said LeRoy T. Carlson, Jr., TDS President and CEO. \"U.S. Cellular drove outstanding customer loyalty and increased its profitability, and successfully implemented continuous improvement initiatives throughout the business. TDS Telecom created momentum from its network investments and federal A-CAM funding to grow its broadband customers.\n\"U.S. Cellular astutely managed growth in network capacity to meet rapidly growing customer data usage ensuring customers receive an unmatched wireless experience. For the fourth time in a row, U.S. Cellular was awarded 'Highest Wireless Network Quality Performance in the North Central Region' by the J.D. Power Wireless Network Quality Performance Study. Postpaid handset gross additions increased modestly and postpaid handset churn remained very low. U.S. Cellular's total customer base increased year over year which, together with increased revenues from device protection plans, helped to offset service plan pricing pressure. U.S. Cellular achieved growth in total operating revenues due to increased sales of both high-priced devices and accessories. Process improvement and cost management initiatives combined with disciplined promotions resulted in improved profitability, as reflected in higher Adjusted EBITDA.\n\"At TDS Telecom, the FCC approved additional A-CAM funding, which will enable us to deploy faster broadband service to more customers, in our most rural markets. The success of recent wireline fiber investments continues to enable growth into 2018, driving growth in IPTV connections and customer demand for faster broadband speeds, which generated higher residential revenue per connection. Cable operations achieved strong growth in broadband connections generating substantially higher cable revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. TDS Telecom is intensely focused on increasing broadband penetration through raising network speed and capacity, and by delivering outstanding customer experiences. Additionally, it continues to seek potential cable acquisition opportunities.\"\n2018 Estimated Results\nTDS' current estimates of full-year 2018 results for U.S. Cellular, TDS Telecom, and TDS are shown below. Such estimates represent management's view as of May 1, 2018. Such forward-looking statements should not be assumed to be current as of any future date. TDS undertakes no duty to update such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. There can be no assurance that final results will not differ materially from such estimated results.\n2018 Estimated Results\nU.S. Cellular\nTDS Telecom (1)\nTDS (1)(2)\nCurrent (3)\nPrevious\nCurrent (3)\nPrevious\nCurrent (3)\nPrevious\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal operating revenues\n$3,850-$4,050\nUnchanged\n$900-$950\nUnchanged\n$5,015-$5,265\nUnchanged\nAdjusted OIBDA (4)(5)\n$625-$775\nUnchanged\n$290-$320\nUnchanged\n$925-$1,105\nUnchanged\nAdjusted EBITDA (4)\n$765-$915\nUnchanged\n$300-$330\nUnchanged\n$1,075-$1,255\nUnchanged\nCapital expenditures\n$500-$550\nUnchanged\n$270\nUnchanged\n$795-$845\nUnchanged\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of Net income to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 estimated results, actual results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and actual results for the year ended December 31, 2017. In providing 2018 estimated results, TDS has not completed the below reconciliation to Net income because it does not provide guidance for income taxes. Although potentially significant, TDS believes that the impact of income taxes cannot be reasonably predicted; therefore, TDS is unable to provide such guidance.\n2018 Estimated Results\nU.S. Cellular (3)\nTDS Telecom (1)(3)\nTDS (1)(2)(3)\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income (GAAP)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nAdd back:\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nIncome before income taxes (GAAP)\n$\n10-160\n$\n80-110\n$\n5-185\nAdd back:\nInterest expense\n110\n–\n170\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\n635\n220\n890\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n755-905\n$\n300-330\n$\n1,065-1,245\nAdd back or deduct:\n(Gain) loss on asset disposals, net\n20\n–\n20\n(Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net\n(10)\n–\n(10)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n765-915\n$\n300-330\n$\n1,075-1,255\nDeduct:\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\n130\n–\n130\nInterest and dividend income\n10\n5\n15\nOther, net (6)\n–\n5\n5\nAdjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) (4)(5)\n$\n625-775\n$\n290-320\n$\n925-1,105\nActual Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (3)\nYear ended December 31, 2017\nU.S.\nCellular\nTDS\nTelecom (1)\nTDS (1)(2)\nU.S.\nCellular\nTDS\nTelecom (1)\nTDS (1)(2)\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n55\n$\n21\n$\n57\n$\n15\n$\n138\n$\n157\nAdd back or deduct:\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n22\n6\n24\n(287)\n(13)\n(279)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(GAAP)\n$\n77\n$\n27\n$\n81\n$\n(272)\n$\n125\n$\n(122)\nAdd back:\nInterest expense\n29\n–\n43\n113\n–\n170\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\n159\n54\n221\n615\n195\n844\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n265\n$\n81\n$\n345\n$\n456\n$\n319\n$\n892\nAdd back or deduct:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n–\n370\n–\n262\n(Gain) loss on asset disposals, net\n1\n–\n2\n17\n3\n21\n(Gain) loss on sale of business and other exit costs, net\n–\n–\n–\n(1)\n–\n(1)\n(Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net\n(7)\n–\n(7)\n(22)\n–\n(22)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n259\n$\n81\n$\n340\n$\n820\n$\n323\n$\n1,152\nDeduct:\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\n38\n–\n38\n137\n–\n137\nInterest and dividend income\n4\n1\n5\n8\n5\n15\nOther, net (6)\n(1)\n1\n1\n–\n3\n4\nAdjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) (4)(5)\n$\n218\n$\n80\n$\n296\n$\n675\n$\n314\n$\n996\nNote: Totals may not foot due to rounding differences.\n(1)\nTDS has re-evaluated internal reporting roles with regard to its HMS business unit and, as a result, has changed its reportable segments. Effective January 1, 2018, HMS is no longer reported under TDS Telecom. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the revised presentation.\n(2)\nThe TDS column includes U.S. Cellular, TDS Telecom and also the impacts of consolidating eliminations, corporate operations and non-reportable segments (including HMS as indicated in Note (1) above), all of which are not presented above.\n(3)\nAs of January 1, 2018, TDS adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, using a modified retrospective approach. Under this method, the new accounting standard is applied only to the most recent period presented. As a result, 2018 amounts include the impacts of ASC 606, but 2017 amounts remain as previously reported, except as specifically stated.\n(4)\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. TDS does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation above are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to Net income are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of TDS' operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of TDS' financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, and gains and losses, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The table above reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measure, Net income or Income (loss) before income taxes.\n(5)\nA reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) to Operating income (GAAP) for March 31, 2018 actual results can be found on TDS' website at investors.tdsinc.com .\n(6)\nASU 2017-07, regarding net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost was adopted as of January 1, 2018, and applied retrospectively. All prior period numbers have been recast to conform to this standard.\nConference Call Information\nTDS will hold a conference call on May 1, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.\nAccess the live call on the Events & Presentations page of investors.tdsinc.com or at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1145/25623 .
