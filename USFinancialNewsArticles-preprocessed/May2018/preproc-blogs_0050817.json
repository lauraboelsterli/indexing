    "text": " newsletter.\nHere’s\n-President Donald Trump signs a directive to streamline regulations on commercial use of space at 11 a.m. and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act at 11:30 a.m.\n-The Gang of Eight meets with Justice Department officials at 2 p.m. to discuss the FBI’s use of a confidential informant in its initial probe of Russian election interference in 2016. Reps. Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy are scheduled to meet at noon with top law enforcement and intelligence officials to discuss the issue.\nHere’s analysis from Susan Benkelman on the Trump administration’s potential use of new tariffs on imported vehicles. Joshua Jamerson is on vacation.\nEarlier this month, President Donald Trump hosted executives from U.S. and foreign auto makers at the White House for a round-table billed as a discussion of emissions rules. Most of the meeting was held behind closed doors, but by day’s end word had circulated that the president had put another item on the table : a threat to impose new tariffs on cars coming into the U.S. as a way to get the companies to build them here in the first place.\nThe president’s warning startled the CEOs and created a stir in the industry, but within a few days it appeared to fade into the background.\nUntil yesterday.\nIn the morning, Mr. Trump teased in a tweet that “there will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!”\nBy afternoon, the WSJ’s Will Mauldin, Tim Puko and Kate O’Keeffe were the first to report what he meant : The president was planning to ask his Commerce secretary to investigate the possibility of imposing tariffs by using part of a 1962 trade law that gives presidents the power to block imports that threaten national security.\nThe maneuver, according to Will, is aimed at putting pressure on U.S. trading partners to come to more favorable terms for sending cars to the U.S.—particularly the EU and Japan but possibly also Mexico and Canada, where auto rules are currently at issue in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nIt could also be an effort to entice the companies to locate more manufacturing in the U.S. In that May 11 meeting, the president singled out Sergio Marchionne, the chairman and CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, as “my favorite man in the room,” citing the auto maker’s plans to move a facility to Michigan from Mexico.\nOr it could be a move to see how far he can push the national security justification for trade actions, which has already been invoked for steel and aluminum tariffs.\nMost likely, it is all of those things at once—part of a multifaceted negotiating strategy to keep the U.S.’s trading partners a little off-balance as the administration seeks maximum leverage in its quest to reorder the global trading system. As Will notes, it also keeps the trade issue and Mr. Trump’s “America First” agenda in front of voters ahead of the fall midterms.\nMore top stories:\nNorth Korea has ratcheted up its anti-U.S. rhetoric, Jonathan Cheng reports. Its senior envoy for U.S. affairs renewed a threat to call off a planned summit with President Trump and warned that Pyongyang could “make the U.S. taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined.”\nIn the same vein, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei scoffed at American demands that his country curb its military ambitions and issued his own set of demands to Europe to remain in the nuclear deal, write Asa Fitch in Dubai and Aresu Eqbali in Tehran.\nDemocrats are quietly fighting their biggest political battle in a decade for state legislative races as they aim to flip control of up to a dozen chambers, Reid J. Epstein reports. The effort could position the party to play a bigger role in redrawing U.S. House districts after the 2020 census and could help boost turnout for candidates running statewide races this year.\nLaura Meckler and Alicia A. Caldwell tell the story of how the nation’s chronically overburdened immigration courts are becoming even more crowded as a wave of illegal immigrants enters the system and fewer are able to exit it. The backlog has reached nearly 700,000, more than double what it was six years ago, and the average case is in court for more than two years. Plus: President Trump suggested withholding aid from some countries to curb illegal immigration.\nOn Capitol Hill, the Trump administration ‘s plan to sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia is running into new resistance, Dion Nissenbaum reports, with lawmakers from both parties saying the U.S. hasn’t done enough to ensure that the missiles aren’t used by Saudi pilots to kill civilians in Yemen.\nFederal Reserve officials at their meeting earlier this month signaled they were likely to raise their benchmark short-term interest rate at their June meeting, Nick Timiraos reports, and they debated how to characterize an evolving policy strategy that soon would no longer try to stimulate economic growth.\nNews & notes: A federal judge ruled that President Trump may not block critics from reading his Twitter feed…Senators reached an agreement on bipartisan legislation to overhaul the Capitol’s sexual-harassment policies , including prohibiting the use of taxpayer funds to pay settlements…The Trump administration will soon issue regulations addressing state legislation aimed at softening the loss of some deductions for state and local taxes under the federal tax overhaul.\nWhat We’re Reading\nGarrett Epps of The Atlantic reviewed four government memos and interviewed six prominent legal scholars to determine whether a sitting president can be indicted. His conclusion: “The one thing I am sure of is that there’s no clear answer.”\nJoshua N. Zingher, writing for the Washington Post , examines the long-term trend of white voters moving away from the Democratic Party, noting that “the Democratic Party is not simply winning a lower proportion of white voters; the whites who are getting more likely to vote for Democrats are less helpful in carrying the electoral college.”\nAmericans for Prosperity , a conservative nonprofit known mostly for targeting Democrats, is about to begin an ad buy “slamming” 10 Republicans as well as seven Democrats over their support for a big spending package earlier this year, Huffpost’s Kevin Robillard reports.\nMilestone\n$407,300: The average sales price for new homes grew to $407,300 in April, the highest price on records dating back to 1963.\n auto makers Donald Trump Tariffs Previous Trump-Kim Summit Could Be Called Off | Texas Democrats Deliver for Party Leaders | How Congress Rolled Back Banking Rules",
