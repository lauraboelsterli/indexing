    "text": "TOKYO, May 29 (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Tuesday that it was difficult for the Fed to raise interest rates by a large margin when the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank were pursuing accommodative policy.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar in Tokyo, Bullard also said the Fed had enough tools and policy options to respond the next time the U.S. economy fell into recession.
