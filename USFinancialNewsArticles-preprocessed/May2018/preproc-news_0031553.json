    "text": "602 COMMENTS JERUSALEM—The U.S. opened its embassy in Jerusalem on Monday amid a spiral of violence that left dozens of Palestinian protesters dead and overshadowed a historic moment for Israel-U.S. relations.\nIsraeli military killed 37 Palestinian protestors at the Gaza Strip’s fence with Israel on Monday, marking the highest single-day death toll since the Israeli army fought a conflict with Gaza rulers Hamas in 2014. Among those killed were a 12- and a 14-year-old, according to Gaza’s ministry of health, who said scores more were injured.\nMonday’s violence marks a culmination of a month and a half of protests in Gaza. Demonstrations involving 35,000 Gazans were larger and more violent than those seen in six weeks of protests on the strip , according to an Israeli military spokesman.\nThe decision by President Donald Trump to move the embassy was seen as a major victory in Israel, which for years has lobbied the international community to move their embassies to Jerusalem. But Tuesday’s bloodshed, which comes after Palestinian and Arab leaders had warned the U.S. against moving the embassy and said it would hurt peace efforts, threatened to taint the celebration of U.S.-Israeli ties.\nA Long Path to the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem\nA Long Path to the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem VIEW In Depth\nAn American delegation including Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin attended the ceremony Monday afternoon at the new site, where Ms. Trump unveiled a plaque in honor of the event.\nMr. Trump addressed the ceremony by pre-recorded video, saying that the U.S. was “fully committed” to a “lasting peace agreement.” He said the U.S. “extends the hand of friendship” to Israel, the Palestinians and their neighbors.\nMr. Kushner said the embassy opening shows the U.S. “will do what is right.”\nThe move’s announcement in December caused thousands of Palestinians to clash with Israeli soldiers, although the violence eventually cooled. Backed by Hamas, however, Gazans in recent weeks have resumed heated protests against Israel ahead of the embassy opening, ratcheting up tensions ahead of the ceremony event.\nThe Gaza protests are expected to reach their height on Tuesday, on what Palestinians call Nakba Day, or Day of the Catastrophe, marking the day after the anniversary of Israel’s founding on May 14, 1948.\nAt similar protests in recent weeks, Israel has said it fired on Palestinians because they attempted to breach the barrier between Gaza and Israel and threatened the lives of Israeli soldiers.\nYahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, which controls the territory, suggested last week that more than 100,000 people could storm the fence on Tuesday.\nRelated Video President Trump on Wednesday recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Mr. Trump said that the U.S. remains committed to reaching a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. Photo: AP (Originally Published December 6, 2017) Israeli military officials say it has information that Hamas is using the protests as a pretext to stage an attack into Israel. Earlier in the morning Israel’s military dropped leaflets over Gaza warning residents not to approach the border.\nArab and Middle East leaders have condemned Israel’s use of live fire against protesters in Gaza but haven’t outright supported the demonstrations for fear of bolstering Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. and a threat to security by many Arab nations.\nTurkey said the U.S. bore responsibility for the deaths on Monday and repeated its opposition to Washington’s decision. “The U.S. is as responsible as the Israeli government for this massacre,” Turkey’s government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said in a statement.\nTuesday’s protests are expected to spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have organized marches.\nMost of the embassy’s functions will remain in Tel Aviv even after the official move, although U.S. Ambassador David Friedman will split his time between the two cities. He will continue to live in his official residence in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv.\nThe state department spent about $400,000 to renovate a consular building in Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood, changed signs and made security upgrades. It will still provide consular services in the building as well as in Tel Aviv.\nAbout 800 guests were expected at Monday’s opening, including 11 Republican members of Congress and American and Israeli officials and business leaders.\nU.S. officials this weekend said they would press on with their still-secret plan to secure what Mr. Trump has called “the ultimate deal” for Middle East peace. The plan is mostly finished, they said, and the administration is seeking the right time and place to present it.\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The Trump administration has said the final boundaries of Jerusalem would be left up to final status negotiations.\nPalestinians are refusing to meet with representatives of the Trump administration and say they no longer recognize the U.S. as the main broker of peace talks with Israel.\nU.S. officials have said recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital reflects the reality on the ground. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and much of its government is in Jerusalem. The international community doesn’t recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nA peace deal has eluded Mr. Trump’s three most recent predecessors as president, and the most recent round of talks collapsed in 2014.\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com",
