    "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Ohio, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- UCG Technologies (UCG), a global information technology services firm, has acquired Cincinnati-based Contract Guardian, Inc. a leader in automated contract management.\nContract Guardian provides a software as a service solution that enables healthcare and cross-industry organizations to manage large numbers of contracts. The system enables clients to easily store/retrieve contracts and verify that they meet regulatory guidelines, manage signatures, workflows, automatically track expirations, review contracts, and conduct risk assessments.\nThe regulatory requirements healthcare technology solutions must satisfy are some of the most demanding when compared with other industries. UCG brings a level of expertise in endpoint security, backup/disaster recovery, and cloud infrastructure that will serve as a point of differentiation from other contract management solution providers. Jim Kandrac, President of UCG, comments, \"The foundation of our business is built on data protection. We recognize the importance of this in healthcare and are looking forward to leveraging our experience for healthcare and cross-industry clients.\"\nThe acquisition also provides significant expansion opportunity for UCG into the healthcare market, as healthcare comprises the majority of Contract Guardian's client base.

It is a unique advantage to be able to provide an offering that will solve regulatory challenges and provide cost efficiencies for healthcare organizations.\"\nFurthermore, Matt's time with IBM Cloud will help bridge the gap between healthcare and IT. Jim Kandrac says, \"Before joining UCG, Matt had responsibility for large healthcare accounts at IBM including health systems and pharmaceutical companies. That industry knowledge will be a strong value add for clients.\"\nUCG has been a client and long-time business partner of Contract Guardian. It plans to invest in the acquired company to expand support, services, sales and marketing while continuing to build upon the firms' product development expertise. The Contract Guardian staff will continue to be based in Cincinnati\n\"This is an exciting time for Contract Guardian.
