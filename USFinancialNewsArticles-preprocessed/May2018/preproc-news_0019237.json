    "text": "-- 2nd Major Investment by KIM in City\nPHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coretrust Capital Partners, LLC , as U.S. Asset Manager for Korea Investment Management Co., Ltd. (KIM), has advised KIM in the acquisition of 5 Crescent Drive, a 208,000-square-foot office building in the Navy Yard submarket of Philadelphia. The seller was Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LPT). KIM purchased the entire fee simple interest in 5 Crescent Drive for $130.5 million or $628 per square foot. This is the second major property acquisition for KIM in Philadelphia, following its February 2016 purchase of the 870,000-square-foot Cira Square in University City.\nDesigned by renowned architect Robert A.M. Stern, the property is located in Philadelphia’s Navy Yard at 5 Crescent Drive. The property received the first double LEED Platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council in Philadelphia. It is a four-story office building and an adjacent surface parking area. It was completed in 2013 by LPT and is fully leased to global pharmaceutical leader GlaxoSmithKline, plc through 2028. KIM has selected the Philadelphia office of CBRE as the property manager, while Coretrust will manage KIM’s investment in the property.\nCoretrust Principal Randall Scott said, “We are very pleased to advise KIM on its second major acquisition in Philadelphia and look forward to directing the operations of this outstanding property.”\nKorea Investment Management Co., Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Korea Investment Holdings, Co., Ltd., which is among the largest investment and securities firms in Korea.
