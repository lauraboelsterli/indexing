    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nortech Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: NSYS), a leading provider of full-service electronics manufacturing services (EMS), today reported net sales of $26.4 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, which includes $0.7 million of revenue recognized under new FASB accounting guidelines adopted this fiscal year. On a pro forma basis to adjust for this change in accounting guidance, first quarter sales of $25.7 million increased $0.2 million sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 while net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $28.3 million.\nNortech reported an operating loss of $120,000 for the first quarter of 2018. This compares with operating income of $121,000 for the first quarter of 2017, which included a one-time gain of $354,000 on the sale of the company’s Wisconsin facility. Excluding the one-time gain, the operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 would have been $233,000, and the first quarter 2018 operating results would have represented an improvement of $113,000 over the adjusted 2017 level, on $2.6 million lower revenue on a pro forma basis.\nThe company reported a net loss of $391,000, or $0.14 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $15,000, or $0.01 per diluted common share, for the 2017 period that reflected the gain on the facility sale. Nortech recognized income tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 despite the operating loss, as a result of foreign operations and related minimum taxes generated from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform.\n“Our first quarter revenue came in as expected, up slightly from the fourth quarter,” said Rich Wasielewski, Nortech Systems’ president and CEO. “Industrial sales were aided by the improving economy, while defense sales continue to benefit from increased defense spending.” He added, “Medical sales were still impacted by several major customers working through their high inventory, but the medical market led our backlog improvements during the quarter and we expect its recovery to continue throughout the year.” Total 90-day backlog was up 13 percent from the start of the quarter.\n“We are pleased with the improvement in our gross profit and operating income, resulting from adjustments in our spending and cost structure to match demand levels, and in generating positive operating cash flow in the quarter,” concluded Wasielewski. “Looking ahead, the improving medical backlog is expected to provide the needed revenue to return to profitability in the second half of the year.”\nConference Call\nNortech Systems will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. (CDT) on Monday, May 14, 2018, to discuss the company’s first quarter results.
