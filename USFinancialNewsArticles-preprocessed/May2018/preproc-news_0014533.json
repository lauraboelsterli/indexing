We successfully introduced Altice One across the Optimum footprint, reaching a milestone of more than 100k customers. We have now begun the rollout of Altice One across the Suddenlink footprint but, even in advance of this launch, Suddenlink saw a significant improvement in customer trends in the quarter.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this presentation, including, without limitation, those regarding Altice USA’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things: Altice USA’s future financial conditions and performance, results of operations and liquidity; Altice USA’s strategy, plans, objectives, prospects, growth, goals and targets; and future developments in the markets in which Altice USA participates or is seeking to participate. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “project” or “will” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. Where, in any forward-looking statement, Altice USA expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. To the extent that statements in this press release are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements, which, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements including risks referred to in Altice USA’s annual and quarterly reports.\nFINANCIAL PRESENTATION\nAltice USA defines Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, income (loss) from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses.\nAltice USA believes Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating its operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in its industry. Internally, Altice USA uses revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of its business performance and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Altice USA believes Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Altice USA’s core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to its ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nAltice USA also uses Adjusted EBITDA less cash Capital Expenditures, or Operating Free Cash Flow, as an indicator of its financial performance. Altice USA believes this measure is one of several benchmarks used by investors, analysts and peers for comparison of performance in Altice USA’s industry, although it may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.\nFINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND COMPARISONS\nFinancial and statistical information is for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, unless otherwise stated, and any year over year comparisons are for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Where financial or statistical information is given for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, any year over year comparisons are to the quarter ended March 31, 2016, unless otherwise stated.\nREGULATED INFORMATION\nThis press release contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation\nMISCELLANEOUS\nAltice USA has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to the distribution of shares of Altice USA by Altice N.V. to its shareholders, which is referred to in this press release.
