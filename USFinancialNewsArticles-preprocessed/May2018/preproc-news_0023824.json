    "text": "HERTFORDSHIRE, England and PITTSBURGH, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues of $2.68 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year period. Europe segment net sales of $1.04 billion, up 16%, up 2% on a constant currency basis. Rest of World segment net sales of $626.7 million, up 8%, up 3% on a constant currency basis. North America segment net sales of $985.3 million, down 19%, primarily due to the combined impact of the loss of exclusivity on the olmesartan products, lower sales of branded products, including the EpiPen® Auto-Injector, the divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets and the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards. U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per ordinary share (\"U.S. GAAP EPS\") of $0.17, up 42% over the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share (\"adjusted EPS\") of $0.96 in line with our expectations, up 3% over the prior year period. U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $621.8 million, up 37% compared to $452.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $663.6 million, up 39% compared to $477.6 million in the prior year period. Mylan is not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information.\nMylan CEO Heather Bresch commented: \"Mylan's first quarter demonstrates continued execution on our long-term plan. Our diversity and durability are what allow us to absorb evolving industry dynamics and natural market volatility, while at the same time accelerate our mission of providing access to high quality medicine. Further demonstrating our commitment to access, I am pleased to share our newly released 2017 Global Social Responsibility Progress Report available at mylan.com .\"\nPresident Rajiv Malik commented: \"We continue to benefit from our diversified and durable global platform, with solid revenue performance from both our Europe and Rest of World segments. We also continue to execute on our key pipeline programs, as outlined during our recent Investor Day, while maintaining our confidence in our ability to bring these important products to market. From an operational standpoint, we are continuing to execute on our integration activities to further optimize our cost structure, at the same time we are investing across our business in areas such as sales and marketing of several global key products. These actions helped to support our performance during the quarter, and we expect to continue this execution throughout 2018.\"\nMylan CFO Ken Parks added, \"During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 3%, in line with our expectations. In addition, we delivered strong adjusted free cash flow of $664 million, an increase of 39 percent over the prior year, driven by improved working capital velocity. This strength continues to demonstrate our stable and durable cash flow profile and supports our financial flexibility to execute on our business strategies and reduce debt levels, while maintaining our commitment to an investment grade credit rating. For the full year 2018, we are reaffirming our guidance and business outlook, including our total revenue range of $11.75 billion to $13.25 billion, adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.20 to $5.60 and adjusted free cash flow range of $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion.\"\nFinancial Summary\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(Unaudited; in millions, except per share amounts and %s)\n2018\n2017\nPercent\nChange\nTotal Revenues (1)\n$\n2,684.5\n$\n2,719.5\n(1)%\nNorth America Net Sales\n985.3\n1,214.9\n(19)%\nEurope Net Sales\n1,038.4\n892.0\n16%\nRest of World Net Sales\n626.7\n580.5\n8%\nOther Revenues\n34.1\n32.1\n6%\nUS GAAP Gross Profit\n$\n984.3\n$\n1,085.0\n(9)%\nUS GAAP Gross Margin\n36.7\n%\n39.9\n%\n(8)%\nAdjusted Gross Profit (2)\n$\n1,419.8\n$\n1,454.2\n(2)%\nAdjusted Gross Margin (2)\n52.9\n%\n53.5\n%\n(1)%\nUS GAAP Net Earnings (Loss)\n$\n87.1\n$\n66.4\n31%\nUS GAAP EPS\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.12\n42%\nAdjusted Net Earnings (2)\n$\n495.6\n$\n499.8\n(1)%\nAdjusted EPS (2)\n$\n0.96\n$\n0.93\n3%\nEBITDA (2)\n$\n663.8\n$\n658.5\n1%\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$\n813.9\n$\n812.7\n—%\n(1)\nAmounts exclude intersegment revenue that eliminates on a consolidated basis.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measures. Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues were $2.68 billion in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.72 billion in the prior year period. Net sales for the current quarter were $2.65 billion compared to $2.69 billion for the prior year period, representing a decrease of $37.0 million, or 1%. Other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $34.1 million, compared to $32.1 million for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $2.0 million.\nNet sales from existing products on a constant currency basis decreased $286.2 million primarily as a result of lower volumes, and to a lesser extent, pricing, which were partially offset by new product introductions of $102.6 million. Sales were also negatively impacted by the adoption of new accounting standards of a net impact of approximately $17.7 million. Mylan's total revenues were favorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of Mylan's subsidiaries in the European Union, India, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current year total revenues was approximately $166.0 million. On a constant currency basis, the decline in total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $201.0 million, or 7%.\nWholesaler and distributor inventory levels of our products can fluctuate throughout the year due to the seasonality of certain products, the timing of product demand and other factors. Such fluctuations may impact the comparability of our net sales between periods. Below is a summary of net sales in each of our segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nNet sales in the North America segment totaled $985.3 million, a decrease of $229.6 million or 19% from the prior year period. This decrease was driven primarily by a $108.7 million combined decrease in the sales of branded products, including EpiPen® Auto-Injector, the impact of the loss of exclusivity of olmesartan and olmesartan HCTZ and the prior year divestiture of certain contract manufacturing assets. In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by $24.6 million related to the implementation of new accounting standards. The remaining decrease was due to lower volumes, and to a lesser extent, pricing, on other existing products partially offset by new product introductions. The impact of foreign currency translation on the current period net sales was insignificant within North America. Partially offsetting the decrease in North America was net sales growth in the Europe segment of $146.4 million, or 16%, in the quarter. Net sales in Europe totaled $1.04 billion in the current quarter. This increase was primarily the result of the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $132.8 million or 14% within Europe. Net sales from new product introductions and favorable volumes were partially offset by slightly lower pricing. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $13.6 million or 2% when compared to the prior year period. Net sales in the Rest of World segment totaled $626.7 million in the current quarter, an increase of $46.2 million, or 8%. This increase was primarily the result of the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $28.2 million and higher net sales as a result of new product sales and favorable volumes, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. The increase in net sales from new products was primarily due to new product sales in emerging markets. The increase in volume was primarily due to the Company's anti-retroviral therapy franchise. Constant currency net sales increased by approximately $18.0 million or 3% when compared to the prior year period.\nU.S. GAAP gross profit was $984.3 million and $1.09 billion for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. U.S. GAAP gross margins were 37% and 40% in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. U.S. GAAP gross margins were negatively impacted in the current quarter by 290 basis points as a result of incremental amortization from product acquisitions and in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") impairment charges. Adjusted gross profit was $1.42 billion and adjusted gross margins were 53% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to adjusted gross profit of $1.45 billion and adjusted gross margins of 53% in the prior year period.\nR&D expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $204.9 million, compared to $217.5 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $12.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to the reprioritization of global programs.\nSG&A expense was $607.5 million, compared to $630.8 million for the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $23.3 million. The net decrease is due to a decline in general and administrative expenses as a result of ongoing integration activities, which were partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges and selling and marketing expenses related to investments in our product portfolio.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a net charge of $16.2 million in Litigation settlements and other contingencies, net compared to a net charge of $9.0 million in the comparative prior year period. The net increase from the prior year period was primarily a result of a current year litigation charge of approximately $13.3 million, primarily related to an anti-trust matter and a patent infringement matter, and a loss of $2.7 million for a fair value adjustment of the respiratory development platform contingent consideration. In the prior year period, the Company recorded a loss of $9.9 million for a fair value adjustment of the Jai Pharma Limited contingent consideration.\nU.S. GAAP net earnings increased by $20.7 million to $87.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to earnings of $66.4 million for the prior year period and U.S. GAAP EPS increased from earnings per share of $0.12 in the prior year period to $0.17 in the current quarter. The Company recognized a U.S. GAAP income tax benefit of $76.6 million, compared to an income tax provision of $5.2 million for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted net earnings decreased to $495.6 million compared to $499.8 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.96 from $0.93 in the prior year period.\nEBITDA was $663.8 million for the current quarter and $658.5 million for the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $813.9 million for the current quarter and $812.7 million for the comparable prior year period.\nCash Flow\nU.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities was $621.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $452.9 million for the prior year period. Capital expenditures were approximately $30.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to approximately $58.4 million for the comparable prior year. The Company repurchased 9.8 million ordinary shares in the first quarter of 2018 at a cost of approximately $432.0 million completing the previously authorized share repurchase program. Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $694.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $536.0 million for the prior year period. Adjusted free cash flow , defined as adjusted net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $663.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $477.6 million in the prior year period.\nConference Call and Earnings Materials\nMylan N.V. will host a conference call and live webcast, today at 10:00 a.m. ET, to review the company's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The briefing can be accessed live by calling 800.514.4861 or 678.809.2405 for international callers (ID#: 2194037) or at the following address on the company's website: investor.mylan.com . The \"Q1 2018 Earnings Call\" presentation, which will be referenced during the call can be found at investor.mylan.com . A replay of the webcast will also be available on the website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EPS, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted free cash flow, constant currency total revenues and constant currency net sales are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Mylan N.V. (\"Mylan\" or the \"Company\"). Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. In addition, primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using the adjusted metrics included herein, along with other performance metrics. Management's annual incentive compensation is derived, in part, based on the adjusted EPS metric and the adjusted free cash flow metric. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA and Credit Agreement Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) pursuant to our Credit Agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of \"constant currency\" total revenues and net sales. These measures provide information on the change in total revenues and net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales and total revenues performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. The \"Summary of Total Revenues by Segment\" table below compares net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as for total revenues. Also, set forth below, Mylan has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFor additional information regarding the components and uses of Non-GAAP financial measures refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Mylan's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the \"Form 10-Q\").\nMylan is not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses including those related to the Meda transaction, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, including changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS\nBelow is a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net earnings and U.S. GAAP EPS to adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nU.S. GAAP net earnings and U.S. GAAP EPS\n$\n87.1\n$\n0.17\n$\n66.4\n$\n0.12\nPurchase accounting related amortization (primarily included in cost of sales) (a)\n423.4\n349.2\nLitigation settlements and other contingencies, net\n16.2\n(0.9)\nInterest expense (primarily clean energy investment financing and accretion of contingent\nconsideration)\n9.7\n25.0\nClean energy investments pre-tax loss\n23.0\n22.3\nAcquisition related costs (primarily included in SG&A and cost of sales) (b)\n2.3\n31.3\nRestructuring related costs (c)\n45.4\n23.1\nOther special items included in:\nCost of sales\n10.0\n7.1\nResearch and development expense (d)\n46.6\n65.1\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n1.8\n5.9\nOther expense, net (e)\n17.4\n6.1\nTax effect of the above items and other income tax related items\n(187.3)\n(100.8)\nAdjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS\n$\n495.6\n$\n0.96\n$\n499.8\n$\n0.93\nWeighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding\n516.8\n536.9\nSignificant items for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\n(a)\nThe increase in purchase accounting related amortization for the three month period is primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation on the amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Meda AB (publ.). In addition, amortization expense increased as a result of the full impact of various product rights acquisitions which occurred throughout 2017 and a $30.0 million IPR&D impairment charge in the current quarter.\n(b)\nAcquisition related costs primarily relate to acquisition and integration activities. Included in SG&A for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is approximately $24.1 million, primarily related to consulting, professional and legal costs.\n(c)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, approximately $4.4 million is included in cost of sales, $4.9 million is included in R&D, and $36.1 million is included in SG&A. Refer to Note 17 Restructuring included in Item 1 of the Form 10-Q for additional information.\n(d)\nR&D expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes two non-refundable upfront payments totaling approximately $43.0 million for development agreements entered into during the quarter, and the remaining expense relates to the Momenta collaboration. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, R&D expense includes an upfront expense of approximately $50.0 million related to a joint development and marketing agreement for a respiratory product, $5.8 million related to Momenta collaboration expense, and other similar smaller agreements.\n(e)\nPrimarily related to mark-to-market losses of investments in equity securities historically accounted for as available-for-sale securities and the cumulative realized gains on such investments.\nBelow is a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net earnings to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nU.S. GAAP net earnings\n$\n87.1\n$\n66.4\nAdd adjustments:\nNet contribution attributable to equity method investments\n23.1\n33.2\nIncome tax (benefit) provision\n(76.6)\n5.2\nInterest expense\n131.7\n138.2\nDepreciation and amortization\n498.5\n415.5\nEBITDA\n$\n663.8\n$\n658.5\nAdd adjustments:\nShare-based compensation expense\n21.4\n23.1\nLitigation settlements and other contingencies, net\n16.2\n9.0\nRestructuring & other special items\n112.5\n122.1\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n813.9\n$\n812.7\nAbout Mylan\nMylan is a global pharmaceutical company committed to setting new standards in healthcare.
