    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French spare car parts distributor Autodis said on Wednesday it had decided to suspend its planned initial public offering due to a “cautious” market environment.\nAutodis added it was confident about its future and that it would accelerate its expansion strategy in Western Europe with the support of Bain Capital, its majority shareholder.\nBankers were hoping the IPO would value the company at more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) including debt, based on a valuation of 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which is forecast at just above 100 million euros for 2018, a source told Reuters earlier in January.\nReporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ",
