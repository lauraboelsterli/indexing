    "text": "A firm led by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels in her suit against , was hit Tuesday with a $10 million judgment by a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, the Los Angeles Times reported .\nThe firm, Eagan Avenatti, was ordered to pay $10 million to Jason Frank, a lawyer who used to work there, the Times reported.\nEagan Avenatti and Frank had previously agreed that the $10 million would be waived if Frank was paid a total of $4.85 million, according to court records.\nBut Frank asked for the full $10 million after failing to receive an initial $2 million installment toward the agreed amount when it was due May 14, according to records.\nIn a statement to CNBC, Avenatti said the Times' account of the case \"nonsense.\"\nshow chapters Porn star Stormy Daniels files new defamation lawsuit against President Trump 3:58 PM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 00:49 \"Completely different law firm - no ties to Daniels case. Irrelevant,\" Avenatti said in an email.\nAvenatti is representing Daniels in multiple lawsuits against the president, but Eagan Avenatti is not involved in those cases. He is using Avenatti & Associates, APC for Daniels' legal matters.\nBrown George Ross, the firm that represents Frank, said in a prepared statement, ''Last week, Mr. Avenatti described our client's claims as \"fraudulent and bogus.\" Today, a federal judge issued a $10 million judgment in our client's favor. That should tell you all you need to know about who is telling the truth.''\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, a Justice Department lawyer said Eagan Avenatti had also defaulted on back taxes that it had agreed to pay in connection with another bankruptcy proceeding, according to the LA Times.\nIn that case, which was settled Jan. 30, Avenatti agreed to pay the government $2.4 million, the Times reported. At least $1.5 million of that amount has been paid, but Avenatti missed an installment last week, the judge reportedly told the court Tuesday.\nRead the full report from the Los Angeles Times.",
