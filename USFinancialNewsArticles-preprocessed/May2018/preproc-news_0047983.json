    "text": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) announced today that its board of directors has authorized an increase of 13 percent in the quarterly dividend paid on its common stock. The new rate of 26 cents per common share, or $1.04 per share on an annual basis, will be effective with the dividend expected to be paid in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We are pleased to again increase our dividend payout. This is representative of our consistent performance and financial strength as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders,” said Richard P.
