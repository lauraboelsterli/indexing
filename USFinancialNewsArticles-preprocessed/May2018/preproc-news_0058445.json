    "text": "Anthony Banda did not start the game but pitched a career-high 6 1/3 effective innings as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-1 Saturday at Tropicana Field.\nThe Rays used a reliever to open the game as Ryne Stanek started and struck out three in 1 2/3 innings while throwing 21 pitches before Banda produced the best outing of his career. Before turning things over to Banda, Stanek fanned Manny Machado, who hit a grand slam off him May 11 in Baltimore.\nBanda (1-0) allowed a leadoff triple to Danny Valencia in the fifth before escaping without damage and a leadoff double to Manny Machado in the seventh before allowing a two-out, RBI single to Chris Davis. The left-hander Banda struck out seven, issued one walk and threw 81 pitches.\nJoey Wendle hit an RBI triple for his first extra-base hit in 56 at-bats and Wilson Ramos contributed an RBI double as the Rays won for the second time in their last eight home games.\nRob Refsnyder added an RBI single and C.J. Cron chipped in a two-run double as Tampa Bay won for the eighth time in 12 games.\nBaltimore starter Andrew Cashner (2-6) allowed five runs and matched a career high by allowing 11 hits for the third time.\nThe Orioles were held to three hits or less for the seventh time this season and fell to 4-6 on an 11-game trip. Baltimore also struck out 11 times and was held to one run or less for the 13th time.\nThe Rays took a 2-0 lead in the first when Wendle tripled to right field and scored on Ramos’ double to right.\nWith one out in the second Tampa extended the lead to 3-0 on Refsnyder’s single to right. Two batters later Cron made it 5-0 with a double to center.\nAfter allowing the Orioles to score, Banda finished the seventh by inducing Joey Rickard to pop out. He retired the side in the eighth before Chaz Roe finished the ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
