Full year 2018 revenue from continuing operations increased 13.5% (7.8% organic growth and 5.7% inorganic growth) to $326.2 million, compared to the prior year period of $287.5 million. Fourth quarter 2018 reported operating income from continuing operations increased 65.6% to $10.6 million compared to the prior year period of $6.4 million. Fourth quarter 2018 reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.68, compared to the prior year period of $0.21. Fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.51, compared to the prior year period of $0.42. Full year 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 45.7% to $57.4 million, compared to the prior year period of $39.4 million.\nDALLAS, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSW Industrials, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSWI), a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across two segments: Industrial Products and Specialty Chemicals, today reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2018.\nNet revenue from continuing operations during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 increased 9.2% to $83.5 million, compared to the prior year period of $76.4 million. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales into HVAC, plumbing and energy end markets and sales from the acquired Greco business ($2.0 million), partially offset by lower volume of legacy businesses into the architecturally-specified building products end market.\nReported operating income from continuing operations in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 increased to $10.6 million, or 12.7% of sales, compared to $6.4 million, or 8.4% of sales, in the prior year period. The increase in operating income was driven by higher volume in the Company’s Industrial Products segment and lower discrete expenses year over year.\nJoseph B. Armes, CSW Industrials’ Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, “We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as we continued to grow our revenues organically and through acquisitions while leveraging operational best practices across our business units. The combination of these factors drove a 17.6% increase in adjusted income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.” Armes continued, “As we look ahead to fiscal 2019, our focus remains on generating long-term, profitable growth by leveraging our strong distribution channels through organic and inorganic growth initiatives, including strategic bolt-on acquisitions, targeted product development and strategic sales territory expansion.”\nFourth Quarter Results of Operations\nThe below results reflect the Company’s financial results from continuing operations unless otherwise noted.\nConsolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $83.5 million, compared to $76.4 million in the prior year period.\nIndustrial Products segment revenue increased 12.5% to $46.8 million, compared to $41.6 million in the prior year period. Higher revenue was mainly the result of strong sales in HVAC and plumbing end markets and sales from the acquired Greco business ($2.0 million), partially offset by decreased volumes by legacy businesses into the architecturally-specified building products end market. Reported operating income increased 28.6% to $10.8 million, compared to $8.4 million in the prior year period. Adjusted to exclude non-recurring expenses, segment operating income increased 13.5% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.6 million in the prior year period.\nSpecialty Chemicals segment revenue increased 5.2% to $36.6 million, compared to $34.8 million in the prior year period. Higher revenue was driven by higher volumes in plumbing and energy end markets, partially offset by lower sales into mining and rail end markets. Reported segment operating income was $3.3 million, compared to $0.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted to exclude non-recurring expenses, segment operating income decreased to $3.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of an unfavorable sales mix and some discrete costs.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 18.7% to $36.2 million, compared to $30.5 million in the prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of sales improved 350 basis points to 43.4%, compared to 39.9% in the prior year period. Higher gross margin compared to the prior year primarily reflected increased operating leverage and lower restructuring and realignment costs, partially offset by unfavorable sales mix in Specialty Chemicals.\nConsolidated operating expenses were $25.7 million, or 30.7% of sales, compared to the prior year level of $24.1 million, or 31.5% of sales, an improvement of 80 basis points, driven by lower one-time discrete expenses year over year. The increase in operating expenses was due to increased selling costs on higher revenue and the expenses from the acquired Greco business, partially offset by lower one-time discrete expenses year over year.\nReported income from continuing operations was $10.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted to exclude one-time expenses and applying a normalized tax rate, adjusted income from continuing operations in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 was $8.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $6.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nFull Year Results\nConsolidated revenue increased 13.5% to $326.2 million, compared with prior year revenue of $287.5 million. Higher revenue was attributed to sales from the acquired Greco business, coupled with organic growth in HVAC, plumbing and energy end markets. This growth was partially offset by decreased volumes by legacy businesses into architecturally-specified building products and in industrial product end markets.\nIndustrial Products segment revenue increased 17.5% to $186.5 million, compared to $158.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in revenue was mainly the result of strong organic growth of both existing products and new products, particularly into the HVAC and plumbing end markets, and sales from the acquired Greco business, partially offset by lower volumes by legacy businesses into architecturally-specified building products and in industrial product end markets. Reported segment operating income increased 33.7% to $44.0 million, compared to $32.9 million in the prior year period. Segment adjusted operating income increased 28.9% to $44.6 million, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year period.\nSpecialty Chemicals segment revenue increased 8.5% to $139.7 million, compared to $128.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in revenue was driven by higher sales volumes into the energy, HVAC and plumbing end markets. Reported segment operating income increased 36.3% to $18.4 million, compared to $13.5 million in the prior year period. Segment adjusted operating income declined 5.3% to $19.5 million, compared to $20.6 million in the prior year period, due to unfavorable sales mix and some discrete costs.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 14.7% to $147.9 million over the prior year level of $128.9 million. Gross margin as a percentage of sales improved 40 basis points to 45.3%, compared to 44.9% in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased gross margin is attributable to the impact of increased sales and lower restructuring and realignment costs.\nConsolidated operating expenses were $97.2 million, or 29.8% of sales, compared to the prior year level of $95.8 million, or 33.3% of sales, an improvement of 350 basis points, driven by lower one-time discrete expenses year over year. Increased operating expenses were attributable to operating expenses from the acquired Greco business and severance charges, mostly offset by executive transition and implementation costs for internal controls compliance incurred in the prior fiscal year that did not recur.\nThe effective tax rate on continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was negative 6.8%. The tax benefit resulted from the refinement of the one-time transition tax for mandatory repatriation based on cash and net accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries due to U.S. tax reform legislation. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be in a range of 25% to 27%.\nReported income from continuing operations was $32.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared to $17.8 million, or $1.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted to exclude one-time expenses and applying a normalized tax rate, adjusted income from continuing operations for the fiscal year 2018 was $33.6 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $28.7 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, increased 45.7% to $57.4 million, compared to $39.4 million in the prior fiscal year, due to improved profits and improved working capital. The Company expects cash flow from continuing operations to be further enhanced in the future as a result of the lower corporate tax rate due to tax reform and recent strategic operational repositioning.\nConference Call Information\nThe company will host a conference call the same day at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.
