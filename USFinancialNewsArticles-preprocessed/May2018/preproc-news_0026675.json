The Company also announced that it has entered into an amendment to its senior secured facility, and that Peter Westley has been elected as Chairman of its Board of Directors.\nHighlights of First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nBookings excluding Greater China were $101.6 million, an increase of 5% year over year. Continued strong revenue growth from subscription and digital/ecommerce sales, with cloud-enabled software subscriptions now at nearly 100,000 at the end of the first quarter and up 40% year-over-year, and digital/e-commerce sales up 58% year-over-year. GAAP Revenue was $97.9 million, in line with guidance. GAAP Gross Margin was 57%. Non-GAAP Gross Margin was 59%, an improvement 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.3 million, in line with guidance. GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.4 million. Free Cash Flow was $3.3 million, up 82% over the prior year.\n“During the first quarter, Avid generated positive free cash flow, made progress toward improving our gross margins and saw continued bookings growth,” said Jeff Rosica, Chief Executive Officer and President of Avid. “Our strategies are resonating with customers and users across the industry as we help them to address the significant changes in the media landscape. In particular, our cloud-based subscriptions and software tools for individual creatives and teams continued to generate good revenue growth last quarter.”\nRosica continued, “At our recent Avid Connect event and the NAB Show, the Company again demonstrated our rapid pace of innovation with another wave of introductions such as new tools and solutions for aspiring artists and creative professionals, and Avid’s first SaaS offering for media enterprises. We expect to achieve additional revenue and margin contributions starting in the second half of 2018 as we bring these new product releases to market during the coming months.\"\nAmendment to Senior Secured Facility\nOn May 10, 2018, Avid entered into an amendment with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, its senior lender, to extend the maturity of its current term loan to May 2023 and increase its term and revolving facilities by an aggregate of $35 million. In addition, under the terms of the amendment, the facility will be subject to a lower interest rate and annual fees, have a reduced principal amortization schedule and no longer include a springing repayment feature related to the maturity of the Company’s convertible notes in June 2020.\n“We are pleased with our improved capital structure in which we increased the facility and reduced debt service, without incurring any fees,” said Brian E. Agle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Avid. “During the quarter, we successfully transitioned our financial reporting to the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606. As we look to the balance of 2018, the Avid team is focused on better harvesting our backlog and converting each quarter’s bookings to revenue and cash.”\nAvid Board Elects Peter Westley as Chairman\nAvid also announced today that Peter Westley has been elected Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Westley is a Partner at Blum Capital Partners, a significant long-term shareholder. He has 30 years of experience in financial services working with media and technology companies, and has served on Avid’s board since 2016 as an independent director.\n“I’m excited about the opportunity to lead Avid’s Board and I’m enthusiastic about the Company’s prospects for achieving greater shareholder value through better operational execution and financial discipline, while continuing to strengthen our strategic position with customers through our software and platform strategy,” said Peter Westley. “Our board is grateful for Nancy Hawthorne’s ongoing, valuable contributions and positive influence on Avid, and I’m pleased that she’s been re-elected to a new three-year term. Her board leadership throughout the recent period of management transition was crucial.”\n“Avid today enjoys a highly diverse board of directors with deep experience across media, technology and finance,” said Nancy Hawthorne. “As the company moves into building upon its recent transformation, operational excellence and driving shareholder value are of paramount importance. As chair of the nominating and governance committee, I believe Peter’s background and leadership will be highly aligned with these priorities. I will continue in my role as board member, and I am committed to helping steer Avid’s increasing focus on culture and workplace environment, along with its other priorities.”\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nAvid’s second quarter 2018 financial guidance is provided in the table below. This guidance reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018.\n(in $ millions) Q2 2018 Revenue $97 - $107 Adjusted EBITDA $4 - $10 All guidance presented by the Company is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Avid’s actual future results of operations could differ materially from those shown in the table above. For a discussion of some of the key assumptions underlying the guidance, as well as the key risks and uncertainties associated with these forward-looking statements, please see “Forward Looking Statements” below as well as the Avid Technology Q1 2018 Business Update presentation posted on Avid’s Investor Relations website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAvid includes non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and non-GAAP Gross Profit and Margin. The Company also includes the operational metrics of bookings and revenue backlog in this release. Avid believes the non-GAAP financial measures and operational metrics provided in this release provide helpful information to investors with respect to evaluating the Company’s performance. Unless noted, all financial information is reported based on actual exchange rates. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in our Form 8-K filed today. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release to the Company's comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods presented are set forth below and are also included in the supplemental financial and operational data sheet available on our investor relations webpage at ir.avid.com , which also includes definitions of the operational metrics.\nThe earnings release also includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. Reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not included in the earnings release due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the excluded information, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible at this time. As a result, the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\nConference Call\nAvid will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the first quarter 2018 on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET.
