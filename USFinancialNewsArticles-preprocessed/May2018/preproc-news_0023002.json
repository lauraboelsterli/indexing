    "text": "Strong Growth in International, Voucherless, and Platform Initiatives;\nRaises Full Year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA Outlook\nGross profit of $324.9 million Net loss from continuing operations of $2.8 million Adjusted EBITDA of $52.6 million GAAP loss per diluted share of $0.01; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.03 Operating cash flow of $148.9 million for the trailing twelve month period; Free cash flow of $83.7 million for the trailing twelve month period 2018 Adjusted EBITDA guidance raised to $280 million to $290 million Board of Directors approved $300 million share repurchase authorization\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We're off to a solid start in 2018, highlighted by strong bottom line growth and continued execution against our strategy and key priorities. More than a million new customers enrolled in our voucherless Groupon+ program during the quarter and are beginning to experience the next generation of Groupon,\" said CEO Rich Williams. \"In addition, we signed a number of new partnerships that connect more high quality local offers with our customer scale and solidify our position as a true platform in local. We're also excited about the strong momentum in our international business, thanks to significant progress on our product, supply and marketing initiatives.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary\nNorth America\nDuring the quarter we continued to make progress on our customer experience and platform initiatives in North America. We recently announced several partnerships that further strengthen the inventory available on the Groupon platform. Additionally, we launched American Express to bolster our card linked offers platform and offer more choice to customers as we scale our voucherless experiences. We now have over 4.2 million cards linked in Groupon+™, one of our leading voucherless initiatives, and continue to deepen supply in our more than 25 Groupon+ markets. North America gross profit in the first quarter 2018 decreased 1% to $219.7 million. In Local, gross profit decreased 2% to $166.8 million driven by our continued scaling of Groupon+ and the sale of certain OrderUp assets in the second half of 2017. Goods gross profit increased 1% to $36.9 million resulting from our continued focus on optimizing for gross profit. Gross profit in Travel increased 6% to $16.0 million. North America active customers were 32.6 million as of March 31, 2018, and trailing twelve month gross profit per active customer increased 1%.\nInternational\nWe generated positive results in International in the first quarter as we advanced our product, supply, and marketing initiatives. In Local, we ran our largest single International deal ever with Odeon, one of the largest cinema chains in the United Kingdom. In Goods, we made further operational improvements focused on driving long-term gross profit growth and improving the customer experience. International gross profit increased 19% (5% FX-neutral) in the first quarter 2018 to $105.2 million. Gross profit increased 19% (5% FX-neutral) in Local, 26% (10% FX-neutral) in Goods, and 6% (7% FX-neutral decline) in Travel. International active customers increased to 17.0 million as of March 31, 2018, and trailing twelve month gross profit per active customer increased 9%.\nConsolidated\nRevenue was $626.5 million in the first quarter 2018, down 7% (11% FX-neutral) reflecting our continued focus on revenue generation that maximizes gross profit. Gross profit was $324.9 million in the first quarter 2018, up 5% (1% FX-neutral), led by growth in International. SG&A declined 4% to $222.1 million in the first quarter 2018 as we continue to focus on operational efficiency. Marketing expense was $99.2 million in the first quarter 2018, up 15%. Net loss from continuing operations was $2.8 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to a net loss of $20.9 million in the first quarter 2017. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $6.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $24.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $16.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $5.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $52.6 million in the first quarter 2018, up 17% from $44.8 million in the first quarter 2017. Global units sold declined 7% to 42.4 million in the first quarter 2018 as we continued to manage our business to maximize gross profit, which in some instances, resulted in fewer units. Units in North America were down 11% with a significant portion of that decline due to our focus on long-term gross profit optimization in Goods as well as our continued scaling of Groupon+ and the sale of certain OrderUp assets that occurred in the second half of 2017. Operating cash flow was $148.9 million for the trailing twelve month period as of the first quarter 2018, and free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $83.7 million for the trailing twelve month period. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $725.9 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings under our $250 million revolving credit facility. In May 2018, the Board of Directors approved a $300 million share repurchase authorization, which replaces the recently expired authorization. The timing and amount of share repurchases, if any, will be determined based on market conditions, limitations under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, share price and other factors, and the program may be terminated at any time.\nDefinitions and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures and additional information regarding operational measures are included below in the section titled \"Terminology Changes, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Metrics\" and in the accompanying tables. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise provided.\nOutlook\nGroupon is raising its outlook for 2018, which reflects current foreign exchange rates and the Vouchercloud acquisition, which we expect to contribute $5 to $6 million to Adjusted EBITDA in 2018. For the full year 2018, Groupon now expects Adjusted EBITDA to be between $280 million and $290 million, an increase from the previously provided range of $260 million and $270 million.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 9:00 a.m. CDT / 10:00 a.m. EDT and will be available on Groupon’s investor relations website at http://investor.groupon.com . This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nGroupon encourages investors to use its investor relations website as a way of easily finding information about the company. Groupon promptly makes available on this website, free of charge, the reports that the company files or furnishes with the SEC, corporate governance information (including Groupon’s Global Code of Conduct), and select press releases and social media postings. Groupon uses its investor relations site ( investor.groupon.com ) and the Groupon blog ( www.groupon.com/blog ) as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nTerminology Changes, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Operational Metrics\nIn prior periods, we referred to our product revenue and service revenue as \"direct revenue\" and \"third-party and other revenue,\" respectively. This terminology change did not impact the amounts presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements accompanying this release.\nIn addition to financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Foreign exchange rate neutral operating results, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP income (loss) per share, non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are presented on a continuing operations basis, are intended to aid investors in better understanding our current financial performance and prospects for the future as seen through the eyes of management. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons with our historical results and with the results of peer companies who present similar measures (although other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we define them, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures). However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For reconciliations of these measures to the most applicable financial measures under U.S. GAAP, see \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation Schedules\" and \"Supplemental Financial and Operating Metrics\" included in the tables accompanying this release.\nWe exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation because it is primarily non-cash in nature and we believe that non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and liquidity.\nAcquisition-related expense (benefit), net. Acquisition-related expense (benefit), net is comprised of the change in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements and external transaction costs related to business combinations, primarily consisting of legal and advisory fees. The composition of our contingent consideration arrangements and the impact of those arrangements on our operating results vary over time based on a number of factors, including the terms of our business combinations and the timing of those transactions. We exclude acquisition-related expense (benefit), net because we believe that non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results.\nDepreciation and amortization. We exclude depreciation and amortization expenses because they are non-cash in nature and we believe that non-GAAP financial measures excluding these items provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and liquidity.\nInterest and Other Non-Operating Items. Interest and other non-operating items include: gains and losses related to minority investments, foreign currency gains and losses, interest income and interest expense, including non-cash interest expense from our convertible senior notes. We exclude interest and other non-operating items from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these items provides meaningful supplemental information about our core operating performance and facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results.\nSpecial Charges and Credits. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, special charges and credits included charges related to our restructuring plan. We exclude special charges and credits from Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that excluding those items provides meaningful supplemental information about our core operating performance and facilitates comparisons with our historical results.\nDescriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release and the accompanying tables are as follows:\nForeign exchange rate neutral operating results show current period operating results as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained the same as those in effect in the prior year period. These measures are intended to facilitate comparisons to our historical performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure that we define as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding income taxes, interest and other non-operating items, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expense (benefit), net and other special charges and credits, including items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions for the allocation of capital. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for income (loss) from continuing operations.\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes, Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP income (loss) per diluted share are non-GAAP performance measures that adjust our net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per share to exclude the impact of:\nstock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expense (benefit), net, special charges and credits, including restructuring charges, non-cash interest expense on convertible senior notes, non-operating foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany balances and reclassifications of cumulative translation adjustments to earnings as a result of business dispositions or country exits, non-operating gains and losses from minority investments that we have elected to record at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, non-operating gains and losses from the sale of minority investments, and income (loss) from discontinued operations.\nWe believe that excluding the above items from our measures of non-GAAP income from continuing operations before provision (benefit) from income taxes, non-GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provides useful supplemental information for evaluating our operating performance and facilitates comparisons to our historical results by eliminating items that are non-cash in nature, relate to discrete events, or are otherwise not indicative of the core operating performance of our ongoing business.\nNon-GAAP Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes reflects our current and deferred tax provision computed based on non-GAAP income from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that comprises net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software from continuing operations. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from continuing operations, we believe that it typically represents a more useful measure of cash flows because purchases of fixed assets, software developed for internal use and website development costs are necessary components of our ongoing operations. Free cash flow is not intended to represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the applicable period.\nDescriptions of the operating metrics included in this release and the accompanying tables are as follows:\nGross Billings. This metric represents the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services. For sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services, which comprise a substantial majority of our service revenue transactions, gross billings differs from revenue reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which is presented net of the merchant's share of the transaction price. For product revenue transactions, gross billings are equivalent to product revenue reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of our growth and business performance as it measures the dollar volume of transactions generated through our marketplaces. Tracking gross billings on service revenue transactions also allows us to monitor the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to merchants.\nActive customers. We define active customers as unique user accounts that have made a purchase during the trailing twelve months (\"TTM\") either through one of our online marketplaces or directly with a merchant for which we earned a commission. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of our business performance as it helps us to understand how the number of customers actively purchasing our offerings is trending. Some customers could establish and make purchases from more than one account, so it is possible that our active customer metric may count certain customers more than once in a given period. For entities that we have acquired in a business combination, this metric includes active customers of the acquired entity, including customers who made purchases prior to the acquisition.\nUnits. This metric represents the number of purchases during the reporting period, before refunds and cancellations, made either through one of our online marketplaces or directly with a merchant for which we earned a commission. We consider unit growth to be an important indicator of the total volume of business conducted through our marketplaces.\nGross profit per active customer. This metric represents the TTM gross profit generated per active customer. We use this metric to evaluate trends in the average contribution to gross profit on a per-customer basis. We updated the calculation of this metric in the current period to reflect active customers as of the end of the period, rather than the average of active customers as of the beginning and end of period, in the denominator of the calculation. Because our active customer metrics are based on purchases over a TTM period, we believe that this change improves the usefulness of this metric. The prior periods presented have been updated to reflect this change.\nNote on Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements contained in this release that refer to plans and expectations for the next quarter, the full year or the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations.

(3) Reflects the total number of unique user accounts that have made a purchase during the TTM either through one of our online marketplaces or directly with a merchant for which we earned a commission. (4) During the first quarter 2018, we updated the calculation of TTM Gross Profit / Active Customer to reflect active customers as of the end of the period, rather than the average of active customers as of the beginning and end of period, in the denominator of the calculation. Because our active customer metrics are based on purchases over a TTM period, we believe that this change improves the usefulness of this metric. The prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this change. (5) Includes merchant sales representatives, as well as sales support personnel.
