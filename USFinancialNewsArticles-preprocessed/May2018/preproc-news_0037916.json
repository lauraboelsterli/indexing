    "text": "Vallourec reports first quarter 2018 results\nRevenue of €862 million, up 10.1% year-on-year (+22.1% at constant exchange rates) Q1 2018 EBITDA improved year-on-year at -€5 million H2 2018 EBITDA targeted to be significantly higher than H1, supported by higher prices in the US and deliveries on international Oil & Gas markets Boulogne-Billancourt (France), 17 May 2018 - Vallourec, a world leader in premium tubular solutions, today announces its results for the first quarter of 2018. The consolidated financial information was presented by Vallourec's Management Board to its Supervisory Board on 16 May 2018.\nKey figures\nQ1 Q1 Change In millions of euros Q4 2018 2017 YoY 2017 515 475 8.4% Sales Volume (k tons) 655 862 783 10.1% Revenue 1,070 (5) (21) +€16m EBITDA 11 -0.6% -2.7% +2.1 pts As % of revenues 1.0% (170) (126) -€44m Net income (loss), Group share (164) (254) (220) -€34m Free cash-flow (26) 31 Mar.2018 Change over the period In millions of euros 31 Dec. 2017 1,783 +€241m Net debt 1,542 Commenting on these results, Philippe Crouzet, Chairman of the Management Board, said:\n\"Vallourec's financial performance continues to improve: our revenue and EBITDA increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the previous year notably thanks to the strong momentum on the Oil & Gas market in the US. Compared to the last quarter of 2017, in spite of negative seasonality impact, cash flow from operating activities improved significantly.\nSupported by robust oil prices, tendering activity is improving in International Oil & Gas markets. Since the beginning of the year, we have achieved significant commercial successes including the reinforcement of our long-standing partnership with Petrobras in Brazil, and we participated in large tenders which should benefit Vallourec deliveries from the end of 2018 on.\nThe final outcome of Section 232 measures in the US is uncertain, but we are ready to adapt as necessary, and to benefit from our local US production.\nWe are moving forward with our Transformation Plan, which is generating significant cost reductions, and we have initiated further adjustments in Europe.\nTaking into account the gradual recovery in our main markets and the progress in our Transformation Plan, we confirm our positive outlook for the year with EBITDA in the second half of 2018 targeted to be significantly higher than in the first half.\"\nI - CONSOLIDATED REVENUE BY MARKET\nIn millions of euros Q1\n2018 Q1\n2017 Change Change YoY at constant exchange rates Q4\n2017 YoY Oil & Gas, Petrochemicals 584 533 9.6% 24.2% 708 Power Generation 98 84 16.7% 20.2% 125 Industry & Other 180 166 8.4% 16.9% 237 Total 862 783 10.1% 22.1% 1,070 Over the first quarter of 2018, Vallourec recorded revenue of €862 million, up 10.1% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Revenue was up 22.1% at constant exchange rates with a positive volume impact of 8.4% mainly driven by Oil & Gas operations in the US, and a positive price/mix effect of 13.7% resulting from higher prices in the US for Oil & Gas and Petrochemicals, and in Europe for Industry.\nSequentially, Q1 2018 Group revenue was down 19.4% compared with Q4 2017 (-17.3% at constant exchange rates). Lower volumes were mostly due to a seasonality effect. Price/mix was broadly stable with (i) improved prices in the Oil & Gas and Industry & Other activities, and (ii) lower prices in Power Generation.\nOil & Gas, Petrochemicals (67.7% of consolidated revenue)\nOil & Gas revenue reached €491 million in Q1 2018, up 1.2% year-on-year (+15.3% at constant exchange rates).\nIn the USA , Oil & Gas revenue increased year-on-year, despite a negative forex effect: the number of active rig count rose soundly (+31%), supporting higher demand for OCTG tubes, and prices were raised in the second half of 2017. Vallourec initiated further price increases during Q1 2018, to be effective essentially as from H2 2018. Compared to Q4 2017 revenue was down essentially as a result of seasonality.\nIn the EA-MEA regions , Oil & Gas volumes and revenue were broadly stable year-on-year. Negative forex translation impact was mainly offset by positive price/mix. Overall, tendering activity increased in these regions as anticipated.\nIn Brazil , Oil & Gas revenue was down compared to Q1 2017, which benefited from higher than average OCTG deliveries to Petrobras for exploratory wells in the Libra field. Revenue was also significantly affected by the weakening of the Brazilian Real. In April 2018, Vallourec reinforced its unique long-standing relationship with Petrobras by signing new long-term contracts for the supply of the most comprehensive range of premium products and services.\nPetrochemicals revenue was €93 million in Q1 2018, up 93.8% year-on-year (+114.6% at constant exchange rates), essentially as a result of the recovery in the US.\nPower Generation (11.4% of consolidated revenue)\nPower Generation revenue amounted to €98 million in Q1 2018, up 16.7% year-on-year (+20.2% at constant exchange rates). This increase was due to slightly higher volumes and better price/mix for Conventional power generation due to orders taken in H1 2017.\nIndustry & Other (20.9% of consolidated revenue)\nIndustry & Other revenue amounted to €180 million in Q1 2018, up 8.4% year-on-year (+16.9% at constant exchange rates):\nIn Europe, Industry & Other revenue was up thanks to higher prices in Mechanical Engineering and Automotive applications. In Brazil, Industry & Other revenue was broadly stable with higher volumes in Mechanical Engineering and Automotive driven by Brazilian economy recovery. Revenue from the mine was down as a result of lower iron ore market prices.\nII - Q1 2018 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS ANALYSIS\nIn Q1 2018, EBITDA stood at - €5 million, up €16 million year-on-year, with:\nConsolidated revenue up 10.1%; An industrial margin of €103 million, up €2 million compared with Q1 2017, reflecting (i) higher activity (ii) savings resulting from the Transformation plan, (iii) partially offset by the increase in raw material prices and unfavorable currencies evolution. An increase of industrial margin was recorded in the North American Oil & Gas market, while it decreased in Brazil in comparison with Q1 2017, which had benefited from a more favorable forex impact along with higher than average offshore deliveries; Sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) down 10.6% at €101 million, representing 11.7% of revenue compared with 14.4% in Q1 2017.\nCompared with Q4 2017, Q1 2018 EBITDA decreased €16 million. As a reminder, net reversals in provisions were booked in Q4 2017 for €45 million, compared to €8 million in Q1 2018. Excluding these changes in provisions, Q1 2018 shows a significant improvement despite a negative seasonality impact.\nOperating result was a loss of €130 million , compared to a loss of €111 million in Q1 2017. Q1 2018 operating result includes €13 million impairment charges as well as €33 million charges relating to asset disposal, restructuring and other. These non-recurring elements essentially result from restructuring provisions and impairments related to further restructuring measures undertaken in Europe in Q1 2018.\nFinancial result was negative at -€43 million , stable compared to Q1 2017. In Q1 2018, Vallourec recorded higher interest charges as a result of last year's OCEANE and bond issuances. As a reminder, Q1 2017 financial result included a loss of €8 million related to the change in fair value of Vallourec's NSSMC shares.\nIncome tax was nil compared to a gain of €19 million in Q1 2017. Tax gains were reduced compared to Q1 2017 as a consequence of the results recovery in North America.\nThe share attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to -€3 million , compared to -€11 million in Q1 2017.\nThis resulted in a net loss, Group share of -€170 million , compared to -€126 million in Q1 2017.\nIII - CASH FLOW & FINANCIAL POSITION\nOver Q1 2018, free cash flow was -€254 million, with :\nCash flow from operating activities of -€83 million, broadly stable compared to Q1 2017, with the improvement of EBITDA being offset by higher financial interests and taxes paid. Compared to Q4 2017, cash flow from operating activities improved by €41 million; The working capital requirement increased by €152 million, according to usual seasonality, and is targeted to decrease from this level by the end of the year. Working capital in days of sales was significantly reduced year-on-year; Capital expenditure of -€19 million, compared to -€34 million in Q1 2017.\nAs at 31 March 2018, Group net debt increased by €241 million compared to 31 December 2017 to reach €1,783 million .\nVallourec's cash position as at 31 March 2018 amounted to €0.8 billion. Medium and long-term undrawn committed facilities amounted to €2.0 billion. At the same date, short-term debt amounted to €0.8 billion, including €0.5 billion of commercial paper.\nVallourec reinforced its liquidity beginning of April 2018 by raising €400 million senior notes due 2023. The proceeds from the offering will be used, together with cash on hand, to refinance Vallourec's outstanding bonds due August 2019 by redeeming them when they mature.\nIV - TRANSFORMATION PLAN\nVallourec continues to deploy its Transformation Plan which is generating significant savings.\nFurther milestones have been achieved since the beginning of 2018 with divestments as part of the continuous rationalization of the Group's asset portfolio. In April, Vallourec closed the sale of its Drilling Products business to NOV. The Group also closed the divestiture of Vallourec Fittings, a subsidiary producing seamless fittings in France.\nThe small tube finishing line in Saint-Saulve dedicated to conventional power plants is expected to be closed by the end of 2018 [1] .\nV - MARKET TRENDS & OUTLOOK\nOil & Gas market fundamentals are improving. According to the latest IEA report, worldwide oil stocks have decreased significantly while countries which had committed to curb their production are maintaining a high discipline. These trends are supporting the increase of global tendering activity of oil companies.\nIn the US, Vallourec anticipates the average rig count to remain robust. This should allow Vallourec to pass further OCTG price increase in H2 2018, in addition to the full year impact of volume and price increases achieved in H2 2017. The effects of Section 232 measures under finalization, aiming at favoring domestic steel manufacturers, are still to be assessed. Vallourec is ready to both benefit and adapt, if necessary, to their final outcome.\nIn Brazil, drilling activity is expected to remain stable. The new long-term contracts signed with Petrobras will enter into force in H2 2018.\nIn the rest of the world, in the context of an increasing number of tenders for Oil & Gas projects, Vallourec anticipates higher bookings, with positive impacts on deliveries to materialize starting late H2 2018.\nImproved macroeconomics in Europe and Brazil should benefit our Industry & Other operations. Power Generation revenue is expected to be impacted by a diminishing number of conventional power plant projects, particularly in Asia.\nDespite unfavorable currencies and raw material prices, Vallourec confirms its positive outlook for the year based upon the progressive recovery of its main markets and the significant savings generated by its Transformation Plan. The Group targets 2018 EBITDA to improve versus 2017, with H2 2018 significantly higher than H1.\nAbout Vallourec\nVallourec is a world leader in premium tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments, new generation power plants, challenging architectural projects, and high-performance mechanical equipment.
