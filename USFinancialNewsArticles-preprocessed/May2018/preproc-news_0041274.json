Picture taken February 5, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\nRandal Quarles, the Fedâ€™s vice chair for supervision, said he wanted the central bank to review its current rules for foreign banks, particularly the levels it requires global banks to hold internally to guard against failures of U.S. operations.\nHe said he would recommend the Fed review its policies on this front in the coming weeks, and invite comment on possible changes.
