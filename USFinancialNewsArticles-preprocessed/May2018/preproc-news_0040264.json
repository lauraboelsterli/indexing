FILE PHOTO: People are pictured in the headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva, Switzerland, April 12, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\nThe EU said Trump’s steel tariffs could cost $1.5 billion (1.1 billion pounds) and aluminium tariffs a further $100 million, and listed rice, cranberries, bourbon, corn, peanut butter, and steel products among the U.S. goods that it might target for retaliation.\nIndia said it was facing additional U.S. tariffs of $31 million on aluminium and $134 million on steel, and listed U.S. exports of soya oil, palmolein and cashew nuts among its potential targets for retaliatory tariffs.
