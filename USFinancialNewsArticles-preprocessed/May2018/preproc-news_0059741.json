    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hospitality Ventures Management Group (HVMG), an Atlanta-based, private hotel investment, ownership and management company today announced that Andy Wardner has joined the company as director of acquisitions and financial analysis. In his new role, Wardner will help evaluate and underwrite new hotel acquisitions and third-party management opportunities. Also, he will provide feasibility insight and perform valuation analysis for targeted opportunities which include independent and boutique hotels and resorts, as well as full-service, select-service and extended-stay hotels under the Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, and IHG brands.\n“Andy brings with him two decades of financial analysis expertise, combined with ‘plug and play’ transactional experience in virtually all commercial real estate classes, but with a primary focus on hotels,” said Mary Beth Cutshall, SVP and Chief Business Development Officer. “Over the course of his career, Andy has been integral in the deployment of more than $4 billion on behalf of some of the world’s largest international investment firms, including Starwood Capital, and oversaw the asset management of a 15-hotel portfolio. HVMG’s vision is to be the most sought-after employer, operator and partner in the hospitality industry, and we are confident Andy’s contribution in his new role with the company will help HVMG continue to achieve our aggressive growth goals.”\nPreviously, Wardner was managing director of Paramount Lodging Advisors, where he was responsible for brokering hotel transactions, particularly full-service hotels, and business development throughout the Southeast. Prior to that, he held numerous positions with Starwood Capital Group, culminating in a vice president of asset management. In that role, he oversaw the capital investment, asset management and disposition of a portfolio of commercial real estate investments worldwide including several hotels. Wardner received his Master of Business Administration in Finance from the Robinson School of Business at Georgia State University and his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Finance from the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia. Wardner holds a Georgia Real Estate License and has been a member of ULI and the Atlanta Hospitality Alliance.\n“HVMG has a tremendous track record of turning around hotels through a combination of strategic value-add investments, operational initiatives and improved guest service. I’m thrilled to be joining such a talented and dynamic team to deliver further success for our hotel owners,” said Wardner.\nAbout Hospitality Ventures Management Group\nHospitality Ventures Management Group is a privately owned, fully-integrated hotel investment and management group that specializes in turning around and repositioning underperforming hotels, as well as maximizing the performance of stabilized hotels.
