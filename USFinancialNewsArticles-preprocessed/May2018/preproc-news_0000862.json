Markets were closed on Monday, and will be closed on Thursday and Friday for national holidays.\nSony Corp tumbled 6 percent after the company forecast operating profit of 670 billion yen ($6.13 billion) for the year through March.. The stock loss accounted for a sizable 12 points in the Nikkei index.\nOn the other hand, Hitachi Ltd jumped 5 percent after the company forecast a record-high operating profit for this fiscal year, up 4.9 percent on the year to 750 billion yen.\nSeparately, the Nikkei reported over the weekend that Hitachi will ask the UK government to take a direct stake in the company that is set to build and operate a nuclear power plant in Wales.
