    "text": "LA CROSSE, Wis. & BELMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kaplan, Inc., the global education services company and largest subsidiary of Graham Holdings (NYSE:GHC), announced the acquisition of Professional Publications, Inc. (PPI), an independent publisher of professional licensing exam review materials and recognized leader in engineering, surveying, architecture, and interior design licensure exam review.\nTerms of the transaction, which closed today, were not released.\nPPI, the market leader in engineering and design exam review, delivers courses and produces print and online materials to prepare students for the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and various Professional Engineering (PE) exams in fields such as chemical, civil, electrical, mechanical and structural engineering. Its expansive library contains over 250 engineering, architecture and design products. The company, founded by Michael Lindeburg in 1975, has helped train more than four million engineers since its inception and has over 26,000 active customers.\n“PPI represents an important extension to our product portfolio,” said Dr. Andrew Temte, President of Kaplan Professional. “Adding engineering education at PPI’s scale fits nicely with our suite of professional exam and licensing preparation products in the fields of accounting, insurance, securities, real estate, financial planning, and information technology.”\n“More importantly, we will be able to extend our strategic vision of helping to build the workforce of the future to the engineering sector,” said Dr. Temte. “PPI’s current product set and customer base represents a natural place to begin blending technical engineering training with targeted diagnostics and behavioral training to ensure engineering skills remain relevant in the rapidly changing work environment of the future.”\nThe combination of PPI with Kaplan Professional (KP) is expected to benefit from Kaplan’s existing global footprint, its online delivery capabilities and its extensive business, university and consumer relationships.\nUnder Kaplan’s management, PPI CEO Patty Steinhardt will continue to lead its operations and the company will remain in Belmont, CA.\nKaplan Professional\nKaplan is a leading international provider of training and education services operating in more than 30 countries and working with over 10,000 corporations and businesses globally.
