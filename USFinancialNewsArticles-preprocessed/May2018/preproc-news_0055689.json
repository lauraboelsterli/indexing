    "text": "0 COMMENTS MADRID—Spanish lawmakers will decide on Friday whether to oust Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and replace his center-right government with one led by the center-left Socialist Party, a confidence vote that has injected a dose of uncertainty into Spanish politics and spooked some investors.\nSpanish lawmakers will debate Mr. Rajoy’s future on Thursday in Madrid and then vote on Friday to remove or keep in power his minority government, the president of Spain’s parliament said on Monday. Spain’s main opposition party, the center-left Socialist Party, called the confidence vote last week after a Spanish court ruled that Mr. Rajoy’s Popular Party financially benefited from an illegal kickback scheme . The court also sent former top Popular Party officials to jail for their roles in the scheme.\nWhile opposition lawmakers are united in their outrage over the corruption case against the Popular Party, they are divided on whether to unseat Mr. Rajoy now, presenting major hurdles for the Socialist Party’s bid to garner enough votes against the premier.\nThe prospect of a sudden and unexpected change in Spain’s government caught many investors unaware on Friday, sending Spanish stocks sharply down and bond yields up, and also drawing comparisons to the political turmoil in Italy, as authorities there struggle to form a government. But on Monday, investors jitters had abated somewhat as it became clearer that the competing interests of Spain’s opposition parties present a challenge to remove Mr. Rajoy. Spain’s benchmark IBEX-35 index was down 0.5% in midday trading in Madrid.\nAnalysts and economists also pointed out that comparisons with Italy, where antiestablishment parties won more than half the popular vote, are exaggerated. “The Spanish economy is immersed in a virtuous cycle of falling unemployment, wage recovery, improving consumption and a positive evolution in the real estate sector,” Ignacio de la Torre, chief economist of investment bank Arcano Group in Madrid, said in a research note on Monday. Even if Mr. Rajoy is removed “the economic effects would be limited,” he added.\nAnother difference with Italy: Even if lawmakers are able to unseat Mr. Rajoy, two of the main opposition parties are fervently pro-European Union. While the other main opposition party, the far-left Podemos, has flirted in the past with euroskeptic ideas, such policies aren’t an essential focus for the party, nor for their Spanish voters.\nHowever, if Mr. Rajoy, who has overseen Spain’s economic recovery since he became prime minister in 2011, survives the confidence vote on Friday, he will emerge with an even weaker grip on power and the chances of calling general elections before they are slated in 2020 will rise, analysts say.\nWrite to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com",
