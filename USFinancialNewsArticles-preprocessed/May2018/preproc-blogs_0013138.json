Mr. Agg succeeds the companyâ€™s current Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield who will leave the company on July 30, 2018, to take on a role at a U.S. public company. Mr. Bonfield has served in his role since Nov. 2010. Mr. Agg is currently group tax and treasury director at National Grid, and has been there for 10 years. The company will start the search for a new CFO, considering both internal and external candidates, it said in a release.\nCapgemini SE, a French consulting and professional services firm, said it plans to appoint Carole Ferrand as chief financial officer, a role she will take on in June. Ms. Ferrand will replace Aiman Ezzat, who became chief operating officer alongside Thierry Delaporte in January 2018. Ms. Ferrand will relinquish her duties as a Capgemini board director and member of the audit and risk committee once she assumes her new role, the company said.\nShare this: CFO MOVES Previous The Morning Ledger: U.S. Companies Report Best Earnings for Years After Corporate Tax Overhaul Next The Weekend Reader: Three Must-Reads ",
