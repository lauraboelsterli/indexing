    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Syncora Holdings Ltd. (“Syncora” or the “Company”) today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services has approved the proposed reinsurance transaction with Assured Guaranty Corp. and the related payment on the Syncora Guarantee Inc. (“SGI”) Long-Term Surplus Notes (the “Long-Term Surplus Notes”) and Short-Term Surplus Notes (the “Short-Term Surplus Notes\" and, together with the Long-Term Surplus Notes, the “Surplus Notes”) held by third party holders in the amounts set forth below:\nAccrued and\nUnpaid\nInterest Principal Total Total Payment to Long-Term Surplus Notes held by Third Parties $ 89,154,746 $ 227,328,606 $ 316,483,352 Total Payment to Short-Term Surplus Notes held by Third Parties $ 23,276,942 $ 60,239,706 $ 83,516,648 Total $ 112,431,688 $ 287,568,312 $ 400,000,000 As required, by the terms of the Surplus Notes, SGI will provide notice that the record date for such payment will be set as June 12, 2018 and that the payment date with respect to the payment set forth above will be June 27, 2018.\nSyncora further announced that it had received the required level of consents from holders of Surplus Notes to the waiver of certain restrictions of its master transaction agreement to permit the reinsurance transaction, which is expected to close June 1, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. No assurance can be given that the transaction will close on the expected timeline or at all. A form of the waiver and amendment has been posted to the Syncora website.\n“With the approval of payment to the surplus noteholders and the waiver described above, we are now in a position to move toward closing the reinsurance transaction with Assured Guaranty. We are very pleased to be able to execute on a transaction that we believe will cap our insured exposure, leaving SGI in a more stable and significantly de-levered financial position and making it possible for us to continue to return value to our stakeholders,” commented Frederick B. Hnat, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Syncora.\nSyncora also reported today financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net premiums earned $ 14.3 $ 15.6 Net investment income 10.4 11.6 Net unrealized and realized gains (losses) on investments 1.0 (14.9 ) Net earnings (loss) on insurance cash flow certificates 34.3 (6.3 ) Net (loss) earnings on credit default and other swap contracts (21.1 ) 13.5 Net losses and loss adjustment expenses 35.3 16.8 Operating expenses 10.4 12.1 Loss from continuing operations (15.5 ) (33.6 ) Income from discontinued operations 6.9 2.8 Net loss attributable to controlling interest $ (8.8 ) $ (30.8 ) Basic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.36 ) Basic and diluted income from discontinued operations per common share $ 0.08 $ 0.03 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) (1) $ 16.7 $ (21.9 ) Non-GAAP basic and diluted operating income (loss) per common share (1) $ 0.19 $ (0.25 ) Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 86.8 86.6 As of\nMarch 31, As of\nDecember 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted Book Value (1) $ 620.7 $ 609.3 Common shares outstanding at end of period 87.0 86.8 Adjusted Book Value per common share (1) $ 7.14 $ 7.02 (1) Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and adjusted book value are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) total Syncora Holdings Ltd. net income (loss) and common shareholders' equity, respectively, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. See below for reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures. Financial Results\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nNet premiums earned were $14.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $15.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was due to lower earned premiums as a result of the continued run-off of the Company’s book of business, partially offset by higher premium accelerations from refundings in the current period. Total premium accelerations were $9.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $8.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet investment income decreased slightly by $1.2 million from $11.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $10.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower income on remediation bonds as compared to the prior period.\nNet unrealized and realized gains on investments increased by $15.9 million to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from a net realized loss of $14.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The change was primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges and foreign exchange gains on the sale of certain Euro-denominated remediation bonds in the current period. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the change in net unrealized losses on equity securities of $2.1 million are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of adopting a new accounting pronouncement for equity securities.\nNet earnings on insurance cash flow certificates was $34.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a loss of $6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was a result of a reduction to reimbursements owed to third party UCF holders as a result of the receipt of cash from the GreenPoint litigation settlement.\nFees and other income were $16.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the sale of a Detroit real estate development option.\nNet loss on credit default and other swap contracts was $21.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to earnings of $13.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower non-performance risk spreads during the current period.\nNet losses and loss adjustment expenses were $35.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to RMBS adverse developments and additional loss adjustment expenses related to the sale of American Roads LLC.\nOperating expenses were $10.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $12.1 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings associated with headcount reductions.\nIncome from discontinued operations represents the total revenues and total expenses of American Roads LLC, which was $6.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $2.8 million for the same period last year.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTotal assets decreased by $86.9 million from $2,385.5 million as of December 31, 2017 to $2,298.6 million as of March 31, 2018 primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of one variable interest entity and operating expenses and claim payments made during the period.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $65.4 million from $1,683.5 million as of December 31, 2017 to $1,618.1 million as of March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to RMBS positive developments, lower unearned premium revenue from the continued run-off of the Company’s insured portfolio, lower liabilities of variable interest entities as a result of the deconsolidation noted above and lower accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to lower compensation-related expenses as a result of headcount reductions. These amounts were partially offset by higher mark-to-market fair values on our credit default and other swap contracts due to lower non-performance risk spreads, and the continued accretion of the surplus note payable and accrual of related interest expense.\nAssets and liabilities of entity held-for-sale represent the total assets and total liabilities of American Roads LLC, which met the accounting criteria for held-for-sale during the third quarter of 2017.\nSyncora Holdings Ltd.

A Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance or financial position that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. While the Company does not manage its business or measure its performance using Non-GAAP measures, we are presenting these Non-GAAP financial measures because they provide greater transparency and enhanced visibility into the underlying performance of our business and, with respect to Adjusted Book Value, the effect of certain items that the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value over time. In addition, we have included these measures because we believe they provide investors with important additional information to compare the Company to other financial guarantors. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Adjusted Book Value as calculated do not consider timing or amounts, if any, of payment on SGI’s surplus notes, which would require NYDFS approval, dividend restrictions under New York Insurance Law applicable to the insurance subsidiaries and contractual constraints with respect to any dividend payment. Reference should be made to Note 18 in the most recently issued consolidated GAAP financial statements. In addition, because other financial guarantors may calculate Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Adjusted Book Value or similarly titled measures differently, or may not be subject to the restrictions noted above, Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Adjusted Book Value may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other financial guarantors. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Adjusted Book Value are not substitutes for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, should not be viewed in isolation and may be subject to change.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders of Syncora Holdings Ltd. to Non-GAAP operating income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of Syncora Holdings Ltd.:\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 GAAP net loss attributable to controlling interest $ (8.8 ) $ (30.8 ) Pre-tax adjustments: Non-credit impairment of net realized and unrealized fair value losses and (gains) on credit derivatives (1) 23.0 (12.8 ) Surplus note accretion (2) 12.4 9.6 Net unrealized and realized (gains) losses on investments (3) (3.0 ) 14.9 Income from discontinued operations (4) (6.9 ) (2.8 ) Total pre-tax adjustments 25.5 8.9 Less tax effect on pre-tax adjustments (5) - - Non-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 16.7 $ (21.9 ) Basic and diluted weighted average common shares 86.8 86.6 Basic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.36 ) Non-GAAP basic and diluted operating income (loss) per common share $ 0.19 $ (0.25 ) Non-GAAP operating income adjustments:\n(1) Elimination of non-credit impairment net realized and unrealized fair value (gains) and losses on credit derivatives in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. The fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate, in part according to, market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that management cannot control or predict and that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. In addition, this adjustment presents all financial guaranty contracts on a more consistent basis of accounting, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules.\n(2) Elimination of surplus note accretion as the full face amount of the surplus notes (including interest paid-in-kind) is included in the Adjusted Book Value calculation.\n(3) Elimination of realized gains (losses) on the Company’s investments, except for gains and losses on investments for which the fair value option of accounting was elected and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities. The timing of realized gains and losses, which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of sales is largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax and capital profile.\n(4) Elimination of the results from discontinued operations related to American Roads LLC.\n(5) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments. SHI has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result, for purposes of Non-GAAP measures, the Company utilizes a 0% effective tax rate until the expiration of these NOLs.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP common shareholders’ equity to Adjusted Book Value:\nSyncora Holdings Ltd. Reconciliation of GAAP Common Shareholders' Equity to Adjusted Book Value March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts) As of March 31, As of December 31, 2018 2017 GAAP common shareholders' equity $ 664.7 $ 686.0 Series B preferred stock (1) (121.0 ) (121.0 ) Adjusted GAAP common shareholders' equity $ 543.7 $ 565.0 Pre-tax adjustments: Deferred acquisition costs (2) (32.6 ) (34.9 ) Net credit derivative liability (3) 107.2 84.2 Net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenue (4) 63.5 65.8 Net unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected loss to be expensed (5) 190.7 208.9 Notes payable (6) (235.8 ) (248.2 ) Unrealized gains on investments (7) (10.1 ) (24.4 ) Income Taxes (8) (5.9 ) (7.1 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 620.7 $ 609.3 Common shares outstanding at end of the period 87.0 86.8 Book value per common share $ 6.25 $ 6.51 Adjusted book value per common share $ 7.14 $ 7.02 Note: GAAP common shareholders' equity and Adjusted Book Value includes $182.0 million and $182.0 million, $175.1 million and $175.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, related to American Roads LLC. Adjusted Book Value adjustments:\n(1) Addition of the excess of the outstanding liquidation preference of the SGI Series B non-cumulative preferred shares over their carrying values. Including the SGI Series B non-cumulative preferred shares at their outstanding liquidation value (which is net of the shares received in connection with our 2012 settlement with Countrywide, Bank of America Corp.) instead of their carrying value is more in line with the residual value to common shareholders.\n(2) Elimination of pre-tax deferred acquisition costs as these amounts represent net deferred expenses that have already been paid and will be expensed in future accounting periods.\n(3) Elimination of the consolidated net credit derivative liability which represents an estimate of the fair value of the Company’s guarantees issued as CDS contracts in excess of the present value of the expected losses. By excluding the net credit derivative liability, this metric eliminates the benefit to our shareholders’ equity embedded therein from the Company’s non-performance risk, which reflects the market’s view of the risk that the Company will not be able to financially honor its obligations as they become due. The fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate, in part according to, market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that management cannot control or predict and that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. In addition, by including our best estimate of losses we expect to incur on our CDS contracts if we were to hold such CDS contracts to maturity and pay claims as they arise over the remaining life of such contracts, the metric presents our guarantees of insurance and derivatives on a consistent basis, which results in a more meaningful measure of our value.\n(4) Addition of the pre-tax net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenues. Including the net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenues enables an evaluation of the value of future estimated credit derivative revenue for which there is no corresponding GAAP financial measure.\n(5) Addition of the pre-tax value of the unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected losses to be expensed on an individual policy level, net of reinsurance as the unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts represents revenues that are expected to be earned in the future.\n(6) Addition to the full face amount, in excess of the carrying amount, of the surplus notes payable held by third parties (including interest paid-in-kind), as including the full face amount of the surplus notes is consistent with the treatment of these instruments as debt.\n(7) Elimination of the pre-tax unrealized gains on the Company’s investments that are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), excluding the effects of foreign exchange. The effects of the AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on investments are not deemed economic until the Company sells such investments.\n(8) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments. SHI has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result, for purposes of Non-GAAP measures, the Company utilizes a 0% effective tax rate until the expiration of these NOLs.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company plans to host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 to discuss its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
