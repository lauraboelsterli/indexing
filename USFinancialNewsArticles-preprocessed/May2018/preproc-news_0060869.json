    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said Tuesday’s market selloff was unjustified, as bond yields spiked and the stock market declined on the political uncertainty tied to a fresh round of elections later this year.\nFILE PHOTO: Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco looks on during a meeting in Rome, Italy, October 31, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli - RC18DA78C300/File Photo The selloff “is very serious”, Visco said at the central bank’s annual assembly in Rome. “There are no justifications — except for emotions — for what we’re seeing today on the markets.”\nItaly’s stock market declined more than 2 percent and the closely watched gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields widened by more than 80 basis points in the morning.\nReporting by Stefano Bernabei, writing by Steve Scherer\n ",
