    "text": "* Turkish lira hits record low after jump in inflation\n* FX interventions fall to halt Argentina peso plunge\n* Stocks fall for third day towards three-month low\n* CEE digest EU budget plans, Czech central bank to hold rates\nBy Marc Jones\nLONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Stress levels rose in emerging markets on Thursday as Argentina’s peso and Turkey’s lira slumped to record lows in what looked like classic currency attacks and shares fell for a third day.\nThe pressure was widespread against the backdrop of a rising dollar and global borrowing rates and after more unpredictable behaviour on metal export tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration towards Brazil overnight.\nIt combined to push MSCI’s 24-country emerging market stocks index towards a three-month low though tensions were highest in foreign exchange markets.\nArgentina’s peso slumped over 3 percent to an all-time low of 21.2 per dollar despite heavy intervention from its central bank just days after an emergency interest rate hike.\nTurkey then saw the lira slide 0.4 percent to an all-time trough of 4.21 to the dollar, as another jump in inflation there added to jitters caused by a rating downgrade this week and government plans to up spending.\n“You have this vicious circle of a deteriorating inflation outlook, a weaker currency and a central bank that is behind the curve,” said ING’s Chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist, Petr Krpata.\nPressure also remained on the Central and Eastern European currencies that were some of last year’s best performers in the world.\nThe Czech central bank was expected to keep its rates steady at a meeting later but the slide in the crown against both the dollar and the euro has boosted chances of another hike later in the year, Krpata added.\nThe region was also digesting news that from 2021 the European Union will cut funds paid out to member states that undermine courts and the rule of law, a move that could cost Hungary and Poland millions of euros.\nEurosceptic nationalists who have come to power in some former Communist states of eastern Europe have clashed with Brussels over what the EU describes as curbs to freedom of the media and violations of other democratic norms.\nIn Asia overnight, Indonesia’s rupiah had fallen to its lowest in more than two years as foreign investors continued to sell their positions in the local bond and equity markets.\nIndonesian stock exchange and Ministry of Finance data showed foreigners sold securities worth $684 million in equity markets and $967 million in bonds in April.\nIt was not all one way traffic however. The Singapore dollar and the Thai baht rose 0.25 percent and 0.15 percent respectively. The Indian rupee and the South Korean won also edged up on the day, the latter buoyed by an ongoing improvement of relations with North Korea.\nIn Latin America though there had been more gloomy news for turmoil-ridden Venezuela as the IMF issued a “declaration of censure” against Venezuela for failing to provide necessary economic data.\nThe United States cut off metals tariff talks with Brazil, contradicting an earlier U.S. announcement that the two countries had reached a permanent exemption from steel and aluminium import tariffs.\nRepresentatives for Brazil’s industry decried U.S. negotiation tactics, which the head of the association for aluminium producers, Milton Rego, called “Al Capone-like.”\n“You get better results by pointing a gun to the head,” he said.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\n ",
