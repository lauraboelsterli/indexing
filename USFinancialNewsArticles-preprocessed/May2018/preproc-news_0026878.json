    "text": "May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. cable TV provider Altice USA Inc reported a 1.2 percent rise in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday as the company added more Suddenlink residential subscribers and advertising revenue rose.\nAltice added 14,000 Suddenlink residential subscribers in the first three months of 2018, compared with the 12,000 added a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 1.2 percent to $2.33 billion, with advertising revenue up 5.1 percent.\nHowever, Altice posted a bigger loss as spending on programming surged.\nNet loss attributable to stockholders widened to $129 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter, from $76.4 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.\nCable TV companies are battling the so-called “cord-cutting”, as viewers drop their cable packages and move to streaming services such as Netflix Inc.\nAltice has been stepping up efforts to cushion the impact from cord-cutting.\nThe company last year launched Altice One, a set-top box that combines traditional video, online streaming services and WiFi as well as other features.
