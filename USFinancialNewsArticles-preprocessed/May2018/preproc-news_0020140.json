    "text": "AT&T paid Essential Consultants, a company set up by U.S. President Donald Trump 's lawyer Michael Cohen , more than the $200,000 that came to light late on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.\nPayments by AT&T were described on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn actress Stormy Daniels , who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations had paid Essential Consultants for certain services.\nAvenatti's document said that AT&T paid Essential Consultants $50,000 in October, November and December of 2017, and another $50,000 in January of 2018, making a total of $200,000.\nAT&T confirmed those payments as described by Avenatti, saying they were aimed at gaining \"insights\" into the new administration.\nHowever, the contract was for a year, the source told Reuters, meaning AT&T paid more than $200,000 to Cohen's company.\nA full year contract for $50,000 per month would total $600,000 for the year. The source declined to give a total for the payments made by AT&T to Cohen's company.\nShares of AT&T were down 1 percent at $31.37.",
