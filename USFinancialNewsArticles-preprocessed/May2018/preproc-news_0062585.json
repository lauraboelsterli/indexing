(NYSE:PVH) reported 2018 first quarter results.\nNon-GAAP Amounts:\nAmounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are described below under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” Amounts stated on a constant currency basis are also deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented later in this release and identify and quantify all excluded items.\nCEO Comments:\nCommenting on these results, Emanuel Chirico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted, “We are very pleased with our first quarter 2018 results, which exceeded our expectations. We experienced broad-based strength across our businesses globally and our performance underscored the power of our diversified business model and the continued momentum in our global designer lifestyle brands, CALVIN KLEIN and TOMMY HILFIGER.”\nMr. Chirico continued, “We are applying our consumer-centric mindset by growing our presence where our consumers prefer to shop, creating exciting brand experiences across our distribution channels and capitalizing on creative new ways to connect with the next generation of consumers. We are also driving our long-term vision by making investments to ensure that we adapt to the evolving consumer landscape, without compromising on our commitment to sustainable development throughout the business.”\nMr. Chirico concluded, “We are pleased to increase our earnings guidance for the year, despite the continuing volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, which is resulting in a significantly lower foreign currency benefit than previously planned for the year. As I think about the strength of our teams, our brands and our platforms, I believe that PVH is in a powerful position to deliver a sustainable trajectory of long-term growth and stockholder value creation. Our strategic priorities will continue to serve as our guidelines for growth and I believe that we will execute on the significant opportunities that PVH has ahead of it.”\nFirst Quarter Business Review:\nDue to the 53rd week in 2017, first quarter 2018 comparable store sales are more appropriately compared with the thirteen week period ended May 7, 2017, instead of the period ended April 30, 2017. All comparable store sales discussed in this release are presented on this one week shifted basis.\nCalvin Klein\nRevenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 18% to $890 million (increased 12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period. Calvin Klein International revenue increased 25% to $475 million (increased 14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period, driven by continued outstanding performance in Europe and Asia, including a 9% increase in comparable store sales. Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 10% (also on a constant currency basis) to $415 million compared to the prior year period as a result of strong wholesale performance across all categories and a 5% increase in comparable store sales.\nEarnings before interest and taxes for the quarter increased to $109 million, inclusive of a $5 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, from $93 million in the prior year period, principally attributable to the revenue increase noted above.\nTommy Hilfiger\nRevenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 21% to $1.0 billion (increased 11% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period. Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 25% to $655 million (increased 10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period, driven by continued strong performance across all regions and channels, including a 9% increase in comparable store sales. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 13% (also on a constant currency basis) to $361 million compared to the prior year period, principally attributable to a 9% increase in comparable store sales and strong performance in the wholesale business.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $132 million from $33 million in the prior year period. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were costs of $7 million incurred related to the April 2016 acquisition of the 55% interest in the Company’s former Tommy Hilfiger joint venture in China (“TH China”) that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the prior year period were costs of (i) $54 million incurred in connection with the agreements to restructure the Company’s supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”), under which the Company terminated its non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung during 2017 (the “Li & Fung termination”), (ii) $7 million incurred related to the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets, and (iii) $7 million incurred in connection with the relocation of the Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense. Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis discussed below excludes these amounts.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $139 million, inclusive of a $12 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, from $101 million in the prior year period. The earnings increase was principally due to the strong revenue increase noted above, as well as gross margin improvements across all regions and channels.\nHeritage Brands\nRevenue in the Heritage Brands business for the quarter increased 5% to $409 million compared to the prior year period, principally due to a shift in the timing of shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter as compared to the prior year periods. Comparable store sales increased 1%.\nEarnings before interest and taxes for the quarter increased to $42 million from $32 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by the increase in revenue noted above, as well as gross margin improvements.\nFirst Quarter Consolidated Results:\nFirst quarter revenue increased 16% to $2.3 billion (increased 10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period.\nEarnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.29 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.89 in the prior year period. These results include the amounts with respect to the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, as discussed below, exclude these amounts.\nEarnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $2.36 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.65 in the prior year period. Earnings per share on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2018 included the $0.20 positive impact related to foreign currency translation.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis for the quarter increased to $244 million from $113 million in the prior year period. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the quarter were costs of $7 million incurred related to the TH China acquisition. Included in earnings before interest and taxes for the prior year period were $79 million of costs consisting of (i) $54 million incurred in connection with the Li & Fung termination, (ii) $9 million incurred in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of the Company’s retirement plan benefit obligations, (iii) $7 million incurred in connection with the relocation of the Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, (iv) $7 million incurred related to the TH China acquisition and (v) $2 million incurred in connection with the consolidation within the Company’s warehouse and distribution network in North America. Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis discussed below excludes these amounts.\nEarnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter was $251 million compared to $193 million in the prior year period. The improvement in earnings was driven by growth across all businesses.\nNet interest expense of $28 million was relatively flat as compared to the prior year period. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was 17.1% as compared to 17.0% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 17.3% as compared to 20.7% in the prior year period.\nInventory levels increased 22% as compared to the prior year period due to a shift in the timing of inventory receipts as a result of the 53rd week in 2017 and an expected increase in second quarter of 2018 sales as compared to the prior year period.\nStock Repurchase Program:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 400,000 shares of its common stock for $54 million (7.1 million shares for $745 million since inception) under the $1.250 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors through June 3, 2020. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as the Company deems appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under the Company’s debt arrangements, trading restrictions under the Company’s insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.\n2018 Outlook:\nThe Company’s effective tax rate projections for 2018 include estimates of the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Legislation”) enacted on December 22, 2017, including (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, (iii) the introduction of a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (known as “GILTI”) and (iv) the introduction of a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (known as “BEAT”) that taxes certain payments between U.S. corporations and their subsidiaries. These projections are subject to adjustment in 2018, including as a result of changes in the provisional net tax benefit of $53 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, during the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as regulatory guidance needs to be issued in regard to the Tax Legislation and as the Company completes its final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation.\nPlease see the section entitled “Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section.\nFull Year Guidance\nThe Company currently projects that 2018 earnings per share on a GAAP basis will be in a range of $8.81 to $8.91 compared to $6.84 in 2017. The Company currently projects that 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis will be in a range of $9.05 to $9.15 compared to $7.94 in 2017.

The Company projects that second quarter 2018 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis will be in a range of $2.05 to $2.10 compared to $1.69 in the prior year period.

Pre-tax costs of $83 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with an amendment to Mr. Tommy Hilfiger’s employment agreement pursuant to which the Company made a cash buyout of a portion of the future payments to Mr. Hilfiger. Pre-tax costs of $54 million incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the Li & Fung termination. Pre-tax costs of $28 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the Company’s redemption and issuance of senior notes, including $24 million related to the early redemption of the $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes and $4 million related to the issuance of €600 million 3 1/8% senior notes. Pre-tax costs of $27 million incurred in 2017 related to the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets, of which $7 million was incurred in the first quarter, $7 million was incurred in the second quarter, $6 million was incurred in the third quarter and $7 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax costs of $19 million incurred in 2017 in connection with the relocation of the Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, of which $7 million was incurred in the first quarter, $7 million was incurred in the second quarter and $5 million was incurred in the third quarter. Pre-tax costs of $9 million incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of the Company’s benefit obligations related to its retirement plans as a result of an annuity purchased for certain participants, under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer. Pre-tax net costs of $8 million incurred in 2017 in connection with the consolidation within the Company’s warehouse and distribution network in North America, of which $2 million of costs were incurred in the first quarter, $6 million of costs were incurred in the second quarter, $3 million of costs were incurred in the third quarter and a net gain of $2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, which included the impact of the sale of a warehouse and distribution center. Pre-tax loss of $3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the recognized actuarial loss on retirement plans. Discrete tax benefits of $23 million recorded in 2017 primarily related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions, of which $13 million was recorded in the third quarter and $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. Discrete net tax benefit of $53 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the Tax Legislation, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. Discrete tax benefit of $15 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. All items above were identified as either primarily taxable or tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local jurisdiction, or as non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s GAAP results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies but reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.\nThe Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the current year period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period).\nConstant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.\nPlease see Tables 1 through 6 and the sections entitled “Reconciliations of 2018 Constant Currency Revenue” and “Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.\nThe Company webcasts its conference calls to review its earnings releases.

PVH CORP.\nNon-GAAP Measures\n(In millions, except per share data)\nThe Company believes it is useful to investors to present its results for the quarters ended May 6, 2018 and April 30, 2017 excluding (i) the costs incurred in those quarters related to the acquisition of the 55% interest in TH Asia, Ltd. (“TH China”), its former joint venture for TOMMY HILFIGER in China, that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets; (ii) the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with agreements to restructure its supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”), under which the Company terminated its non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung in 2017 (the “Li & Fung termination”); (iii) the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of its benefit obligations related to its retirement plans as a result of an annuity purchased for certain participants, under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer; (iv) the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the relocation of the Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense; (v) the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the consolidation within its warehouse and distribution network in North America; and (vi) the tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items, which are on a non-GAAP basis. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems non-recurring or non-operational and believes that this (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release.

PVH CORP.\nReconciliations of 2018 Constant Currency Revenue\n(In millions)\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies but reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.\nThe Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the current year period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period).\nConstant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.\nGAAP Revenue % Change Quarter Ended GAAP Positive Impact of\nForeign Exchange\nConstant\nCurrency\n5/6/18 4/30/17 Calvin Klein North America $ 414.5 $ 375.4 10.4 % 0.5 % 9.9 % Calvin Klein International 475.5 380.4 25.0 % 10.7 % 14.3 % Total Calvin Klein 890.0 755.8 17.8 % 5.7 % 12.1 % Tommy Hilfiger North America $ 361.2 $ 318.5 13.4 % 0.5 % 12.9 % Tommy Hilfiger International 654.6 523.5 25.0 % 14.8 % 10.2 % Total Tommy Hilfiger 1,015.8 842.0 20.6 % 9.4 % 11.2 % Total Revenue $ 2,314.6 $ 1,989.0 16.4 % 6.2 % 10.2 % PVH CORP.\nFull Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts\nThe Company is presenting its 2018 estimated results excluding the costs to be incurred related to the TH China acquisition, consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets and the resulting estimated tax effect. The 2018 estimated results are presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The Company believes presenting these results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional information to investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems non-recurring or non-operational and believes that this (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company has provided the reconciliations set forth below to present its estimates on a GAAP basis and excluding these amounts. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the item described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The estimated tax effect associated with the above pre-tax item is based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated the item identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. The item is identified as tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local jurisdiction.\n2018 Net Income Per Common Share Reconciliations\nCurrent Guidance Previous Guidance Full Year\n2018\n(Estimated) Second Quarter\n2018\n(Estimated) Full Year\n2018\n(Estimated)\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n(Estimated) GAAP net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. $8.81 - $8.91 $1.98 - $2.03 $8.76 - $8.86 $2.13 - $2.18 Estimated per common share impact of item identified as a non-GAAP exclusion $(0.24) $(0.07) $(0.24) $(0.07) Net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. on a non-GAAP basis $9.05 - $9.15 $2.05 - $2.10 $9.00 - $9.10 $ 2.20 - $2.25 The GAAP net income per common share attributable to PVH Corp. amounts presented in the above table, as well as the amounts excluded in providing non-GAAP earnings guidance, would be expected to change as a result of (i) acquisition, restructuring, divestment or similar transactions or activities, (ii) the timing and strategy of restructuring and integration initiatives or other one-time events, if any, that the Company engages in or suffers during the period, (iii) any market or other changes affecting the Company’s expected actuarial gain or loss on retirement plans, (iv) the imposition of significant tariffs on apparel, footwear and accessories imported from China or any of the Company’s other significant sourcing countries, (v) adjustments to the Company’s income tax provision related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Legislation”), including as a result of changes in the provisional amounts recorded in 2017, during the measurement period allowed by the SEC as regulatory guidance needs to be issued related to the Tax Legislation and as the Company completes its final analysis of the impacts of the Tax Legislation, or (vi) any discrete tax events including changes in tax rates or tax law and events arising from audits or the resolution of uncertain tax positions.
