    "text": "Johan Camargo hit the first pitch he saw for a solo home run with one out in the ninth to give the Atlanta Braves a 7-6 walkoff win against the New York Mets on Tuesday at SunTrust Park.\nIt was the second last-inning victory for the Braves in the series and their 45th final at-bat win since Brian Snitker became manager in 2016.\nCamargo’s third homer of the season came against Gerson Bautista (0-1).\nThe winning pitcher was Dan Winkler (2-0), who pitched around a single and hit batsman to work a scoreless ninth.\nThe Braves have won two of the first three games of the series and improved to 7-2 against the Mets this season.\nNew York starter Steven Matz opened the game with three scoreless innings. He gave up one hit and two walks before turning it over to the bullpen when he left with discomfort in the middle finger of his pitching hand. X-rays were negative, the Mets announced.\nAtlanta’s Anibal Sanchez made his return from the disabled list and went four innings. He allowed four runs on five hits, two of them home runs, and two walks. Matt Wisler kept the game close by working four innings and allowing two runs.\nThe Mets got on the board with a run in the first inning when Jose Bautista doubled home Brandon Nimmo.\nNew York went ahead 3-0 in the third on Asdrubal Cabrera’s two-run homer and made it 4-0 when Adrian Gonzalez hit his sixth homer, a solo shot, in the fourth.\nThe Braves cut the lead in half in the fourth. Charlie Culberson singled home a run and eventually came around to score on a passed ball.\nNew York added a run in the fifth on Cabrera’s second homer of the night, his 10th, and another run in the sixth on Nimmo’s RBI double for a 6-2 lead.\nThe Braves scored once in the seventh on a run-scoring double by Nick Markakis. Atlanta tied the game with three runs in the eighth, getting one on Preston Tucker’s bases-loaded groundout and two on Ender Inciarte’s triple.\nAtlanta’s Freddie Freeman extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the seventh.\nThe first pitch was delayed by an hour to wait out the bad weather that moved through the Atlanta area. It was the second straight night the game had been delayed by rain.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
