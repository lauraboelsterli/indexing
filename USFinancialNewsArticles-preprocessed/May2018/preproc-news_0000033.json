    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 6:37 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Ocado signs partnership deal with Swedish grocer ICA Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Ocado ( OCDO.L ), the British online grocer and technology company, has signed a partnership deal with Sweden’s ICA Group to develop its online business, it said on Wednesday.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\nPotential deals with overseas grocers are seen as the key influence on Ocado’s stock market valuation. It has already bagged deals with France’s Casino ( CASP.PA ) and Canada’s Sobeys ( EMPa.TO ).\nICA is Sweden’s market leader with around 1,300 stores and a share of around 36 percent.\nICA and Ocado will together develop ICA’s first Customer Fulfilment Centre (CFC) in the Stockholm area. The build is expected to take approximately three years. CFCs elsewhere in Sweden will also be considered.\nICA will also move to use the British group’s Ocado Smart Platform technology.\nOcado said it expected the deal to create significant long term value to its business, with the impact of the transaction set to be earnings neutral in the current financial year.\nIt said the deal would mean minimal additional capital expenditure in 2018 but additional capex in future years as development of the CFC project gets underway.
