    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of KLX Ltd. (NASDAQ: KLXI) (\"KLX\") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of its Aerospace Solutions Group business to The Boeing Company (\"Boeing\"). KLX Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides aerospace fasteners, consumables, and logistics services worldwide.\nOn May 1, 2018, KLX announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Boeing. Under the terms of the agreement, KLX will sell the Aerospace Solutions Group to Boeing for $63.00 per share in cash.\nThe investigation concerns whether the KLX board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the sale and whether the board obtained the best price possible for KLX shareholders.\nIf you are a shareholder of KLX and believe the proposed sale price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
