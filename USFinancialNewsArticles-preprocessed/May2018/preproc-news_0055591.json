    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 5:46 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Rugby - Late Tambwe try hands Lions vital win over wilting Stormers Nick Said 3 Min Read\nCAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Wing Madosh Tambwe scored a winning try five minutes from full time as the Lions grabbed a precious 26-23 victory in their titanic South African Super Rugby derby against an ill-disciplined Stormers at Newlands on Saturday.\nThe win takes the Lions six points clear of the Jaguares from Argentina at the top of the South African conference, but they have played a game more and they were made to work hard for their latest, bruising win.\nThe Stormers played for 10 minutes with 13 players after a red card for wing Raymond Rhule on 50 minutes was followed by a yellow for replacement Jaco Coetzee just 90 seconds after he came on to the pitch.\nThe home side also had centre JJ Engelbrecht sent to the sin-bin in the first half, and he was fortunate not to be sent off permanently after a dangerous clear-out at the ruck later on in an incident that was penalised only by New Zealand referee Nick Briant.\nReplacement hooker Corne Fourie, who has been converted from prop, bagged two tries and scrumhalf Nic Groom the other as the Lions proved more clinical in the opponents’ 22.\nThe Stormers led 17-7 at the break after tries for scrumhalf Dewaldt Duvenage and Rhule, but their lack of discipline in the second period especially saw them slip to a ninth defeat in 14 games this season.\n“It was a tough battle, we knew it would be. We knew they would come out and give their all but my boys showed character,” Lions captain Franco Mostert said at the post-match media conference.\n“We tried too many 50-50 offloads in the first half, but second half we were better. Our forwards worked hard in the mauls.”\nDuvenage burrowed over under the posts for the Stormers’ first try, before Groom breezed through a cavernous gap in the home defence to get the Lions on the board.\nRhule profited from a fine chip-kick from fellow Stormers wing Craig Barry to cross in the corner, before he let down his side with an ugly piece of play early in the second period.\nFellow Springbok wing Ruan Combrinck chipped the ball over his head and Rhule jumped into his path as the latter chased his kick, his elbow connecting with the head of his opponent.\nDespite their numerical disadvantage, the Stormers led by four points going into the final five minutes but after the Lions saw their driving maul halted, wing Aphiwe Dyantyi fed Tambwe to cross unopposed in the corner.
