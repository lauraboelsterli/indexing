    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:HABT) (“The Habit” or the “Company”), today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 27, 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter ended March 27, 2018 include:\nTotal revenue increased 17.0% to $91.9 million compared to $78.6 million in 2017.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.4% as compared to 2017.\nNet income was $0.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted weighted average share, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted weighted average share, in 2017.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income(1) was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per fully distributed weighted average share compared to $2.4 million, or $0.09 per fully distributed weighted average share for 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $7.9 million compared to $9.4 million for 2017.\nThe Company opened 11 new company-operated restaurants and two franchised restaurants during 2018. As of March 27, 2018, the Company had 204 company-operated locations and 18 franchised/licensed locations (excluding seven licensed locations in Santa Barbara County, California from which the Company is not entitled to royalties) for a system-wide total of 222 locations.\n(1) Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to each of these measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “ ,” included herein.\n“While our first quarter results were below our expectations we are excited about the progress being made around making The Habit even more convenient for our customers as well as the progress on initiatives which are focused on menu and marketing innovation,” said Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Habit Restaurants, Inc. “During the quarter, we opened 11 new company-operated Habit Burger Grills of which four were drive-thrus, and opened two franchised restaurants. We continue to plan to open a total of approximately 30 new company-operated locations in 2018, including approximately 15 drive-thru locations, while our franchisees expect to open six to eight locations in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenue was $91.9 million in 2018, compared to $78.6 million in 2017.\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.4% for the quarter ended March 27, 2018. The decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant sales was driven primarily by a 2.1% decrease in transactions partially offset by a 0.7% increase in average transaction amount.\nNet income for 2018 was $0.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted weighted average share, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted weighted average share in 2017.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income in 2018 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per fully distributed weighted average share, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.09 per fully distributed weighted average share, in 2017. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income is included in the accompanying financial data.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently anticipates the following for its fiscal year 2018:\nTotal revenue between $389 million to $393 million;\nCompany-operated comparable restaurant sales approximately flat for the year;\nThe opening of approximately 30 company-operated restaurants and six to eight franchised/licensed restaurants;\nRestaurant contribution margin of 16.0% to 17.0%;\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $37.5 million to $38.0 million;\nDepreciation and amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million;\nCapital expenditures of $43.0 million to $46.0 million; and\nAn effective pro forma tax rate of approximately 32.5%, which assumes the conversion of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC for shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of Class B common stock), which would eliminate the non-controlling interests.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter 2018 today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Russ Bendel, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ira Fils, Chief Financial Officer will host the call.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (855) 327-6837 or for international callers by dialing (778) 327-3988. A replay will be available after the call and can be accessed by dialing (844) 512-2921 or for international callers by dialing (412) 317-6671; the passcode is 10004556. The replay will be available until Wednesday, May 9, 2018. The conference call will also be webcast live from the Company’s corporate website at ir.habitburger.com under the “Events” page. An archive of the webcast will be available at the same location on the corporate website shortly after the call has concluded.\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nComparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales in our comparable restaurant base. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base in the accounting period following its 18th full period of operations. We operate on a 4-4-5 calendar, each accounting period will consist of either four or five weeks with the exception of a 53-week year, where the last period contains six weeks.\nAverage Unit Volumes (AUVs) are calculated by dividing revenue for the trailing 52-week period for all company-operated restaurants that have operated for 12 full accounting periods by the total number of restaurants open for such period.\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income includes net income attributable to The Habit (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock), which results in the elimination of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC, and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed pro forma net income before income taxes at our estimated long term effective income tax rate. Adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to The Habit, before non-recurring items and the effects of non-controlling interests in The Habit Restaurants, LLC. We use adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interests as a result of member owner exchanges of common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nAdjusted fully distributed pro forma net income per fully distributed weighted average share is calculated using adjusted fully distributed pro forma net income as defined above and assumes the exchange of all common units of The Habit Restaurants, LLC into shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of corresponding shares of our Class B common stock).\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents EBITDA plus pre-opening costs, stock-based compensation, loss on disposal of assets, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, and exchange related expenses.\nAbout The Habit Restaurants, Inc.\nThe Habit Burger Grill is a burger-centric, fast casual restaurant concept that specializes in preparing fresh, made-to-order chargrilled burgers and sandwiches featuring USDA choice tri-tip steak, grilled chicken and sushi-grade tuna cooked over an open flame.
