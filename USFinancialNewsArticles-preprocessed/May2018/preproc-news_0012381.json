REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\nThe Florence-based company, which is battling against falling sales and profitability, issued a profit warning in December.\nIn a statement it said current currency trends and ongoing unfavourable channel mix would have a negative impact on sales, margins and results this year.\nAlthough like-for-like sales in the first three months of the year were up 0.3 percent, sales in its retail channel were down 3.6 percent at current exchange rates in the same period.\nWholesale rose 2.6 percent.\nThe group said it would “continue to invest in a focused programme aimed at relaunching the Brand and optimising the processes.” Reporting by Giulia Segreti",
