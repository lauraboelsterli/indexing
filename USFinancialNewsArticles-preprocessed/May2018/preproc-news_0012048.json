    "text": "The Detroit Tigers scored three first-inning runs and used six pitchers to make it hold up as they edged the Kansas City Royals 3-2 on Saturday afternoon.\nNicholas Castellanos had three extra-base hits while scoring a run and driving in another. Victor Martinez had two hits, scored a run and added an RBI, while Leonys Martin had two hits and scored a run.\nJordan Zimmermann (2-0) lasted five innings to pick up the win. Shane Greene survived some shaky fielding by striking out three batters to record his sixth save. Detroit has lost the first two games of the four-game series.\nJason Hammel (0-4) took the loss. Abraham Almonte hit his third homer of the season, while Lucas Duda added two hits and a run scored.\nThe Tigers had three run-scoring extra-base hits in the opening inning against Hammel. Leonys Martin led off with a single and scored one out later on Castellanos’ line-drive double to left. Martinez knocked in Castellanos with a double to center.\nWith two outs in the inning, John Hicks also doubled to bring home Martinez and make it 3-0.\nFrom that point, the pitchers took control. Castellanos was left stranded after hitting a one-out triple in the third.\nThe Royals loaded the bases with two outs in the fifth but Zimmermann struck out Mike Moustakas to snuff out the threat.\nAlmonte ended Kansas City’s scoring drought with his two-out homer to left in the sixth.\nDetroit squandered a chance to extend the lead in the seventh. With two on and one out, Castellanos struck out on a pitch out of the zone. Hanmel was then removed for left-hander Brian Flynn. A walk loaded the bases but JaCoby Jones swung at the next pitch and fouled out.\nDuda led off the ninth with a double. Following a strikeout, Alex Gordon blooped a ball to center that Martin dropped, allowing Duda to score and Gordon to reach second.\nGreene struck out Alcides Escobar before Ryan Goins reached on an infield single when second baseman Dixon Machado had trouble with the exchange. Greene then struck out Jon Jay to finish the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
