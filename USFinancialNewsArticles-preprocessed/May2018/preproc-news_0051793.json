EPS, which strips out certain one-off items, is the main profit measure in South Africa.\nTiger Brands’ shares fell 4.9 percent to 332.01 rand by 0958 GMT.\nRecall and related costs to date amounted to 365 million rand net of initial insurance claims, the company said in a statement. These costs excluded ongoing trading losses.\nThe company is now busy deep cleaning the facilities and has allocated 50 million rand of capital expenditure to ensure that the plants are ready for product relaunches.\n“We’re using this time of the shutdown to make all the repairs and maintenance and structural changes that we intended to make and new ones that have been suggested by international experts over this period,” MacDougall told shareholders at the results presentation, without giving much detail.\nTiger Brands faces a combined class action lawsuit filed in March by Richard Spoor, a human rights advocate, on behalf of families affected by the listeria outbreak.\nMacDougall told a conference call that the group did not yet have details on the total amount of the claim.\n“The application for certification of the classes is in progress, while our legal representatives are in discussion to explore further collaboration,” he said.\nTiger Brands, which makes bread, breakfast cereals and energy drinks, is battling intense competition and pressure on pricing from consumers chasing value and group revenue fell 4 percent to 15.7 billion rand.\nThe closure of the cold meat facilities weighed on the company’s value-added meat products business, with revenue falling by 9 percent and operating income plunging by 78 percent to 13 million rand.\nProfit before tax from continuing operations decreased by 18 percent to 1.9 billion rand.\n“The outlook for the balance of the year remains challenging, with intense competitor activity in the domestic market and no meaningful recovery expected in international markets,” Tiger Brands said in its statement.\nThe company declared an unchanged interim dividend of 378 cents per share.
