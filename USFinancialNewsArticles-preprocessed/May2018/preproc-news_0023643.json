    "text": "HOUSTON, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Select Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE: WTTR) (\"Select\" or \"the Company\"), a leading provider of total water management and chemical solutions to the North American unconventional oil and gas industry, today announced results for the first quarter .\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $376.4 million as compared to $304.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $99.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.1 million as compared to a net loss of $14.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Due to the timing of Select's merger with Rockwater Energy Solutions, Inc. (\"Rockwater\") that closed on November 1, 2017, results in the fourth quarter of 2017 do not include Rockwater's operating results for the month of October, which included approximately $70.1 million in revenue, $0.7 million in net income and $7.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA.\nHolli Ladhani, President and CEO, stated, \"We are very encouraged by how the company progressed during the first quarter. The integration of Rockwater has gone well and is reflected in our first quarter results with solid net income and cash flow. With a supportive backdrop of rising oil prices and overall strong market fundamentals, we will continue to remain focused on further improving our margins in the second quarter.\"\n(1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Please see the supplemental financial information in the table under \"Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this earnings release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nCash Flow from Operations for the first quarter was $35.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $32.6 million, which were fully funded with Cash Flow from Operations, which also included $18.2 million of working capital build. Total cash during the quarter increased $3.3 million and, at March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.1 million and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $75.0 million. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company had approximately $160.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to $19.8 million of outstanding letters of credit, providing total liquidity of $166.9 million.\nConference Call\nSelect has scheduled a conference call on Friday, May 11, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

We define EBITDA as net income, plus interest expense, taxes and depreciation & amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus impairment of investment, lease abandonment costs, non-recurring severance expenses, non-recurring transaction costs, non-cash compensation expenses, plus/(minus) non-cash loss (gain) on sale of subsidiaries and other assets, plus/(minus) foreign currency loss (gain), plus inventory write downs and other non-recurring charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and non-recurring items outside the control of our management team. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.\nNet income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For further discussion, please see \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data\" in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented:\nRockwater\nThree Months Ended\nOne Month\nEnded\nOctober 31,\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n16,132\n$\n(14,950)\n$\n701\n$\n(12,280)\nInterest expense\n1,151\n4,744\n468\n730\nTax expense (benefit)\n462\n(525)\n121\n106\nDepreciation and amortization\n31,423\n34,993\n4,806\n21,650\nEBITDA\n49,168\n24,262\n6,096\n10,206\nImpairment of investment\n2,000\n—\n—\n—\nLease abandonment costs\n1,124\n701\n50\n1,863\nNon-recurring severance expenses\n—\n4,039\n125\n—\nNon-recurring transaction costs\n2,694\n4,717\n627\n748\nNon-cash compensation expenses\n2,481\n5,910\n387\n643\nNon-cash loss (gain) on sale of subsidiaries and other assets\n1,515\n965\n(3)\n309\nForeign currency loss (gain)\n400\n(281)\n404\n—\nInventory write downs\n266\n—\n—\n—\nOther non-recurring charges\n—\n3,563\n21\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n59,648\n$\n43,876\n$\n7,707\n$\n13,769\nContacts:\nSelect Energy Services\nGary Gillette - CFO & SVP\nChris George - Sr. Director, Finance & Investor Relations\n(713) 296-1073\nIR@selectenergyservices.com\nDennard Lascar Investor Relations\nKen Dennard / Lisa Elliott\n713-529-6600\nWTTR@dennardlascar.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/select-energy-services-reports-2018-first-quarter-results-300646628.html\nSOURCE Select Energy Services, Inc.",
