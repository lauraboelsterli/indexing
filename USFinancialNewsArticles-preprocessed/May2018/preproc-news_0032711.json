    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday he would support President Donald Trump’s nominee to be CIA director, Gina Haspel, all but ensuring her confirmation as the first woman to lead the spy agency.\nCIA Director nominee Gina Haspel testifies at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Senator Mark Warner said it had been a “difficult decision,” but cited Haspel’s 33-year career at the CIA and support from its workforce and past intelligence community leaders.\n“Most importantly, I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the President if ordered to do something illegal or immoral – like a return to torture,” Warner said in a statement.\nIn a letter to Warner dated Monday, Haspel said the CIA should not have undertaken a past harsh interrogation program, which has been a focus of debate over her confirmation.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is due to vote on Wednesday on whether to approve Haspel. With Warner’s support, she is expected to have the backing of all eight committee Republicans and at least two of the seven Democrats.\nDespite criticism - including from Republican Senators Rand Paul and John McCain - because of past ties to the CIA’s former rendition, detention and interrogation activities, Haspel is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate next week.\nAt least three other Democrats, all up for re-election this year in Republican-leaning states, have also said they support Haspel. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota announced she would be a “yes.”\nHaspel pledged at her confirmation hearing that she would never restart the program, in place after the Sept. 11 attacks but did not go as far as saying it should not have been started.\nHaspel in 2002 served as station chief in Thailand, where the CIA conducted interrogations at a secret prison using methods including waterboarding, widely viewed as torture.\nThree years later, she drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes of those interrogations.\n“While I won’t condemn those that made those hard calls, and I have noted the valuable intelligence collected, the program ultimately did damage to our officers and our standing in the world,” Haspel said in the letter.\n“With the benefit of hindsight and my experience as a senior Agency leader, the enhanced interrogation program is not one the CIA should have undertaken. The United States must be an example to the rest of the world, and I support that,” Haspel said.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Dan Grebler and Cynthia Osterman\n ",
