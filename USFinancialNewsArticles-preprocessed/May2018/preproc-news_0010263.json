The improvements to our processes and systems have made our platform and real estate portfolio stronger than ever and we continue to prudently allocate capital, as demonstrated by targeted asset recycling and share repurchases, for the benefit of our stockholders - in the past 12 months, we have repurchased approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock, 57.1 million shares, at a weighted average price of $7.88 ($450.0 million),\" stated Jackson Hsieh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spirit. \"As we approach the finish line with our spin-off transaction, we are very pleased with the prospects for each company and our ability to enhance stockholder value.\"\nFIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS\nTotal revenues were $165.3 million compared to $165.4 million for the same period last year.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $28.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to $12.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nFFO per diluted share was $0.24 and $0.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAFFO was $95.3 million (including cash severance charges of $2.1 million), compared to $98.0 million for the same period last year. AFFO per diluted share was $0.21 ($0.22 excluding cash severance charges), compared to $0.20 for the same period last year.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, which equates to an annualized cash dividend of $0.72 per share. The quarterly dividend was paid on April 13, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 30, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\nSpirit invested $9.9 million in one property and other revenue producing capital expenditures. The transaction, with an existing customer, has a lease term of 15.0 years and an initial weighted-average cash yield of approximately 7.99%.\nThe Company disposed of 29 properties for $37.7 million in gross proceeds, including the sale of 25 income producing properties for $28.2 million, with a weighted average capitalization rate of 12.28%. The remaining four properties were non-revenue producing assets that were transferred to CMBS lenders, resulting in the resolution of $26.2 million in secured debt.\nSpirit funded a $35.0 million, B-1 term loan to Shopko as part of a syndicated loan and security agreement. The loan bears interest at 12.0% per annum and matures in June of 2020. The loan is secured by Shopko's assets collateralizing their $784.0 million asset-back lending facility.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Spirit's diversified real estate portfolio, comprised of 2,364 owned properties, was essentially fully occupied at 98.9% with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.9 years.\nBALANCE SHEET, LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL MARKETS\nAdjusted Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre was 6.3x as of March 31, 2018. Unencumbered Assets totaled $4.5 billion as of March 31, 2018, representing approximately 58% of Spirit's total real estate investments. As of April 30, 2018, Spirit had approximately $8 million in cash and cash equivalents,$539 million of available borrowing capacity under its $800 million unsecured line of credit and $420 million of available borrowing capacity under its undrawn Term Loan facility. As of April 30, 2018, Spirit had additional funds available for acquisitions of approximately $98.0 million in its 1031 Exchange and Spirit Master Trust Program release accounts. As of April 30, 2018, our outstanding common share count is 426,418,536, excluding unvested restricted shares.\nDefinitions for non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial and operating report posted on Spirit's website along with this release. A reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to net income attributable to common stockholders is included in this document.\nSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nIn August 2017, Spirit's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $250.0 million of its outstanding common stock. In the first quarter, the Company repurchased 13.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock at a weighted average price of $7.88 per share.\nAs of April 30, 2018, the Company has fully utilized the remaining $63.9 million authorized under the share repurchase program, having purchased 8.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $7.93 per share since March 31, 2018.\nIn the past 12 months, the Company has repurchased 57.1 million shares, totaling $450.0 million of its common stock at a weighted average price of $7.89 per share.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company is providing guidance for Spirit as a stand-alone entity, pro-forma for the expected distribution of Spirit MTA REIT, as if the distribution had been effected as of January 1, 2018:\nPro-forma AFFO of $0.66 to $0.68 per share, (excluding severance charges), Capital deployment of $400.0 million to $500.0 million (comprising acquisitions, revenue producing capital expenditures and stock repurchases), Asset dispositions of $50.0 million to $100.0 million, and Pro-forma Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDAre of 5.1x to 5.4x.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for its guidance range of AFFO per diluted share to net income available to common stockholders per diluted share, the most directly comparable forward looking GAAP financial measure, due to the inherent variability in timing and/or amount of various items that could impact net income available to common stockholders per diluted share, including, for example, gains on debt extinguishment, impairments and other items that are outside the control of the Company.\nEARNINGS WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL TIME\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call is scheduled for Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
