    "text": "Published: May 9, 2018 8:05 p.m. ET Share\nCtW says Kimbal Musk, James Murdoch and Antonio Gracias ‘lack independence, industry relevant knowledge’ Getty Images\nBy Allison Prang\nPension-fund adviser CtW Investment Group has encouraged Tesla Inc. shareholders to vote against three of the company’s directors running for re-election.\nThe firm is encouraging shareholders to vote down the re-election of Kimbal Musk, the brother of Tesla TSLA, +1.62% Chief Executive Elon Musk, venture capitalist Antonio Gracias and 21st Century Fox FOX, -0.56% Chief Executive James Murdoch.\nCtW works with union-sponsored pension funds and in its letter described them as “substantial Tesla shareholders.” ‘[Tesla’s] continuing success looks more tenuous than ever. All of this year’s director nominees lack independence, industry relevant knowledge, and a track record of effective service in a governance role.’ CtW Investment Group\nCtW, which did something similar with Equifax EFX, +2.34% last month, said in a letter to shareholders that “Tesla has failed to hit critical production milestones” in the past year and has renominated people “who exemplify the company’s failure to evolve.”\nTesla has nine directors total on its board and will hold its yearly meeting June 5.\n(James Murdoch is a director on the board of News Corp NWS, +0.30% , the parent company of The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch. His father, Rupert Murdoch, is executive chairman.) ",
