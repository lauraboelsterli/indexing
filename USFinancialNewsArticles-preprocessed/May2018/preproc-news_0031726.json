    "text": "NASDAQ: CRME TSX: COM\nCardiome Pharma Corp. Becomes Correvio Pharma Corp., Closes on $25.5 million (CAD) in Non-Dilutive Capital\nVANCOUVER, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Correvio Pharma Corp. (\"Correvio\"), formerly Cardiome Pharma Corp. (\"Cardiome\") (NASDAQ:CRME / TSX:COM), a revenue-generating, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing hospital drugs, today announced that it has completed its previously announced strategic transaction with Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\"Cipher\") (TSX: CPH) whereby Cipher has acquired Correvio's Canadian business portfolio, including the Canadian rights to Brinavess ® , Aggrastat ® , Xydalba ™ and Trevyent ® , effective today.\nCardiome has undergone a corporate restructuring by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\"). Pursuant to the Arrangement, all of the outstanding common shares of Cardiome have been assigned and transferred to Cardiome's newly created wholly-owned subsidiary, Correvio Pharma Corp., in exchange for common shares of Correvio. Each former shareholder of Cardiome now holds the same pro rata interest in Correvio as it held in Cardiome immediately prior to completion of the Arrangement. Correvio has acquired and will hold all of Cardiome's pre-transaction assets, other than the Canadian business portfolio acquired by Cipher under the Arrangement. Cipher has acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Cardiome, which holds only the transferred Canadian business.\nStrategic & Financial Benefits of the Transaction for Correvio Shareholders\nProvides important upfront and non-dilutive consideration of $25.5 million CAD; Reduces cash burn; Establishes a long-term collaboration with a top-tier Canadian pharmaceutical company that is expected to result in additional product licenses between the two companies; Enables Correvio to focus internal resources on its rapidly growing European direct sales business and rest of world commercial initiatives; and Provides added financial flexibility to execute new strategic transactions and/or add new Europe-focused growth products.\nWilliam Hunter, MD, Chief Executive Officer and President of Correvio, stated, \"The completion of this strategic transaction with Cipher marks a significant step forward for Correvio and for our shareholders. We are eager to advance our rapidly growing European and rest of world, cardiovascular and anti-biotic commercial initiatives. This transaction is important because it secured important non-dilutive capital, while reducing our cash burn, and provides us with the financial flexibility to execute on potential future business development transactions. We are confident that this new strategic path leaves us well positioned for long-term growth.\"\nThe Arrangement was approved by the former Cardiome shareholders at a special meeting which took place on May 9, 2018. All of the directors and senior officers of former Cardiome entered into voting and support agreements pursuant to which they voted in favor of the Arrangement. In addition to the approvals from Cardiome's Board, management and shareholders, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, along with the TSX, have also approved the Arrangement.\nCorrevio Pharma Corp. will continue to trade under the ticker symbols \"CRME\" (NASDAQ) and \"COM\" (TSX) until the TSX finalizes our transition and publishes a bulletin announcing commencement of trading under our new ticker symbol \"CORV\", which we anticipate will occur in two to three trading days following closing. We will commence trading under \"CORV\" on Nasdaq at the same time.\nComplete details of the terms and conditions of the arrangement are set out in the definitive Arrangement agreement, which was publicly filed by each of Cipher and Cardiome under their respective profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and, in the case of Cardiome, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov .\nAbout Correvio Pharma Corp.\nCorrevio Pharma Corp. is a revenue-generating, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on providing innovative, high-quality brands that meet the needs of acute care physicians and patients.
