    "text": "Reblog Alphabet Inc.’s Google has agreed to meet with a group of publishers next week at four of its global offices to discuss their concerns about its preparations for Europe’s forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Some publishers have been critical of Google’s stance on the sweeping new data-protection law and worry the tech giant’s moves might further consolidate its position as the dominant digital advertising player. Google has told publishers using its advertising-technology tools they will need to obtain user consent on its behalf to gather personal information on European users to target ads at them.",
