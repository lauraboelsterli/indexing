    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - A Paris museum is shining a light on the work of Mary Cassatt, an American woman whose paintings made a profound and often-overlooked contribution to the male-dominated Impressionist movement in France.\n“An American Impressionist in Paris” at the Jacquemart-Andre museum is showcasing 50 works by the artist, who was born in Pennsylvania but lived in France for more than 60 years.\nShe was a friend and contemporary of Edgar Degas, and her works were exhibited with those of other Impressionist masters, but are less known today than those of many of her male peers.\n“Mary Cassatt has been kind of a forgotten painter of our French Impressionism. She arrived in Paris in 1865, and she was very important, in the very heart of French Impressionists,” exhibition curator Pierre Curie said\nShe is known in particular for paintings of women and children, often in domestic surroundings.\n“She’s not exactly a typical Impressionist because landscape is the heart of the Impressionist. She is like Degas. She is a figure painter. What interests her is the human being, and especially the mother and the children.”\nThe exhibition runs until July 23.\nReporting by Feyi Adegbite; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
