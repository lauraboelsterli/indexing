Beddingfield III, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Sienna. “We continue to advance our innovative multi-asset pipeline and are looking forward to data from all five of our clinical programs in the second half of this year and into the first quarter of 2019.”\nPipeline Overview\nSienna’s pipeline currently includes five clinical-stage programs:\n(from the Company’s Topical by Design™ platform)\nSNA-120 for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis and the underlying psoriasis; Phase 2b top-line results expected in the first quarter of 2019 SNA-125 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis; Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept results expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 SNA-125 for the treatment of psoriasis; Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept results expected in the third quarter of 2018\n(from the Company’s Topical Photoparticle Therapy™ platform)\nSNA-001 for the treatment of acne; pivotal results expected in the second half of 2018 SNA-001 for the reduction of light-pigmented hair; pivotal results expected in the second half of 2018\nSelected Financial Results\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended Mar. 31, 2018, were approximately $18.5 million, which includes research and development, or R&D, expenses totaling approximately $13.0 million and general and administrative, or G&A, expenses totaling approximately $5.5 million. Total operating expenses for the three months ended Mar. 31, 2017, were approximately $9.0 million, which included R&D expenses totaling approximately $4.9 million and G&A expenses totaling approximately $4.1 million.
