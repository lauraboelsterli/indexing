    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 7:26 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Argentina weighs 5 airlines' plans for new Falklands flights - minister Maximiliano Rizzi 2 Min Read\nBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina and Britain are analysing five South American airlines’ proposals for new flights between the Falkland Islands and Argentina, Argentina’s Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said on Tuesday. Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Argentina's Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie shake hands during a news conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\nTwo of the carriers are based in Chile, two in Brazil and one in Uruguay, Faurie said in a joint news conference with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, without naming them.\nLATAM Airlines operates the only flight to the Falkland Islands from South America, once a week from Chile. Once a month the flight stops in Rio Gallegos, Argentina. The new flights would originate outside Argentina, with a stopover in the country.\nA decision on the new flights will be made in coming months, Faurie said.

Johnson’s visit for a G20 meeting was the first by a British foreign secretary to Argentina in 22 years.\nDuring Britain’s two-month war to reclaim the Falklands in 1982, 255 British troops and about 650 Argentine soldiers were killed. The majority of the Argentines who perished were on a Navy ship that sank.\nThe two nations also reached a deal to allow forensic scientists to identify the remains of unknown Argentine soldiers buried in the Darwin Cemetery, leading to an unprecedented trip by Argentine relatives in March.
