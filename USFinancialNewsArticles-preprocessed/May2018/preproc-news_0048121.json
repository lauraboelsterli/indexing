    "text": "May 22 (Reuters) - Australia’s Santos said on Tuesday it terminated discussions with Harbour Energy and rejected the U.S.-based firm’s final takeover offer of $10.8 billion.\n“(The board) resolved to reject the final proposal on the basis that it does not represent a full value of the company,” Santos said in a statement.\nHarbour made the final offer for Santos this week, hiking its bid for a fifth time in nine months after a steep rise in oil prices.
