    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Syros Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SYRS), a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of medicines to control the expression of genes, today announced that it will host a live conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, May 10, 2018 to report its first quarter 2018 financial results and provide a corporate update.\nTo access the live conference call, please dial 866-595-4538 (domestic) or 636-812-6496 (international) and refer to conference ID 2967666. A webcast of the call will also be available on the Investors & Media section of the Syros website at www.syros.com . An archived replay of the webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following the presentation.\nAbout Syros Pharmaceuticals\nSyros is pioneering the understanding of the non-coding region of the genome to advance a new wave of medicines that control the expression of genes. Syros has built a proprietary platform that is designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, Syros’ gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across a range of diseases. Syros is currently focused on cancer and monogenic diseases and is advancing a growing pipeline of gene control medicines. Syros’ lead drug candidates are SY-1425, a selective RARα agonist in a Phase 2 clinical trial for genomically defined subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and SY-1365, a selective CDK7 inhibitor in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. Led by a team with deep experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, Syros is located in Cambridge, Mass.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005239/en/\nMedia Contact:\nSyros Pharmaceuticals\nNaomi Aoki, 617-283-4298\nnaoki@syros.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\nHannah Deresiewicz, 212-362-1200\nhannahd@sternir.com\nSource: Syros Pharmaceuticals",
