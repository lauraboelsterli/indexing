    "text": "ZURICH, May 18 (Reuters) - Luxury goods group Richemont said on Friday it could target strategic investments and divestments after organic sales rose 8 percent in constant currency terms in its fiscal year to March, helped by buoyant jewellery sales.\n“Our long-term approach does not preclude us from targeting strategic investments and divestments, as we have demonstrated over the past year,” the maker of Cartier jewellery and IWC watches said in a statement on Friday.\nNet profit rose 1 percent to 1.221 billion euros ($1.44 billion), well below a 1.719 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, partly due to inventory buy-backs of watches of 203 million euros in 2017/18. ($1 = 0.8468 euros) (Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; editing by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi)\n ",
