This week, Fusion Bank has appointed experienced banking and loans veteran Beth McCoy as Regional Sales Manager in Michigan and Illinois.\n\"I am thrilled to be on the ground-floor of such an awesome banking solution for the cannabis industry. With the structured business model in place, I feel we can make a major impact, helping this industry to grow,\" says Ms. McCoy.\nBeth McCoy, who lives in Clarkton Michigan, has over 25 years' experience in mortgage banking in both sales and operations, taking care of tasks such as pipeline management, monitoring loans from disclosure to close, and facilitating loans closing smoothly and on-time, all the while adhering to compliance regulations and applicable guidelines.\nMs. McCoy began her career as a closer, back in 1983 in San Diego, CA.
