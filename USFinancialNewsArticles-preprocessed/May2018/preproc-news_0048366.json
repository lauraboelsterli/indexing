    "text": "MUNICH, May 25 (Reuters) - The downward trend in German business morale has ended, above all thanks to strength in the domestic economy, Ifo institute economist Klaus Wohlrabe said on Friday.\nIfo’s business sentiment survey was unchanged in May after falling for five straight months.\n“The downward trend has stopped,” Wohlrabe told Reuters. “Above all, strength in the domestic economy contributed to the stabilisation of the economy ... The global economic environment is difficult, but the German economy is holding its ground.”\nReporting by Alexander Huebner Writing by Paul Carrel Editing by Michelle Martin\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
