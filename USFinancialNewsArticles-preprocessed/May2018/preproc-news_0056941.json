NiQ Lai, the current Chief Operating Officer and an Executive Director, will assume the role as the CEO with effect from 1 September 2018.\nThese appointments are part of a long-term succession plan for the Company's sustainable development. After 10 years at the helm, William will step up to focus on engaging key strategic partners and exploring new business opportunities for HKBN, and will report to the Board of Directors; while NiQ, in his new role as the CEO, will take over operational leadership of HKBN, and will maintain his directorship on the Board as an Executive Director.\nBoth William and NiQ have committed to fully subscribing to their maximum one-year gross salary investment in HKBN's Co-Ownership Plan III (the Plan was approved by the general meeting of the Company held on 15 December 2017).\nNiQ joined the Group in 2004 and was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer in 2006, and an Executive Director and the Chief Operating Officer in 2014 and 2017 respectively.
