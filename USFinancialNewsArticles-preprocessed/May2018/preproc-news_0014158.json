    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 9:15 Brighton ensure survival with 1-0 win over Man United Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Brighton and Hove Albion made sure of Premier League football next season with two games to spare after a Pascal Gross goal gave them a 1-0 home win over Manchester United on Friday. Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion v Manchester United - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - May 4, 2018 Manchester United's Anthony Martial in action with Brighton's Dale Stephens REUTERS/Eddie Keogh\nThe German forward headed home a Jose Izquierdo cross in the 57th minute as Brighton dominated the contest and only a string of good saves by United keeper David de Gea denied the home side a bigger win.\nThe result lifted Brighton into 11th place on 40 points from 36 matches and left them assured of finishing above the bottom three as they visit champions Manchester City on Wednesday before their final game away to Liverpool.\nMarcus Rashford and unsettled forward Anthony Martial got a rare start together for second-placed United but failed to make any impact as the visitors looked disjointed and bereft of ideas, with their final pass going astray all evening.
