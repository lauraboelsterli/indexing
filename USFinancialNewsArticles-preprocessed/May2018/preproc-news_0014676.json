    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) today announced the sale of approximately $17 Billion of first and second lien mortgages to DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc., a subsidiary of Credit Suisse AG. The company expects to complete the transaction and record a gain in the second quarter of 2018. The company had previously announced that it ceased new originations of residential mortgages and home equity loan products.\nAs a result of the portfolio sale, the company now expects to resume repurchasing shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2018 under its existing board authorization.\n\"Strong market demand enabled us to negotiate and sign this complex transaction more quickly than we thought possible,\" said R. Scott Blackley, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One.\nThe timing and exact amount of any Capital One common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, and the company's capital position and amount of retained earnings. Capital One's share repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC acted as financial advisors to Capital One on the transaction. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to Capital One on the transaction.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
