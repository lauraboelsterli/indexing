Deliveries will vary from quarter to quarter to account for different build specifications, customer acceptance and revenue recognition. Management expects to deliver approximately two hundred forty (240) Vicinity buses during the 2018 fiscal year.\nJean-Marc Landry, Grande West CEO stated, \"Grande West is diligently working on identified key areas of focus which include U.S. sales, Buy America assembly and optimizing our systems and operations. We have added strong new personnel to our team, most recently welcoming Dan Buckle as our Chief Financial Officer. New team members are now being integrated into the Company and have already started making a positive impact. 2018 is an important year for setting up for the future growth of Grande West.\"\nCorporate Update\nGeneral Overview\nManagement is pleased to have delivered a profitable quarter, but realizes the opportunity to increase operational efficiencies and cost savings to bring more to the bottom line. The addition of Dan Buckle as CFO in May was directed by the current and future needs of the Company. Reducing costs and increasing margin as Grande West grows into the U.S. market is a key focus for management and Dan's addition along with the new VP of Sales and Marketing, Rob Mowat, are clear steps in this direction.\nUS Buy America Production\nThe College Park facility located near the Atlanta Airport in Georgia is our U.S. final assembly facility. As previously noted, Grande West is proceeding carefully in the initial stages of final assembly ramp up in Atlanta. We are working diligently on verification and validation of the final assembly process and documentation with the assistance of a contracted third-party auditor. Our first bus has been completed, we will continue to ramp up progressively over the next few months with a target of reaching a production level of 10 buses per month as quickly as possible in 2018.\nReconciliation of Net earnings to Adjusted EBITDA\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure in evaluating the historical operating performance of the Company. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure under IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Readers of this MD&A are cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or loss determined in accordance with IFRS as indicators of the Company's performance, or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with IFRS as a measure of liquidity and cash flow. The Company defines and has computed EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange, and share based compensation.\nThe following tables reconcile net earnings or losses and cash flow from operations to Adjusted EBITDA based on the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company for the periods indicated.\n3 months ended,\nMarch 31, 2018\n3 months ended,\nMarch 31, 2017\n$\n$\nNet Comprehensive Income (loss)\n420,209\n(1,084,865)\nAdd back\nStock based compensation\n305,736\n271,426\nInterest\n287,476\n268,028\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n568,203\n117,050\nAmortization and Depreciation\n94,113\n64,139\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1,675,737\n(364,222)\nFinancial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the first quarter 2018 can accessed at the Company's website at http://grandewest.com/index.php/investors/stock-info .\nA conference call to discuss these results will be held today at 8:00 AM PST / 11:00 AM EST.

Grande West's Best-in-Class heavy-duty Vicinity bus is available in 27.5, 30 and 35 foot models powered by clean diesel or CNG designed with affordability, accessibility and global responsibility in mind. It costs significantly less than a regular 40 foot transit bus, is more maneuverable, burns less fuel and emits less harmful emissions. Grande West will soon be offering a new product which will be the first Crossover Vehicle in the transit space - a medium-duty, monocoque-designed rear engine vehicle.\nThe Company has been successful in supplying Canadian municipal transportation agencies and private operators with new buses and is receiving follow-on orders in many Canadian transit agencies. Grande West is compliant to Buy America certification, and along with Alliance Bus Group (\"ABG\"), its exclusive US distributor, is actively pursuing opportunities in public and private transit fleet operations that would benefit from Grande West's vehicles.\nFor further information please contact:\nGrande West Transportation\nJohn LaGourgue\nVP Corporate Development\nPh: 1-604-607-4000\njlagourgue@grandewest.com\nwww.grandewest.com\nNeither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX-V) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" (collectively \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.
