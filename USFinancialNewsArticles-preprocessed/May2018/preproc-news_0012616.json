Soccer Football - Premier League - Newcastle United v West Bromwich Albion - St James' Park, Newcastle, Britain - April 28, 2018 Newcastle United's Islam Slimani clashes with West Bromwich Albion's Craig Dawson Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith EDITORIAL USE ONLY.\nThe 29-year-old Algerian, who is on loan from Leicester City, was charged after he appeared to kick out at West Bromwich Albion defender Craig Dawson in the 80th minute of Newcastle’s 1-0 league defeat at St. James’ Park last weekend.\nThe incident was not seen by match officials but was caught on video.\n“He accepted the charge but argued the suspension was excessive. This was rejected by an Independent Regulatory Commission,” the FA said in a statement.\nNewcastle travel to Watford in the league on Saturday before a trip to Tottenham Hotspur in their penultimate game and end the season with a home match against Chelsea.
