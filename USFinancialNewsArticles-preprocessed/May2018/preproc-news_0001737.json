Our balance sheet remains strong and our cash position increased to just over $60 million as we continue to fund Coricancha from the cash flows from our operations in Mexico.\"\nOPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nQ4 2017\nChange\nOPERATING RESULTS\nTonnes milled\n96,869\n82,656\n17%\n98,396\n-2%\nAg eq oz produced 1\n1,031,937\n730,186\n41%\n1,065,773\n-3%\nSilver production - ounces\n491,063\n366,435\n34%\n514,218\n-5%\nGold production - ounces\n5,831\n5,178\n13%\n5,931\n-2%\nPayable silver ounces\n476,325\n344,995\n38%\n516,078\n-8%\nAg eq oz sold\n971,189\n680,984\n43%\n1,038,023\n-6%\nCost per tonne milled 2\n$\n121\n$\n88\n38%\n$\n116\n4%\nCash cost 2\n$\n5.39\n$\n3.54\n52%\n$\n7.25\n-26%\nCash cost per Ag eq oz 2\n$\n12.76\n$\n10.99\n16%\n$\n13.18\n-3%\nAll in Sustaining Cost (AISC) 2\n$\n12.33\n$\n19.55\n-37%\n$\n14.72\n-16%\nAISC per Ag eq oz 2\n$\n16.16\n$\n19.10\n-15%\n$\n16.89\n-4%\n(in 000's, unless otherwise noted)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nQ4 2017\nChange\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue\n$\n17,019\n$\n12,371\n38%\n$\n17,384\n-2%\nMine operating earnings before non-cash items 2\n$\n5,225\n$\n5,445\n-4%\n$\n4,962\n5%\nMine operating earnings\n$\n4,019\n$\n4,662\n-14%\n$\n3,755\n7%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(97)\n$\n3,040\n-103%\n$\n(1,918)\n95%\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$\n415\n$\n2,134\n-81%\n$\n904\n-54%\nOperating cash flows before changes in\nnon-cash net working capital\n$\n118\n$\n894\n-87%\n$\n618\n-81%\nCash and short-term deposits at end of period\n$\n60,884\n$\n53,158\n15%\n$\n56,888\n7%\nNet working capital at end of period\n$\n67,076\n$\n69,281\n-3%\n$\n65,965\n2%\nAverage realized silver price per oz 3\n$\n16.36\n$\n19.33\n-15%\n$\n16.86\n-3%\nAverage realized gold price per oz 3\n$\n1,363\n$\n1,297\n5%\n$\n1,292\n5%\nEarnings (loss) per share â€“ basic and diluted\n$\n(0.00)\n$\n0.02\n-100%\n$\n(0.01)\n100%\n1\nSilver equivalent ounces are referred to throughout this document. Ag eq oz are calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to lead and zinc price/pound, respectively, and applied to the relevant metal content of the concentrates produced, expected to be produced, or sold from operations.\n2\nThe Company has included the non-GAAP performance measures cost per tonne milled, cash cost, cash cost per Ag eq oz, AISC, AISC per Ag eq oz, mine operating earnings before non-cash items, cost of sales before non-cash items and adjusted EBITDA throughout this document. Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section of the MD&A for an explanation of these measures and reconciliation to the Company's financial results reported in accordance with IFRS. As these are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by others.\n3\nAverage realized silver price is prior to smelting and refining charges.\nREVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue increased by $4.6 million or 38% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily attributable to an increase in metal sales volumes ($5.6 million effect) as there were negligible metal sales for Topia during the first quarter of 2017 due to the suspension of milling operations for plant upgrades, and an increase in gold prices ($0.4 million effect). This was partly offset by a decrease in silver prices ($1.4 million effect). The Company's average realized silver price for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.36 per oz compared to $19.33 per oz during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in metal sales volume resulted in a corresponding increase in production costs for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017 (approximate $3.2 million increase). Production costs also increased in MXN terms as a result of mining narrower veins at the GMC (which causes more waste material to be mined), along with rate increases for mining contractors ($0.4 million effect). Another factor in the increase of production costs was the strengthening of the MXN against the USD which had the impact of increasing costs in USD terms by $0.8 million.\nMine operating earnings before non-cash items decreased by $0.2 million relative to the first quarter of 2017 as the $4.9 million increase in production costs exceeded the $4.6 million increase in revenue.\nAmortization and depletion increased compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to depreciation of the new tailings filtration and handling facilities at Topia that were commissioned in the second quarter of 2017.\nG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3% compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher share-based compensation.\nExploration, evaluation and development (\"EE&D\") expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $1.4 million or 70% compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to $1.5 million of care and maintenance and project expenditures related to Coricancha, which was acquired on June 30, 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included $0.3 million of Coricancha pre-acquisition EE&D costs related to technical evaluation, integration planning and pre-closing legal and professional fees. The Company will continue to expense costs associated with the ongoing care and maintenance of Coricancha and any project costs associated with evaluating the return of Coricancha to production until such time as a positive decision is made to restart the mine. EE&D expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 also included $0.6 million of additional corporate development costs, due to a higher level of activity associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions.\nFinance and other income (expense) primarily reflects interest income or expense and foreign exchange gains and losses. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company had foreign exchange gains of $0.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The foreign exchange gains recorded in both periods were primarily as a result of the forward contracts to purchase MXN to fund operating expenditures in Mexico.\nThe first quarter of 2018 reflected a net loss of $0.1 million compared to net income of $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The change was largely accounted for by the $1.4 million increase in EE&D expenses, $1.1 million decrease in finance and other income, and $0.6 million decrease in mine operating earnings.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease largely reflects a $1.4 million increase in EE&D expenses and a $0.2 million decrease in mine operating earnings before non-cash items.\nRefer to the Company's MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 for more details of the financial results.\nCASH COST AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS\nCash cost per silver payable ounce (\"cash cost\") for the first quarter of 2018 increased over the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher MXN production costs as discussed above which had the effect of increasing cash cost by $8.97 per payable silver ounce (\"per oz\"). In addition, the strengthening of the MXN against the USD accounted for a further $1.25 per oz increase. These factors were partly offset by an increase in by-product credits associated with higher volumes sold for gold, lead and zinc and higher realized prices for gold (together, a $7.47 per oz). Payable silver volumes were also higher in the first quarter of 2018 than in the first quarter of 2017, which reduced cash cost by a further $0.98 per oz. The full operation of Topia accounted for an approximate net $2.60 per oz increase in consolidated cash cost.\nAll-in sustaining cost per silver payable ounce (\"AISC\") during the first quarter of 2018 decreased from the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower sustaining exploration, evaluation and development expenses (\"EE&D\") and lower capital expenditures ($4.66 per oz effect). These were partly offset by the increase in cash cost ($1.85 per oz effect) as discussed above. The increased number of payable silver ounces had the effect of decreasing AISC ($4.41 per oz effect).\nRefer to the Company's MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018, for further discussion of cash cost and AISC, and for a reconciliation to the Company's financial results as reported under IFRS.\nCASH, SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS AND WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 31, 2018\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and short-term deposits of $60.9 million, compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Company does not have any debt.\nCash and short-term deposits increased by $4.0 million in the first three months of 2018 primarily due to $4.1 million of cash generated by operating activities, $0.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $0.1 million in foreign exchange gains on cash balances. These factors were partly offset by $0.3 million in additions to plant and equipment.\nNet working capital was $67.1 million as at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.1 million from the start of the year.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company's production and cost guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018 remains unchanged:\nProduction and cash cost guidance\nQ1 2018 Actual\nFY 2018 Guidance\nFY 2017 Actual\nTotal silver equivalent ounces 4\n1,031,937\n4,000,000 - 4,100,000\n3,978,731\nCash cost 5\n$5.39\n$5.00 â€“ 6.50\n$5.76\nAISC 2\n$12.33\n$12.50 â€“ 14.50\n$15.07\nIt is cautioned that cash cost and AISC are very sensitive to the Mexican peso foreign exchange rate and metal prices through the computation of by-product credits.\nThe Company's guidance for capital expenditures and EE&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 also remains unchanged:\nCapex and EE&D expense guidance (in millions)\nQ1 2018 Actual\nFY 2018 Guidance\nFY 2017 Actual\nCapital expenditures, excluding acquisition cost and capital expenditures associated with Coricancha\n$0.3\n$2.5 - $3.5\n$4.4\nEE&D â€“ operating mines (excluding Coricancha)\n$1.3\n$5.0 - $6.0\n$5.2\nThe focus for 2018 is to maintain steady and efficient operations in Mexico, while advancing the Company's Coricancha Mine Complex in Peru to set a platform for production growth in 2019 and 2020. While still in the early stage of evaluation, based upon historic production records, Coricancha has the potential to add 3 million Ag eq oz of annual production.\nAs noted, the Company is currently undertaking technical, economic and environmental evaluations to assess a restart of the mine, and plans to release the results of additional technical and economic studies for the project in the current quarter. Depending on the outcome of these evaluations, investments in connection with a restart of the mine could commence in 2018.\nThe Company continues to seek and evaluate additional acquisition opportunities in the Americas to meet the Company's growth objectives.",
