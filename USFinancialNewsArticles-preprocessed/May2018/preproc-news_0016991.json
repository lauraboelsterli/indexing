    "text": "Achieves Record First Quarter Revenues (up 10.2% to $280.6 million vs. Q1 2017)\nAnnounces Twenty-Seventh Consecutive Quarterly Dividend Increase\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- j2 Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: JCOM) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.4150 per share.\n“We are pleased with our Q1 results, particularly the progress we have made with our subscription businesses in the Digital Media segment as well as our initiatives to grow the healthcare business at Cloud Services,” said Vivek Shah, CEO of j2 Global. “We are also very excited to have welcomed several new key executives to our leadership team, including Dan Stone, President of Everyday Health, and Ron Burr, General Manager of Voice and Messaging in Cloud Services.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nQ1 2018 quarterly revenues increased 10.2% to a first quarter record of $280.6 million compared to $254.7 million for Q1 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities more than doubled to $103.9 million compared to $51.2 million for Q1 2017. Q1 2018 free cash flow (1) increased 47.5% to an all-time record of $90.7 million compared to $61.5 million for Q1 2017. The increase in free cash flow (1) is primarily due to the media business’ collection cycle which resulted in greater cash inflows associated with accounts receivable in comparison to Q1 2017.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share (2) decreased 26.9% to $0.38 in Q1 2018 compared to $0.52 for Q1 2017. The decrease over the prior comparable period is primarily attributed to (1) fair value adjustments associated with investments and contingent consideration; and (2) an increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of the $650 million 6.0% Senior Notes due in 2025.\nAdjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (2)(3) for the quarter increased 2.5% to $1.22 compared to $1.19 for Q1 2017.\nGAAP net income decreased by 26.7% to $18.9 million compared to $25.8 million for Q1 2017. The decrease over the prior comparable period is primarily attributed to (1) fair value adjustments associated with investments and contingent consideration; and (2) an increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of the $650 million 6.0% Senior Notes due in 2025.\nQuarterly Adjusted EBITDA (4) increased 3.2% to $102.7 million compared to $99.5 million for Q1 2017. The impact of a change in accounting principle associated with revenue recognition (ASC 606) was a decrease of approximately $2.0 million for both the quarterly revenues and quarterly adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2018. Without this impact, Q1 2018 revenues would have been $282.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA would have been $104.7 million.\nj2 ended the quarter with approximately $400 million in cash and investments after deploying approximately $100 million during the quarter for acquisitions and j2’s regular quarterly dividend.\nKey financial results for Q1 2018 versus Q1 2017 are set forth in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts). Reconciliations of Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures are attached to this Press Release.\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change Revenues Cloud Services $149.5 million $141.6 million 5.6% Digital Media $131.1 million $113.1 million 15.9% Total Revenue:\n$280.6 million $254.7 million 10.2% Operating Income $46.2 million $48.0 million (3.8)% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $103.9 million $51.2 million 102.9% Free Cash Flow (1) $90.7 million $61.5 million 47.5% GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (2) $0.38 $0.52 (26.9)% Adjusted Non-GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (2) (3) $1.22 $1.19 2.5% GAAP Net Income $18.9 million $25.8 million (26.7)% Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income $59.8 million $57.8 million 3.5% Adjusted EBITDA (4) $102.7 million $99.5 million 3.2% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (4) 36.6% 39.1% (2.5)% BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company estimates that it will achieve revenues between $1.20 billion and $1.25 billion, Adjusted EBITDA between $480 million and $505 million and Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of between $5.95 and $6.25.\nAdjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2018 excludes share-based compensation of between $31 million and $34 million, amortization of acquired intangibles and the impact of any currently unanticipated items, in each case net of tax.\nIt is anticipated that the non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2018 (exclusive of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions) will be between 23.0% and 25.0%.\nThe Company has not reconciled the Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and tax rate guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability with respect to costs related to acquisitions and taxation, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable and significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nDIVIDEND\nj2’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4150 per common share, a $0.01, or 2.5% increase versus last quarter’s dividend. This is j2’s twenty-seventh consecutive quarterly dividend increase since its first quarterly dividend in September 2011. The dividend will be paid on June 1, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 18, 2018. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval.\nNotes :\n(1) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment, plus contingent consideration. Free cash flow amounts are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are solely for informational purposes. (2) The estimated GAAP effective tax rates were approximately 27.1% for Q1 2018 and 26.7% for Q1 2017. The estimated Adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rates were approximately 23.7% for Q1 2018 and 29.1% for Q1 2017.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other expense, net; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and the items used to reconcile EPS to Adjusted non-GAAP EPS, as defined in the Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP Financial Measures.

The Company also understands that this Adjusted non-GAAP measure is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the Company’s performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of this Adjusted non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted non-GAAP EPS is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, net income per share and may be different from Non-GAAP measures with similar or even identical names used by other companies. In addition, this Adjusted non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This Adjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, the Company uses the following Non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted non-GAAP net income, and Adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “Non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\n(1) Share Based Compensation. The Company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. The Company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(2) Acquisition Related Integration Costs. The Company excludes certain acquisition and related integration costs such as adjustments to contingent consideration, severance, lease terminations, retention bonuses and other acquisition-specific items. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(3) Interest Costs. In June 2014, the Company issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the Company separately accounts for the value of the liability and equity features of its outstanding convertible senior notes in a manner that reflects the Company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The value of the conversion feature, reflected as a debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over time. Accordingly, the Company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 5.8% in its income statement. The Company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense of 3.25% because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding core operational performance. The Company has determined excluding these items from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(4) Amortization. The Company excludes amortization of patents and acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(5) Change in Value on Investments. The Company excludes the change in value on its equity investments. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(6) Convertible Debt Dilution. The Company excludes convertible debt dilution from diluted EPS. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\nThe Company presents Adjusted non-GAAP cost of revenues, Adjusted non-GAAP research, development and engineering, Adjusted non-GAAP sales and marketing, Adjusted non-GAAP general and administrative, Adjusted non-GAAP interest expense, Adjusted non-GAAP other income, Adjusted non-GAAP income tax provision and Adjusted non-GAAP net income because the Company believes that these provide useful information about our operating results and enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects.\nj2 GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS)\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 18,871 $ 25,820 Plus: Interest expense, net 15,751 12,410 Other expense, net 4,519 323 Income tax expense 7,017 9,422 Depreciation and amortization 42,618 39,323 Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures: Share-based compensation and the associated payroll tax expense 6,420 3,614 Acquisition-related integration costs 7,473 8,615 Adjusted EBITDA $ 102,669 $ 99,527 Adjusted EBITDA as calculated above represents earnings before interest and other expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the items used to reconcile GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, including (1) share-based compensation and (2) certain acquisition-related integration costs. We disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental Non-GAAP financial performance measure as we believe it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of our business from period to period. We understand that measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing our performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, net income, and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
