    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday inaugurated the long-delayed new airport in the capital, Islamabad, replacing the cramped Benazir Bhutto airport often criticised by travellers.\nA general view of the check-in area during a media tour of the newly built Islamabad International Airport Terminal, ahead of its official opening, Pakistan April 18, 2018.

REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood The new Islamabad airport, which has the capacity to handle 15 million passengers annually and space for further expansion, was first suggested in the 1980s and has been more than a decade in the making.\nThe delays have become a running joke with many Pakistanis, who mock the frequent announcements that the new airport would open soon and subsequent clarifications of further delays. The airport’s most recent delay was last month.\n“Nothing is impossible but this project definitely seemed impossible,” quipped Abbasi, in reference to his government inheriting the project in 2013.\nThe new airport is about 15 km (nine miles) from the capital. Benazir Bhutto airport was in the nearby city of Rawalpindi and attached to a military base.\nInternational travellers often complained about chaotic scenes at the airport and in 2014 it was voted the worst in the world by the “Guide to Sleeping in Airports” website, prompting widespread criticism of the airport in Pakistani media.\nA general view of the newly-built Islamabad International Airport building during a media tour ahead of its official opening, Pakistan April 18, 2018.
