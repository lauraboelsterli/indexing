    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday that the planned takeover of Sprint Corp ( S.N ) by Deutsche Telekom’s ( DTEGn.DE ) U.S. unit T-Mobile US ( TMUS.O ) made sense from a business perspective.\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz arrives for the Informal meeting of economic and financial affairs ministers (ECOFIN) in Sofia, Bulgaria, April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov Scholz also said: “I welcome the clear statement from Deutsche Telekom that the transaction will not have any impact on its broadband roll-out in Germany and that planned investment of 5 billion euros per year will be carried out without cutbacks.”\nDeutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) CEO Tim Hoettges expressed confidence on Monday that the $26 billion takeover would clear anti-trust hurdles.\nReporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel\n ",
