(Photo: Business Wire)\nKhaykin is currently president and CEO of Viavi Solutions, Inc ., a provider of network and service enablement solutions. He is also a member of their board of directors. He joined Viavi in February 2016.\n\"Oleg’s extensive experience in the semiconductor industry and with technology companies makes him an ideal addition,” said William H. Schumann III , chairman of the board of Avnet, Inc. \"Oleg is a well-respected leader who will bring valuable insights to the Avnet board as we continue to guide the company for future growth.”\nPrior to joining Viavi, Khaykin served as a senior advisor at Silver Lake Partners. Previously he had served as president and CEO, and as a member of the board of directors, at International Rectifier, a world leader in power management technology, from 2008 until its acquisition by Infineon AG in 2015. During his tenure, he successfully turned around the company and transformed it into the world leader in power semiconductors.\nKhaykin has also served as Chief Operating Officer of Amkor Technology, Inc., a provider of semiconductor assembly and test services, and vice president of strategy and business development at Conexant Systems, Inc. and Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. He was previously a member of the board of directors of Newport Corporation until its acquisition by MKS Instruments (2010-2016) and Zarlink Semiconductor, Inc. (2007-2011). His extensive operational experience and strategic leadership at other technology companies makes him an ideal executive to serve on the board of directors for Avnet.\n“I am pleased to be joining the Avnet board of directors as I have known Avnet for many years and have worked with the company as both a customer and as a supplier,” said Khaykin. “I look forward to contributing to the company in support of its transformation strategy and continued growth.”\nKhaykin holds an MBA from Northwestern University’s J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) with High University Honors from Carnegie-Mellon.
