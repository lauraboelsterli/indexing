(Nasdaq: IMGN), a leader in the expanding field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer, today reviewed recent progress in the business and reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We have achieved a number of important milestones to start the year, led by the advancement of mirvetuximab soravtansine,” said Mark Enyedy, ImmunoGen’s president and chief executive officer. “Our FORWARD I registration trial continues as planned following the successful outcome of the pre-specified interim futility analysis and the completion of enrollment in the trial earlier than expected. This accelerated accrual reflects the significant interest expressed by the oncology community in mirvetuximab and the need for new treatments in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In addition, as we look to expand the eligible patient population for this program, we were also pleased to report encouraging data for mirvetuximab in combination with Keytruda from our FORWARD II trial at SGO in March and look forward to presenting additional data from FORWARD II during 2018, with a poster presentation at ASCO for the mirvetuximab and Avastin expansion cohort. Finally, with our continued evolution towards a commercial-stage company, we have strengthened our management team with the addition of Blaine McKee as Chief Business Officer.”\nRecent Progress\nMirvetuximab Soravtansine\nIn April, ImmunoGen announced the completion of patient enrollment two months ahead of schedule in its Phase 3 FORWARD I trial. FORWARD I is designed to support full approval of mirvetuximab as a single-agent therapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In April, ImmunoGen successfully completed a pre-specified interim analysis for futility after 80 progression-free survival (PFS) events in FORWARD I. The study will continue as planned based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee and the Company is on-track to report top-line results in first half of 2019. In March, ImmunoGen presented data from the dose-escalation FORWARD II cohort evaluating mirvetuximab in combination with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting, demonstrating encouraging efficacy and favorable tolerability in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Notably, in the subset of eight patients with medium or high levels of folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression, the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was 63 percent (95% CI 25, 92), with a median PFS of 8.6 months (95% CI 1.6, upper bound not yet reached), and duration of response of 36.1 weeks. Based on these data, ImmunoGen is enrolling an additional 35 patients with medium or high FRα expression levels in an expansion cohort in the FORWARD II study and expects to present data from this cohort later this year.\nEarly-Stage Pipeline – Novel IGN Compounds\nIMGN779 is a CD33-targeting ADC in a Phase 1 dose-finding study in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dose escalation is continuing with both biweekly and weekly dosing schedules. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan-drug designation to IMGN779 for the treatment of AML. IMGN632 is a CD123-targeting ADC in a Phase 1 dose-finding study for AML and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).\nResearch and Innovation\nIn April, ImmunoGen presented three posters at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting highlighting the Company’s ongoing innovation in ADCs, including advancements to payloads and targets for enhanced anti-tumor activity as well as insights into factors that determine the clinical efficacy of ADCs.\nAnticipated Upcoming Events\nReport updated data from the FORWARD II mirvetuximab plus Avastin (bevacizumab) combination expansion cohort in approximately 50 patients at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting; Anticipate partner Takeda to begin clinical testing of TAK-164 in 2Q 2018; Report initial findings from the FORWARD II mirvetuximab plus pembrolizumab combination expansion cohort in 35 patients in the second half of the year; Report additional data from IMGN779 Phase 1 dose finding study in 4Q 2018 and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose before the end of the year; Report initial data from IMGN632 Phase 1 dose finding study in 4Q 2018; and Advance ADAM9 program into IND-enabling activities before year-end.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $19.8 million, compared to $28.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. License and milestone fees of $11.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 included $10.9 million and $0.5 million of recognized upfront fees previously received from Takeda and Debiopharm, respectively, compared to recognition of $12.7 million of a non-cash fee related to the Company’s license agreement with CytomX and $6 million in partner milestone payments received in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues in the first quarter of 2018 included $7.2 million in non-cash royalty revenues, compared with $7.6 million for the same quarter in 2017, reflecting a change in accounting standards for recognizing royalty revenue. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 also included $0.4 million of research and development (R&D) support fees and $0.7 million of clinical materials revenue, compared with $1.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the same quarter in 2017.\nOperating expenses, including R&D and G&A expenses, for the first quarter of 2018 were $56.6 million, compared to $41.4 million for the same quarter in 2017. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $44.8 million, compared to $32.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased clinical trial and drug supply costs driven largely by the accelerated timing of completing patient enrollment in the FORWARD I Phase 3 clinical trial. General and administrative expenses increased in the first quarter of 2018 to $10.0 million, compared to $8.1 million in the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased third-party service fees and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 also included a $1.7 million restructuring charge due to the workforce reduction related to the decommissioning of our Norwood facility as previously announced by the Company, compared to a $0.4 million charge in the same quarter of 2017 related to losses recorded on leased office space in Waltham.\nImmunoGen reported a net loss of $38.6 million, or $0.30 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $17.3 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter last year.\nImmunoGen had $218.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, compared with $267.1 million as of December 31, 2017, and had $2.1 million of convertible debt outstanding in each period. Cash used in operations was $50.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $33.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures were $1.0 million and $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancial Guidance\nImmunoGen has updated its operating expenses guidance for 2018. ImmunoGen now expects:\noperating expenses between $200 million and $205 million.\nGuidance for revenues and cash remains unchanged:\nrevenues between $60 million and $65 million; and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018 between $115 million and $120 million.\nImmunoGen expects that its current cash combined with the expected cash revenues from partners and collaborators will enable the Company to fund its operations into the fourth quarter of 2019.\nConference Call Information\nImmunoGen will hold a conference call today at 8:00 am ET to discuss these results.
