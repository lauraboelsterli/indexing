(Chuck) Mattera, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our CO 2 laser optics and EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography components businesses had another record quarter, and our optical communications business had 36% sequential growth in bookings. Silicon carbide substrates shipments grew 60% over the same quarter last year, 24% sequentially. For 3D sensing, we are excited about our positioning and we continue to see our market opportunities growing. Overall, with our consolidated book to bill ratio at 1.13 and our record backlog of $442 million, we expect our fourth quarter to be a good finish to the year.”\n“Our year to date cash flow from operations increased 45% from the same period last year,” said Mary Jane Raymond, Chief Financial Officer. “Our reported EPS of $0.45 per share includes $0.09 per share or $6.5 million of tax benefits for the revisions of provisional amounts recognized in Q2 FY18 for the impact of tax reform. The adjusted EPS of $0.36 per share, when compared on the same basis to our guidance, was negatively affected by $0.02 per share due to the weaker U.S. dollar and $0.03 due to a higher tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of FY18 income worldwide.\"\nTable 1 $ Millions, except per share amounts, % and Book to Bill (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues $ 294.7 $ 281.5 $ 245.0 $ 837.7 $ 698.3 Operating income $ 34.8 $ 32.5 $ 29.0 $ 97.1 $ 79.8 Net earnings $ 30.1 $ 9.6 $ 22.4 $ 60.8 $ 62.6 Adjusted net earnings (1) $ 23.6 $ 25.4 $ 22.4 $ 70.1 $ 62.6 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.45 $ 0.15 $ 0.35 $ 0.93 $ 0.97 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) $ 0.36 $ 0.39 $ 0.35 $ 1.08 $ 0.97 Other Selected Financial Metrics Book to Bill (2) 1.13 1.05 1.15 1.05 1.14 Gross margin 40.2 % 38.9 % 39.9 % 39.8 % 40.0 % Operating margin 11.8 % 11.5 % 11.8 % 11.6 % 11.4 % Return on sales 10.2 % 3.4 % 9.2 % 7.3 % 9.0 % Adjusted return on sales (1) 8.0 % 9.0 % 9.2 % 8.4 % 9.0 % (1) Excludes the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fiscal year 2018. See Tables 8 and 9 for Reconciliation of Reported Earnings to Adjusted Net Earnings.\n(2) Book to Bill is calculated by dividing orders the company expects to convert to revenue within the next twelve months by revenues recognized during the period.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2018 is revenues of $295 million to $305 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.37 to $0.43. This is all at prevailing exchange rates. Comparable results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were revenues of $274 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.50. The $0.50 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 included $0.04 of one-time favorable items relating to the acquisition of IPI and other year-end adjustments. As discussed in more detail below, actual results may differ from these forecasts due to various factors including, but not limited to, changes in product demand, competition and general economic conditions.\nSegment Information\nOperating income is defined as earnings before income taxes, interest expense and other expense or income, net.\nTable 2 Segment Book to Bill, Revenues, Operating Income and Margins $ Millions, except % and Book to Bill (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2017\nBook to Bill: II-VI Laser Solutions 1.09 1.11 1.27 1.09 1.11 II-VI Photonics 1.08 0.96 1.00 0.94 1.15 II-VI Performance Products 1.28 1.09 1.25 1.17 1.20 Total Book to Bill 1.13 1.05 1.15 1.05 1.14 Revenues: II-VI Laser Solutions $ 109.8 $ 109.8 $ 83.6 $ 312.9 $ 244.4 II-VI Photonics 116.8 110.5 109.1 337.9 305.8 II-VI Performance Products 68.1 61.2 52.3 186.9 148.1 Total Revenues $ 294.7 $ 281.5 $ 245.0 $ 837.7 $ 698.3 Operating Income: II-VI Laser Solutions $ 9.9 $ 9.5 $ 8.3 $ 22.7 $ 22.6 II-VI Photonics 16.7 16.9 15.9 53.1 45.7 II-VI Performance Products 8.2 6.1 4.8 21.3 11.5 Total Operating Income $ 34.8 $ 32.5 $ 29.0 $ 97.1 $ 79.8 Operating Margin: II-VI Laser Solutions 9.0 % 8.7 % 9.9 % 7.3 % 9.2 % II-VI Photonics 14.3 % 15.3 % 14.6 % 15.7 % 14.9 % II-VI Performance Products 12.0 % 10.0 % 9.2 % 11.4 % 7.8 % Total Operating Margin 11.8 % 11.5 % 11.8 % 11.6 % 11.4 % Table 3 is a reconciliation of Operating Income reported in this press release to reported Net Earnings.\nTable 3 Reconciliation of Operating Income to Net Earnings $ Millions (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2017\nOperating income $ 34.8 $ 32.5 $ 29.0 $ 97.1 $ 79.8 Interest expense 5.0 4.7 1.9 13.3 4.5 Other expense (income), net (1.5 ) (2.0 ) (2.1 ) (4.2 ) (9.6 ) Income taxes 1.2 20.2 6.8 27.2 22.3 Net Earnings $ 30.1 $ 9.6 $ 22.4 $ 60.8 $ 62.6 Table 4 is a reconciliation of Operating Income reported in this press release to EBITDA.\nTable 4 Reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA $ Millions (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018 2017 2017 2018 2017 Operating income $ 34.8 $ 32.5 $ 29.0 $ 97.1 $ 79.8 Depreciation and amortization 19.8 19.4 14.9 58.1 44.7 Other income (expense) 1.5 2.0 2.1 4.2 9.6 EBITDA (3) $ 56.1 $ 53.9 $ 46.0 $ 159.4 $ 134.1 Table 5 is a reconciliation of EBITDA reported in this press release to reported Net Earnings.\nTable 5 Reconciliation of EBITDA to Net Earnings $ Millions (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, Mar 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2017\nEBITDA $ 56.1 $ 53.9 $ 46.0 $ 159.4 $ 134.1 EBITDA margin (4) 19.0 % 19.1 % 18.8 % 19.0 % 19.2 % Interest expense $ 5.0 $ 4.7 $ 1.9 $ 13.3 $ 4.5 Depreciation and amortization 19.8 19.4 14.9 58.1 44.7 Income taxes 1.2 20.2 6.8 27.2 22.3 Net Earnings $ 30.1 $ 9.6 $ 22.4 $ 60.8 $ 62.6\n(3) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.

The conference call will be broadcast live over the internet and can be accessed by all interested parties from the Company's website at www.ii-vi.com as well as at http://tinyurl.com/ybympbaj . A replay of the webcast will be available for two weeks following the call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has disclosed financial measurements in this press release that present financial information considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not a substitute for GAAP measurements, although the Company's management uses these measurements as an aid in monitoring the Company's on-going financial performance. The adjusted non-GAAP net earnings and the adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share measure the earnings of the Company, excluding non-recurring or unusual items that are considered by the management to be outside the Company’s standard operation. EBITDA is an adjusted non-GAAP financial measurement that is considered by management to be useful in measuring the profitability between companies within the industry by reflecting operating results of the Company excluding non-operating factors. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures, including that such measures may not be entirely comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, due to potential differences among calculation methodologies. Thus, there can be no assurance that items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures will not occur in the future, or that there could be cash costs associated with items excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. The Company compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by providing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors should consider adjusted measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout II-VI Incorporated\nII-VI Incorporated, a global leader in engineered materials and optoelectronic components, is a vertically integrated manufacturing company that develops innovative products for diversified applications in the industrial, optical communications, military, life sciences, semiconductor equipment, and consumer markets.
