    "text": "LINCOLN, Neb., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Research Corporation (NASDAQ:NRC) today announced results for the first quarter of 2018.\nDigital VOC Platform highlights:\nVOC contract value doubles to $29 million Platform accounts for 21% of total first quarter revenue up from 10% year-over-year Platform variable direct expense drops in half Major back-to-back wins confirm emerging advantage at point of sale\nRemarking on Company performance, Michael D. Hays, chief executive officer of National Research Corporation said, “The quarter is less about consolidated performance and all about our unwavering focus in migrating current clients to our digital VOC platform. Early results are ahead of my expectations and our point of sale advantage is becoming confirmed.”\nKevin Karas, chief financial officer commented, “The quarter was noisy driven by unique events including our recapitalization, adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, impact of the 2017 Tax Act and redirection of sales resources to convert existing clients to the digital platform.”\nRevenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $31.0 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same quarter in 2017. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $7.3 million, compared to $6.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
