    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fred’s Inc. (“Fred’s” or “Company”) (NASDAQ:FRED) today announced that Dana Goldsmith Needleman and Thomas Zacharias have been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, effective May 20, 2018. The appointments are in connection with the retirement of Mike McMillan, Peter Bocian and Neeli Bendapudi.\nMs. Goldsmith Needleman has been serving as a principal of The Cogent Group, a private real estate investment firm, since 2009. She has been instrumental in the acquisition, development and disposition of more than $5.0 billion of corporate real estate throughout the United States with a heavy concentration of retail assets. Prior to The Cogent Group, Ms. Goldsmith Needleman was a Managing Director at Cardinal Capital Partners, one of the largest private sale-leaseback investors in the United States. Throughout her career, Ms. Goldsmith Needleman has completed sizeable acquisitions with Academy Sports & Outdoors, Albertson’s, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Dick’s Sporting Goods, PetSmart, Rite Aid, Shaw’s, and various other national retailers, enabling these companies to maximize the value of their real estate holdings through build-to-suits and sale-leaseback transactions. Ms. Goldsmith Needleman earned her B.A. from Duke University, J.D. from Boston University School of Law, and was admitted to the New York and Massachusetts bars.\nMr. Zacharias currently serves as President of Zacharias & Co. LLC, a real estate investment and advisory firm he founded in April 2017, after retiring as Chief Operating Officer from W. P. Carey Inc., a $10 billion publicly traded REIT. He has 36 years of corporate management experience and 23 years of board level experience involving a total of eight companies. The focus of his experience includes general management, financial analysis, strategic planning, value creation, operations, acquisitions, restructurings and retail real estate. He received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University magna cum laude and a MBA from Yale School of Management.\n“We are pleased to welcome Dana and Tom to Fred’s Board,” said Heath Freeman, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “Tom and Dana’s expertise, in both real estate and corporate management, will be a terrific addition and we look forward to immediate contributions.”\n“I am excited to be joining Fred’s Board of Directors and to begin working with the whole Fred’s team,” said Ms. Goldsmith Needleman. “And I am eager to make available to the rest of the board and management my diverse experience in business and real estate.”\nMr. Zacharias commented: “Joining the Fred’s Board of Directors is a great opportunity, and I look forward to leveraging my years of management experience across a variety of industries to assist management and the rest of the team during the Company’s operational turnaround period and beyond.”\nMr. Freeman concluded, “On behalf of the board and management, I would like to thank Pete, Mike and Neeli for their service to Fred’s and wish them all the best.”\nAbout Fred’s Inc.\nTracing its history back to an original store in Coldwater, Mississippi, opened in 1947, today Fred’s, Inc. operates approximately 600 general merchandise and pharmacy stores, including 13 franchised locations, and three specialty pharmacy-only locations.
