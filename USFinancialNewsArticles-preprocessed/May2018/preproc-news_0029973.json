    "text": "NEW YORK, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ALJ Regional Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALJJ) (\" ALJ \") announced results today for its second quarter\nALJ is a holding company, whose primary assets are its subsidiaries Faneuil, Inc. (including the customer management outsourcing business recently acquired from Vertex Business Services LLC, \" Faneuil \"), Floors-N-More, LLC, dba Carpets N' More (\" Carpets \"), and Phoenix Color Corp. (including the recently acquired printing components business, \" Phoenix \"). Faneuil is a leading provider of call center services, back office operations, staffing services, and toll collection services to government and regulated commercial clients across the United States. Carpets is one of the largest floor covering retailers in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a provider of multiple products for the commercial, retail and home builder markets including all types of flooring, countertops, cabinets, window coverings and garage/closet organizers, with four retail locations, as well as a stone and solid surface fabrication facility. Phoenix is a leading manufacturer of book components, educational materials and related products producing value-added components, heavily illustrated books and specialty commercial products using a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies.\nOur financial statements reflect the operations of Faneuil, Carpets and Phoenix throughout all periods presented, Faneuil's customer management outsourcing business (\" CMO Business \") since May 26, 2017, and Phoenix's recent acquisition of certain assets and liabilities (\" Printing Components Business \") from Moore-Langen Printing Company, a division of LSC Communications, Inc., since October 2, 2017.\nInvestment Highlights â€“ Three and Six Months Ended March 31, 2018\nConsolidated Results for ALJ\nALJ recognized consolidated revenue of $95.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $15.8 million, or 19.9%, compared to $79.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the acquisitions of the CMO Business by Faneuil and the Printing Components Business by Phoenix, which together accounted for $12.1 million of the total revenue increase, and increases in business activity in the Faneuil and Carpets segments. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total revenue increased $3.7 million, or 4.7%. ALJ recognized consolidated revenue of $95.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. ALJ recognized a net loss of $0.3 million and a loss per share of $0.01 (diluted) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $0.4 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.01 (diluted) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Increased revenue was offset by restructuring expenses to combine manufacturing facilities at Phoenix, higher start-up costs of certain contracts, and higher selling, general and administrative costs due to increased depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquisitions. ALJ recognized net loss of $5.3 million and loss per share of $0.14 (diluted) for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which included an increased provision for income taxes to reflect a one-time, non-cash deferred income tax expense of $4.1 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding such deferred income tax expense, ALJ recognized net loss of $1.2 million and loss per share of $0.03 (diluted) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. ALJ recognized adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.9%, compared to $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was flat due to higher labor, material, and customer service costs at Carpets, and transition expenses associated with the CMO Business acquisition, which offset increased net revenue from acquisitions. ALJ recognized adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. ALJ recognized consolidated revenue of $190.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $33.1 million, or 21.1%, compared to $156.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 due to the acquisitions of the CMO Business by Faneuil and the Printing Components Business by Phoenix, which together accounted for $25.1 million of the total revenue increase, and increases in business activity in the Faneuil and Carpets segments. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total revenue increased $8.1 million, or 5.1%. ALJ recognized a net loss of $5.7 million and loss per share of $0.15 (diluted) for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $0.9 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.03 (diluted) for the six months ended March 31, 2017. Increased revenue was offset by restructuring expenses to combine manufacturing facilities at Phoenix, higher start-up costs of certain contracts, higher selling, general and administrative costs due to increased depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquisitions, and increased provision for income taxes to reflect a one-time, non-cash deferred income tax expense of $4.1 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding such deferred income tax expense, ALJ recognized net loss of $1.6 million and loss per share of $0.04 (diluted) for the six months ALJ recognized adjusted EBITDA of $14.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.8%, compared to $14.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was due to higher labor, material, and customer service costs at Carpets, lower volumes for books and packaging at Phoenix, and transition expenses associated with the CMO Business acquisition, which offset increased net revenue from acquisitions. ALJ estimates consolidated revenue for the three months ending June 30, 2018 to be in the range of $80.2 million to $88.8 million, compared to $83.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.\nJess Ravich, Executive Chairman of ALJ, said, \"We continue to invest and support each of our businesses, with a focus on growing revenues and EBITDA while lowering our overall cost structure in order to increase shareholder value.\"\nAmounts in $000's, except per share amounts\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet revenue\n$\n95,105\n$\n79,296\n$\n15,809\n19.9%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n74,239\n61,007\n13,232\n21.7%\nSelling, general, and administrative expense\n18,822\n14,914\n3,908\n26.2%\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n(25)\n4\n(29)\nNM\nTotal operating expenses\n93,036\n75,925\n17,111\n22.5%\nOperating income\n2,069\n3,371\n(1,302)\n(38.6%)\nOther expense:\nInterest expense, net\n(2,793)\n(2,284)\n(509)\n(22.3%)\nTotal other expense\n(2,793)\n(2,284)\n(509)\n(22.3%)\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(724)\n1,087\n(1,811)\nNM\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n384\n(695)\n1,079\nNM\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(340)\n$\n392\n$\n(732)\nNM\nBasic (loss) earnings per share of common stock\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.01\n$\n(0.02)\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share of common stock\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.01\n$\n(0.02)\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding:\nBasic\n37,911\n34,575\n3,336\nDiluted\n37,911\n35,644\n2,267\nNM - Not Meaningful\nAmounts in $000's, except per share amounts\nSix Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet revenue\n$\n190,059\n$\n156,913\n$\n33,146\n21.1%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n149,149\n121,188\n27,961\n23.1%\nSelling, general, and administrative expense\n38,360\n29,297\n9,063\n30.9%\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n(232)\n12\n(244)\nNM\nTotal operating expenses\n187,277\n150,497\n36,780\n24.4%\nOperating income\n2,782\n6,416\n(3,634)\n(56.6%)\nOther expense:\nInterest expense, net\n(5,453)\n(4,718)\n(735)\n(15.6%)\nTotal other expense\n(5,453)\n(4,718)\n(735)\n(15.6%)\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(2,671)\n1,698\n(4,369)\nNM\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n(2,987)\n(755)\n(2,232)\nNM\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(5,658)\n$\n943\n$\n(6,601)\nNM\nBasic (loss) earnings per share of common stock\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n0.03\n$\n(0.18)\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share of common stock\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n0.03\n$\n(0.18)\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding:\nBasic\n37,742\n34,575\n3,167\nDiluted\n37,742\n35,671\n2,071\nNM - Not Meaningful\nResults for Faneuil\nAnna Van Buren, CEO of Faneuil, stated, \"During this quarter, Faneuil invested in additional resources to support our new commercial retail segment.

These non-GAAP financial measures are designed to complement the GAAP financial information presented in this release because management believes they present information regarding ALJ that is useful to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe present adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our company. ALJ defines adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, acquisition-related expense, (gain) loss on sales of assets, and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA measures are not calculated in the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure for comparison. Below are reconciliations of our net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA:\nAmounts in $000's\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(340)\n$\n392\n$\n(732)\n(186.7%)\nInterest expense\n2,793\n2,284\n509\n22.3%\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n(384)\n695\n(1,079)\n(155.3%)\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,850\n4,053\n797\n19.7%\nStock-based compensation\n270\n174\n96\n55.2%\nRestructuring expenses\n430\n61\n369\n604.9%\nGain on sales of assets\n(25)\n4\n(29)\nNM\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,594\n$\n7,663\n(69)\n(0.9%)\nNM - Not Meaningful\nAmounts in $000's\nSix Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(5,658)\n$\n943\n$\n(6,601)\n(700.0%)\nInterest expense\n5,453\n4,718\n735\n15.6%\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n2,987\n755\n2,232\nNM\nDepreciation and amortization\n9,683\n8,014\n1,669\n20.8%\nStock-based compensation\n563\n357\n206\n57.7%\nRestructuring expenses\n1,263\n93\n1,170\nNM\nAcquisition-related expenses\n123\nâ€”\n123\nâ€“\nGain on sales of assets\n(232)\n12\n(244)\nNM\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA\n$\n14,182\n$\n14,892\n(710)\n(4.8%)\nNM - Not Meaningful\nSupplemental Consolidated Financial Information - Segment Revenue, Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and Debt\nAmounts in $000's\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet revenue\nFaneuil\n$\n47,953\n$\n36,722\n$\n11,231\n30.6%\nCarpets\n18,691\n17,905\n786\n4.4%\nPhoenix\n28,461\n24,669\n3,792\n15.4%\nTotal net revenue\n$\n95,105\n$\n79,296\n$\n15,809\n19.9%\nAmounts in $000's\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nSegment adjusted EBITDA\nFaneuil\n$\n2,915\n$\n2,929\n$\n(14)\n(0.5%)\nCarpets\n(240)\n261\n(501)\n(192.0%)\nPhoenix\n5,459\n4,863\n596\n12.3%\nCorporate\n(540)\n(390)\n(150)\n(38.5%)\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,594\n$\n7,663\n$\n(69)\n(0.9%)\nAmounts in $000's\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nNet revenue\nFaneuil\n$\n99,427\n$\n74,773\n$\n24,654\n33.0%\nCarpets\n35,341\n33,449\n1,892\n5.7%\nPhoenix\n55,291\n48,691\n6,600\n13.6%\nTotal net revenue\n$\n190,059\n$\n156,913\n$\n33,146\n21.1%\nAmounts in $000's\nSix Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nSegment adjusted EBITDA\nFaneuil\n$\n6,625\n$\n6,690\n$\n(65)\n(1.0%)\nCarpets\n(966)\n215\n(1,181)\n(549.3%)\nPhoenix\n9,619\n9,211\n408\n4.4%\nCorporate\n(1,096)\n(1,224)\n128\n10.5%\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA\n$\n14,182\n$\n14,892\n$\n(710)\n(4.8%)\nAs of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, consolidated debt and consolidated net debt was comprised of the following (exclusive of deferred financing costs):\nAmounts in $000's\nMarch 31,\nSeptember 30,\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nTerm loan payable\n$\n89,795\n$\n91,018\nLine of credit\n4,500\n5,500\nCapital leases\n8,635\n7,250\nTotal debt\n102,930\n103,768\nCash\n2,947\n5,630\nNet debt\n$\n99,983\n$\n98,138\nAs of March 31, 2018, ALJ was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nFinancial Covenants Comparison\nMarch 31, 2018\n(actual)\n(required)\nLeverage ratio\n3.18\n< 3.50\nFixed charges ratio\n1.29\n> 1.25\nRevised Guidance â€“ Full Fiscal Year 2018\nALJ is revising guidance for its full fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 (\"Fiscal 2018\") due to the underperformance of (i) Faneuil's CMO Business, and (ii) Carpets.\nAfter experiencing transition challenges, which caused an extended integration period and increased costs, Faneuil continues to invest in its strategic CMO Business acquisition, which aligns with ALJ's long-term strategy.\nCarpets had previously forecasted improved results for Fiscal 2018. Margins were impacted by higher than expected labor, material and customer service costs in the first half of Fiscal 2018. Carpets has implemented a cost reduction plan, which include headcount savings totaling more than $2.0 million on an annualized run rate.\nALJ's original and revised guidance is as follows:\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nRevised\nOriginal\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA\n$31.0 - $34.0 million\n$36.0 - $39.0 million\nAbout ALJ Regional Holdings, Inc.\nALJ Regional Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of (i) Faneuil, Inc., a leading provider of outsourcing and co-sourced services to both commercial and government entities in the healthcare, utility, toll and transportation industries, (ii) Floors-N-More, LLC, dba Carpets N' More, one of the largest floor covering retailers in Las Vegas and a provider of multiple finishing products for commercial, retail and home builder markets including all types of flooring, countertops, cabinets, window coverings and garage/closet organizers, with 4 retail locations, and (iii) Phoenix Color Corp., a leading manufacturer of book components, educational materials and related products producing value-added components, heavily illustrated books and specialty commercial products using a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nALJ's second quarter ended March 31, 2018 earnings release and related communications contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
