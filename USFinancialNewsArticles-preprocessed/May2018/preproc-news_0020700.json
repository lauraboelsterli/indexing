    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Telefonica Deutschland ( O2Dn.DE ), Germany’s third-largest mobile operator, said Vodafone’s ( VOD.L ) proposed $21.7 billion takeover of Liberty Global’s ( LBTYA.O ) European assets would lead to excessive market concentration.\n“It’s clear that the announced transaction would create a monopoly in cable content distribution and a de facto duopoly in fixed-line infrastructure in Germany,” Chief Executive Markus Haas said in a statement.\n“We therefore expect close scrutiny from the responsible competition authorities. If this combination is in any way approvable, then only under appropriately strict conditions.”\nTelefonica Deutschland, majority-owned by Telefonica TEC.MC of Spain, has a mobile-led strategy. That leaves it vulnerable to ‘converged’ mobile and fixed services offered nationwide by market leader Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) and, if the proposed deal goes through, Vodafone.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
