Ms. Reilly will work closely with the executive leadership team to implement AMCP's new strategic plan, bringing more than 20 years of nonprofit and pharmacy leadership experience to the organization.\n\"AMCP is fortunate to have someone of Cynthia's expertise and experience onboard,\" said AMCP CEO Susan A.

She also coordinated industry-sponsored continuing education programs for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, and developed publications to guide operational and clinical aspects of pharmacy practice.\nMs. Reilly earned a bachelor-of-science degree in pharmacy from Temple University School of Pharmacy, and a master-of-science degree in global health and medical policy from George Mason University School of Policy and Government. She's a registered pharmacist in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nAbout AMCP\nThe Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy is the nation's leading professional association dedicated to increasing patient access to affordable medicines, improving health outcomes and ensuring the wise use of health care dollars.
