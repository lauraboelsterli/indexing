In the first six months of fiscal 2018, net income increased 44% to a record $124.8 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, up from $86.6 million, or 80 cents per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nAll share and per share information has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect a 5-for-4 stock split distributed by the Company in January 2018.\nOperating income increased 20% to a record $91.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $76.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, operating income increased 21% to a record $171.1 million, up from $141.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company's consolidated operating margin improved to 21.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from 20.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's consolidated operating margin improved to 20.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from 19.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nNet sales increased 17% to a record $430.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $368.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net sales increased 17% to a record $835.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $712.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the United States (U.S.) government enacted significant changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 14.8%, down from 29.5% for the first six months of fiscal 2017. Net income in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by approximately $23.7 million, or 22 cents per diluted share, including approximately $11.9 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, which resulted from one-time tax benefits principally due to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nConsolidated Results\nLaurans A. Mendelson, HEICO’s Chairman and CEO, commented on the Company's second quarter results stating, \"We are very pleased to report record quarterly results in consolidated net sales and operating income driven by record net sales and operating income at the Flight Support Group and continued year-over-year increases in both net sales and operating income at the Electronic Technologies Group. Our performance principally reflects the outstanding profitable contributions to earnings from our well-managed fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, continued mid- single digit organic growth within our Flight Support Group and strong demand for defense-related products within our Electronic Technologies Group.\nOur total debt to shareholders' equity ratio decreased to 49.9% as of April 30, 2018, down from 54.0% as of October 31, 2017. Our net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) of $635.6 million to shareholders’ equity ratio decreased to 46.4% as of April 30, 2018, down from 49.8% as of October 31, 2017. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 1.55x as of April 30, 2018 compared to 1.67x as of October 31, 2017. During fiscal 2018, we have successfully completed three acquisitions and have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023 and plan to utilize our financial flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns.\nCash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling $95.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018. We continue to forecast record cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we anticipate net sales growth within the Flight Support Group and Electronic Technologies Group resulting from increased demand across the majority of our product lines. Also, we will continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration, and an aggressive acquisition strategy while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility.\nBased on our current economic visibility, we now estimate our consolidated fiscal 2018 year-over-year growth in net sales to be 13% - 14% and in net income to be 33% - 35%, up from our prior growth estimates in net sales of 12% - 14% and net income of 30% - 32%. Additionally, we now anticipate our consolidated operating margin to approximate 21%, up from our prior estimate of 20% - 21%. Further, we continue to anticipate cash flow from operations to approximate $310 million and capital expenditures to approximate $50 million, and we now estimate depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $77 million. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.\"\nFlight Support Group\nEric A. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, commented on the Flight Support Group's second quarter results stating, \"Our record quarterly results in net sales and operating income principally reflects continued strong contributions from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions and organic growth within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines.\nThe Flight Support Group's net sales increased 16% to a record $267.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $231.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 15% to a record $522.6 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $452.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 is attributable to the impact from our fiscal 2017 profitable acquisitions as well as organic growth of 5% and 4%, respectively. The organic growth in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 is principally from increased demand and new product offerings within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. Additionally, the increase in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by lower net sales within our specialty products product line. Excluding the net sales decrease in our specialty products product line, the Flight Support Group experienced organic growth of 6% in the first six months of fiscal 2018.\nThe Flight Support Group's operating income increased 15% to a record $51.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $44.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 13% to a record $97.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $86.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 is mainly attributable to the previously mentioned net sales growth and the impact from an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation expense. Additionally, the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflects an increase in intangible asset amortization expense mainly resulting from the fiscal 2017 acquisitions.\nThe Flight Support Group's operating margin was a strong 19.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Flight Support Group's operating margin decreased slightly to 18.6% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 from 19.0% in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the first six months of fiscal 2018 principally reflects the previously mentioned increases in performance-based compensation expense and intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin.\nWith respect to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we continue to estimate full year net sales growth of approximately 10% over the prior year and we now estimate the full year Flight Support Group operating margin to approximate 18.5% - 19.0%, up from the prior estimate of 18.0% - 18.5%. Further, we estimate the Flight Support Group's full year organic net sales growth rate to be in the mid-single digits. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.”\nElectronic Technologies Group\nVictor H. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO’s Electronic Technologies Group, commented on the Electronic Technologies Group's second quarter results stating, \"Our quarterly results mainly reflect strong contributions from our fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions as well as continued increased demand for our defense products.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 20% to $168.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $141.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 21% to a record $324.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $267.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by our fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions. Additionally, the increase in the first six months of fiscal 2018 reflects organic growth of 3% principally from increased demand for our defense and space products.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 24% to $48.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $38.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 35% to a record $91.4 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from $67.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 came primarily from the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin impact mainly reflecting increased net sales and a more favorable product mix for certain defense products, partially offset by a less favorable product mix for certain space and other electronics products. Further, the increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 reflects an increase in intangible asset amortization expense mainly from the fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 28.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up from 27.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 28.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2018, up from 25.4% in the first six months of fiscal 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin, partially offset by the previously mentioned increase in intangible asset amortization expense.\nWith respect to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we now estimate full year net sales growth of approximately 18% - 20% over the prior year, up from the prior estimate of 15% - 17%, and anticipate the full year Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin to approximate 28.0% - 29.0%, up from the prior estimate of 27.0% - 28.0%. Further, we now estimate the Electronic Technologies Group’s organic net sales growth rate to be in the mid-single digits. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.”\n(NOTE: HEICO has two classes of common stock traded on the NYSE.
