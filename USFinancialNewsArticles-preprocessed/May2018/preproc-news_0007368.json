    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NasdaqGS:OXSQ) (“OXSQ,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and announced a distribution of $0.20 per share for the quarter ending June 30, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, net asset value per share was $7.60 compared with the net asset value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $7.55. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 we recorded net investment income of approximately $8.7 million, or approximately $0.17 per share. We recorded net realized gains of approximately $0.3 million, and net unrealized appreciation of approximately $2.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. In total, we had a net increase in net assets from operations of approximately $11.5 million, or approximately $0.22 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Our core net investment income (“Core NII”) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $7.6 million, or approximately $0.15 per share. Core NII represents net investment income adjusted for additional cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity investments and also excludes any capital gains incentive fees we recognize but have no obligation to pay in any period. See additional information under “Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income” below . While our experience has been that cash flow distributions have historically represented useful indicators of our CLO equity investments’ annual taxable income during certain periods, we believe that current and future cash flow distributions may represent less accurate indicators of taxable income with respect to our CLO equity investments than they have in the past. Accordingly, our taxable income may be materially different than either GAAP NII or Core NII. Total investment income for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to approximately $13.3 million, which represents a decrease of approximately $0.1 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded investment income from our portfolio as follows: approximately $5.9 million from our debt investments, approximately $6.8 million from our CLO equity investments, and approximately $0.6 million from all other sources. Our total expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were approximately $4.6 million, down by approximately $1.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest expense and professional fees. During the first quarter of 2018: We made investments of approximately $24.7 million in corporate loan investments. We received proceeds of approximately $0.2 million and $2.9 million from sales of our CLO equity investments and debt investments, respectively. We received or were entitled to receive proceeds of approximately $24.9 million from repayments and amortization payments on our debt investments. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average yield of our debt investments at current cost was approximately 9.9%, compared with 9.7% as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was approximately 15.9%, compared with 15.6% as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was approximately 15.5%, compared with 20.2% as of December 31, 2017. Our weighted average credit rating on a fair value basis was 2.1 at the end of the first quarter of 2018 (compared to 2.2 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017). As of March 31, 2018, we had no investments on non-accrual status. On April 24, 2018, our board of directors declared the following distribution on our common stock:\nQuarter Ending Record Date Payment Date Amount Per Share June 30, 2018 June 15, 2018 June 29, 2018 $ 0.20 On February 5, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of $25 million. During the quarter we repurchased 990,260 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $6.01 per share, producing accretion of approximately $0.03 per share.\nSupplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income\nOn a supplemental basis, we provide information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted for additional cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our CLO equity investments (excluding those cash distributions believed to represent a return of capital) and also excludes any capital gains incentive fees we recognize but have no obligation to pay in any period. The Company did not recognize any capital gains incentive fees for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nIncome from investments in the “equity” class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows compared to the cost, resulting in an effective yield for the investment; the difference between the actual cash received or distributions entitled to be received and the effective yield calculation is an adjustment to cost. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by us during the period (referred to below as “CLO equity adjustments”).\nFurther, in order to continue to qualify to be taxed as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. Therefore, core net investment income may provide a better indication of estimated taxable income for a reporting period than does GAAP net investment income, although we can offer no assurance that will be the case as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of a fiscal year. We note that these non-GAAP measures may not be useful indicators of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility and our taxable income may differ materially from our core net investment income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to core net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017 Amount Per Share\nAmounts Amount Per Share\nAmounts Net investment income $ 8,723,096 $ 0.170 $ 8,283,242 $ 0.161 CLO equity adjustments (1,115,601 ) (0.022 ) 2,547,993 0.049 Core net investment income $ 7,607,495 $ 0.148 $ 10,831,235 $ 0.210 We will host a conference call to discuss our first quarter results today, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 10:00 AM ET.
