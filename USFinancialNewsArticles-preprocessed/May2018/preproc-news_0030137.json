    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 4:54 AM / Updated 12 hours ago Buttler's record-equalling knock leads Royals to victory Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Jos Buttler continued his fine Indian Premier League (IPL) form by hitting a record-equalling fifth consecutive half-century since being promoted to opener in the Rajasthan Royals’ seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians on Sunday. FILE PHOTO: Britain Cricket - England Nets - Sophia Gardens - June 13, 2017 England's Jos Buttler during nets Action Images via Reuters / Andrew Couldridge Livepic\nThe England wicketkeeper-batsman stroked an unbeaten 94 for the Royals to add to his last four scores of 67, 51, 82 and 95 not out, matching retired Indian great Virender Sehwag’s record of five successive IPL half-centuries set in 2012.\nButtler’s England team mate Ben Stokes and Sussex all-rounder Jofra Archer took two wickets apiece as the Royals restricted holders Mumbai to 168 for six in their 20 overs.\nThe Royals then put in a solid batting display, led by Buttler, and notched 171-3 in 18 overs to win their third consecutive match and keep their playoff hopes alive.\n“I’m really enjoying it, found some good form, it’s a do-or-die situation and I’m full of confidence so want to keep it going,” Buttler said at his player of the match award ceremony.\n“I’ve spent a lot of time batting in the middle order so if I can bat through the first six overs I can tie the two together.”\nButtler, who helped Mumbai win last year’s title, admitted that his familiarity with Wankhede Stadium had helped his cause.\n“Nice to come back here, I enjoyed my time at Mumbai and it properly helped to know the conditions. I’m in a good head-space and looking forward to the next game.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien",
