    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - British filmmaker Terry Gilliam will have to wait until Wednesday to learn if the Don Quixote movie he has spent two decades struggling to make will be allowed to screen at the Cannes Film Festival, which opens this week.\nBenjamin Sarfati (R), lawyer of American-born British screenwriter Terry Gilliam, speaks to Gabrielle Odinot (C) lawyer for the Cannes Fim Festival, at the courthouse, France, May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau A Paris court on Monday heard a lawsuit to ban the screening, brought by a producer who says he has rights over “The Man who Killed Don Quixote”. The court said it would deliver its verdict on Wednesday afternoon.\nThat extends the agony for Gilliam, the former Monty Python member whose quest to make the film has been plagued by misfortune. An initial version, starring Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, was abandoned in 2000.\nThe movie is due to close the Cannes Film Festival, which starts on Tuesday, screening after the awards ceremony on May 19.\nBut that depends on the court ruling.\nPortuguese film producer Paulo Branco speaks to reporters as he leaves the courthouse in Paris, France, May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau Gilliam’s lawyer said he was hopeful the injunction would be denied.\n“We demonstrated that this prejudice is a figment of their imagination,” Benjamin Sarfati told reporters outside the courthouse.\n“...It’s time for the film to be seen. It is Terry Gilliam’s most powerful desire that the film can meet with its audience.”\nPaulo Branco, who brought the lawsuit, said: “The conflict with Terry Gilliam is something much deeper than what has been said today, that it is simply an issue of money. It is not that.”\nReporting by Feyi Adegbite; Writing by Robin Pomeroy; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
