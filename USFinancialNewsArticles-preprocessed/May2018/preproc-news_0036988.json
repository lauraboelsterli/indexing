    "text": "PRAGUE, May 17 (Reuters) - Investment vehicle J&T Private Investments (JTPI) said on Thursday it had taken over shareholder rights and installed crisis management at CEFC Europe, the Czech-based part of the troubled Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy.\nIt said the move came after CEFC Europe had not paid back debt on time.\nSeparately, Czech financial group J&T Finance Group (JTFG), which says it is an independent structure from JTPI but also a creditor, said it was aware of the steps and believed they could shield CEFC Europe from problems of its parent firm.\nJTPI said it had installed crisis management at CEFC Europe including Dusan Palcr, who is also a board member at JTFG.\nA spokesman at CEFC Europe was not immediately available for comment.
