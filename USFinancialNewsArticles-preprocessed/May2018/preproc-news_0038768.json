But in the most expensive ZIP code in D.C., prices can be nearly twice that.\nThat's according to financial website GOBankingRates, which collected median home values and mortgage data from Zillow, as well as Bureau of Labor Statistics-based cost of living data for 48 states and the District of Columbia, to identify the nation's most expensive ZIP codes. The site finds that D.C.'s most expensive ZIP is 20015, where the average home is worth about $1 million .\nshow chapters How much more it costs to own vs. rent in your state 1:24 PM ET Fri, 7 April 2017 | 01:23 \"ZIP code 20015 covers the D.C. neighborhood that straddles the Maryland border and is south of both Chevy Chase and Silver Spring,\" notes GOBankingRates, adding that, \"over the years, the nation's capital has earned a reputation for its escalating cost of living.\"\nTo calculate exactly how much you'd need to earn to live there comfortably, GOBankingRates used the 50-30-20 budget rule : 50 percent of your income would be used to cover necessities, 30 percent is discretionary income and 20 percent is allocated to savings.\n\"Monthly costs were totaled and multiplied by 12 to get the annual dollar cost of necessities in each ZIP code,\" writes GOBankingRates. \"This dollar amount for necessities was then doubled to find the actual annual income needed to live in the location.\"\nZillow Home Value Index for 20015. Data through Mar 31, 2018.\nBased on that data, here's how much it costs to live in 20015:\nNecessities: $75,939 Splurges: $45,563 Savings: $30,376 Total income needed: $151,878 While home values have declined a bit over the past year in 20015, Zillow predicts they could rise nearly 2 percent within the next year.\nIf you're looking for a home, experts suggest making sure you're ready to transition from renting .
