    "text": "NORTHBOROUGH, Mass., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (NYSE: ASPN) (\"Aspen Aerogels\") today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which ended March 31, 2018, and discussed business developments during the quarter.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $23.1 million compared to $23.0 million in the first quarter last year. First quarter net loss was $6.8 million compared to $9.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.29 compared to $0.39 in the first quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $(2.4) million compared to $(5.1) million in the first quarter of 2017. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA included legal and related expenses associated with Aspen Aerogels' ongoing patent enforcement actions of $0.1 million for the first quarter compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nRecent Business Developments\n\"During the first quarter, we experienced broad-based growth in our core and adjacent energy markets, most notably in North America, and modest growth in subsea project work. However, total revenue was essentially flat as a result of a decline in sales in Asia resulting from the conclusion of shipments to the South Asia petrochemical project, which comprised over 8% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017,\" said Don Young, President and CEO of Aspen Aerogels.\n\"We benefitted from solid manufacturing yields and strong operational productivity in our East Providence, Rhode Island manufacturing facility during the first quarter. In addition, we experienced a significant decline in legal and related expenses associated with our patent enforcement actions due to the successful results of our actions against two China-based companies at the International Trade Commission in February. As a result, we delivered strong year-over-year improvement in gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter,\" continued Mr. Young.\n\"We also made solid progress during the quarter with our strategic initiatives to drive revenue growth and profitability in our energy infrastructure business and to leverage our aerogel technology platform to develop breakout opportunities in new markets. We expanded and enhanced our salesforce, created and staffed a new business development group focused on commercializing innovation, kicked-off our EP20 initiative designed to increase the capacity and profit potential of our existing manufacturing assets, and made great progress in our joint development initiative with BASF focused on the building materials market. We also received the first of two advance payments of $2.5 million expected in 2018 from BASF in support of our capacity expansion plans, our process improvement initiatives and our new business development efforts,\" concluded Mr. Young.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAspen Aerogels updates its 2018 full year outlook as follows:\nTotal revenue is expected to range between $106 million and $116 million, unchanged from prior guidance Net loss is expected to range between $17.6 million and $20.6 million, revised from prior guidance of between $16.9 million and $20.0 million Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $(2.0) million and $(5.0) million, unchanged from prior guidance Net loss per share is expected to range between $(0.74) and $(0.87), revised from prior guidance of between $(0.71) and $(0.85)\nOur 2018 outlook assumes depreciation and amortization of $10.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $4.3 million, interest and other expense of $0.5 million, and weighted average shares outstanding of 23.6 million for the full year. In addition, our 2018 outlook reflects an expected $1.1 million to $1.3 million of costs and expenses associated with our ongoing patent enforcement efforts during the year.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for this 2018 financial outlook is provided in the financial schedules that are part of this press release. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nAspen Aerogels may incur charges, realize gains or losses, incur financing costs or interest expense, or experience other events in 2018 that could cause actual results to vary materially from this outlook. In addition, the timing of projects may have a significant impact on quarterly and annual revenue and profitability and can be difficult to predict.\nConference Call Notification\nA conference call with Aspen Aerogels management to discuss first quarter results and business developments will be held at 5:00 pm EDT on May 3, 2018. During the call, management will respond to questions concerning, but not limited to, Aspen Aerogels' financial performance, business conditions and industry outlook. Management's discussion and responses could contain information that has not been previously disclosed. The conference call will be available live as a listen-only webcast and will be hosted at the Investors section of the Aspen Aerogels website, www.aerogel.com . In addition, shareholders and other interested parties may call 833-287-0799 (toll free, U.S. & Canada only) or +1 647-689-4458 (international) conference ID \"8883209\" to participate in the conference call.\nFollowing the live event, an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Aspen Aerogels website for convenient on-demand replay for at least a year.\nA copy of this press release is posted in the Investors section on the Aspen Aerogels website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), Aspen Aerogels provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (\"non-GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release is Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as a measure of operating performance because the non-GAAP financial measures do not include the impact of items that management does not consider indicative of Aspen Aerogels' core operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) for planning purposes, including the preparation of Aspen Aerogels' annual operating budget, (ii) to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business, and (iii) as a performance measure under its bonus plan.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Aspen Aerogels' ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in its business, as they exclude expenses and gains not reflective of Aspen Aerogels' ongoing operating results or that may be infrequent and/or unusual in nature. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating Aspen Aerogels' operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Aspen Aerogels' GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Aspen Aerogels' financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. In this press release, Aspen Aerogels has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management strongly encourages investors to review Aspen Aerogels' financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nAbout Aspen Aerogels, Inc.\nAspen Aerogels is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets where thermal energy efficiency is at a premium and Aspen's products offer unique value.
