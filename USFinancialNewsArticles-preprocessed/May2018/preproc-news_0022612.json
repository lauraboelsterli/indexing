    "text": "CALGARY, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - WestJet (TSX: WJA) today announced its first quarter results for 2018, with net earnings of $37.2 million, or $0.32 per fully diluted share. While remaining profitable in a challenging quarter, this result compares with net earnings of $46.7 million, or $0.40 per fully diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2017. WestJet achieved its 52 nd consecutive quarter of profitability and flew an all-time quarterly record of 6.1 million guests. Based on the trailing twelve months, the airline achieved a return on invested capital of 9.5 per cent, down from to 10.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Even though winter 2018 brought many operational challenges, we successfully achieved record load factors and increased revenue by 6.9 per cent on a capacity increase of 4.3 per cent,\" Ed Sims, WestJet President and CEO. \"I want to thank every individual WestJetter for rising to the challenge through a very difficult operating quarter. Nonetheless, the quarter saw net earnings and margin decline as we continue to invest in the strategy laid out at Investor Day, in a higher fuel environment. We remain laser-focused on strategic execution to ensure we drive shareholder returns.\"\nOperating highlights (stated in Canadian dollars)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nNet earnings (millions)\n$37.2\n$46.7\n(20.4%)\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.32\n$0.40\n(20.0%)\nTotal revenue (millions)\n$1,191.7\n$1,114.7\n6.9%\nOperating margin\n4.7%\n7.1%\n(2.4 pts.)\nASMs (available seat miles) (billions)\n8.029\n7.699\n4.3%\nRPMs (revenue passenger miles) (billions)\n6.810\n6.393\n6.5%\nLoad factor\n84.8%\n83.0%\n1.8 pts.\nSegment guests\n6,088,954\n5,687,659\n7.1%\nYield (revenue per revenue passenger mile) (cents)\n17.50\n17.44\n0.3%\nRASM (revenue per available seat mile) (cents)\n14.84\n14.48\n2.5%\nCASM (cost per available seat mile) (cents)\n14.15\n13.45\n5.2%\nFuel costs per litre (cents)\n73\n64\n14.1%\nCASM, excluding fuel and employee profit share (cents)*\n10.57\n10.30\n2.6%\n*Refer to reconciliations in the accompanying tables for further information regarding calculations.\nDividend declaration\nOn May 7, 2018, WestJet's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per common voting share and variable voting share for the second quarter of 2018, to be paid on June 29, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 13, 2018.

percentage, mile and per unit data)\n(Unaudited)\nWestJet excludes the effects of aircraft fuel expense and employee profit share expense to assess the operating performance of the business. Fuel expense is excluded from operating results due to the fact that fuel prices are impacted by a host of factors outside WestJet's control, such as significant weather events, geopolitical tensions, refinery capacity and global demand and supply. Excluding this expense allows WestJet to analyze its operating results on a comparable basis. Employee profit share expense is excluded from operating results due to its variable nature and excluding this expense allows greater comparability.\nThree months ended March 31\n2018\n2017 (i)\nChange\nOperating expenses\n1,136,157\n1,035,843\n100,314\nAircraft fuel expense\n(281,151)\n(235,516)\n(45,635)\nEmployee profit share expense\n(6,384)\n(7,027)\n643\nOperating expenses, adjusted\n848,622\n793,300\n55,322\nASMs\n8,028,866,429\n7,699,062,691\n4.3%\nCASM, excluding above items (cents)\n10.57\n10.30\n2.6%\n(i)\nCertain 2017 numbers have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 15.\nReturn on invested capital\n(Stated in thousands of Canadian dollars, except percentages)\n(Unaudited)\nROIC is a measure commonly used to assess the efficiency with which a company allocates its capital to generate returns. Return is calculated based on our earnings before tax, excluding special items, finance costs and implied interest on our off-balance-sheet aircraft leases. Invested capital includes average long-term debt, average finance lease obligations, average shareholders' equity and off-balance-sheet aircraft operating leases.\nMarch 31\n2018\nMarch 31\n2017 (iv)\nChange\nEarnings before income taxes\n385,241\n369,795\n15,446\nAdd:\nFinance costs\n49,119\n59,615\n(10,496)\nImplicit interest in operating leases (i)\n83,498\n92,651\n(9,153)\n517,858\n522,061\n(4,203)\nInvested capital:\nAverage long-term debt (ii)\n2,045,485\n1,766,361\n279,124\nAverage shareholders' equity\n2,214,999\n2,097,329\n117,670\nOff-balance-sheet aircraft leases (iii)\n1,192,830\n1,323,593\n(130,763)\n5,453,314\n5,187,283\n266,031\nReturn on invested capital\n9.5%\n10.1%\n(0.6 pts)\n(i)\nInterest implicit in operating leases is equal to 7.0 per cent of 7.5 times the trailing 12 months of aircraft lease expense. 7.0 per cent is a proxy and does not necessarily represent actual for any given period.\n(ii)\nAverage long-term debt includes the current portion and long-term portion.\n(iii)\nOff-balance-sheet aircraft leases are calculated by multiplying the trailing 12 months of aircraft leasing expense by 7.5. At March 31, 2018, the trailing 12 months of aircraft leasing expenses totaled $159,044 (March 31, 2017 – $176,479).\n(iv)\nCertain 2017 numbers have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 15.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/westjet-reports-first-quarter-net-earnings-of-37-2-million-300644189.html\nSOURCE WESTJET, an Alberta Partnership",
