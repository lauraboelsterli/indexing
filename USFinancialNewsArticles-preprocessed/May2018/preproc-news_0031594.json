    "text": "12 COMMENTS\nThe Trump administration is facing stark choices as it seeks to fulfill promises to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico ahead of a fast-approaching deadline .\nThe administration’s goal is to have a deal cleared by the U.S. Congress by year-end. Given procedural hurdles, both House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump’s top trade official, U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, have called for a Nafta agreement this week, so as to give it the best chance of getting lawmaker approval by the end of December.\nThere are few signs that a deal will be ready in time, but then again, none of the three Nafta members is willing to say—at least so far—that the members will miss the deadline. Mr. Trump spoke Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the possibility of bringing the negotiations to a prompt conclusion.\nAnd yet, officials have struggled to compromise on major issues. Amid the uncertainties, here are four scenarios that could unfold in the weeks ahead:\nStrike a quick deal: The U.S., Canada and Mexico have hinted they are close to a deal on arguably the most difficult and important section of Nafta—the rules for the North American auto industry .\nRelated\nMexico Doesn’t See Nafta Talks Wrapping Up Before Deadline (May 15) Bevy of Issues Continues to Complicate Nafta Negotiations (May 14) As Nafta Deadline Nears, Hopes for Deal Focus on Autos (May 10) In Nafta Talks, U.S. Pushes Mexico to Raise Wages for Its Auto Workers (May 7) As such, new auto trade rules could be the centerpiece for a quick deal, packaged with some other, less-controversial Nafta updates. Such a deal would require the U.S. to compromise on other demands that are unpopular with its trading partners, including a “sunset” clause to end Nafta if it isn’t reapproved every few years, a plan to gut the agreement’s dispute-resolution provisions, and efforts to limit Canadian and Mexican companies’ procurement opportunities with the U.S. government.\nExtend the deadline: Mr. Ryan’s set a deadline of May 17 to give the deal enough time to pass through the current session of Congress, but that deadline may not be as firm as the speaker suggests. And, while each day after that makes a year-end vote more difficult in the U.S., many analysts say there is room for slippage. If Congress is willing, a vote can still be managed if a deal is announced later in May, or even in June.\nMoreover, Mr. Ryan needs formal notification of a deal 90 days before the three member countries sign it. In 2015, Congress delegated great authority to the president under “fast track” trade legislation. Under these rules, the Trump administration could finish the details over the next 30 days without falling behind on Mr. Ryan’s schedule, though the timeline would be tight.\nMeanwhile, another key deadline is June 1, when steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada will face tariffs in the U.S. if the countries don’t reach a deal through Nafta or another framework to avoid the tariffs. “Depending where we are with Nafta on June 1, the president will decide whether or not to extend their situation,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday.\nMore brinkmanship: President Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of Nafta if Canada and Mexico don’t agree to a major rewrite, and said as recently as Friday the current deal is a “disaster.”\nThis may just be tactics. The president must give partners six months’ notice to pull out of the treaty. He could well give notice to trading partners or Congress as a way of accelerating talks or even of encouraging lawmakers to quickly pass the deal.\nStill, such brinkmanship, in the middle of the midterm election season, could cost Republican support in farm states that benefit from agricultural sales to Mexico and Canada. Mr. Trump has softened his tone toward Nafta in recent months after a series of meetings with Republican senators who support the pact.\nBut in the long term, Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and prior warnings could lead him to return to a withdrawal from Nafta if there is no deal at the negotiating table, according to people following the talks. “I don’t think that there’s any chance at this time next year we have the Nafta status quo,” said Lori Wallach, senior trade expert at watchdog group Public Citizen, which backs some of the Trump administration’s controversial proposals.\nHold out for full Nafta rewrite: Trade negotiations are notorious for breaking deadlines, and the Nafta talks got off to a slow start last year, with major progress on rules for the auto industry only coming in recent months.\nLabor unions and Democratic lawmakers who support Mr. Trump’s approach to rebalancing the deal toward workers are eager to keep negotiations going if they are to achieve a broad agreement that covers worker rights, environmental rules and other topics. But such deal would need the approval of the next Congress, and few can say whether the new session will support the president’s agenda.\nOn the other side, business groups and many Republicans have been skeptical of the administration’s approach and would be happy to let the talks languish without pressure for an immediate deal.\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com",
