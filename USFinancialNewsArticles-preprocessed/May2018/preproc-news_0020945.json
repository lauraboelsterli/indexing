    "text": "ATLANTA, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gray Television, Inc. (\"Gray,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") (NYSE: GTN and GTN.A) today announces record results of operations for the three-months ended March 31, 2018, including record revenue, net income and Broadcast Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure, defined below). Our net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.22.\nFinancial Highlights and Selected Operating Data:\nRecord First Quarter Revenue, Net Income and Broadcast Cash Flow - Our revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $226.3 million, increasing $22.8 million, or 11%, from the first quarter of 2017. Our net income was $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, increasing $9.4 million, or 90% from the first quarter of 2017. Our Broadcast Cash Flow was $77.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, increasing $7.3 million, or 10%, from the first quarter of 2017.\nRetransmission - We have now completed negotiations to renew the retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") that expired at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. We currently anticipate that gross retransmission revenue for calendar year 2018 will be within a range of approximately $350.0 million to $353.0 million and retransmission revenue, net of retransmission expense, will be within a range of approximately $178.5 million to $180.0 million.\nStock Repurchases - During the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of $12.64 per share, including commissions, for a total cost of approximately $19.6 million.\nTotal Leverage Ratio - As of March 31, 2018, our total leverage ratio, as defined in our senior credit facility, was 4.23 times on a trailing eight-quarter basis, netting our total cash balance of $443.4 million.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% Change\n% Change\n2018 to\n2018 to\n2018\n2017\n2017\n2016\n2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue (less agency commissions):\nTotal\n$ 226,258\n$ 203,461\n11 %\n$ 173,723\n30 %\nPolitical\n$ 5,775\n$ 1,321\n337 %\n$ 9,655\n(40)%\nOperating expenses (1)(3):\nBroadcast\n$ 149,654\n$ 133,556\n12 %\n$ 108,536\n38 %\nCorporate and administrative\n$ 8,260\n$ 7,710\n7 %\n$ 15,670\n(47)%\nNet income\n$ 19,945\n$ 10,505\n90 %\n$ 8,990\n122 %\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow (2):\nBroadcast Cash Flow (3)\n$ 77,684\n$ 70,379\n10 %\n$ 65,926\n18 %\nBroadcast Cash Flow Less\nCash Corporate Expenses (3)\n$ 70,373\n$ 63,643\n11 %\n$ 51,226\n37 %\nFree Cash Flow\n$ 49,298\n$ 36,593\n35 %\n$ 24,215\n104 %\n(1)\nExcludes depreciation, amortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets.\n(2)\nSee definition of non-GAAP terms and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP amounts to net income included elsewhere herein.\n(3)\nAmounts in 2017 and 2016 have been reclassified to give effect to the implementation of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) – Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Postretirement Benefit Cost (\"ASU 2017-07\").\nResults of Operations for the First Quarter of 2018\nRevenue (less agency commissions).\nThe table below presents our revenue (less agency commissions) by type for the first quarter of 2018\nand 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nAmount\nPercent\nPercent\nPercent\nIncrease\nIncrease\nAmount\nof Total\nAmount\nof Total\n(Decrease)\n(Decrease)\nRevenue (less agency commissions):\nLocal (including internet/digital/mobile)\n$ 105,469\n46.6%\n$ 102,597\n50.4%\n$ 2,872\n3 %\nNational\n24,512\n10.8%\n24,814\n12.2%\n(302)\n(1)%\nPolitical\n5,775\n2.6%\n1,321\n0.6%\n4,454\n337 %\nRetransmission consent\n85,551\n37.8%\n67,573\n33.2%\n17,978\n27 %\nOther\n4,951\n2.2%\n7,156\n3.6%\n(2,205)\n(31)%\nTotal\n$ 226,258\n100.0%\n$ 203,461\n100.0%\n$ 22,797\n11 %\nWe acquired three television stations between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Collectively, these three television stations accounted for $9.6 million of the increase in our total revenue for the first quarter of 2018. Including the revenue attributable to these three stations, local and national advertising revenue increased, in part, due to the $2.3 million of revenue we earned from the broadcast of the 2018 Super Bowl on our NBC-affiliated stations, compared to $0.6 million that we earned from the broadcast of the 2017 Super Bowl on our FOX-affiliated stations. In addition, revenue from the broadcast of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games on our NBC-affiliated stations was approximately $5.5 million.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses .\nBroadcast operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $16.1 million, or 12%, to $149.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe three television stations that we acquired between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018, collectively, accounted for $6.6 million of the increase in broadcast operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018. Including the broadcast operating expenses attributable to these three stations, significant changes in our total broadcast operating expenses included:\nNon-compensation expense increased $13.1 million, or 19%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was due largely to an increase in retransmission expense of $9.4 million. The remaining increase was due primarily to increases in programming expense, licensing fees and professional fees.\nCompensation expense increased $2.9 million, or 4%, in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the first quarter of 2017. Non-cash stock based compensation expenses were $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate and Administrative Expenses .\nCorporate and administrative expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $0.6 million, or 7%, to $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase reflects the following:\nNon-compensation expense increased $0.3 million.\nCompensation expense increased $0.3 million, primarily due to routine increases in compensation. Non-cash stock based compensation expenses were $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.5 million related to the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility.\nTaxes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we made aggregate federal and state income tax payments of approximately $8.5 million. During the remainder of 2018, we anticipate making income tax payments (net of refunds) of approximately $36.0 million.\nGray Television, Inc.\nSelected Operating Data (Unaudited)\n(in thousands except for net income per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue (less agency commissions)\n$ 226,258\n$ 203,461\nOperating expenses before depreciation,\namortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net:\nBroadcast (1)\n149,654\n133,556\nCorporate and administrative (1)\n8,260\n7,710\nDepreciation\n13,694\n12,629\nAmortization of intangible assets\n5,436\n5,567\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n(821)\n527\nOperating expenses\n176,223\n159,989\nOperating income\n50,035\n43,472\nOther income (expense):\nMiscellaneous income, net (1)\n560\n93\nInterest expense\n(24,250)\n(23,191)\nLoss from early extinguishment of debt\n-\n(2,540)\nIncome before income taxes\n26,345\n17,834\nIncome tax expense\n6,400\n7,329\nNet income\n$ 19,945\n$ 10,505\nBasic per share information:\nNet income\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.15\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\n89,058\n71,877\nDiluted per share information:\nNet income\n$ 0.22\n$ 0.14\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\n89,576\n72,519\n(1) Amounts in 2017 have been reclassified to give effect to the implementation of ASU 2017-07.\nOther Financial Data:\nAs of\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands)\nCash\n$ 443,425\n$ 462,399\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n$ 1,836,828\n$ 1,837,428\nBorrowing availability under our revolving credit facility\n$ 100,000\n$ 100,000\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$ 14,407\n$ (483)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(7,817)\n(293,393)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(25,564)\n(7,772)\nNet decrease in cash\n$ (18,974)\n$ (301,648)\nGuidance for the Three-Months Ending June 30, 2018\nBased on our current forecasts for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 (the \"second quarter of 2018\"), we\nanticipate the changes from the quarter ended June 30, 2017 (the \"second quarter of 2017\") as outlined\nbelow.\nThree Months Ending June 30,\nLow End\n% Change\nHigh End\n% Change\nGuidance\nFrom\nGuidance\nFrom\nfor\nAs-Reported\nfor\nAs-Reported\nAs-Reported\nthe Second\nSecond\nthe Second\nSecond\nSecond\nQuarter of\nQuarter of\nQuarter of\nQuarter of\nQuarter of\nSelected operating data:\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n2017\n(dollars in thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUE:\nRevenue (less agency commissions)\n$248,000\n9 %\n$254,000\n12 %\n$ 226,681\nOPERATING EXPENSES (1)\n(before depreciation, amortization and\ngain or loss on disposals of assets):\nBroadcast\n$149,000\n11 %\n$151,000\n13 %\n$ 133,657\nCorporate and administrative\n$ 9,250\n10 %\n$ 10,000\n19 %\n$ 8,421\nOTHER SELECTED DATA:\nPolitical advertising revenue\n(less agency commissions)\n$ 13,000\n251 %\n$ 15,000\n305 %\n$ 3,708\n(1) Amounts in 2017 have been reclassified to give effect to the implementation of ASU 2017-07.\nComments on Second Quarter of 2018 Guidance:\nRevenue.\nBased on our current forecasts for the second quarter of 2018, we anticipate the following changes from the second quarter of 2017 as outlined below:\nWe believe our second quarter of 2018 local advertising revenue (including internet/digital/mobile) will change to be within a range of approximately $115.8 million to $117.0 million, or -2% to -1%.\nWe believe our second quarter of 2018 national advertising revenue will change to be within a range of approximately $28.8 million to $30.0 million, or -7% to -3%.\nWe believe our second quarter of 2018 political revenue will be within a range of approximately $13.0 million to $15.0 million.\nWe have completed negotiations to renew the retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs that expired at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. We currently anticipate that gross retransmission revenue for calendar year 2018 will be within a range of approximately $350.0 million to $353.0 million and retransmission revenue, net of retransmission expense, will be within a range of approximately $178.5 million to $180.0 million. We believe our second quarter of 2018 retransmission consent revenue will be within a range of approximately $87.0 million to $88.0 million.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets, net).\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we anticipate our broadcast operating expenses will increase from the second quarter of 2017, reflecting increases in retransmission expense of approximately $8.2 million, to total approximately $42.5 million for the second quarter of 2018.\nCorporate and Administrative Operating Expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets).\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we anticipate our corporate and administrative operating expense will increase approximately $1.2 million to approximately $9.6 million, primarily due to routine increases in compensation and professional service fees.\nThe Company\nWe are a television broadcast company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, that owns and operates over 100 television stations across 57 television markets that collectively broadcast over 200 program streams including over 100 channels affiliated with the CBS Network, the NBC Network, the ABC Network and the FOX Network.

These \"forward-looking statements\" are not statements of historical facts, and may include, among other things, statements regarding our current expectations and beliefs of operating results for the second quarter of 2018 or other periods, future income tax payments and other future events. Actual results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from the current expectations and beliefs discussed in this press release. All information set forth in this release is as of the date hereof. We do not intend, and undertake no duty, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. Information about certain potential factors that could affect our business and financial results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements are included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and may be contained in reports subsequently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nConference Call Information\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our first quarter operating results on May 8, 2018. The call will begin at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The live dial-in number is 1-888-516-2443 and the confirmation code is 3100808. The call will be webcast live and available for replay at www.gray.tv . The taped replay of the conference call will be available at 1-888-203-1112, Confirmation Code: 3100808 until June 7, 2018.\nWeb site: www.gray.tv\nEffects of Acquisitions and Divestitures on Our Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Terms\nFrom January 1, 2016 (the beginning of the earliest period presented) through March 31, 2018, we completed eight acquisition transactions and one divestiture transaction. As more fully described in our 2017 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our other prior disclosures, these transactions added a net total of 21 television stations to our operations. We refer to these transactions, collectively, as the \"Acquisitions.\"\nFrom time to time, Gray supplements its financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") by disclosing the non-GAAP financial measures Broadcast Cash Flow, Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement and Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash. These non-GAAP amounts are used by us to approximate amounts used to calculate key financial performance covenants contained in our debt agreements and are used with our GAAP data to evaluate our results and liquidity.\nWe define Broadcast Cash Flow as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, corporate and administrative expenses, broadcast non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits and payments for program broadcast obligations.\nWe define Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, and non-cash 401(k) expense, less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program and broadcast obligations.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense and pension expense, less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations, pension income, contributions to pension plans, amortization of original issue premium on our debt, purchases of property and equipment (net of any insurance proceeds) and the payment of income taxes (net of any refunds received).\nWe define Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense, trade expense and pension expenses less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations, trade income, pension income and contributions to pension plans. Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement gives effect to the revenue and broadcast expenses of the Acquisitions as if they had been acquired or divested, respectively, on January 1, 2016. It also gives effect to certain operating synergies expected from the Acquisitions and the financings and adds back professional fees incurred in completing Acquisitions. Certain of the financial information related to the Acquisitions has been derived from, and adjusted based on, unaudited, un-reviewed financial information prepared by other entities, which Gray cannot independently verify. We cannot assure you that such financial information would not be materially different if such information were audited or reviewed and no assurances can be provided as to the accuracy of such information, or that our actual results would not differ materially from this financial information if the Acquisitions had been completed at the stated date. In addition, the presentation of Operating Cash Flow as Defined in the Senior Credit Agreement and the adjustments to such information, including expected synergies resulting from such transactions, may not comply with GAAP or the requirements for pro forma financial information under Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.\nOur Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash is determined by dividing our Adjusted Total Indebtedness, Net of All Cash by our Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement, divided by two. Our Adjusted Total Indebtedness, net of all cash represents the total outstanding principal of our long-term debt, plus certain other obligations as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement, less all cash. Our Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement, divided by two represents our average annual Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement for the preceding eight quarters.\nThese non-GAAP terms are not defined in GAAP and our definitions may differ from, and therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness. Such terms are used by management in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Terms, in thousands:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$ 19,945\n$ 10,505\n$ 8,990\nAdjustments to reconcile from net income to Broadcast Cash\nFlow Less Cash Corporate Expenses:\nDepreciation\n13,694\n12,629\n11,126\nAmortization of intangible assets\n5,436\n5,567\n3,888\nNon-cash stock-based compensation\n2,157\n1,338\n1,284\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n(821)\n527\n(1,648)\nMiscellaneous income, net (1)\n(560)\n(93)\n(529)\nInterest expense\n24,250\n23,191\n21,275\nLoss from early extinguishment of debt\n-\n2,540\n-\nIncome tax expense\n6,400\n7,329\n6,415\nAmortization of program broadcast rights\n5,346\n5,222\n4,396\nPayments for program broadcast rights\n(5,474)\n(5,119)\n(3,977)\nCommon stock contributed to 401(k) plan\n-\n7\n6\nCorporate and administrative expenses excluding\ndepreciation, amortization of intangible assets and\nnon-cash stock-based compensation (1)\n7,311\n6,736\n14,700\nBroadcast Cash Flow\n77,684\n70,379\n65,926\nCorporate and administrative expenses excluding\ndepreciation, amortization of intangible assets and\nnon-cash stock-based compensation (1)\n(7,311)\n(6,736)\n(14,700)\nBroadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses\n$ 70,373\n$ 63,643\n$ 51,226\nContributions to pension plans\n-\n(624)\n(520)\nInterest expense\n(24,250)\n(23,191)\n(21,275)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n1,157\n1,151\n1,071\nAmortization of net original issue premium on\n5.875% senior notes due 2026\n(153)\n(153)\n(216)\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(6,280)\n(3,977)\n(5,931)\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds\n8,451\n(256)\n(140)\nFree Cash Flow\n$ 49,298\n$ 36,593\n$ 24,215\n(1) Amounts in 2017 and 2016 have been reclassified to give effect to the implementation of ASU 2017-07.\nReconciliation of Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash, in thousands except for ratio:\nEight Quarters\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nOperating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement:\nNet income\n$ 335,180\nDepreciation\n100,464\nAmortization of intangible assets\n43,216\nNon-cash stock-based compensation\n14,276\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net\n(73,044)\nMiscellaneous (income) expense, net\n5\nInterest expense\n195,470\nLoss from early extinguishment of debt\n34,838\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(25,271)\nAmortization of program broadcast rights\n40,984\nCommon stock contributed to 401(k) plan\n39\nPayments for program broadcast rights\n(42,308)\nPension expense\n(631)\nContributions to pension plans\n(5,652)\nAdjustments for stations acquired or divested, financings and expected\nsynergies during the eight quarter period\n49,025\nProfessional fees related to acquisitions and divestitures\n3,031\nOperating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement\n$ 669,622\nOperating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement,\ndivided by two\n$ 334,811\nMarch 31, 2018\nAdjusted Total Indebtedness:\nTotal outstanding principal, including current portion\n$ 1,858,630\nCapital leases and other debt\n714\nCash\n(443,425)\nAdjusted Total Indebtedness, Net of All Cash\n$ 1,415,919\nTotal Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash\n4.23\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gray-reports-record-operating-results-for-the-quarter-ended-march-31-2018-300643884.html\nSOURCE Gray Television, Inc.",
