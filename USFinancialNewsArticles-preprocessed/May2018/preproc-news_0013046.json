    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turquoise Hill Resources today announced that, further to its March 14, 2018 letter to shareholders, the Company’s Board of Directors has undertaken a review of the matters raised by SailingStone Capital Partners LLC in its February 1, 2018 letter.\nThe Board believes that the Company is appropriately informed and that management is properly incentivized to perform its duties. Recognizing the concerns raised by SailingStone, the Board of Directors, through its independent members, has met with Rio Tinto and discussed actions that the parties can and have taken to enhance their working relationship on relevant Oyu Tolgoi matters. Specific actions that the parties are taking include:\nIncreasing direct participation by Turquoise Hill management on Oyu Tolgoi matters, including in various Oyu Tolgoi working groups that are interacting with the Government of Mongolia and in the upcoming Oyu Tolgoi cost and schedule reviews; Enhancing the independence of Turquoise Hill’s technical personnel; and Establishing a project management office at Oyu Tolgoi as an additional mechanism to facilitate sharing of information.\nIn addition, the Board, through its Compensation and Benefits Committee as part of its ongoing mandate, continues to review management compensation arrangements to ensure consistency with the guiding principles of the Company’s compensation philosophy, building on the progress made over recent years in aligning management interests with those of the Company’s shareholders.\nDiscussions with Rio Tinto have been constructive and are ongoing. Both parties recognize that Turquoise Hill’s independence and its participation in all material and relevant Oyu Tolgoi matters are important to facilitating the maximization of Oyu Tolgoi’s value for all Turquoise Hill shareholders.\nContact\nInvestors and Media\nTony Shaffer\n+ 1 604 648 3934\ntony.shaffer@turquoisehill.com\nFollow us on Twitter @TurquoiseHillRe\nForward-looking statements\nCertain statements made herein, including statements relating to matters that are not historical facts and statements of the Company’s beliefs, intentions and expectations about developments, results and events which will or may occur in the future, constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements and information relate to future events or future performance, reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events and are typically identified by words such as “anticipate”, “could”, “should”, “expect”, “seek”, “may”, “intend”, “likely”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “believe” and similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. These include, but are not limited to, statements about anticipated business activities, planned expenditures, corporate strategies, and other statements that are not historical facts.\nForward-looking statements and information are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements or information. There can be no assurance that such statements or information will prove to be accurate. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies, local and global economic conditions, and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future, including the price of copper, gold and silver, anticipated capital and operating costs, anticipated future production and cash flows, and the status of the Company’s relationship and interaction with the Government of Mongolia on the continued development of Oyu Tolgoi and Oyu Tolgoi LLC internal governance. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and information include, among others, copper; gold and silver price volatility; discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries; development plans for processing resources; matters relating to proposed exploration or expansion; mining operational and development risks; litigation risks; regulatory restrictions (including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability); Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s ability to deliver a domestic power source for the Oyu Tolgoi project within the required contractual time frame; communications with local stakeholders and community relations; activities, actions or assessments, including tax assessments, by governmental authorities; events or circumstances (including strikes, blockages or similar events outside of the Company’s control) that may affect the Company’s ability to deliver its products in a timely manner; currency fluctuations; the speculative nature of mineral exploration; the global economic climate; dilution; share price volatility; competition; loss of key employees; cyber security incidents; additional funding requirements, including in respect of the development or construction of a long-term domestic power supply for the Oyu Tolgoi project; capital and operating costs, including with respect to the development of additional deposits and processing facilities; and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. All such forward-looking statements and information are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company’s management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These statements, however, are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements or information.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur. Events or circumstances could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the “Risk Factors” section in the Company’s Annual Information Form dated as of March 15, 2018 in respect of the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “AIF”).\nReaders are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the “Risk Factors” section of the AIF that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on the Company’s forward-looking statements and information to make decisions with respect to the Company, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events.\nSource:Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd.",
