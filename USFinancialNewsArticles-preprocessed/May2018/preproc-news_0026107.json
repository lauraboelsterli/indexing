    "text": "WARSAW, May 10 (Reuters) - Poland’s Bank Pekao said on Thursday its first-quarter net profit rose 12 percent year-on-year to 392 million zlotys ($109.06 million) as a fast-growing economy encourages Poles to take loans, while pay rises contribute to increased deposits.\nThe state-run bank’s net profit in the first quarter came in above forecasts, as analysts had expected the country’s second largest bank to report a bottomline of 380 million zlotys. ($1 = 3.5942 zlotys) (Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Sunil Nair)\n ",
