(NASDAQ:HCOM) reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31. The first quarter and recent highlights are as follows:\nRevenue totaled $89.2 million, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $21.8 million.\nConsumer and business strategic revenues (2) increased 1.0 percent year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth from fiber-based strategic services such as video, fiber Internet, and business VoIP.\nTV revenue grew 6.0 percent year-over-year, driven by 7.0 percent subscriber growth. Overall Next-Generation Network (NGN) penetration is over 26 percent, an increase from 24 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nConsumer Internet revenue rose 6.3 percent year-over-year, driven by 2.7 percent overall subscriber growth and 4.5 percent growth in average revenue per user (ARPU).\nBusiness VoIP revenue increased 23.3 percent year-over-year, driven by 16.1 percent growth in business VoIP lines and 5.6 percent growth in ARPU.\nWholesale revenue from high-bandwidth services grew 57.0 percent year-over-year, driven by strong Ethernet growth and trans-Pacific fiber circuit capacity revenue.\nFiber-enabled approximately 1,700 business addresses and 1,000 consumer households in the quarter, bringing total fiber-enabled business addresses to 13,000 and total NGN households on O‘ahu to 207,000.\nIncurred a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the same period in the prior year. The decrease was partially due to a $2.1 million year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of continued investments to expand the Company’s fiber network statewide.\nMerger with Cincinnati Bell received approval from the Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission. The overall regulatory review process is nearing completion, pending final decision from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Integration planning is underway and the merger is expected to close as soon as FCC’s approval is obtained and other customary closing conditions are met.\n“In the first quarter, we continued to invest in our fiber infrastructure, widening the reach of our NGN footprint and expanding our strategic services subscriber base, while enhancing the capabilities and portfolio of products and services we deliver to our consumer, business and wholesale customers,” said Scott K. Barber, Hawaiian Telcom’s president and CEO. “Our fiber investments and state-of-the-art network has helped us transform our company and will position us to capitalize on customers’ growing demand for higher bandwidth and integrated solutions.\n“We are excited about coming together with Cincinnati Bell as we believe the combination will enable us to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and employees. We are actively engaged with Cincinnati Bell in integration planning to ensure a smooth transition for all of our stakeholders and to enable the combined company to realize the full potential of the combination quickly after the transaction closes.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter revenue was $89.2 million, compared to $94.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue growth in the quarter, driven by video, high-bandwidth fiber Internet, business VoIP and trans-Pac capacity, was more than offset by a $2.4 million decrease in low-margin equipment revenue and revenue declines associated with legacy voice and low-bandwidth data services.\nThe Company incurred a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was partially due to a $2.1 million year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of continued investments to expand the Company’s fiber network statewide. Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter was $21.8 million.\nBusiness Revenue\nFirst quarter business revenue totaled $39.1 million, compared to $43.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBusiness VoIP revenue increased 23.3 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by strong demand for Hawaiian Telcom’s hosted voice and fiber data bundle. Demand for the Company’s high-bandwidth fiber Internet products also continued to grow. The number of subscribers on packages with 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps speeds increased 77.8 percent year-over-year. To support this growing demand for bandwidth and increasing cloud adoption, the Company deployed fiber GPON technology to nearly 1,700 additional small business addresses across the islands in the first quarter, increasing the total number of fiber-enabled business addresses to approximately 13,000 as of March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter business strategic revenue was $16.4 million and represented 42 percent of total reported business revenue, compared to 39 percent in the same period a year ago. Growth in high-bandwidth fiber strategic services were offset by lower equipment revenue, declines in legacy copper services, as well as lower ARPU on certain data services due to promotional activities.\nConsumer Revenue\nFirst quarter consumer revenue totaled $33.6 million, down $0.7 million year-over-year and flat sequentially.\nFirst quarter consumer strategic revenue was $18.3 million, up 6.1 percent year-over-year and 2.4 percent sequentially, driven by strong demand for the Company’s fiber-based products. Strategic revenue represented 55 percent of total consumer revenue, up from 50 percent in the same period a year ago.\nVideo services revenue grew 6.0 percent year-over-year to $11.2 million for the first quarter, driven by a 7.0 percent year-over-year subscriber growth. The Company ended the first quarter with over 45,700 video subscribers, 25 percent of which were bulk multi-dwelling unit (MDU) video subscribers on multi-year contracts. When combined with approximately 8,900 additional single-play and double-play non-TV Internet subscribers on our NGN footprint, the penetration rate in our NGN footprint was over 26 percent at the end of the first quarter, an increase from 24 percent in the year-ago period.\nInternet revenue also was up 6.3 percent from the same period a year ago, led by a 2.7 percent year-over-year increase in subscribers and 4.5 percent growth in ARPU. Customer demand and adoption of high-bandwidth premium fiber products continued to outpace subscriber declines in low-bandwidth copper areas. In the first quarter, the number of Internet subscribers on packages with 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps fiber speeds grew 58.3 percent year-over-year.\nRevenue growth from Hawaiian Telcom TV and high-bandwidth fiber Internet services was offset by the year-over-year revenue decline in legacy voice and low-bandwidth copper Internet services.\nWholesale Revenue\nFirst quarter wholesale revenue totaled $13.9 million, up 8.6 percent compared to first quarter 2017, driven by a 57.0 percent year-over-year revenue increase from high-bandwidth, multi-year contract wholesale services including Ethernet, trans-Pacific fiber circuit capacity, and optical transport services. High-bandwidth services represented 40 percent of total wholesale revenue in the first quarter, up from 28 percent in the same period a year ago.\nOperating Expenses\nFirst quarter operating expenses totaled $93.0 million, up $1.0 million compared to first quarter 2017. Operating expenses, exclusive of non-cash and special items which are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA calculation, was $67.4 million, flat year-over-year. Decreased cost of revenues from lower equipment sales were offset by higher video content costs from rising rates and increasing numbers of video subscribers, as well as higher outside contractor maintenance costs in the first quarter.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity\nCapital expenditures totaled $24.3 million for the first quarter 2018, down from $27.2 million in same period in the prior year. Nearly 90 percent of total capital expenditures in the quarter was directed towards growth and expansion initiatives, which included the continued expansion of our fiber network, costs associated with improving our systems, and the success-based spending to support the growth of the Company’s strategic services.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $19.2 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $40.8 million at the end of 2017. The reduction was primarily related to $13.6 million repayment of debt, including installment obligations in the first quarter to simplify our capital structure. Net Debt (3) was $285.9 million, resulting in a Net Leverage Ratio (4) as of March 31, 2018 of 2.9x. Levered Free Cash Flow (5) for the first quarter 2018 was negative $5.9 million.\nConference Call\nDue to the pending merger with Cincinnati Bell, the Company will not host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains information about adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Levered Free Cash Flow.
