REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\nMcCallion takes over as CFO on Tuesday, and Hele is expected to stay at MetLife as senior adviser until September.\nIn 2017 MetLife disclosed two key financial reporting errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate.\nMetLife cut Hele’s total 2017 compensation by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, a change that reflected the insurer’s “performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” the company said in an April 26 proxy statement..\n“I want to thank John Hele for his service as CFO and for bringing a sharper focus on the true economics of the business we write,” MetLife Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in a statement on Tuesday.
