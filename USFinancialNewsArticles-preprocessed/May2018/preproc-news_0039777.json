REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Icahn in a letter to AmTrust’s board said he strongly opposed the going-private deal, which was announced by the company on March 1.\nThe company’s shares jumped more than 10 pct in after-market trading after the stake was disclosed.\nIcahn also said that he wants AmTrust to change the date for the special meeting, which was originally scheduled for June 4.\nAmTrust said on March 1 it would be acquired in a $2.7 billion deal by a group of shareholders including its founding family, chief executive officer and private equity funds.\nReporting by Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
