    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 1:35 AM / in 20 minutes Boca Juniors clinch Argentine Superliga title with 2-2 draw Ramiro Scandolo 2 Min Read\nBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Boca Juniors won the Argentina Superliga title on Wednesday when a 2-2 draw away to Gimnasia y Esgrima gave them an unassailable four-point lead with one round of the championship remaining.\nThe visitors opened the scoring after 12 minutes through Pablo Perez but former Boca player Nicolas Colazo equalised for the home side 20 minutes later.\nThe capital club took the lead again after 57 minutes when Ramon Abila took advantage of a defensive error but Uruguayan Brahian Aleman levelled the scores with a deflected shot nine minutes from time.\nBoca, however, held on for the point, meaning second-place Godoy Cruz can no longer catch them.\n“I’m delighted we have won the championship for the second time in a row,” said striker Carlos Tevez.\n“We deserved it, because we were the best over the whole season.”\nCoach Guillermo Barros Schelotto’s side dominated the championship from the word go, with Cristian Pavon and marksman Dario Benedetto among their star performers as they secured a 33rd league title.
