    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NYSE American: NOG) today announced 2018 first quarter results and increased the company’s full-year 2018 production guidance.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nDaily production exceeded guidance, increasing 35% year-over-year and 7.5% sequentially to average approximately 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”) per day in the first quarter, for a total of 1,619,521 Boe Exited the quarter with 19.0 net wells in process after adding 5.8 net wells to production and 6.5 net wells to the drilling and completing list Raising full year 2018 production guidance; expect average daily production to increase by 26 - 30% over 2017, versus prior guidance of 18 - 22% (estimates do not include the recently announced Salt Creek acquisition) Increased activity is expected to add 22 - 24 net wells to production during 2018, an increase of two net wells versus prior guidance (estimates do not include the recently announced Salt Creek acquisition) Completed a $93.4 million underwritten common stock offering in April 2018; expect to close the previously announced bond exchange agreement and related transactions by May 15, 2018 On April 26, 2018, the company announced a definitive agreement with Salt Creek Oil and Gas, LLC to acquire producing assets and acreage in the core of the Williston Basin\nMANAGEMENT COMMENT\n“We are pleased to announce an excellent quarter as drilling activity and well performance continue to exceed our expectations,” commented Northern’s Interim President, Brandon Elliott. “In addition to strong operational results, we signed a definitive agreement for the largest acquisition in Northern’s history and announced a $497 million bond exchange agreement, which we are working toward closing by May 15th. With our disciplined capital allocation process and record wells coming online, we expect to continue the operational momentum through the rest of the year and further execute on our consolidation strategy.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nThe following tables set forth selected operating and financial data for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Net Production: Oil (Bbl) 1,354,602 1,014,095 34 % Natural Gas and NGLs (Mcf) 1,589,514 1,096,971 45 % Total (Boe) 1,619,521 1,196,924 35 % Average Daily Production: Oil (Bbl) 15,051 11,268 34 % Natural Gas and NGLs (Mcf) 17,661 12,189 45 % Total (Boe) 17,995 13,299 35 % Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Sales: Oil Sales $ 79,143,313 $ 44,339,147 Natural Gas and NGL Sales 7,737,501 4,509,075 Cash Paid on Settled Derivatives (8,130,137 ) (95,659 ) Total Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales Including all Derivative Settlements 78,750,677 48,752,563 Average Sales Prices: Average NYMEX Price (per Bbl) (1) $ 62.89 $ 51.78 Oil Differential (per Bbl) (2) (4.46 ) (8.06 ) Oil (per Bbl) 58.43 43.72 Effect of Loss on Settled Derivatives on Average Price (per Bbl) (6.00 ) (0.09 ) Oil Net of Settled Derivatives (per Bbl) 52.43 43.63 Natural Gas and NGLs (per Mcf) 4.87 4.11 Realized Price on a Boe Basis Including all Realized Derivative Settlements 48.63 40.73 Operating Expenses: Production Expenses $ 12,488,422 $ 11,674,348 Production Taxes 7,922,314 4,461,265 General and Administrative Expense (3) 1,666,875 3,608,943 Depletion, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion 18,630,629 12,828,143 Costs and Expenses (per Boe): Production Expenses $ 7.71 $ 9.75 Production Taxes 4.89 3.73 General and Administrative Expense (3) 1.03 3.02 Depletion, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion 11.50 10.72 Net Income $ 2,965,097 $ 16,940,523 Net Income Per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.27 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (4) $ 11,253,376 $ (69,363 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share – Diluted (4) $ 0.17 $ — Adjusted EBITDA (4) $ 55,957,956 $ 29,638,551 (1) Based on average NYMEX WTI closing prices.\n(2) Average oil price differential to the NYMEX WTI.\n(3) General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were impacted by a $1.2 million reversal of non-cash share based compensation expense in connection with the resignation of a former executive officer.\n(4) Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP Measure.\nGUIDANCE\nNorthern is raising its 2018 annual production guidance range to 18,650 - 19,240 Boe per day, which represents a 26% - 30% increase over 2017 production. As a result of increased activity, Northern now expects to add approximately 22 - 24 net wells to production for the year. In addition, as Northern continues to strengthen and grow its drilling and completing inventory, the company is revising its drilling and completion capital budget to $172 - $187 million, an increase of $20 million over prior guidance, to reflect the growth in our drilling and completing inventory and the additional net wells expected to be completed in 2018. With additional capital allocated to acquisitions, workovers, and other capitalized costs, the total revised capital budget is $185 - $200 million for 2018. These estimates do not include the recently announced Salt Creek acquisition.\nBased on favorable first quarter results, Northern is lowering its 2018 guidance on production expenses and taxes, while maintaining general and administrative expense guidance. With greater than anticipated production growth in North Dakota the company expects an increase in average differentials for the remainder of 2018. Management’s current expectations for operating metrics for 2018 are as follows:\nOperating Expenses Guidance: 2018 Production Expenses (per Boe) $7.75 - $8.75 Production Taxes (% of Oil & Gas Sales) ~ 9.2% General and Administrative Expense (per Boe) $2.00 - $2.50 Average Differential to NYMEX WTI $4.50 - $5.50 CORE WILLISTON BASIN ACQUISITION\nOn April 26, 2018 Northern announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire producing assets and acreage in the core of the Williston Basin in North Dakota for total consideration of $40 million in cash (subject to adjustments) and 6 million shares of Northern common stock. The assets, which are expected to generate approximately $19 million of cash flow from operations in 2018, had estimated February production of 1,380 Boe per day and included 1,319 net acres that are 100% held by production with an average net revenue interest of 86%. The estimated 8.2 net future drilling locations are expected to generate average EURs over 1 million Boe. The company expects the deal to close in early June, and will have an effective date of January 1, 2018. A map of the acquired acreage can be found at: www.northernoil.com/saltcreek .\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES & DRILLING ACTIVITY\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Capital Expenditures Incurred: Drilling, Completion & Capitalized Workover Expense $53.3 million Acreage $2.2 million Other $0.4 million Net Wells Added to Production 5.8 Net Producing Wells (Period-End) 234.7 Net Wells in Process (Period-End) 19.0 Weighted Average AFE for In-Process Wells (Period-End) $7.7 million ACREAGE\nAs of March 31, 2018, Northern controlled a leasehold of approximately 142,075 net acres targeting the Williston Basin Bakken and Three Forks formations. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 92% of the company’s North Dakota acreage position, and approximately 90% of its total acreage position, was developed, held by production or held by operations.\nLIQUIDITY\nAt March 31, 2018, Northern had available liquidity of approximately $189.5 million, comprised of $89.5 million in cash on hand and $100 million of delayed draw term loan availability. This does not include proceeds from the equity capital raise that was completed in early April.\nHEDGING\nNorthern hedges portions of its expected production volumes to increase the predictability of its cash flow and to help maintain a strong financial position. The following table summarizes Northern’s open crude oil derivative contracts scheduled to settle after March 31, 2018.\nSwaps Contract Period Volume (Bbls) Weighted Average Price (per Bbl) 2018: 2Q 829,000 $53.09 3Q 877,200 $55.38 4Q 643,000 $53.54 2019: 1Q 727,200 $54.45 2Q 673,400 $53.93 3Q 524,400 $52.30 4Q 469,200 $52.22 2020: 1Q 445,900 $51.49 2Q 318,500 $50.53 3Q 303,600 $50.37 4Q 303,600 $50.37 2021: 1Q 288,000 $52.72 FIRST QUARTER 2018 EARNINGS RELEASE CONFERENCE CALL\nIn conjunction with Northern’s release of its financial and operating results, investors, analysts and other interested parties are invited to listen to a conference call with management on Monday, May 7, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.\nThose wishing to listen to the conference call may do so via the company’s website, www.northernoil.com , or by phone as follows:\nDial-In Number: (855) 638-5677 (US/Canada) and (262) 912-4762 (International)\nConference ID: 4991368 - Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding Northern’s financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, industry conditions, and indebtedness covenant compliance are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “target,” “could,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “goal,” “will,” “should,” “may” or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond Northern’s control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, the pace of drilling and completions activity on Northern’s properties, Northern’s ability to acquire additional development opportunities, changes in Northern’s reserves estimates or the value thereof, general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which Northern conducts business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, Northern’s ability to consummate any transaction with its bondholders, including the final terms of any such transaction, which could result in the issuance of a significant amount of equity, Northern’s ability to raise or access capital, including as a condition to any transaction with its bondholders, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting Northern’s operations, products, services and prices.\nNorthern has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Northern’s control. Northern does not undertake any duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the federal securities laws.\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (UNAUDITED) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 REVENUES Oil, Natural Gas, and NGL Sales $ 86,880,814 $ 48,848,222 Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments, Net (20,271,451 ) 16,960,883 Other Revenue 4,100 7,742 Total Revenues 66,613,463 65,816,847 OPERATING EXPENSES Production Expenses 12,488,422 11,674,348 Production Taxes 7,922,314 4,461,265 General and Administrative Expenses 1,666,875 3,608,943 Depletion, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion 18,630,629 12,828,143 Total Operating Expenses 40,708,240 32,572,699 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 25,905,223 33,244,148 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Interest Expense, Net of Capitalization (23,106,761 ) (16,303,805 ) Other Income 166,635 180 Total Other Income (Expense) (22,940,126 ) (16,303,625 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 2,965,097 16,940,523 INCOME TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT) — — NET INCOME $ 2,965,097 $ 16,940,523 Net Income Per Common Share – Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.28 Net Income Per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.27 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding – Basic 65,215,148 61,446,156 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding – Diluted 65,382,772 61,972,123 CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS MARCH 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017 March 31, 2018\n(unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017 ASSETS Current Assets: Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 89,472,745 $ 102,183,191 Accounts Receivable, Net 51,284,262 46,851,682 Advances to Operators 3,023,851 604,977 Prepaid and Other Expenses 2,454,565 2,333,288 Income Tax Receivable 785,016 785,016 Total Current Assets 147,020,439 152,758,154 Property and Equipment: Oil and Natural Gas Properties, Full Cost Method of Accounting Proved 2,641,517,632 2,585,490,133 Unproved 1,578,767 1,699,344 Other Property and Equipment 1,003,388 981,303 Total Property and Equipment 2,644,099,787 2,588,170,780 Less – Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Impairment (2,133,433,050 ) (2,114,951,189 ) Total Property and Equipment, Net 510,666,737 473,219,591 Deferred Income Taxes (Note 9) 785,000 785,000 Other Noncurrent Assets, Net 5,998,270 5,490,934 Total Assets $ 664,470,446 $ 632,253,679 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable $ 95,148,543 $ 93,152,297 Accrued Expenses 6,607,642 6,339,425 Accrued Interest 18,839,931 4,836,112 Derivative Instruments 26,796,245 18,681,891 Asset Retirement Obligations 550,443 565,521 Total Current Liabilities 147,942,804 123,575,246 Long-term Debt, Net 980,782,714 979,324,222 Derivative Instruments 15,523,889 11,496,929 Asset Retirement Obligations 8,869,762 8,562,607 Other Noncurrent Liabilities 127,761 135,225 Total Liabilities $ 1,153,246,930 $ 1,123,094,229 Commitments and Contingencies (Note 8) STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Preferred Stock, Par Value $.001; 5,000,000 Authorized, No Shares Outstanding — — Common Stock, Par Value $.001; 142,500,000 Authorized (3/31/2018 – 65,937,945\nShares Outstanding and 12/31/2017 – 66,791,633 Shares Outstanding) 65,938 66,792 Additional Paid-In Capital 448,766,213 449,666,390 Retained Deficit (937,608,635 ) (940,573,732 ) Total Stockholders’ Deficit (488,776,484 ) (490,840,550 ) TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT $ 664,470,446 $ 632,253,679 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Northern defines Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) excluding (gain) loss on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments, net of tax. Northern defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, (iv) (gain) loss on the mark-to-market of derivative instruments and (v) non-cash share based compensation expense. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of current financial performance. Specifically, management believes the non-GAAP results included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized derivatives gains and losses that management believes are not indicative of Northern’s core operating results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring Northern’s performance, and management believes it is providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to its internal measurement processes.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income $ 2,965,097 $ 16,940,523 Add: Impact of Selected Items: (Gain) Loss on the Mark-to-Market of Derivative Instruments 12,141,314 (17,056,542 ) Selected Items, Before Income Taxes 12,141,314 (17,056,542 ) Income Tax of Selected Items (1) (3,853,035 ) 46,656 Selected Items, Net of Income Taxes 8,288,279 (17,009,886 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) $ 11,253,376 $ (69,363 ) Weighted Average Shares Outstanding – Basic 65,215,148 61,446,156 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding – Diluted 65,382,772 61,972,123 Net Income Per Common Share – Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.28 Add: Impact of Selected Items, Net of Income Taxes 0.12 (0.28 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share – Basic $ 0.17 $ — Net Income Per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.27 Add: Impact of Selected Items, Net of Income Taxes 0.12 (0.27 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share – Diluted $ 0.17 $ — (1) For the 2018 column, this represents a tax impact using an estimated tax rate of 25.5%, which includes a $0.8 million adjustment for a reduction in valuation allowance for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
