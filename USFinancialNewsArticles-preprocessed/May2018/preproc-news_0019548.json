    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE:TRNO), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, acquired an industrial property located in Renton, Washington on May 7, 2018 for a purchase price of approximately $6.0 million.\nThe property consists of one industrial distribution building containing approximately 39,000 square feet on approximately 2.3 acres adjacent to the intersection of Interstate 405 and Highway 167 in the northern Kent Valley. The property is at 2701 East Valley Road, provides four dock-high and three grade-level loading positions, parking for 42 cars and is 100% leased to one tenant. The estimated stabilized cap rate of the property is 5.2%.\nEstimated stabilized cap rates are calculated as annualized cash basis net operating income stabilized to market occupancy (generally 95%) divided by total acquisition cost. Total acquisition cost includes the initial purchase price, the effects of marking assumed debt to market, buyer’s due diligence and closing costs, estimated near-term capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to achieve stabilization.\nTerreno Realty Corporation acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C.\nAdditional information about Terreno Realty Corporation is available on the company’s web site at www.terreno.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
