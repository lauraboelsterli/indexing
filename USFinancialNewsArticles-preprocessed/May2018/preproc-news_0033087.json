In his new role, Brandon will work to enable EY’s innovative impact in the market by leveraging offerings such as those presented through the recent acquisition of Citizen , a Portland-based strategic digital design firm.

He currently serves on the Board of Directors and is the Incoming Board Chair for Rosemary Anderson High School and POIC, which aims to reconnect at-risk youth with career training through work opportunity training programs. He previously served on the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children board of Multnomah and Washington counties for 10 years.\nA native Portlandian, Brandon lives in Lake Oswego with his wife and two college-bound children.
