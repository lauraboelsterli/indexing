    "text": "EVANSTON, Ill., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fidus Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:FDUS) (“Fidus” or the “Company”), a provider of customized debt and equity financing solutions, primarily to lower middle-market companies based in the United States, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal investment income of $18.2 million Net investment income of $7.4 million, or $0.30 per share Adjusted net investment income of $8.9 million, or $0.36 per share (1) Net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $15.0 million, or $0.61 per share Invested $60.9 million in debt and equity securities, including five new portfolio companies Received proceeds from repayments and realizations of $36.1 million Paid regular quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share on March 23, 2018 Net asset value (NAV) of $398.2 million, or $16.28 per share, as of March 31, 2018\nManagement Commentary\n“In the first quarter, our diverse investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating adjusted net investment income of $8.9 million, an 8.7% increase over the prior year. We were particularly pleased with the underlying performance of our equity portfolio, which generated $7.3 million in capital gains,” said Edward Ross, Chairman and CEO of Fidus Investment Corporation. “As a result, our per share net asset value rose by 1.4% to $16.28 from 2017 year-end. Deal activity remained healthy, as expected, and we closed investments totaling $60.9 million, including five new portfolio companies, while we received repayments totaling $36.1 million. Looking forward, Fidus remains well positioned to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in high quality companies that have high free cash flows, strong yet defensible market positions and positive long-term outlooks.”\n(1) Supplemental information regarding adjusted net investment income:\nOn a supplemental basis, we provide information relating to adjusted net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income. Adjusted net investment income represents net investment income excluding any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses. The management agreement with our advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to cumulative realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized losses. In addition, we accrue, but do not pay, a capital gains incentive fee in connection with any unrealized capital appreciation, as appropriate. As such, we believe that adjusted net investment income is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any capital gains incentive fee expense or (reversal) attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of net investment income to adjusted net investment income are set forth in Schedule 1.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe following table provides a summary of our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Interest income $ 14,735 $ 13,089 $ 1,646 12.6 % Payment-in-kind interest income 1,679 1,659 20 1.2 % Dividend income 338 658 (320 ) (48.6 %) Fee income 1,437 782 655 83.8 % Interest on idle funds and other income 44 40 4 10.0 % Total investment income $ 18,233 $ 16,228 $ 2,005 12.4 % Net investment income $ 7,377 $ 7,859 $ (482 ) (6.1 %) Net investment income per share $ 0.30 $ 0.35 $ (0.05 ) (14.3 %) Adjusted net investment income (1) $ 8,907 $ 8,194 $ 713 8.7 % Adjusted net investment income per share (1) $ 0.36 $ 0.37 $ (0.01 ) (2.7 %) Net increase in net assets resulting from operations $ 15,025 $ 9,532 $ 5,493 57.6 % Net increase in net assets resulting from operations per share $ 0.61 $ 0.42 $ 0.19 45.2 %\nThe $2.0 million increase in total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily attributable to (i) a $1.7 million increase in total interest income resulting from higher average debt investment balances outstanding, partially offset by a small decrease in weighted average debt yield and one additional portfolio company on non-accrual status, (ii) a $0.7 million increase in fee income resulting from a higher level of structuring fees earned due to a comparative increase in new investments, as well as an increase in prepayment fees, and (iii) a $(0.3) million decrease in dividend income from equity investments.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total expenses, including income tax provision, were $10.9 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 29.7%, from the $8.4 million of total expenses, including income tax provision, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) a $1.2 million increase in the capital gains incentive fee accrued, (ii) a $0.5 million increase in interest and financing expenses due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding, and (iii) a $0.6 million increase in base management and income incentive fees due to higher average total assets and higher pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nNet investment income decreased by $(0.5) million, or (6.1)%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, as a result of the $2.0 million increase in total investment income and offset by the $2.5 million increase in total expenses, including income tax provision. Adjusted net investment income (1) , which excludes the capital gains incentive fee accrual, increased by $0.7 million, or 8.7%, due to the $2.0 million increase in total investment income, which exceeded the $1.3 million increase in total expenses, excluding the accrued capital gains incentive fee.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the total net realized gain on investments, net of income tax provision on realized gains, was $5.5 million, as compared to total net realized gain on investments, net of income tax provision on realized gains, of $5.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net change in unrealized appreciation of $2.1 million, as compared to net change in unrealized (depreciation) of $(3.4) million for the same period in 2017.\nPortfolio and Investment Activities\nAs of March 31, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $632.2 million and consisted of 63 active portfolio companies and three portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. Our total portfolio investments at fair value were approximately 103.4% of the related cost basis as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, three debt investments bore interest at a variable rate, which represented $26.2 million of our portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate investments. As of March 31, 2018, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was $9.7 million, which excludes investments in the three portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. The weighted average yield on debt investments as of March 31, 2018 was 12.7%. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for debt investments at cost as of March 31, 2018, including the accretion of OID and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any.\nFirst quarter 2018 investment activity included the following new portfolio company investments:\nAVC Investors, LLC (dba Auveco), a provider of fasteners and autobody hardware to the automotive aftermarket and general industrial markets. Fidus invested $19.5 million in second lien debt and common equity.\nB&B Roadway and Security Solutions, LLC, a leading manufacturer of traffic control and perimeter security solutions. Fidus invested $10.5 million in second lien debt and common equity and made a commitment for up to $0.1 million of additional common equity.\nCRS Solutions Holdings, LLC (dba CRS Texas), a technology-enabled provider of comprehensive point-of-sale solutions to the hospitality end market. Fidus invested $9.8 million in second lien debt and common equity.\nSpendMend LLC, a leading provider of spend visibility and audit recovery services to the healthcare industry. Fidus invested $11.0 million in second lien debt and common equity.\nThe Tranzonic Companies, a value-added supplier of disposable maintenance, cleaning, personal care and safety products to the \"away-from-home\" marketplace. Fidus invested $6.1 million in subordinated debt, preferred equity and common equity.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had investments in two portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which had an aggregate cost and fair value of $18.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $32.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $50.0 million of unused capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2018, we had SBA debentures outstanding of $214.5 million and $50.0 million outstanding of our 5.875% notes due 2023 (the “Public Notes”). As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.796%.\nSubsequent Events\nOn April 3, 2018, we invested $7.8 million in subordinated debt and common equity of UBEO, LLC, a premier provider of printer, copier, and related office equipment sales and services.\nOn April 12, 2018, we invested $12.0 million in second lien debt, preferred equity and common equity of Power Grid Components, Inc., a supplier of high quality, mission critical products used in the North American electric power grid.\nOn April 19, 2018, we exited our debt investment in Allied 100 Group, Inc. We received payment in full of $13.0 million on our subordinated debt.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Dividend of $0.39 Per Share Declared\nOn April 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2018, payable on June 22, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 8, 2018.\nWhen declaring dividends, our Board of Directors reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which differs from consolidated income under generally accepted accounting principles due to (i) changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii) the amount of undistributed taxable income carried over from a given year for distribution in the following year. The final determination of 2018 taxable income, as well as the tax attributes for 2018 dividends, will be made after the close of the 2018 tax year. The final tax attributes for 2018 dividends will generally include ordinary taxable income but may also include capital gains, qualified dividends and return of capital.\nFidus has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when we declare a cash dividend, stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP at least two days prior to the dividend payment date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the operating and financial results at 9:00am ET on Friday, May 4, 2018.
