    "text": "10 massive corporations going big on solar power Share Anmar Frangoul 9 Hours Ago\nAmerican businesses are investing record amounts in solar, with the top corporate users adding 325 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity last year, according to the \"Solar Means Business 2017\" report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).\nThe impact of corporate solar is significant: the solar installations analyzed in the SEIA report produce enough electricity to power 402,000 U.S. homes and offset 2.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. Here, CNBC's Sustainable Energy looks at the top 10 corporations in the U.S. by their installed capacity of solar power. 10. Amazon.com — 33.6 MW\nIt's not only solar power that Amazon in embracing. Last year, the business announced that its largest wind farm to date, Amazon Wind Farm Texas, was up and running. The facility, located in Scurry County, has more than 100 turbines and will add one million megawatt hours of clean energy to the grid each year. Lisa Werner | Moment Mobile | Getty Images 9. Macy's — 38.9 MW\nAs well as having installed almost 40 MW of solar capacity, Macy's wants to increase the amount of its waste diverted from landfills to 70 percent by this year. Bruce Leighty | Photolibrary | Getty Images 8. IKEA — 44.9 MW\nBy 2020, the IKEA Group wants to produce as much renewable energy as it consumes in its operations. On its website, the business says it wants to source all its wood from more sustainable sources, also by 2020. Steve Proehl | Corbis Documentary | Getty Images 7. General Growth Properties — 50.2 MW\nReal estate business General Growth Properties describes sustainability as \"an integral component of GGP's long-term success.\" Raymond Boyd | Michael Ochs Archives | Getty Images 6.

Apple — 79.4 MW\nTech giant Apple places fourth in the SEIA's list. Earlier this year, Apple announced that its global facilities were powered by 100 percent clean energy. CEO Tim Cook described the development as a significant milestone for the business. Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty Images 3. Prologis — 120.7 MW\nThird placed Prologis has a little under 121 MW of installed capacity, according to the SEIA's report. The business is targeting a 20 percent cut in corporate greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, from a 2011 baseline. Gina Ferazzi | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images 2. Walmart — 149.4 MW\nWith just under 150 MW of solar capacity installed Walmart grabs second place in the SEIA's list.
