(NASDAQ:ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, equipment and accessories for young men and women, today announced, that total net sales for the four-week period ended May 5, 2018 increased 3.7% to $58.6 million, compared to $56.5 million for the four-week period ended April 29, 2017. The Company's comparable sales increased 1.7% for the four-week period ended May 5, 2018 compared to a comparable sales increase of 7.8% for the four-week period ended April 29, 2017.\nBased on higher than anticipated sales, we now expect our first quarter 2018 operating profit margin to be between negative 1.3% and negative 1.5% of sales, compared to our previous guidance range of negative 1.7% to negative 2.6%. In addition, we believe that earnings per share will be at the high end of our previously disclosed range or slightly better due to the timing and location of income and the associated tax expense.\nTo hear the Zumiez prerecorded April sales message, please dial (201) 689-8483 or (877) 523-5612, followed by the passcode # 986439 (ZUMIEZ).\nAbout Zumiez Inc.\nZumiez is a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods for young men and women who want to express their individuality through the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear, and other unique lifestyles.
