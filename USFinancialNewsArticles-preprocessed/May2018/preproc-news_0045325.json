    "text": "Mitch Haniger’s run-scoring double in the seventh inning capped a five-run rally as the Seattle Mariners defeated the visiting Detroit Tigers 5-4 Friday night at Safeco Field.\nDan Altavilla (3-2) pitched one inning in relief of Felix Hernandez, Juan Nicasio worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Edwin Diaz earned his American League-leading 15th save, striking out pinch hitter Mikie Mahtook for the final out.\nTrailing 4-0, the Mariners scored all of their runs in the seventh.\nTigers right-hander Michael Fulmer, who had allowed just two hits in blanking Seattle through the first six innings, walked Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager leading off the seventh. The runners advanced on a groundout, and Ben Gamel grounded a two-run single to right field, cutting Detroit’s lead in half.\nRight-hander Buck Farmer (0-2) replaced Fulmer and walked Mike Zunino and Guillermo Heredia to load the bases. Left-hander Daniel Stumpf came on to face Dee Gordon, who hit a sacrifice fly to right field to make it 4-3.\nRight-hander Warwick Saupold, who got the victory in Thursday night’s series opener, was called on by manager Ron Gardenhire to face Jean Segura. The move backfired as Segura grounded a single to center field to score Zunino from second and tie it at 4-4. Haniger then doubled into the left-field corner to give Seattle its first lead.\nThe Tigers scored three runs in the top of the first off Hernandez, the longtime Seattle ace.\nWith two outs, Nicholas Castellanos lined a single to left field and Victor Martinez walked. John Hicks then lined a 3-2 pitch for a two-run double to center field. Niko Goodrum followed with a run-scoring double to center to make it 3-0.\nThe Tigers tacked on a run in the fifth. Leonys Martin, making his return from the disabled list, reached on an error by Mariners first baseman Ryon Healy and scored on a two-out double by Martinez.\nHernandez allowed four runs (three earned) on six hits in six innings. He walked three and struck out four. Fulmer gave up three runs on three hits in 6 1/3 innings, with two walks and seven strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
