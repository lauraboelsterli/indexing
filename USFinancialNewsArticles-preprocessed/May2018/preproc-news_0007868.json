Interest and fee income decreased by $19.01 million, or 53.5%, to $16.53 million from $35.54 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in interest and fee income was mainly due to reduced interest rates this year as a result of competitive pressure and the significant decrease in interest received on certain supply chain financing loans related to certain customers who were facing financial difficulties. Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $55.47 million, or net loss of $3.20 per diluted share for 2017. This compared to net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $16.95 million, or net income of $0.77 per diluted share, for 2016. Loans receivable, net of provision for loan losses, was $117.26 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $148.29 million at the end of 2016. Provision for loan losses was $55.30 million for 2017, compared to $4.65 million for 2016. The increase was mainly related to certain overdue loans as certain customers particularly tire supply chain financing customers were facing financial difficulties during 2017.\nJingping Li, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of China Lending, commented, \"Our 2017 financial results highlighted increasing headwinds facing the micro lending industry as the industry growth momentum slowed and competition heated up during the year. Our 2017 financial results were also adversely affected by financial difficulties at certain supply chain financing customers that led to significant decrease in our total interest and fee income, dramatic increase in provisions for loan losses and quickly deteriorating cash flow situation. We are closely monitoring the situation at those customers and expect further impact on our business as additional loans become due over time based on management's current assessment.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nInterest and fee income\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, total interest and fee income, which include interest and fees on direct lending loans, financial advisory fees and interest on deposits with banks, decreased by $19.01 million, or 53.5%, to $16.53 million from $35.54 million for the same period of last year.\nThe decrease in interest and fee income was mainly due to reduced interest rates this year as a result of competitive pressure and the significant decrease in monthly interest received during the period on certain supply chain financing loans related to certain customers who were facing financial difficulties. We are closely monitoring the situation at those customers and expect further impact on our business as additional loans become due over time based on management's current assessment.\nInterest expense\nThe Company borrows funds, which include short-term bank loans, a secured loan and loans from cost investment investee, to fund its direct lending business. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, total interest expense increased by $2.39 million, or 48.0%, to $7.37 million from $4.98 million for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly related to interest penalty from overdue loans.\nProvision for loan losses\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, provision for loan losses was $55.30 million, compared to $4.65 million for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly related to certain overdue loans as certain customers particularly tire supply chain financing customers were facing financial difficulties during 2017 which caused increased provision percentages.\nNet interest income/ (loss)\nAfter deducting for interest expense and provision for loan losses, net interest loss was $46.14 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net interest income of $25.92 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in total interest income and an increase in provision for loan losses.\nNon-interest expenses\nSalaries and employee surcharge for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $0.46 million, or 36.4%, to $0.81 million from $1.27 million for the same period of last year. Business taxes and other taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $0.55 million, or 79.4%, to $0.14 million from $0.69 million for the same period of last year.

Investment impairment incurred $3.70 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As a result, total non-interest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $2.08 million, or 44.9%, to $6.70 million from $4.62 million for the same period of last year, which mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the decrease in employee expenses due to departure of certain employees in the period; (2) the decrease in business tax and other taxes in line with the decrease in total interest income; and (3) the decrease in expenses related to travel, entertainment and other professional activities as a result of headcount reduction.\nIncome/ (loss) before income tax, net income/ (loss) and EPS\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, loss before income tax was $52.03 million, compared to income before tax of $21.40 million for the same period of last year. Income tax expenses was $2.75 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to income tax expense of $4.12 million for the same period of last year.\nAs a result of the above, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $54.78 million, compared to net income of $17.28 million for the same period of last year.

The Company issued 309 loans which aggregated to $192.63 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 459 loans which aggregated to $331.72 million for the same period of last year. Supply chain financing was the largest segment, accounting for 46.5% of total loan amount with 103 loans issued for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Commerce and service was the second largest segment, accounting for 39.8% of total loan amount with 175 loans issued for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.22 million, compared to $4.50 million at the end of 2016. Net loans receivable was $117.26 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $148.29 million as of December 31, 2016. Short-term bank loans, loans from a cost investment investee, and secured loans were $11.97 million, $15.37 million and $15.34 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, compared to $7.47 million, $14.40 and $14.15 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nThe net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $13.53 million to $9.90 million, comparing with $23.43 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was mainly result from our supply chain finance customers have difficulties in repaying the loans due to the market pressure.\nThe capital liquidity of the Company was also influenced consequently due to a decrease in cash inflows provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2017, $11.97 million short-term bank loans and $15.37 million loans from a cost investment investee were overdue.\nThe Company's operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to maintain profitability and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses in line with revenue forecasts, the company may not be able to maintain profitability.\nThe Company's accounts have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern basis. The going concern basis assumes that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed in the financial statements. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern depends upon aligning its sources of funding (debt and equity) with the expenditure requirements of the Company and repayment of the debt facilities as and when they fall due.\nRecent Update\nOn January 16, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from Xinjiang superior people's court. China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. sued the Company and its guarantors for a default on the loan, plus penalties. The case is in the process. The Company is actively negotiating with China Great Wall Assets Management Co, Ltd. regarding the debt restructuring.\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company filed a registration statement on Form F-3 statement with the SEC. The registration statement was declared effective on March 22, 2018.\nAbout China Lending Corporation\nFounded in 2009, China Lending is a non-bank direct lending corporation and provides services to micro, small and medium sized enterprises, farmers, and individuals, who are currently underserved by commercial banks in China.
