    "text": "(Takeda spokesman corrects comment on number of votes needed for proposal to pass to two thirds from half in 3rd paragraph)\nTOKYO, May 29 (Reuters) - Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd faces demands from disgruntled shareholders to put to a vote its $62-billion acquisition of London-listed Shire and do more to assuage concerns over the record-breaking deal.\nThe deal “carries overly high risks to the company”, 12 shareholders said in a proposal to be voted on at next month’s annual meeting of shareholders, adding that new shares to be issued to fund the deal threaten “a danger of causing a great disadvantage to existing shareholders”.\nThe Shire deal and any future deals worth more than 1 trillion yen ($9.19 billion) should be put to a shareholder vote, says the proposal - which will need two thirds of the votes at the meeting to pass, according to a Takeda spokesman.\nTakeda’s board of directors opposes the proposal, according to the company’s notice of convocation that contained the proposal.\nThe drugmaker already plans to put the Shire deal to a vote at an extraordinary general meeting.
