Operating costs and expenses for the asset management business for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB84.9 million (US$13.5 million), a 78.1% increase from the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in investment sub-advisory fees and a decrease in government subsidies.

This estimate reflects management's current business outlook and is subject to change.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nSenior management will host a combined English and Chinese language conference call to discuss the Company's first quarter 2018 unaudited financial results and recent business activities.\nThe conference call may be accessed with the following details:\nConference call details\nDate/Time:\nTuesday, May 29, 2018 at 8:00 p.m., U.S. Eastern Time\nWednesday, May 30, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., Hong Kong Time\nDial in details:\n- United States Toll Free\n+1-866-311-7654\n- Mainland China Toll Free\n4001-201203\n- Hong Kong Toll Free\n800-905-945\n- International\n+1-412-317-5227\nConference Title:\nNoah Holdings Limited First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call\nParticipant Password:\nNoah Holdings\nA telephone replay will be available starting one hour after the end of the conference call until June 5, 2018 at +1-877-344-7529 (US Toll Free) or +1-412-317-0088 (International Toll). The replay access code is 10120296.\nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at Noah's investor relations website under the News & Events section at http://ir.noahwm.com .\nDISCUSSION OF RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD AND NON-GAAP MEASURES\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires that equity investments, except for those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee, be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nThe accounting standard also includes a transition requirement on presentation that requires the amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income for equity securities that exist as of the date of adoption previously classified as available-for-sale to be reclassified to retained earnings.\nAs a result, upon adoption of this new standard, Noah recorded a cumulative effect adjustment from other comprehensive income to retained earnings of RMB251.6 million (US$38.7 million), net of tax, for the unrealized gains related to equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale securities. This adjustment had no overall impact on shareholders' equity; however, since these net unrealized gains are now included within retained earnings, they will not appear as realized gains on Noah's consolidated income statement when sold.\nThe future impact to Noah's consolidated income statement from period to period will vary depending upon the level of volatility in the performance of the securities held in Noah's equity portfolio and the overall market. ASU 2016-01 does not affect the treatment of equity investments accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee.\nIn addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effects of all forms of share-based compensation and fair value changes of equity investments (unrealized) and adjusting for sale of equity securities, if any. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be prepared differently from and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWhen evaluating the Company's operating performance in the periods presented, management reviewed the foregoing non-GAAP net income attributable to Noah shareholders and per diluted ADS and non-GAAP net margin attributable to Noah shareholders to supplement U.S. GAAP financial data. As such, the Company's management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its results of operations in a manner consistent with that used by management.\nABOUT NOAH HOLDINGS LIMITED\nNoah Holdings Limited (NYSE: NOAH) is a leading wealth and asset management service provider in China with a focus on global investment and asset allocation services for high net worth individuals and enterprises.
