Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Watford - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - March 17, 2018 Liverpool's Roberto Firmino and Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp before the match REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBrazil international Firmino, who has scored 27 goals and provided 16 assists in 50 games this season, has signed a long-term contract at the Merseyside club.\n\"It's unbelievably important news for us. Really cool,\" Klopp told Liverpool's website www.liverpoolfc.com . \"This is one very important step for us. Absolutely. But even Roberto cannot play alone.\n“In the moment every player knows about our plans. He’s the first but for sure he won’t be the last.”\nBritish media reported that new deals are in the pipeline for Liverpool forwards Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah along with defenders Ragnar Klavan and Alberto Moreno.\nThe goals of Salah, Firmino and Mane have helped Liverpool up to third in the league table and into the Champions League semi-finals.\nThey travel to AS Roma for the second leg on Wednesday with a 5-2 advantage before a league trip to Chelsea on Sunday.
