REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n“Thomson Reuters has commenced the process of applying to the Central Bank of Ireland for authorization to operate its FX Multilateral Trading Facility from Dublin rather than London as a result of the UK’s planned departure from the European Union,” it said.\n“It is our intention to transfer all existing client relationships of the Thomson Reuters MTF and Dealing, as well as Fixed Income Callouts and Auctions, from RTSL to our new Irish legal entity ahead of the Brexit date.”\nThomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News.
