    "text": "PayPal shares rallied on news it plans to acquire Swedish payment company iZettle, and all signs point to this as a smart move.\nEven though the price tag is expensive — a hefty $2.2 billion — this helps solidify PayPal as end-to-end payments solution as retail shoppers continue moving online and payments are made increasingly on mobile phones.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nThis should also put to bed the rumors that PayPal was going to buy Square — and instead will now be a stiff competitor.\nWhere PayPal now stands PayPal is a leader in the move to digital, and more importantly mobile payments, across the globe. It has a technology platform that includes Venmo and other payment services which allow customers and merchants to quickly, easily and safely execute transactions. The company also already has a wide reach, with over 225 million active accounts executing over 2.2 billion transactions per quarter in over 200 countries.\nGaining an edge IZettle will likely provide small point-of-sale devices that attach to mobile phones to businesses that are offline. It is similar to the U.S.-based Square.\nThe acquisition will help PayPal expand its point-of-sale business in the small and medium business market, and gives PayPal exposure to some additional markets in which they do not already have a strong presence.\nDisclosure: Binger's firm, Gradient Investments, owns PayPal in its portfolios; Binger does not own the stock personally.",
