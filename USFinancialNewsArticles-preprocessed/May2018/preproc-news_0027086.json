    "text": "LEXINGTON, Mass., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a biotechnology company devoted to development of next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases, announced the hiring of David McMullin to the newly created position of Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy. Mr. McMullin will be responsible for leading Aldeyra's commercial planning, corporate development, and business development efforts.\n\"We are pleased to welcome David to the Aldeyra team,\" commented Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra. \"David's arrival highlights the evolution of Aldeyra towards a pre-commercial enterprise, and we believe his leadership in the launch, management, and growth of multi-billion-dollar franchises and divisions will add tremendous value to Aldeyra as we work towards our strategic goal of becoming a diversified company focused on immunological disease.\"\nMr. McMullin brings extensive experience leading business development, strategic planning, commercial and operational activities in the biopharmaceutical industry. Prior to joining Aldeyra, Mr. McMullin most recently served as the Group Vice President of the $1.4 billion U.S. Internal Medicines franchise at Shire plc where he led sales, marketing, and business operations for the U.S. rare disease and specialty products business. Previously, he was Vice President of the Commercial Center of Excellence at Shire, responsible for commercial operations worldwide. Prior to joining Shire, Mr. McMullin was the Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Strategy at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics (now part of GlaxoSmithKline plc), where he led a successful operational turnaround followed by an asset swap divestiture between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline plc. He also held management positions in marketing, sales, and corporate strategy at Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Novartis International, divisions of Novartis AG. Mr. McMullin received a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University, and a Bachelor of Science degree from Brigham Young University.\nAbout Aldeyra Therapeutics\nAldeyra Therapeutics is developing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases. Aldeyra's lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease and other forms of ocular inflammation.

None of Aldeyra's product candidates have been approved for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Aldeyra's strategy, future operations, future, prospects, plans, and objectives. Aldeyra intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
