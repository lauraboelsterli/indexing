    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Cyber security firm Avast ( AVST.L ) shares were down 2.6 percent in early trade on Thursday in the London Stock Exchangeâ€™s biggest debut in almost a year.\nThe logo of Avast Software company is seen at its headquarters in Prague, Czech Republic, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/David W Cerny Priced at 250 pence per share, the private equity-backed firm was trading at 243.5 pence as of 0801 GMT.\nBankers typically price initial public offerings (IPOs) aiming for a slight rise in the first days of trading.\nThe company had set the offer at the bottom end of its guidance, having already reduced the expected price range, in a market in which scores of IPOs have been canceled.\nThe offer size of $816.6 million included gross proceeds of approximately $200 million and represented around 25 percent of the shares of the company. It was the biggest IPO on the LSE since July 2017.\nBased on the offer price, the company had a market capitalization of 2.4 billion pounds.\nAvast is 46 percent-owned by its founders, Czech entrepreneurs Pavel Baudis and Eduard Kucera.\nCVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] has a 29 percent stake and Summit Partners hold 7 percent.\nIn 2017, Avast reported adjusted cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $451 million on adjusted revenue of $780 million.\nMorgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSG.S ) led the transaction.\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva; editing by Clara Denina and Jason Neely\n ",
