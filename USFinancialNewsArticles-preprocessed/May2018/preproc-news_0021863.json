Additionally, our wealth management business grew assets under management by 15% to $12.7 billion and total assets under administration by 10% to $43.9 billion.”\nSummary Financial Performance: Q1 2018\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\nQ1 Q1 2018 2017 Change Revenue $ 206.0 $ 182.4 13 % Wealth Management $ 92.1 $ 82.7 11 % Tax Preparation $ 113.9 $ 99.7 14 % Segment Income $ 71.9 $ 65.0 11 % Wealth Management $ 13.1 $ 11.9 10 % Tax Preparation $ 58.8 $ 53.1 11 % Unallocated Corporate Operating Expenses $ (5.5 ) $ (6.8 ) (18 )% GAAP: Operating Income $ 52.7 $ 43.9 20 % Net Income Attributable to Blucora, Inc. $ 45.3 $ 30.6 48 % Diluted Net Income Per Share Attributable to Blucora, Inc.

Tax Season Update\nClendening continued, “Our tax preparation business had a strong tax season. In the third year of a multi-year pivot to focus on profitable customers, while total units, including free, declined as expected, I’m pleased to report a return to growth in paid units, as well as continued growth in average revenue per user. Based on these results we now expect full first-half 2018 tax revenue growth of approximately 15% versus the comparable period last year, well ahead of our previous outlook range of 8-10%.”\n“This season we significantly enhanced our mobile experience, moved to the cloud, and improved our customer support capabilities. In addition, this season we launched our BluPrint TM financial assessment which turns insights from a customer’s tax return into actionable recommendations to improve their financial lives. We have been encouraged by the customer adoption of BluPrint this year as well the progress of the associated partnerships in our inaugural year of the program,” Clendening concluded.\n(in thousands except %s) Tax seasons ended April 19, 2018 April 18, 2017 % change Consumer: Online e-files 3,432 3,958 (13 )% Desktop e-files 152 184 (17 )% Sub-total e-files 3,584 4,142 (13 )% Free File Alliance e-files 188 164 15 % Total consumer e-files 3,772 4,306 (12 )% Professional tax preparer: E-files 1,763 1,717 3 % Total e-files (consumer and preparer) 5,535 6,023 (8 )% Tax season begins on the first day that the IRS begins accepting e-files and ends on tax day +1.

Restructuring costs relate to the relocation of our corporate headquarters during 2017.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for internal management and compensation purposes, when publicly providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance, that it provides a more complete understanding of the results of operations and trends affecting our business when viewed together with GAAP results, and that management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant and necessary components to the operations of our business and, therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and, therefore, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Blucora, Inc., determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including acquired technology), accelerated accretion of debt discount on our Convertible Senior Notes that were outstanding for a portion of 2017 (the \"Notes\" ), restructuring costs (described further under Adjusted EBITDA above), the impact of noncontrolling interests, the related cash tax impact of those adjustments, and non-cash income taxes. We exclude the non-cash portion of income taxes because of our ability to offset a substantial portion of our cash tax liabilities by using deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of U.S. federal net operating losses. The majority of these net operating losses will expire, if unutilized, between 2020 and 2024.\nWe believe that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provide meaningful supplemental information to management, investors, and analysts regarding our performance and the valuation of our business by excluding items in the statement of operations that we do not consider part of our ongoing operations or have not been, or are not expected to be, settled in cash. Additionally, we believe that non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are common measures used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance and the valuation of our business. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share should be evaluated in light of our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, GAAP net income and net income per share. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share differently, and, therefore, our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n(2) As presented in the Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited).\n(3) Other loss, net primarily includes items such as interest income, interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, accretion of debt discounts, and gain/loss on debt extinguishment.\nSource:Blucora, Inc.",
