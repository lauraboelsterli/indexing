    "text": "LODI, Calif., The Board of Directors of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp (OTCQX:FMCB), a bank holding company headquartered in Lodi, California, declared a mid-year cash dividend of $6.90 per share, an increase over the $6.75 per share declared in May of 2017. The cash dividend will be paid on July 2, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 8, 2018. Kent A. Steinwert, Chairman, President and CEO noted, “The Board is pleased with the Company’s record first quarter 2018 financial results and unanimously approved the cash dividend. The Board believes our strong earnings performance allows for increasing the cash dividend while still providing a level of capital retention that supports the Company’s expansion plans. This year marks the 83 rd consecutive year that Farmers & Merchants Bancorp has paid cash dividends and the 53 rd consecutive year we have increased dividends. As a result of the reliability of our cash dividends over many decades, we remain a member of a select group of only 25 publicly traded companies referred to as 'Dividend Kings.'”\nFor the quarter ending March 31, 2018, Farmers & Merchants Bancorp reported net income of $9.9 million, or $12.24 per share, a 27.1% increase from net income of $7.8 million earned in the first quarter of 2017. Return on average assets for the first quarter of 2018 was 1.31% and return on average equity was 13.14%. Total assets at quarter-end were $3.1 billion, up 3.6% from the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s credit quality remained strong with a nominal amount of non-performing loans and leases as of March 31, 2018, representing effectively 0.0% of total loans and leases. In addition, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $50.7 million, or 2.27% of total loans and leases. The Company’s tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.49% at March 31, 2018, and the total capital ratio was 13.33%, resulting in the highest possible regulatory classification of “well capitalized.”\nAbout Farmers & Merchants Bancorp\nFarmers & Merchants Bancorp, traded on the OTCQX under the symbol FMCB, is the parent company of Farmers & Merchants Bank of Central California, also known as F&M Bank.
