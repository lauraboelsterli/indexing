(\"Eguana\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V:EGT) (OTCQB:EGTYF) today announced results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nContinued shipments into the Hawaiian residential market resulted in energy storage system revenue of $2.4 million CAD, representing a +400% increase for the six months ending March 31, as compared to the same period in 2017 Achieved 15% gross margin on product sales for the first half of the year as compared to (11%) for the same period in 2017 Launched the Elevate and Evolve commercial and residential energy storage product lines into the US market Broadened relationship with German automotive partner to expand Eguana distribution network into key global markets\nOutlook for 2018\nLaunch of the Enduro all-in-one product for the European market, to be showcased at Intersolar Munich Evolve Energy Storage product launch in Australia with select distribution partners Completion of the Commercial AC Battery certification with initial shipments to Southern California Expand distributor partnerships in key global markets for Evolve, Enduro, and Elevate product lines Complete partnership with renewable energy power company to put Evolve product line into solar financing channels Expand sales and marketing, and after sales support teams to coincide with expanding global presence\nEguana maintained deliveries into Hawaii as planned, which resulted in a first half revenue increase of 400%.
