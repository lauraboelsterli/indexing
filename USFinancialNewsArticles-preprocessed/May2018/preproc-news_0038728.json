    "text": "An arbitrator has ruled Cornell University violated federal labor law during a contested unionization election for graduate students working as teaching and research assistants, but he rejected the unionâ€™s bid for a new election if it loses.\nHoward Edelman of the American Arbitration Association said in a ruling on Wednesday that the mass email sent by Graduate School Dean Barbara Knuth the night before the vote that claimed a union could reduce the amount of graduate students at the university violated the National Labor Relations Act. The email could make student assistants think voting for the union would put their positions in danger, Edelman said.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2rSRMhf\n ",
