    "text": "44 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court decided Monday that employers can block collective claims from workers—as opposed those by individuals—through arbitration clauses, ruling in favor of management in the clash of two longstanding federal laws.\nWith Justice Neil Gorsuch writing for a 5-to-4 majority after casting the deciding vote, the case exposed the conflict between the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, which makes arbitration clauses generally “valid, irrevocable and enforceable,” and the National Labor Relations Act, passed in 1935, which authorizes employees to take collective action for “mutual aid or protection.”\nSupreme Court precedents have given great weight to arbitration clauses that businesses use to block consumers and employees from filing lawsuits, instead funneling claims into private arbitration. The cases before the court didn’t dispute employers’ ability to require the arbitration of labor disputes.\nBut employees asserted that their right to “concerted activities” could not be limited by employment contracts that allow only individual arbitration claims by workers, rather than joint arbitration actions.\nUnder the Obama administration, the Justice Department and the National Labor Relations Board backed the worker position. The Justice Department switched sides after President Donald Trump took office, while the labor board, still run by holdover appointees, held to its prior position. Lower courts divided on the issue.\n(More to Come)\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com",
