    "text": "Microsoft has unveiled a new Xbox controller with customizable features for disabled gamers.\nThe company's new accessible device is targeted at users with a range of physical disabilities, and is set to launch later this year.\nTailor-made controllers for disabled people are near non-existent in the gaming world. Several charities have been set up to address this, creating modified controllers that are more accessible to disabled users.\nThe Xbox Adaptive Controller is a rectangular gadget with two large buttons on the face and 19 3.5mm jacks round the back that connect to a range of external switches, buttons, mounts and joysticks.\nMicrosoft It's wireless and designed so that users can place it on their lap while gaming but can be mounted with hardware and attached to a wheelchair or desk.\nThe controllers can be used for Xbox One and Windows 10 PC games and will sell for $99.99. Microsoft didn't provide a specific date for the release.\nThe announcement comes as several gaming firms prepare for the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), which takes place on June 12 this year.",
