    "text": "BENTON HARBOR, Mich., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) (\"Whirlpool\") today announced the preliminary results of its \"modified Dutch Auction\" tender offer, which expired one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 23, 2018.\nBased on the preliminary count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, a total of 7,192,653 shares of Whirlpool's common stock, $1.00 par value per share, were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below the purchase price of $159.50 per share, including 4,676,808 shares that were tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery. Whirlpool has been informed by the depositary that the preliminary proration factor for the tender offer is approximately 87 percent.\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer, and based on the preliminary count by the depositary, Whirlpool expects to acquire approximately 6,269,592 shares of its common stock at a price of $159.50 per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $1 billion, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer.
