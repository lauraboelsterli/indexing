    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB):\nEPS Increases 15% to $1.12 Per Diluted Share Comparable Store Sales Decrease 0.3% Continued Strong Growth in E-Commerce Sales Company Successfully Launches Mobile App\nHibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB), an athletic specialty retailer, today provided the following business updates:\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, decreased 0.4% to $274.7 million compared with $275.7 million for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2017. Comparable store sales decreased 0.3%. E-commerce sales represented 7.0% of total sales for the first quarter.\nGross margin was 35.2% of net sales for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, compared with 35.6% for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2017. The decline was mainly due to increased sales of clearance merchandise and freight associated with e-commerce sales. At the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, aged inventory levels were significantly improved compared with the same period last year.\nStore operating, selling and administrative expenses were 22.5% of net sales for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, compared with 21.2% of net sales for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2017. The increase was mainly due to reinvestment of tax reform savings to benefit the Company’s team members, additional marketing initiatives to drive e-commerce sales and investments made to launch our new mobile app.\nNet income for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, was $21.5 million compared with net income of $20.9 million for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2017. Earnings per diluted share was $1.12 for the 13-week period ended May 5, 2018, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.97 for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2017.\nJeff Rosenthal, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Overall we were pleased with our results, as we exceeded our internal plan and experienced gross margin improvement in April. Branded apparel was especially strong during the quarter with comparable store sales in the high single-digit range, while footwear and cleats were positive as well. E-commerce sales continued to perform above expectations and represented approximately 7% of total sales for the quarter. We are also very encouraged with the early results of our new mobile app and believe this will be a great tool for our highly mobile customer. Additionally, we continue to make good progress on our Buy Online, Pick up in Store and Reserve in Store capabilities, and plan to launch this functionality ahead of the holiday season. As we start the second quarter, we believe we are well positioned with fresh assortments and easier comparisons as we prepare for the back-to-school season.”\nFor the quarter, Hibbett opened seven new stores, expanded four high-performing stores and closed 18 underperforming stores, bringing the store base to 1,068 in 35 states as of May 5, 2018.\nLiquidity and Stock Repurchases\nHibbett ended the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 with $115.8 million of available cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet, no bank debt outstanding and full availability under its $60.0 million unsecured credit facilities.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company repurchased 40,299 shares of common stock for a total expenditure of $0.9 million. Approximately $203.6 million remained authorized for future stock repurchases as of May 5, 2018.\nFiscal 2019 Outlook\nThe Company is maintaining its guidance for Fiscal 2019, with earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.65 to $1.95.\nInvestor Conference Call and Simulcast\nHibbett Sports, Inc. will conduct a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET on Friday, May 25, 2018, to discuss first quarter Fiscal 2019 results.
