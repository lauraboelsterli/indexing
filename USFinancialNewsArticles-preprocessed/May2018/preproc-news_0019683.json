    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) (“Diamondback” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results\nHIGHLIGHTS\nQ1 2018 net income of $163 million, or $1.65 per diluted share; adjusted net income (as defined and reconciled below) of $162 million, or $1.64 per diluted share Previously announced Q1 2018 production of 102.6 Mboe/d (74% oil), up 10% over Q4 2017 and 67% year over year Q1 2018 CAPEX of $318 million, generated $21 million of free cash flow in the quarter Narrowing full year 2018 production guidance to 110.0 – 116.0 Mboe/d, up 1% from prior guidance midpoint; implies 43% annualized growth at the midpoint from full year 2017 average daily production Q1 2018 cash operating costs of $8.42/boe, down 10% year over year with realized pricing up 21% over the same period Lowering full year 2018 LOE guidance to $3.75 - $4.50 per boe, down 13% from prior guidance midpoint Q1 2018 cash dividend of $0.125 per share payable on May 29, 2018; implies a 0.4% annualized yield based on May 7, 2018 share closing price of $130.24 Executed 50,000 bo/d firm transportation agreement as shipper on Gray Oak pipeline Currently operating 11 horizontal drilling rigs and five dedicated frac spreads\n“Diamondback remains committed to capital discipline by continuing to grow production at industry leading rates within cash flow and achieving an annualized return on average capital employed of over 13% in the first quarter, well above our estimated cost of capital. The execution of our forward operating plan while maintaining best in class operating metrics is the primary focus of our organization in an increasingly active Permian Basin,\" stated Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer of Diamondback.\nMr. Stice continued, \"We have made significant progress on our Permian Basin takeaway strategy, with the 50,000 barrel per day commitment to the Gray Oak Pipeline being the first step of many as we work to increase our exposure to international pricing away from the Midland market. Additionally, Diamondback will continue to be active, yet selective, in our acquisition strategy, with accretion and full-cycle economics remaining key drivers of our decision making process. Our disciplined approach to all facets of the business, from day-to-day operations to longer-term strategic decisions, is evidenced by Diamondback's significant Adjusted EBITDA per share growth since going public just over five years ago.\"\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nDiamondback’s Q1 2018 production was 102.6 Mboe/d (74% oil), up 67% year over year from 61.6 Mboe/d in Q1 2017, and up over 10% quarter over quarter from 92.9 Mboe/d in Q4 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Diamondback drilled 41 gross horizontal wells and turned 35 operated horizontal wells to production. The average completed lateral length for first quarter wells was 9,000 feet. Operated completions during the first quarter consisted of 20 Wolfcamp A wells, nine Lower Spraberry wells, four Wolfcamp B wells, one Middle Spraberry well and one Third Bone Spring shale well. The Company operated 10 drilling rigs and four dedicated frac spreads during the quarter.\nThe Company is currently operating 11 horizontal rigs and five dedicated frac crews, and plans to operate, on average, between 10 and 12 horizontal rigs throughout 2018. As a result, Diamondback expects to turn between 170 and 190 gross operated horizontal wells to production for the full year 2018.\nOPERATIONS UPDATE\nIn Pecos County, Diamondback continues to see strong performance from operated completions targeting the Wolfcamp A. After achieving a peak 30-day 2-stream flowing initial production (\"IP\") rate of 226 boe/d per 1,000 feet (91% oil), the State Biggs 12A-2 2WA went on to achieve a peak 90-day flowing IP rate of 172 boe/d per 1,000 feet (91% oil). Subsequently in the first quarter, Diamondback completed another Wolfcamp A well with a 7,527 foot lateral. This well, the Neal Lethco 39-37 Unit 2WA, achieved a peak 30-day flowing IP rate of 159 boe/d per 1,000 feet (84% oil) and a peak 60-day flowing IP rate of 141 boe/d per 1,000 feet (84% oil).\nIn Reeves County, Diamondback recently completed its first well targeting the Third Bone Spring shale with a 9,401 foot lateral. This well, the Rogers 6 Unit 3TB, achieved a peak 30-day flowing IP rate of 122 boe/d per 1,000 feet (80% oil), and went on to achieve a peak 90-day flowing IP rate of 110 boe/d per 1,000 feet (81% oil).\nIn the Midland Basin, the Company recently completed a four-well pad in Midland County targeting the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A with an average lateral length of 10,353 feet. Two Wolfcamp A wells on the Bombardier C Unit pad achieved an average 30-day IP rate of 134 boe/d per 1,000 feet (89% oil), while two Lower Spraberry wells averaged 123 boe/d per 1,000 feet (88% oil) over the same period.\nIn Glasscock County, Diamondback has drilled and completed a seven-well pad targeting the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B with an average lateral length of 9,984 feet. The initial two Wolfcamp A completions achieved an average 30-day IP rate of 117 boe/d per 1,000 feet (86% oil), while the initial Wolfcamp B well produced 143 boe/d per 1,000 feet (85% oil) over the same period. The remaining four wells are still flowing back.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nDiamondback's first quarter 2018 net income was $163 million, or $1.65 per diluted share. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled below) was $162 million, or $1.64 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) was $341 million, up 13% from $302 million in Q4 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 average realized prices were $61.66 per barrel of oil, $2.20 per Mcf of natural gas and $24.64 per barrel of natural gas liquids, resulting in a total equivalent unhedged price of $50.55/boe, up 12% from $45.31/boe in Q4 2017.\nDiamondback's cash operating costs 2018 were $8.42 per boe, including lease operating expenses (\"LOE\") of $4.04 per boe, cash general and administrative expenses of $0.96 per boe and taxes and transportation of $3.42 per boe.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Diamondback had $54 million in standalone cash and $166 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility. In connection with its Spring 2018 redetermination expected to close in May 2018, the lead bank on Diamondback's credit facility recommended a borrowing base increase to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion, while the Company intends to limit the lenders' aggregate commitment to $1.0 billion. Additionally, Viper Energy Partners LP (\"Viper\"), a subsidiary of Diamondback, expects to have its borrowing base increased to $475 million from $400 million currently.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Diamondback spent $275 million on drilling, completion and non-operated properties, and $43 million on infrastructure and midstream.\nDIVIDEND DECLARATION\nDiamondback announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of 12.5 cents per common share payable on May 29, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018.\nFULL YEAR 2018 GUIDANCE\nBelow is Diamondback's guidance for the full year 2018, which has been updated to reflect a narrowed production range and lower lease operating expenses per boe.\n2018 Guidance Diamondback Energy, Inc.

Our calculation of such effects includes realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus non-cash (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net, net interest expense, net, depreciation, depletion and amortization, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, capitalized equity-based compensation expense, asset retirement obligation accretion expense, gain on revaluation of investment and income tax (benefit) provision. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income as determined by United States’ generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows it to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company adds the items listed above to net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Diamondback Energy, Inc. plus non-cash loss on derivative instruments, gain on revaluation of investment and related income tax adjustments. The Company’s computations of Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies or to such measure in our credit facility or any of our other contracts.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).\nDiamondback Energy, Inc.
