    "text": "DALLAS, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram (NASDAQ:MGI) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue of $380.0 million declined 2% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to first quarter 2017. Money transfer revenue was $336.6 million, representing a decrease of 1% on a reported basis and a decrease of 6% on a constant currency basis as compared to first quarter 2017. Revenue results were in-line with the company's expectations and reflect the impact of newly implemented, industry-leading compliance standards, along with ongoing geopolitical challenges in certain markets. Moneygram.com revenue grew 21% primarily from new customer acquisitions. Digital revenue represented 16% of total money transfer revenue. Net income was $7.1 million compared to $8.8 million for first quarter 2017. EBITDA was $66.3 million, an increase of $12.9 million as compared to the year-ago period. Net income and EBITDA results included: Other income of $30.0 million related to the terminated merger with Ant Financial. An additional accrual of $10.0 million in connection with a possible resolution of the company's deferred prosecution agreement (the \"DPA\"), which is based on the facts and circumstances known at the present time. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company accrued $85.0 million related to the same matter. $7.3 million of restructuring and reorganization costs. Income tax expense of $14.8 million compared to $2.5 million in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the negative impact of certain provisions in the US tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017 and the non-deductability of certain expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.6 million and remained relatively flat compared to first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.5% as compared to 17.2% for first quarter 2017. Diluted earnings per share was $0.11 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.13 in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.15. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $29.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $2.6 million compared to first quarter 2017.\n\"2018 will be a transition year for MoneyGram as we continue to invest and reposition the company to compete in a fast changing environment,\" said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chairman and chief executive officer. \"We are increasing our investments in digital assets as we accelerate our transition to a digitally enabled customer-first organization. At the same time, our focus on compliance will underpin our future success. Fraud and risk are on the rise globally and we are enhancing our processes and systems to provide our customers with the best experience and the highest standards of protection. During the quarter, we implemented significant new compliance standards which are above and beyond what is currently required by law and without comparison in the money transfer industry. While these standards are expected to adversely impact transactions and revenue in 2018, we are setting the industry paradigm and intend to be at the forefront of compliance as we lead our business into the future.\"\nRestructuring and Reorganization\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company initiated a restructuring and reorganization program as part of its Digital Transformation initiative. The company incurred $7.3 million of expenses in the quarter, and expects the full cost of the program to be approximately $15 million. This program reflects the alignment of the organization with the delivery of new digital touch-points for customers and agents, and the maturity of the company's global agent model. The company expects efficiencies that will result in $30 million of expense reductions in 2018 and, upon completion, $45 million on an annualized basis.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nIncluding the company's first quarter results along with the expected impact of its new compliance standards and recently announced Walmart2World service, the company estimates full year 2018 constant currency revenue to decline between 4% and 6%. Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis is expected to decline between 8% and 10%.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains which are protected as under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect MoneyGram's current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events.

Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond MoneyGram's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to compete effectively; our ability to maintain key agent or biller relationships, or a reduction in business or transaction volume from these relationships, including our largest agent, Walmart, whether through the introduction by Walmart of additional competing \"white label\" branded money transfer products or otherwise; our ability to manage fraud risks from consumers or agents; the ability of us and our agents to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations; litigation or investigations involving us or our agents; uncertainties relating to compliance with the DPA entered into with the U.S. federal government and the effect of the DPA on our reputation and business; regulations addressing consumer privacy, data use and security; our ability to successfully develop and timely introduce new and enhanced products and services and our investments in new products, services or infrastructure changes; our ability to manage risks associated with our international sales and operations; our offering of money transfer services through agents in regions that are politically volatile; changes in tax laws or an unfavorable outcome with respect to the audit of our tax returns or tax positions, or a failure by us to establish adequate reserves for tax events; our substantial debt service obligations, significant debt covenant requirements and credit ratings; major bank failure or sustained financial market illiquidity, or illiquidity at our clearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions; the ability of us and our agents to maintain adequate banking relationships; a security or privacy breach in systems, networks or databases on which rely; disruptions to our computer network systems and data centers; weakness in economic conditions, in both the U.S. and global markets; a significant change, material slow down or complete disruption of international migration patterns; the financial health of certain European countries or the secession of a country from the European Union; our ability to manage credit risks from our agents and official check financial institution customers; our ability to adequately protect our brand and intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing on the rights of others; our ability to attract and retain key employees; our ability to manage risks related to the operation of retail locations and the acquisition or start-up of businesses; any restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the expected results and these actions may adversely affect our business; our ability to maintain effective internal controls; our capital structure and the special voting rights provided to designees of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. on our Board of Directors; and uncertainties described in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of MoneyGram's public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including MoneyGram's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the is contained from time to time in MoneyGram's SEC filings. MoneyGram's SEC filings may be obtained by contacting MoneyGram, through MoneyGram's web site at ir.moneygram.com or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval System (EDGAR) at http://www.sec.gov . MoneyGram undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), this news release and related tables include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including a presentation of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization), Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes and cash payments for capital expenditures and agent signing bonuses), constant currency measures (which assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year), adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted net income. In addition, we present adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin for our two reporting segments. The following tables include a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures. The equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results are not provided, and projected results do not reflect the potential impact of certain non-GAAP adjustments, which include (but in future periods, may not be limited to) stock-based, contingent and incentive compensation costs, compliance enhancement program costs, direct monitor costs, legal and contingent matter costs, restructuring and reorganization costs, currency changes and the tax effect of such items. We cannot reliably predict or estimate if and when these types of costs, adjustments or changes may occur or their impact to our financial statements. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not available.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry. Finally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, constant currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted net income figures are financial and performance measures used by management in reviewing results of operations, forecasting, allocating resources or establishing employee incentive programs. Although MoneyGram believes the above non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the accompanying GAAP financial measures.\nDescription of Tables\nTable One\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nTable Two\n-\nSegment Results\nTable Three\n-\nSegment Reconciliations\nTable Four\n-\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nTable Five\n-\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nTable Six\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nTable Seven\n-\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nTable Eight\n-\nIncome Statement Presentation Change and Correction of Prior Period Results\nConference Call\nMoneyGram International will host a conference call tomorrow, May 8, at 8:00 a.m. CT, 9:00 a.m. ET, to discuss its results.

expenses. Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect the change in presentation, which had no impact on operating income, net income, earnings per share, or segments operating results.\n(2) In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's management determined that there was an immaterial error with respect to the allocation of certain expenses between the reporting segments in the first three quarters of 2017. The Company assessed the materiality of the misstatement both quantitatively and qualitatively and determined that the error was immaterial to all prior consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the correction of the immaterial error. This correction resulted in a decrease to Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products operating income, and a decrease to Other operating loss.
