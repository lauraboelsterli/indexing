(Nasdaq:HMSY) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $6.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $25.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the prior year first quarter. Net income in the quarter included a net benefit of $0.05 per diluted share related to a reversal of the Company’s reserve liability for open or pending Medicare RAC appeals following expiration of the RAC contract on January 31, 2018 (the “Reserve Release”). Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a non-cash tax benefit of $15.1 million or $0.18 per diluted share, due to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax balances pursuant to the tax rate reduction included in the federal tax legislation enacted in December of last year (the “Revaluation of Deferred Tax Balances”).\nAdjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.22 per diluted share compared to adjusted EPS of $0.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted EPS of $0.13 per diluted share in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 included a net benefit of $0.05 per diluted share related to the Reserve Release. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a non-cash tax benefit of $0.25 per diluted share, due to the Revaluation of Deferred Tax Balances.\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $141.4 million, compared to total revenue of $148.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $113.7 million in the prior year first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included $8.4 million in Medicare RAC revenue resulting from the Reserve Release. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was $34.9 million, compared to $40.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $19.9 million in the prior year first quarter.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance exceeded our expectations and represents a solid beginning to the new year. The sequential and year-over-year growth in payment integrity (PI) revenue is particularly encouraging and further indication that the enhanced analytics implemented in the back half of last year are having a sustained impact on throughput in our PI business,\" said Bill Lucia, Chairman and CEO. “Payers in recent years have increasingly focused on better understanding the health status of their members and effectively communicating with them to improve outcomes, which we believe creates a favorable environment for cross-sales of our care management and consumer engagement solutions in 2018.”\nCommercial revenue was $71.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $55.1 million in the prior year first quarter - prior to the April 2017 acquisition of Eliza Holding Corp. (“Eliza”) - and $77.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Commercial revenue in the first quarter of 2018 included $9.7 million from Eliza, compared to $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. State government revenue was $54.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $53.3 million in the prior year first quarter and $64.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The sequential quarterly decline in commercial and state government revenue was expected and consistent with Company projections. Federal (including Medicare RAC) and other revenue was $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, a $9.7 million increase compared to the prior year first quarter and $7.9 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. Medicare RAC revenue of $10.0 million in the quarter included $8.4 million related to the Reserve Release.\nCoordination of benefits (COB) revenue was $91.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $88.5 million in the prior year first quarter and $105.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. COB accounted for 64.9% of total revenue in the first quarter, compared to 77.8% in the prior year first quarter and 71.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue from analytical services, which includes PI, Medicare RAC and care management and consumer engagement solutions, was $49.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $25.2 million in the prior year first quarter (prior to the Eliza acquisition) and $42.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. PI revenue was $28.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $24.3 million in the prior year first quarter and $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and care management and consumer engagement revenue was $11.0 million.\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 were $5.8 million, compared to $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $8.5 million in the prior year first quarter.\nPursuant to the Company’s $50 million share repurchase program announced in November 2017, the Company purchased approximately 384,000 shares for approximately $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2018.\n\"Our previous Medicare RAC contract with CMS ended on January 31, 2018. As a result, the contract obligation to maintain a reserve for open or pending appeals ceased. The associated reserves of $8.4 million were, therefore, released in the first quarter which had a net impact of $0.05 per diluted share on both net income and adjusted EPS in the first quarter,\" said Jeff Sherman, CFO. \"Our effective tax rate in the quarter was slightly above the rate we expect on a full year basis, due primarily to a higher level of stock compensation related to annual equity grants to employees made in the first quarter of each year. Net of the benefit of the reserve release, we believe that normalized total revenue of $133 million and normalized adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million in the quarter position us nicely to reach our full year 2018 financial objectives.”\nFor additional information about the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results, see the Q1 2018 Investor Presentation available on the HMS Investor Relations Website at http://investor.hms.com/events-and-presentations .\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nHMS will report its preliminary first quarter 2018 financial and operating results via webcast at 7:30 AM CT / 8:30 AM ET on May 4, 2018.
