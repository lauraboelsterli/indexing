Whittington as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective June 21, 2018. Whittington will succeed Louis M. (“Mike”) Riccio who previously announced he will retire from La-Z-Boy when the company completes its fiscal 2018 year-end reporting. Riccio will remain at La-Z-Boy through August 1, 2018, in an advisory capacity to transition the role.\nWhittington brings more than 25 years of financial experience and expertise to La-Z-Boy.

It is a fascinating time for the company as it marries its rich history, brand strength and legacy of innovation with an evolving e-commerce strategy to address today’s marketplace. It is indeed exciting to be part of the team that is leading the company through its next phase of transformation.”\nWhittington is a summa cum laude graduate of The Ohio State University, is a CPA and has served in several leadership positions for non-profit organizations.
