A technology executive with more than 25 years of experience leading global software engineering and product management teams, Milani will lead the engineering organization in growing and innovating Bugcrowd’s industry-leading Crowdcontrol™ platform.\n“We are thrilled to have Mark onboard the Bugcrowd team,” said Ashish Gupta, CEO, Bugcrowd. “He is an experienced engineering, analytics and business leader in technology spanning across a number of areas in both small and large company environments.
