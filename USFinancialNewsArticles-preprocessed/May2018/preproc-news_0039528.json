    "text": "BERLIN, May 15 (Reuters) - German economic growth slowed slightly more than expected in the first quarter of the year due to weak trade, a first estimate from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Tuesday.\nEuropeâ€™s biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months - the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016 - after expanding 0.6 percent in the final three months of last year.\nEconomists had on average expected growth of 0.4 percent, with forecasts ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent in a Reuters poll of 34 economists.\nThe statistics office said positive contributions in the first quarter came mainly from domestic demand while trade was weak.
