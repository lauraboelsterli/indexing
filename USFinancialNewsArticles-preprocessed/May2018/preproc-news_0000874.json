    "text": "NEW YORK, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Quality Care Properties, Inc. (\"QCP\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: QCP) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Welltower, Inc. (\"WELL\") (NYSE: WELL). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $20.75 in cash for each QCP share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether QCP's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, QCP shares traded for $22.91, or $2.16 above the offer price, the day before the acquisition announcement.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether QCP's Board acted in the best interests of QCP's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
