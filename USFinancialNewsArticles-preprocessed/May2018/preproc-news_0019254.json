(Nasdaq:KPTI) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases. Karyopharm's SINE compounds function by binding with and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1 (or CRM1). In addition to single-agent and combination activity against a variety of human cancers, SINE compounds have also shown biological activity in models of neurodegeneration, inflammation, autoimmune disease, certain viruses and wound-healing. Karyopharm, which was founded by Dr. Sharon Shacham, currently has several investigational programs in clinical or preclinical development.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such include those regarding the therapeutic potential of and potential clinical development plans for Karyopharm's drug candidates, especially selinexor, and our expectations related to the offering discussed , including the use of proceeds from the offering. Such statements are subject to numerous important factors, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from Karyopharm's current expectations. For example, there can be no guarantee that any of Karyopharm's drug candidates, including selinexor, will successfully complete necessary clinical development phases, that development of any of Karyopharm's drug candidates will continue or that any positive feedback from regulatory authorities will ultimately lead to the approval of selinexor or any of Karyopharm’s other drug candidates. Further, there can be no guarantee that any positive developments in Karyopharm's drug candidate portfolio will result in stock price appreciation. Management's expectations and, therefore, any could also be affected by risks and uncertainties relating to a number of other factors, including the following: Karyopharm's results of clinical trials and preclinical studies, including subsequent analysis of existing data and new data received from ongoing and future studies; the content and timing of decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities, investigational review boards at clinical trial sites and publication review bodies, including with respect to the need for additional clinical studies; Karyopharm's ability to obtain and maintain requisite regulatory approvals and to enroll patients in its clinical trials; unplanned cash requirements and expenditures; development of drug candidates by Karyopharm's competitors for diseases in which Karyopharm is currently developing its drug candidates; and Karyopharm's ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and other intellectual property protection for any drug candidates it is developing. These and other risks are described under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in Karyopharm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the SEC on March 15, 2018, and in other filings that Karyopharm may make with the SEC in the future. Any contained speak only as of the date hereof, and, except as required by law, Karyopharm expressly disclaims any obligation to update any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nContacts:\nInvestors:\nKimberly Minarovich\n(646) 368-8014\nkimberly@argotpartners.com\nMary Jenkins\n(617) 340-6073\nmary@argotpartners.com\nMedia:\nDavid Rosen\n(212) 600-1902\ndavid.rosen@argotpartners.com\nSource:Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.",
