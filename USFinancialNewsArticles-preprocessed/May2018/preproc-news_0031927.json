(Reuters) - American Webb Simpson had his lead cut to five strokes, but remained in control halfway through the final round at the Players Championship on Sunday. May 13, 2018; Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, USA; Webb Simpson plays his shot from the ninth tee during the final round of The Players Championship golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass - Stadium Course. Adam Hagy-USA TODAY Sports\nSimpson started the day with a record seven-stroke advantage, and remained at 19-under after one birdie and one bogey on the front nine on another perfect day for low scoring at TPC Sawgrass.\nNew Zealander Danny Lee picked up two early birdies to creep to 14-under, but squandered a golden chance to put some pressure on the leader when he missed a six-foot birdie at the par-five ninth hole. Slideshow (3 Images)\nTiger Woods, after a 65 on Saturday, continued his strong form to vault into a tie for third with Jason Day and Jason Dufner at 13-under.\nWoods picked up five strokes in 11 holes as his comeback from last yearâ€™s successful spinal fusion gathered a full head of steam.\nDay, the 2016 champion, holed a 55-foot bunker shot at the ninth hole.
