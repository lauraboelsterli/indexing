    "text": "TORONTO, May 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Slate Retail REIT (TSX:SRT.U) (TSX:SRT.UN) (the \"REIT\"), an owner and operator of U.S. grocery-anchored real estate, announced today that the REIT has received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) to renew its existing normal course issuer bid effective as at the open of markets on May 28, 2018 to repurchase for cancellation up to 3,873,045 class U units (the “Class U Units”), or approximately 10% of the public float of 38,730,455 Class U Units.\nAs of May 11, 2018, 43,257,378 Class U Units were outstanding. The REIT may purchase Class U Units for cancellation over the 12­month period commencing May 26, 2018 and ending on May 25, 2019. Any purchases under the normal course issuer bid will be made through the facilities of the TSX and/or through other permitted means, including through one or more alternative Canadian trading systems, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements at the prevailing market price on the TSX or the alternative market at the time of purchase or such other price as may be permitted by the TSX at the time of acquisition. Subject to certain prescribed exemptions and any block purchase made in accordance with the rules of the TSX, the number of Class U Units that can be purchased pursuant to the bid is subject to a daily maximum of 10,023 Class U Units, or approximately 25% of the average daily trading volume during the period from November 1, 2017 to April 30, 2018 (being 40,094 Class U Units per day). The actual number of Class U Units which may be purchased (if any), and the timing of any such purchases, will be determined by the REIT. Any Class U Units purchased under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled following purchase. The REIT intends to fund the purchases of Class U Units under its normal course issuer bid out of the general funds of the REIT. Within the past 12 months of the REITs normal course issuer bid, which expires on May 25, 2018, 494,671 Class U Units were purchased.\nThe Board of Trustees of Slate Retail REIT believe that the purchase by the REIT of a portion of its outstanding Class U Units will increase unitholder value and that such purchases constitute a desirable use of the REIT's available resources.\nSlate Asset Management L.P. is the REIT’s manager.\nAbout Slate Retail REIT (TSX: SRT.U / SRT.UN)\nSlate Retail REIT is a real estate investment trust focused on U.S. grocery-anchored real estate.
