At Tibotec he led the successful launch of the first two Johnson & Johnson products launched into the HIV/AIDS market and presided over the growth of both Doxil and Procrit in the oncology therapeutic and supportive care categories.\nFrom 1998 thru 2002, Mr. Mattes served as Vice President of Worldwide Commercial and Clinical Operations at Centocor Inc. He played a critical role in defining the company's overall business direction as well as developing and implementing the strategy leading to the growth of ReoPro and the commercial launch of Remicade.\nPrior to joining Centocor, Mr. Mattes was at Rhône Poulenc Rorer, where he held positions of increasing responsibility, including President of RPR Canada and General Manager of U.S. pharmaceuticals.

In early testing the Thin Film Freezing (TFF) proprietary platform significantly improved the solubility of drugs that have poor water solubility.\nThe Company has generated numerous formulations for dry powder delivery to the lungs. The initial focus is on dry powder drugs for inhalation of both biologic and small molecule drugs that currently cannot be formulated for dry powder delivery by other means. TFF Pharmaceuticals expects that these dry powder formulations, which can be delivered directly to the lungs via inhaler, will avoid certain negative side effects that come from delivering these drugs systematically. , visit tffpharma.com.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nAny statements in this release that are not historical facts may be considered \"forward-looking statements.\" Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially and adversely from the statements contained herein.
