    "text": "NEW YORK, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MFA Financial, Inc. (NYSE:MFA) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and other highlights:\nMFA generated first quarter net income available to common shareholders of $79.6 million, or $0.20 per common share (based on 398.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding). As of March 31, 2018, book value per common share was $7.62. Net Income was lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included mark to market gains on CRT securities that had recovered in value following declines due to hurricane-related concerns in the third quarter of 2017. Asset acquisitions exceeded run-off during the quarter. MFA purchased in excess of $700 million of residential mortgage assets in the first quarter, including $522 million of residential whole loans. On April 30, 2018, MFA paid its first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2018.\nCraig Knutson, MFA's CEO and President, said, \"In the first quarter, we continued to execute our strategy of targeted investment within the residential mortgage universe with a focus on credit sensitive assets. We again grew our portfolio this quarter, as acquisitions exceeded run-off, which included opportunistic sales of $19.4 million of Legacy Non-Agency MBS that generated realized gains of $8.8 million. As we have done for over five years now, we continue to manage this Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio through selective and strategic sales of positions.\n\"MFA remains well-positioned to generate attractive returns despite the continuing low interest rate environment and elevated asset prices. Through our asset selection and hedging strategy, the estimated net effective duration, a gauge of our portfolio's sensitivity to interest rates, remains relatively low and measured 1.02 at quarter-end. MFA's book value per common share decreased to $7.62 from $7.70 at the end of 2017 despite a substantial increase in interest rates, as our investment strategy continues to produce relatively stable book value. Leverage, which reflects the ratio of our financing obligations to equity, was 2.2:1 at quarter-end.\"\nMr. Knutson added, \"MFA's portfolio asset selection process continues to emphasize residential mortgage credit exposure while seeking to minimize sensitivity to interest rates. As housing prices maintain their upward trend and borrowers repair their credit and balance sheets, the performance of our credit sensitive residential whole loan portfolio benefits from this fundamental strength. MFA's proactive asset management team has been able to shorten liquidation timelines and increase property sale proceeds, leading to improved outcomes and better returns. Additionally, MFA's Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio continues to outperform our credit assumptions. In the first quarter of 2018, we reduced our credit reserve on this portfolio by $7.1 million.\"\nDuring the first quarter MFA purchased more than $700 million of residential mortgage assets, including $522 million of residential whole loans. Portfolio run-off in RPL/NPL MBS, which had been elevated during most of 2017, was relatively low during the first quarter.\nAt March 31, 2018, our investments in credit sensitive residential whole loans totaled $2.7 billion. Of this amount, $1.1 billion is recorded at carrying value and generated a loss-adjusted yield of 5.81% (5.52% net of servicing costs) during the quarter, and $1.6 billion is recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. On this portion of the portfolio, we recorded gains for the quarter of approximately $38.5 million, primarily reflecting coupon interest payments and other cash received during the quarter and changes in the fair value of the underlying loans.\nMFA's Legacy Non-Agency MBS had a face amount of $2.6 billion with an amortized cost of $1.9 billion and a net purchase discount of $770.3 million at March 31, 2018. This discount consists of a $572.6 million credit reserve and other-than-temporary impairments and a $197.7 million net accretable discount. We believe this credit reserve appropriately factors in remaining uncertainties regarding underlying mortgage performance and the potential impact on future cash flows. Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS have underlying mortgage loans that are on average approximately twelve years seasoned and approximately 12.6% are currently 60 or more days delinquent.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Agency MBS portfolio totaled $2.6 billion, had an amortized cost basis of 103.8% of par and generated a 2.21% yield in the first quarter. The Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio had an amortized cost of 70.9% of par as of March 31, 2018, and generated a loss-adjusted yield of 9.44% in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, MFA held approximately $935.2 million of RPL/NPL MBS. These securities had an amortized cost of 99.80% of par and generated a 4.36% yield for the quarter. Our investments in CRT securities totaled $679.5 million at March 31, 2018, and generated a yield of 6.12% in the first quarter. Values of our CRT securities were largely unchanged during the quarter, in contrast to the higher price volatility experienced in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, MFA's costs for compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expenses were $10.6 million, or an annualized 1.31% of stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents the weighted average prepayment speed on MFA's MBS portfolio.\nTable 1\nFirst Quarter\n2018 Average CPR\nFourth Quarter\n2017 Average CPR\nAgency MBS\n12.7%\n14.1%\nLegacy Non-Agency MBS\n14.9%\n16.3%\nRPL/NPL MBS (1)\n14.0%\n20.1%\n(1)\nAll principal payments are considered to be prepayments for conditional prepayment rate (\"CPR\") purposes. RPL/NPL MBS are securitized financial instruments that are primarily backed by securitized re-performing and non-performing loans. The majority of these securities are structured such that the coupon increases up to 300 basis points at 36 months from issuance or sooner.\nAs of March 31, 2018, under its swap agreements, MFA had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of interest of 2.04% and a floating receive rate of 1.82% on notional balances totaling $2.6 billion, with an average maturity of 24 months.\nThe following table presents MFA's asset allocation as of March 31, 2018, and the first quarter 2018 yield on average interest-earning assets, average cost of funds and net interest rate spread for the various asset types.\nTable 2\nASSET ALLOCATION\nAt March 31, 2018\nAgency\nMBS\nLegacy\nNon-Agency\nMBS\nRPL/NPL\nMBS\nCredit Risk\nTransfer\nSecurities\nMSR\nRelated\nAssets\nResidential\nWhole\nLoans, at\nCarrying\nValue (1)\nResidential\nWhole\nLoans, at Fair\nValue\nOther,\nnet (2)\nTotal\n($ in Millions)\nFair Value/Carrying Value\n$\n2,647\n$\n2,463\n$\n935\n$\n679\n$\n455\n$\n1,100\n$\n1,556\n$\n421\n$\n10,256\nLess Payable for\nUnsettled Purchases\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(14)\n—\n—\n(14)\nLess Repurchase\nAgreements\n(2,339)\n(1,662)\n(569)\n(467)\n(293)\n(353)\n(876)\n—\n(6,559)\nLess Securitized Debt\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(152)\n(199)\n—\n(351)\nLess Senior Notes\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(97)\n(97)\nNet Equity Allocated\n$\n308\n$\n801\n$\n366\n$\n212\n$\n162\n$\n581\n$\n481\n$\n324\n$\n3,235\nDebt/Net Equity Ratio (3)\n7.6x\n2.1x\n1.6x\n2.2x\n1.8x\n0.9x\n2.2x\n2.2x\nFor the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nYield on Average Interest\nEarning Assets (4)\n2.21%\n9.44%\n4.36%\n6.12%\n6.37%\n5.81%\nN/A\n—%\n5.15%\nLess Average Cost of\nFunds (5)\n(1.91)\n(3.29)\n(2.94)\n(2.76)\n(3.27)\n(3.56)\n(3.79)\n—\n(2.90)\nNet Interest Rate Spread\n0.30%\n6.15%\n1.42%\n3.36%\n3.10%\n2.25%\nN/A\n—%\n2.25%\n(1)\nThe carrying value of such loans reflects the purchase price, accretion of income, cash received and provision for loan losses since\nacquisition.

The numerator of our Total Debt/Net Equity Ratio also includes the obligation to return securities obtained as collateral of $254.0 million and Senior Notes.\n(4)\nYields reported on our interest earning assets are calculated based on the interest income recorded and the average amortized cost for the quarter of the respective asset. At March 31, 2018, the amortized cost of our interest earning assets were as follows: Agency MBS - $2.7 billion; Legacy Non-Agency MBS - $1.9 billion; RPL/NPL MBS - $933.2 million; Credit Risk Transfer securities - $624.3 million; and Residential Whole Loans at carrying value - $1.1 billion. In addition, the yield for residential whole loans at carrying value was 5.52% net of 29 basis points of servicing fee expense incurred during the quarter. For GAAP reporting purposes, such expenses are included in Loan servicing and other related operating expenses in our statement of operations. Interest payments received on residential whole loans at fair value is reported in Other Income as Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value in our statement of operations. Accordingly, no yield is presented as such loans are not included in interest earning assets for reporting purposes.\n(5)\nAverage cost of funds includes interest on repurchase agreements, the cost of swaps, Senior Notes and securitized debt. Agency cost of funds includes 26 basis points and Legacy Non-Agency cost of funds includes 30 basis points associated with swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets.\nAt March 31, 2018, MFA's $5.1 billion of Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS were backed by hybrid, adjustable and fixed-rate mortgages.

Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: changes in interest rates and the market (i.e., fair) value of MFA's MBS, residential whole loans, CRT securities and other assets; changes in the prepayment rates on the mortgage loans securing MFA's MBS, an increase of which could result in a reduction of the yield on MBS in our portfolio and an increase of which could require us to reinvest the proceeds received by us as a result of such prepayments in MBS with lower coupons; credit risks underlying MFA's assets, including changes in the default rates and management's assumptions regarding default rates on the mortgage loans securing MFA's Non-Agency MBS and relating to MFA's residential whole loan portfolio; MFA's ability to borrow to finance its assets and the terms, including the cost, maturity and other terms, of any such borrowings; implementation of or changes in government regulations or programs affecting MFA's business; MFA's estimates regarding taxable income, the actual amount of which is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the amount of interest income and financing costs, the method elected by MFA to accrete the market discount on Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans and the extent of prepayments, realized losses and changes in the composition of MFA's Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loan portfolios that may occur during the applicable tax period, including gain or loss on any MBS disposals and whole loan modification, foreclosure and liquidation; the timing and amount of distributions to stockholders, which are declared and paid at the discretion of MFA's Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, MFA's taxable income, its financial results and overall financial condition and liquidity, maintenance of its REIT qualification and such other factors as MFA's Board of Directors deems relevant; MFA's ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; MFA's ability to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (or the \"Investment Company Act\"), including statements regarding the Concept Release issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") relating to interpretive issues under the Investment Company Act with respect to the status under the Investment Company Act of certain companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related interests; MFA's ability to successfully implement its strategy to grow its residential whole loan portfolio, which is dependent on, among other things, the supply of loans offered for sale in the market; expected returns on our investments in non-performing residential whole loans (\"NPLs\"), which are affected by, among other things, the length of time required to foreclose upon, sell, liquidate or otherwise reach a resolution of the property underlying the NPL, home price values, amounts advanced to carry the asset (e.g., taxes, insurance, maintenance expenses, etc. on the underlying property) and the amount ultimately realized upon resolution of the asset; risks associated with our investments in MSR related assets, including servicing, regulatory and economic risks, and risks associated with investing in real estate assets, including changes in business conditions and the general economy. These and other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those described in the annual, quarterly and current reports that MFA files with the SEC, could cause MFA's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any it makes.
