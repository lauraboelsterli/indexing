Our teams managed the rapidly changing environment well and positioned the company for a strong performance for the balance of the year. In times like these, when trade flows and capacities shift among regions, the value of our global footprint and capabilities are demonstrated. In Food & Ingredients, results were better than expected with improvement in most regions. Looking ahead, we expect significant growth in Company earnings and returns in 2018.\nSchroder continued, \"We closed on Loders Croklaan during the quarter, which now positions us as a global leader in B2B oils, and when fully integrated will nearly double the size of our Edible Oils business. We also strengthened our milling footprint in the U.S. with the acquisition of two corn masa mills. These investments increase results from value added activities closer towards our targeted level of 35 percent. In addition, we continue to progress towards the separation of our Brazilian sugarcane milling business. We have recently secured debt financing for the business and are now in a position where the business could operate on a stand-alone basis.\n\"We also made solid progress on our cost objectives. Our Global Competitiveness Program is on track towards our target of $100 million this year. And, over the course of the year, we expect an additional $80 million of savings from industrial and supply chain initiatives.\"\nFirst Quarter Results\nAgribusiness\nThe agribusiness environment improved dramatically from conditions seen last year with reduced soybean supplies in Argentina and tightening global grain supplies, leading to increased volatility and improved margins, especially in soy crushing.\nIn Grains, higher results were driven by global trading & distribution, which benefitted from increased margins and effective risk management. Origination results were comparable to last year as improved performance in Brazil, which benefitted from increased farmer commercialization as local soy prices rose, offset lower results in North America and Argentina.\nIn Oilseeds, global soy crush margins significantly improved over the course of the quarter driven by the combination of strong underlying soymeal demand and crushing capacity constraints caused by reduced soybean production in Argentina. The increase in forward margins resulted in negative mark-to-market of $120 million related to forward oilseed crushing contracts. As we execute on these contracts during the balance of the year, we expect this impact will be offset by higher margins, which is embedded in our revised outlook.\nEdible Oil Products\nResults were higher in all regions with the exception of South America. In Europe, improved performance was driven by higher volumes and margins, reflecting increased value-added sales from recent acquisitions, as well as increased demand for margarine which benefitted from the rise in European butter prices. In North America, improved results reflected higher margins and lower costs, where the business is seeing the positive effects of cost improvement and restructuring initiatives. In Asia, results were higher in both India and China. In Brazil, however, lower costs were more than offset by lower margins as abundant oil supplies from the strong soy crushing environment pressured retail prices.\nMilling Products\nHigher results in North America were the primary driver of improved performance in the quarter. In Mexico, results benefitted from double digit volume growth, which was supported by a new sales force structure, and lower costs. Improved results in the U.S. were due to higher margins. Results in Brazil were slightly higher than last year, as higher volume and lower costs more than offset lower margins. We are starting to see signs of improvement as the Brazilian market transitions to a significantly smaller wheat crop this year.\nSugar & Bioenergy\nThe first quarter is the inter-harvest period in Brazil when sugarcane mills in the Center-South region typically do not operate for most of the quarter and are selling sugar and ethanol inventories from the previous sugarcane harvest.\nResults were lower than last year as higher average ethanol prices were more than offset by lower sugar prices and volumes. Volumes were negatively impacted by carrying over a low inventory balance from 2017 into the intercrop period. Trading & distribution results in the quarter were higher than last year.\nIn addition to progressing towards the separation of our sugarcane milling business, we recently signed a share purchase agreement to sell our interest in our renewable oils joint venture to our partner, and are in the process of exiting our global sugar trading operation.\nFertilizer\nImproved results in the quarter were primarily driven by higher margins and lower costs, reflecting in part the restructuring of our Argentine nitrogen fertilizer plant.\nGlobal Competitiveness Program\nThe Global Competitiveness Program announced in July 2017 is expected to rationalize Bunge's cost structure and reengineer the way we operate, reducing our 2017 addressable baseline SG&A of $1.35 billion to $1.1 billion by 2020.\nWe reduced SG&A by $40 million in 2017 and expect to reduce it by an additional $60 million this year, totaling a $100 million reduction in 2018 as compared to the 2017 baseline. We have incurred a total of $69 million of program-related costs since inception, including $14 million this quarter.\nCash Flow\nCash used by operations in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $1.5 billion compared to cash used of $603 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in inventory, reflecting the improved agribusiness environment. Trailing four-quarter adjusted funds from operations was $811 million as of the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $19 million.\nOutlook\nWe expect 2018 to be a year of strong earnings growth, particularly in Agribusiness.\nIn Agribusiness, we are increasing our full-year EBIT outlook range to $800 million to $1.0 billion, primarily based on improved soy crush margins.\nIn Food & Ingredients, we are increasing our full-year EBIT outlook range to $290 to $310 million to account for the addition of our 70 percent ownership stake in Loders Croklaan, which we acquired in early March. Segment results are expected to improve sequentially.\nIn Sugar & Bioenergy, based on current sugar prices, we are reducing our full-year EBIT outlook range to $40 to $60 million. Results are expected to be seasonally weak until the second half of the year.\nIn Fertilizer, we continue to expect EBIT of approximately $25 million.\nSavings from the Global Competitiveness Program and industrial and supply chain initiatives are reflected in our segment EBIT ranges.\nAdditionally, we expect the following for 2018, which incorporates Loders Croklaan: a tax rate range of 18% to 22%; net interest expense in the range of $255 to $275 million; capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, of which approximately $150 million is related to sugarcane milling; and depreciation, depletion and amortization of approximately $690 million.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nBunge Limited's management at 8:00 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 to discuss the company's results.\nAdditionally, a slide presentation to accompany the discussion of results will be posted on www.bunge.com .\nTo listen to the call, please dial (877) 883-0383.

Bunge has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures below. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nTotal Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT, adjusted\nBunge uses total segment earnings before interest and taxes (\"Total Segment EBIT\") to evaluate Bunge's operating performance. Total Segment EBIT is the aggregate of each of our five reportable segments' earnings before interest and taxes. Total Segment EBIT, adjusted, is calculated by excluding certain gains and charges as described above in \"Additional Financial Information\" from Total Segment EBIT. Total Segment EBIT and Total Segment EBIT, adjusted are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace net income (loss) attributable to Bunge, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Bunge's management believes these non-GAAP measures are a useful measure of its reportable segments' operating profitability, since the measures allow for an evaluation of segment performance without regard to their financing methods or capital structure. For this reason, operating performance measures such as these non-GAAP measures are widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries. These non-GAAP measures are not a measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.\nBelow is a reconciliation of Net income attributable to Bunge to Total Segment EBIT, adjusted:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n(US$ in millions)\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss) attributable to Bunge\n$\n(21)\n$\n47\nInterest income\n(8)\n(12)\nInterest expense\n70\n65\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n19\n28\n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n2\n6\nNoncontrolling interest share of interest and tax\n(1)\n(1)\nTotal Segment EBIT\n61\n133\nCertain (gains) and charges\n24\n6\nTotal Segment EBIT, adjusted\n$\n85\n$\n139\nNet Income (loss) per common share from continuing operations–diluted, adjusted\nNet income (loss) per common share from continuing operations-diluted, adjusted, excludes certain gains and charges and discontinued operations and is a non-GAAP financial measure. This measure is not a measure of earnings per common share-diluted, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. It should not be considered as an alternative to earnings per share-diluted or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

There was $100 million of SG&A determined not to be addressable through the GCP, leaving 2017 addressable baseline SG&A of $1.35 billion (\"Addressable Baseline\"). The items that are not addressable by the GCP relate to costs other than direct spending and personnel costs, such as amortization, bad debt charges and recoveries and financing fees and taxes.\nGCP savings are determined by comparing Adjusted Actual Addressable SG&A to the Addressable Baseline. Adjusted Actual Addressable SG&A is equal to the total reported SG&A minus the items not addressable by the GCP, plus or minus items such as:\nGCP program costs which include severance and related employee costs, consulting and professional costs and other costs specifically designated to the program, Changes in inflation and foreign exchange rates as compared to Addressable Baseline assumptions, Perimeter changes relating to acquisitions and divestitures and corporate transactions, Changes in variable compensation relating to business performance as compared to the Addressable Baseline assumptions, and Identified investments in new or enhanced capabilities.\nWe expect to reduce Actual Addressable SG&A from the Addressable Baseline level of $1.35 billion to $1.1 billion by 2020, achieving $250 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2019.\nAs previously announced, the Company has developed a high-level estimate of $200 - $300 million for the total pre-tax costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Global Competitiveness Program.\nNotes\n(1) Agribusiness:\n2018 first quarter EBIT includes charges related to the Company's Global Competitiveness Program of $(10) million [$(4) million for severance and other employee benefit costs and $(6) million for other program costs], all of which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2018 first quarter EBIT also includes $(1) million for severance and other employee benefits related to other industrial initiatives recorded in Cost of goods sold and a $1 million gain on the sale of a subsidiary.\n(2) Edible Oil Products:\n2018 first quarter EBIT includes charges related to the Company's Global Competitiveness Program of $(2) million [$(1) million for severance and other employee benefit costs and $(1) million for other program costs], all of which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, $(5) million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of IOI Loders Croklaan were incurred, all of which were included within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(3) Milling Products:\n2018 first quarter EBIT includes charges related to the Company's Global Competitiveness Program of $(1) million for other program costs, all of which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2018 first quarter EBIT also includes $(1) million for severance and other employee benefits related to other industrial initiatives recorded in Cost of goods sold.\n(4) Sugar & Bioenergy:\n2018 first quarter EBIT includes charges related to the Company's Global Competitiveness Program of $(1) million for other program costs, all of which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2018 first quarter EBIT also includes Sugar restructuring charges of $(3) million recorded in Cost of goods sold.\n2017 first quarter EBIT also includes Sugar restructuring charges of $(6) million recorded in Cost of goods sold.\n(5) Fertilizer:\n2018 first quarter EBIT includes $(1) million for severance and other employee benefits related to other industrial initiatives recorded in Cost of goods sold.\nNotes to Financial Tables:\n(6)\nSee Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\n(7)\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Bunge to Net income (loss) is as follows:\nQuarter Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss) attributable to Bunge\n$\n(21)\n$\n47\nEBIT attributable to noncontrolling interest\n3\n2\nNoncontrolling interest share of interest and tax\n(1)\n(1)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(19)\n$\n48\n(8)\nApproximately 7 million and 2 million outstanding stock options and contingently issuable restricted stock units were not dilutive and not included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, approximately 8 million weighted-average common shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible preference shares were not dilutive and not included in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\n(9)\nIncludes readily marketable inventories of $5,410 million and $4,056 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Of these amounts, $4,095 million and $2,767 million, respectively, can be attributable to merchandising activities.\n(10)\nThe Oilseed business included in our Agribusiness segment consists of our global activities related to the crushing of oilseeds (including soybeans, canola, rapeseed and sunflower seed) into protein meals and vegetable oils; the trading and distribution of oilseeds and oilseed products; and biodiesel production, which is primarily conducted through joint ventures.\nThe Grains business included in our Agribusiness segment consists primarily of our global grain origination activities, which principally conduct the purchasing, cleaning, drying, storing and handling of corn, wheat, barley, rice and oilseeds at our network of grain elevators; the logistical services for distribution of these commodities to our customer markets through our port terminals and transportation assets (including trucks, railcars, barges and ocean vessels); and financial services and activities for customers from whom we purchase commodities and other third parties.\n(11)\nIn accordance with new cash flow presentation requirements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, cash receipts from payments on beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. As such, we have made necessary changes to our cash flow presentation in current and prior periods presented, which resulted in an increase in cash inflows from investing activities and a corresponding decrease to cash from operating activities.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bunge-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300640787.html\nSOURCE Bunge Limited",
