    "text": "(Adds Snap statement)\nMay 22 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it had hired Snapchat maker Snap Inc's vice president of monetization engineering, Stuart Bowers, as VP of engineering, to work on its Autopilot software and other projects.\nTesla has seen the departure of several senior executives and also is flattening its management structure as it aims to improve efficiency and clear up production bottlenecks related to its new Model 3 sedan.\nSnap confirmed the move and said that Bowers had a passion for robotics and would be working on Tesla's semi-autonomous driving program, Autopilot. Tesla said he would work on that and other projects as well.\nBowers' job at Snap, monetization engineering, involved the social media company's advertising system.\nWebsite Cheddar first reported the move.
