The prime and subcontracting component goals include goals for small businesses, small businesses owned by women (WOSBs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs), and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones).\nEvery fiscal year, the SBA works with each agency to set their prime and subcontracting goals and their grades are based on the agreed upon goals. Each federal agency has a different small business prime contracting goal. The SBA ensures that the sum total of all of the goals exceeds the 23 percent target established by law.\nWHAT: Conference call on FY17 Small Business Federal Procurement Scorecard\nWHO: Ken Dodds, SBA's Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Government Contracting and Business Development\nWHEN: Tuesday, May 22, 3-4 p.m. EDT\nWHERE: Conference Call Dial-in Phone Number: is: 888-858-2144\nAccess Code: 5213070#\nHOW: Press must RSVP for the event\nto Tiffani.Clements@sba.gov by noon on May 22\nAbout the U.S. Small Business Administration\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration makes the American dream of business ownership a reality.
