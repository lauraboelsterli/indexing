(\" Spartan \" or the \" Company \") (TSX:SPE) is pleased to announce that it has obtained approval from the holders (the \" Spartan Shareholders \") of common shares of Spartan (the \" Spartan Shares \") at a special meeting of Spartan Shareholders (the \" Meeting \") held today to consider the proposed plan of arrangement (the \" Arrangement \") pursuant to which Vermilion Energy Inc. will acquire all of the outstanding Spartan Shares, as previously announced by Spartan on April 16, 2018.\nThe Arrangement was approved by: (i) 96.23% of the votes cast by Spartan Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting; and (ii) 95.85% of the votes cast by minority Spartan Shareholders (after excluding the Spartan Shares of those persons required by Multilateral Instrument 61-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators).\nFollowing the requisite Spartan Shareholder approvals having been obtained at the Meeting, Spartan obtained a final order of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta approving the Arrangement.

More particularly and without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the proposed Arrangement and closing of the Arrangement. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities that Spartan assumes, anticipates, plans, expects, believes, projects, aims, estimates or anticipates (and other similar expressions) will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. All of the forward-looking statements in this release are qualified by the assumptions that are stated or inherent in such forward-looking statements. Although Spartan believes these assumptions are reasonable, they are not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the forward-looking statements and the reader should not place undue reliance on these assumptions and such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.

Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained herein are made as at the date hereof and Spartan does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.
