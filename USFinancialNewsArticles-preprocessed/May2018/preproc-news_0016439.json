    "text": "VANCOUVER, May 8 (Reuters) - Nevsun Resources said on Tuesday that its board of directors had unanimously rejected a non-binding, unsolicited takeover proposal from Lundin Mining Corp and Euro Sun Mining, saying it was too low and had a “problematic structure”.\nNevsun said in a statement that the rejection followed an extensive engagement with fellow Canadian-based miner Lundin over several months with regard to a possible transaction.
