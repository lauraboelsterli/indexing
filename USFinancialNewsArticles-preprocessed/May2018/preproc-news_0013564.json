    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, May 4 (Reuters) - Argentina’s central bank said on Friday it increased its monetary policy rate by 675 basis points, and vowed to keep using all tools at its disposal in an effort to hit the country’s 15 percent inflation target for this year.\nThe bank said Friday’s rate hike was also aimed at stabilizing Argentina’s peso currency, which has weakened dramatically in recent days.\nReporting by Hugh Bronstein Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
