    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Approach Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: AREX) today reported first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Other Highlights\nMet quarterly production guidance with 11.3 MBoe/d, and increased daily crude oil production 3% over prior quarter Revenues of $28.8 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter Net loss was $7.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) was $7.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share Generated $13.7 million of EBITDAX (non-GAAP) Bank group unanimously reaffirmed $325 million borrowing base\nAdjusted net loss and EBITDAX are non-GAAP measures. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures” below for our definitions and reconciliations of adjusted net loss and EBITDAX to net loss.\nManagement Comment\nRoss Craft, Approach’s Chairman and CEO, commented, “We completed four wells during the second half of the quarter, two in our Pangea area and two in our Pangea West area. The two Pangea wells are performing above our 700 MBoe type curve. The two Pangea West wells are in the post-frac flowback and clean up stage. We delivered production of 11.3 MBoe/d, in line with guidance, and increased daily oil production quarter over quarter. We continue to experiment with our completion techniques and are pleased with the solid results we are realizing. We remain focused on operating substantially within cash flow and will align our annual capital expenditures as closely as possible within our anticipated annual cash flow.”\n“Looking forward we will continue to use our resources and experience to generate additional shareholder value. We see four key strategies that will add value to Approach: (1) continuing to improve recoveries in our core southern Midland Basin Wolfcamp shale acreage; (2) maintaining our industry-leading operating efficiencies and costs; (3) continuing to strengthen our balance sheet; and (4) pursuing mergers and acquisitions that are accretive to shareholders and can fuel balanced and sustained growth.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nProduction for first quarter 2018 totaled 1,020 Mboe, or 11.3 MBoe/d, made up of 27% oil, 34% NGLs and 39% natural gas. Average realized commodity prices for first quarter 2018, before the effect of commodity derivatives, were $60.04 per Bbl of oil, $20.84 per Bbl of NGLs and $2.15 per Mcf of natural gas. Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $26.71 per Boe for first quarter 2018.\nNet loss for first quarter 2018 was $7.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, on revenues of $28.8 million. Excluding the decrease in the fair value of our commodity derivatives of $0.4 million, adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2018 was $7.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for first quarter 2018 was $13.7 million. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures” below for our reconciliation of adjusted net loss and EBITDAX to net loss.\nLease operating expenses (“LOE”) averaged $5.16 per Boe, a 9% increase over the prior quarter, driven primarily by lease maintenance, winter related expenditures and facility repairs. We expect LOE per Boe to decrease from the current level in subsequent quarters. Production and ad valorem taxes averaged $2.45 per Boe, or 8.7% of oil, NGL and gas sales. Total general and administrative (“G&A”) costs averaged $6.44 per Boe, including cash G&A costs of $5.63 per Boe. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense averaged $15.37 per Boe. Interest expense totaled $5.9 million.\nOperations Update\nDuring the second half of the first quarter 2018, we completed four horizontal wells: two wells in the Wolfcamp A bench, one well in the Wolfcamp B bench and one well in the Wolfcamp C bench. The two wells completed in our Pangea area are tracking above our 700 MBoe type curve. The two wells completed in our Pangea West area are currently in the post-frac flowback and clean up stages. We are encouraged by the early results of these two wells. At March 31, 2018, we had six horizontal wells waiting on completion.\nCapital expenditures incurred during first quarter 2018 totaled $13.7 million and included $12.4 million for drilling and completion activities, and $1.3 million for infrastructure projects and equipment.\nLiquidity Update\nAt March 31, 2018, we had a $1 billion revolving credit facility in place, with a borrowing base and lender commitment amount of $325 million, and liquidity of $32.7 million. Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination was completed on May 1, 2018, and our borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments were reaffirmed at $325 million. See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial and Other Measures” below for our definition and calculation of liquidity.\nCommodity Derivatives Update\nWe enter into commodity derivatives positions to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations.

We have provided reconciliations below of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and on the Non-GAAP Financial Information page in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.approachresources.com .\nAdjusted Net Loss\nThis release contains the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share, which exclude (1) non-cash fair value loss (gain) on derivatives, (2) gain on debt extinguishment, (3) write-off of deferred tax assets, (4) tax effect and other discrete tax items. The amounts included in the calculation of adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share below were computed in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share are useful to investors because they provide readers with a meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of adjusted net loss to net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Loss $ (7,446 ) $ (140,768 ) Adjustments for certain items: Non-cash fair value loss (gain) on derivatives 397 (4,405 ) Gain on debt extinguishment — (5,053 ) Write-off of deferred tax assets — 139,090 Tax effect and other discrete tax items (1) (13 ) 3,600 Adjusted net loss $ (7,062 ) $ (7,536 ) Adjusted net loss per diluted share $ (0.07 ) $ (0.11 ) (1) The estimated income tax impacts on adjustments to net loss are computed based upon a statutory rate of 21% and 35%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, this includes the tax impact of a tax shortfall related to share-based compensation of $0.1 million, and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nEBITDAX\nWe define EBITDAX as net loss, plus (1) exploration expense, (2) depletion, depreciation and amortization expense, (3) share-based compensation expense, (4) non-cash fair value loss (gain) on derivatives, (5) gain on debt extinguishment, (6) interest expense, net, and (7) income tax (benefit) provision. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flow as determined by GAAP. The amounts included in the calculation of EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled to the GAAP measure of net loss because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund development and exploration activities. This measure is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of EBITDAX to net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Loss $ (7,446 ) $ (140,768 ) Exploration — 1,043 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 15,680 17,962 Share-based compensation 828 1,159 Non-cash fair value loss (gain) on derivatives 397 (4,405 ) Gain on debt extinguishment — (5,053 ) Interest expense, net 5,886 5,463 Income tax (benefit) provision (1,610 ) 138,700 EBITDAX $ 13,735 $ 14,101 Liquidity\nLiquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company’s ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company’s financial statements and may further be subject to covenants in a company’s loan agreements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\nThe table below summarizes our liquidity at March 31, 2018 (in thousands).\nLiquidity at March 31, 2018 Borrowing base $ 325,000 Cash and cash equivalents 22 Long-term debt – Credit Facility (292,000 ) Undrawn letters of credit (325 ) Liquidity $ 32,697\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006833/en/\nApproach Resources Inc.\nSuzanne Ogle, 817-989-9000\nVice President – Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\nir@approachresources.com\nSource: Approach Resources Inc.",
