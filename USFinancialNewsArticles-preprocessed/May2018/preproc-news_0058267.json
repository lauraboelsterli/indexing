Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attends a news conference of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in St. Petersburg, Russia May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\n“When we see the gradual expansion of NATO military structures towards our borders..., this of course in no way creates security and stability on the continent,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Monday.
