    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LiveWorld, Inc. (OTC Markets: LVWD), today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s revenues for the first quarter were approximately $2.4 million, as compared to the $2.4 million for the first quarter in 2017.\nThe Company had a net loss for the quarter of approximately $132,000, or 5% of total revenues, as compared to the net loss of approximately $320,000, or 13% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company finished the first quarter with approximately $656,000 in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to the approximately $2.3 million at the end of 2017. Accounts receivable was approximately $2.1 million as of March 31, 2018 which was an increase of approximately $1.8 million, or 607% from the accounts receivable balance of approximately $304,000 as of December 31, 2017. This change in the cash and accounts receivable is a result of the renewal process and timing of payments with some clients. The cash position as of May 15, 2018 is approximately $1.9 million.\n“In the first quarter of 2018 we cut our operating loss by almost 60% or approximately $188,000,” said David Houston, Chief Financial Officer of LiveWorld. “We feel it is critical we make more strategic investments in our sales, marketing and product development efforts.”\nDetailed financial information may be downloaded at http://www.liveworld.com/ir (LiveWorld’s Investor Relations page) or at http://www.otcmarkets.com .\nAbout LiveWorld\nLiveWorld provides enterprise-class software and services for managing customer conversations in social media and messaging apps, on the web and mobile devices.
