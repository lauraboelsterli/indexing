    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR) (\"Matador\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018. A short slide presentation summarizing the highlights of Matador's first quarter 2018 earnings release is also included on the Company's website at www.matadorresources.com on the Presentations & Webcasts page under the Investors tab.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nQ1 2018 average daily oil equivalent production increased 4% sequentially to a record quarterly high of 45,300 BOE per day (58% oil) as compared to Q4 2017. Average daily oil production increased 7% sequentially to 26,500 barrels per day and average daily natural gas production decreased 1% sequentially to 112.9 million cubic feet of natural gas per day as compared to Q4 2017. Q1 2018 Delaware Basin average daily oil equivalent production increased 7% sequentially to a record quarterly high of 37,200 BOE per day (63% oil) as compared to Q4 2017. Delaware Basin average daily oil production increased 11% to 23,400 barrels per day and Delaware Basin average daily natural gas production remained essentially flat at 82.8 million cubic feet per day as compared to Q4 2017. Q1 2018 net income (GAAP basis) was $59.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share. Q1 2018 adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $39.1 million, or $0.36 per diluted common share. Q1 2018 adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, and certain other items (\"Adjusted EBITDA,\" a non-GAAP financial measure) were $117.3 million. The Leo Thorsness 13-24S-33E AR #211H (Leo Thorsness #211H) well, Matador's first Wolfcamp A-Lower completion in its Antelope Ridge asset area, flowed 2,906 BOE per day (72% oil), consisting of 2,087 barrels of oil per day and 4.9 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, during a 24-hour initial potential test. The Leo Thorsness #211H well had the highest 24-hour initial potential test rate of any well Matador has drilled to date in the Delaware Basin.\nNote: All references to net income, adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA reported throughout this earnings release are those values attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders after giving effect to any net income, net loss or Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, attributable to third-party non-controlling interests, including in Matador's midstream affiliate, San Mateo Midstream, LLC (\"San Mateo\" or the \"Joint Venture\"). For a definition of adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted common share and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial metrics to their comparable GAAP metrics, please see \"Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nManagement Comments\nJoseph Wm. Foran, Matador's Chairman and CEO, commented, \"The first quarter of 2018 was another strong quarter for Matador marked by steadily improving financial and operational execution and by the 15 th consecutive quarter in which Matador has met or exceeded consensus estimates. We continue to be pleased with the consistently strong well results our asset teams are achieving throughout our acreage position in the Delaware Basin and are especially excited by the initial results from our first three wells in the Antelope Ridge asset area, which confirm our previous expectations that Antelope Ridge would soon become another key operating area for Matador in the northern Delaware Basin.\n\"Our midstream team, San Mateo, completed the planned expansion of the Black River Processing Plant on time and on budget and entered into a strategic relationship with Plains for oil gathering, both of which should deliver significant value to San Mateo customers, including Matador. With the completion of the Black River Processing Plant expansion, the strategic relationship with Plains and San Mateo's increasing salt water disposal capacity, San Mateo has begun to attract business from producers with operations in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas. Further, our operational, marketing and midstream teams have worked together to ensure takeaway at favorable rates for our oil, natural gas and NGLs throughout our various asset areas. We believe our first quarter results confirm Matador's commitment to delivering consistent results while staying nimble and opportunistic in our ongoing efforts to increase shareholder value.\"\nSequential and year-over-year quarterly comparisons of selected financial and operating items are shown in the following table:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net Production Volumes: (1) Oil (MBbl) (2) 2,382 2,269 1,649 Natural gas (Bcf) (3) 10.2 10.5 7.9 Total oil equivalent (MBOE) (4) 4,075 4,022 2,970 Average Daily Production Volumes: (1) Oil (Bbl/d) 26,465 24,665 18,323 Natural gas (MMcf/d) (5) 112.9 114.3 88.1 Total oil equivalent (BOE/d) (6) 45,273 43,718 32,999 Average Sales Prices: Oil, without realized derivatives (per Bbl) $ 62.20 $ 53.66 $ 50.72 Oil, with realized derivatives (per Bbl) $ 60.40 $ 52.30 $ 49.73 Natural gas, without realized derivatives (per Mcf) $ 3.33 $ 4.12 $ 3.94 Natural gas, with realized derivatives (per Mcf) $ 3.33 $ 4.12 $ 3.86 Revenues (millions): Oil and natural gas revenues $ 182.0 $ 165.1 $ 114.8 Third-party midstream services revenues $ 3.1 $ 3.3 $ 1.6 Realized loss on derivatives $ (4.3 ) $ (3.1 ) $ (2.2 ) Operating Expenses (per BOE): Production taxes, transportation and processing $ 4.37 $ 4.46 $ 3.98 Lease operating $ 5.44 $ 4.68 $ 5.31 Plant and other midstream services operating $ 1.04 $ 1.16 $ 0.79 Depletion, $ 13.59 $ 13.53 $ 11.45 General and administrative (7) $ 4.40 $ 4.06 $ 5.50 Total (8) $ 28.84 $ 27.89 $ 27.03 Net income (millions) (9) $ 59.9 $ 38.3 $ 44.0 Earnings per common share (diluted) (9) $ 0.55 $ 0.35 $ 0.44 Adjusted net income (millions) (9)(10) $ 39.1 $ 27.2 $ 17.4 Adjusted earnings per common share (diluted) (9)(11) $ 0.36 $ 0.25 $ 0.17 Adjusted EBITDA (millions) (9)(12) $ 117.3 $ 108.6 $ 70.0 (1) Production volumes reported in two streams: oil and natural gas, including both dry and liquids-rich natural gas.\n(2) One thousand barrels of oil.\n(3) One billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n(4) One thousand barrels of oil equivalent, estimated using a conversion ratio of one barrel of oil per six thousand cubic feet of natural gas.\n(5) Millions of cubic feet of natural gas per day.\n(6) Barrels of oil equivalent per day, estimated using a conversion ratio of one barrel of oil per six thousand cubic feet of natural gas.\n(7) Includes approximately $1.03, $1.04 and $1.40 per BOE of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2018, the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively.\n(8) Total does not include the impact of full-cost ceiling impairment charges or immaterial accretion expenses.\n(9) Attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders.\n(10) Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Matador has a 25% working interest in this well. Matador is encouraged by the results of this latest Wolfcamp D test in its exploratory Twin Lakes asset area and looks forward to spudding and operating its upcoming Wolfcamp D test in the western portion of its Twin Lakes acreage during the second quarter of 2018.\nMidstream and Marketing Highlights\nIn late March 2018, San Mateo completed on time and on budget the expansion of its Black River cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Eddy County, New Mexico (the \"Black River Processing Plant\"), adding an incremental designed inlet capacity of 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and bringing the total designed inlet capacity of the Black River Processing Plant to 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The expanded Black River Processing Plant supports Matador's exploration and development activities in the Delaware Basin and, with the expanded capacity, San Mateo can now offer natural gas processing services to other producers as well. In March 2018, San Mateo completed a natural gas liquids (\"NGL\") pipeline connection at the tailgate of the Black River Processing Plant to the NGL pipeline owned by EPIC Y Grade Pipeline, LP. The NGL connection ensures Matador and other San Mateo customers firm NGL takeaway out of the Delaware Basin. As compared to trucking the NGLs out of the area, this NGL connection should also allow Matador and other San Mateo customers to achieve increased NGL recoveries and improved pricing realizations through lower transportation and fractionation costs, among other benefits. On January 22, 2018, San Mateo and Matador announced a strategic relationship between a subsidiary of San Mateo and a subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA) (\"Plains\") to gather and transport crude oil for Matador and additional customers in Eddy County, New Mexico. Subsidiaries of San Mateo and Plains have agreed to work together through a joint tariff arrangement and related transactions to offer producers located within a joint development area of approximately 400,000 acres in Eddy County, New Mexico crude oil transportation services from the wellhead to Midland, Texas with access to other end markets. Please see San Mateo's and Matador's January 22, 2018 press releases for additional details regarding this strategic relationship. During the first quarter and early in the second quarter of 2018, Matador entered into agreements with third-party natural gas transmission companies, including most recently with El Paso Natural Gas Company, L.L.C., to secure firm takeaway capacity for all of its anticipated natural gas volumes in both the Wolf and Rustler Breaks asset areas.\nAcreage Acquisitions\nFrom January 1 through April 30, 2018, Matador acquired approximately 3,500 net leasehold and mineral acres in and around its existing acreage positions in the Delaware Basin.\nBorrowing Base Increase\nOn March 5, 2018, Matador's lenders completed their review of the Company's oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2017, and as a result, the borrowing base under the Company's revolving credit facility was increased to $725 million. Matador elected to keep the lenders' borrowing commitment at $400 million and the maximum facility amount remained at $500 million.\nCorporate Credit Upgrade\nOn March 20, 2018, Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") upgraded Matador's Corporate Family Rating to B1 from B2 and its senior unsecured notes to B2 from B3. In increasing the Company's credit rating, Moody's noted Matador's (i) growing production and reserves, large and repeatable drilling inventory and growth potential, particularly in the Delaware Basin, (ii) fiscal discipline through commodity price cycles and (iii) management's track record.\nOperations Update\nDrilling and Completion Activities\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Matador continued to focus on the exploration, delineation and development of the Company's Delaware Basin acreage position in Loving County, Texas and Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. Matador began 2018 operating six drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin and continued to operate six drilling rigs throughout the first quarter and as of May 2, 2018. Matador currently expects to continue operating six drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin throughout 2018, including three rigs in the Rustler Breaks asset area, one rig in the Wolf and Jackson Trust asset areas, one rig in the Arrowhead, Ranger and Twin Lakes asset areas and one rig in the Antelope Ridge asset area. Depending on commodity prices, costs, opportunities in new asset areas like Antelope Ridge, liquidity and other factors, Matador may consider adding a seventh rig towards the end of the year.\nOne of the three rigs operating in the Rustler Breaks asset area is also expected to drill at least two salt water disposal wells in the area for San Mateo during 2018. As a result, the Company expects this rig will spend only approximately three-quarters of the year drilling oil and natural gas wells. Matador anticipates that it will begin drilling these two salt water disposal wells during the second quarter of 2018.\nProduction Results\nAverage daily oil equivalent production increased 4% sequentially from 43,700 BOE per day (56% oil) in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 45,300 BOE per day (58% oil) in the first quarter of 2018, a record quarterly high for Matador.\nAverage daily oil production increased 7% sequentially from 24,700 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 26,500 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018, also a record quarterly high, and well above the Company's expectations that oil production would remain essentially flat between the two quarters. The better-than-expected oil production was attributable, in part, to strong initial well results from all three wells completed and turned to sales in the Antelope Ridge asset area, as well as to the excellent well results achieved from the three-well Garrett pad in the Rustler Breaks asset area. In addition, a key acreage trade and other land-related improvements increased Matador's working interests and, therefore, its share of production in several wells in the Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas.\nAverage daily natural gas production decreased 1% sequentially from 114.3 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 112.9 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2018, better than the Company's expectations for a 3 to 5% decline between the two quarters. The small decline in natural gas production in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to fewer Wolfcamp B-Blair completions in the Rustler Breaks asset area in the first quarter as compared to previous quarters, as well as to the continued decline in natural gas production from the Haynesville shale.\nRealized Commodity Prices\nMatador's weighted average realized oil price, excluding derivatives, increased 16% sequentially from $53.66 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $62.20 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018. Average oil price differentials improved from ($1.65) per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 to ($0.66) per barrel in the first quarter of 2018.\nMatador's weighted average realized natural gas price, excluding derivatives, decreased 19% sequentially from $4.12 per thousand cubic feet in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $3.33 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter of 2018. Matador realized an NGL-related uplift of $0.48 per thousand cubic feet above the average NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1.20 per thousand cubic feet in the fourth quarter of 2017. Matador is a two-stream reporter, and the revenues associated with its NGLs are included in the weighted average realized natural gas price.\nOperating Expenses\nOn a unit-of-production basis, production taxes, transportation and processing expenses decreased 2% sequentially from $4.46 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $4.37 per BOE in the first quarter of 2018, despite higher production taxes attributable to the 10% sequential increase in oil and natural gas revenues. General and administrative expenses per BOE increased 8% sequentially from $4.06 per BOE (which was a post-IPO low for general and administrative expenses on a unit-of-production basis) to $4.40 per BOE, on target with the Company's expectations. Lease operating expenses per BOE increased 16% from $4.68 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $5.44 per BOE in the first quarter of 2018; however, compared to the first quarter of 2017, lease operating expenses per BOE increased by only 2%. Lease operating expenses are typically higher in the first quarter of each year, and the Company expects lease operating expenses in subsequent quarters to return to the $4.50 to $5.00 per BOE range achieved last year during all but the first quarter. Depletion, expenses per BOE remained essentially flat sequentially at $13.59 per BOE in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $13.53 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWells Completed and Turned to Sales\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Matador completed and turned to sales a total of 32 gross (16.2 net) wells in its various operating areas, including 31 gross (15.2 net) horizontal wells and one gross (1.0 net) vertical well deepening. The 31 gross (15.2 net) horizontal wells included 16 gross (13.4 net) operated wells and 15 gross (1.8 net) non-operated wells. Essentially all of the Company's operated and non-operated drilling and completions activity in the first quarter of 2018 was undertaken in the Delaware Basin, as summarized in the table below.\nOperated Non-Operated Total Gross Operated Asset/Operating Area Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Well Completion Intervals Rustler Breaks 9 7.8 7 1.3 16 9.1 4-WC A-XY, 2-WC A-Lower, 2-WC B-Blair, 1-Morrow (vertical)\nArrowhead 1 0.7 - - 1 0.7 1-2BS Ranger 2 1.9 2 0.1 4 2.0 1-2BS, 1-3BS Wolf/Jackson Trust 2 1.0 - - 2 1.0 1-WC A-XY, 1-WC A-Lower Twin Lakes - - 1 0.2 1 0.2 Antelope Ridge 3 3.0 2 0.1 5 3.1 1-WC A-XY, 1-WC A-Lower, 1-1BS Delaware Basin 17 14.4 12 1.7 29 16.1 Seven separate intervals tested in Q1 2018 Eagle Ford Shale - - - - - - No Eagle Ford activity in Q1 2018 Haynesville Shale - - 3 0.1 3 0.1 Total 17 14.4 15 1.8 32 16.2 Note: WC = Wolfcamp; BS = Bone Spring. For example, 1-2BS indicates one Second Bone Spring completion and 4-WC A-XY indicates four Wolfcamp A-XY completions in the first quarter of 2018.\nDelaware Basin Acreage Acquisitions\nFrom January 1 through April 30, 2018, Matador acquired approximately 3,500 net leasehold and mineral acres, mostly in and around its existing acreage in the Delaware Basin. Matador has incurred capital expenditures of approximately $30 million since January 1, 2018 to acquire these leasehold and mineral interests.\nMatador continues to improve and block up its acreage position in its various asset areas throughout the Delaware Basin. As a result of these efforts, during the first quarter of 2018, Matador closed a key acreage trade and concluded other land-related improvements to its operating position that resulted in significant increases to both the working and net revenue interests in a number of recently drilled wells in both its Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas, including almost doubling its interests (to approximately a 97% working interest) in the three recently drilled and better-than-expected Garrett wells in the Rustler Breaks asset area. Matador believes that these improvements to the Company's working and net revenue interests not only enhance Matador's operating position in the existing producing units, but should also lead to multiple, high-value locations for future drilling in and around these recently drilled wells. Matador incurred approximately $14.5 million in additional drilling and completion expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 directly attributable to the increased working interests resulting from these land-related efforts.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Matador's capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping operated and non-operated wells totaled approximately $170.5 million, of which $14.5 million was directly attributable to the increased working interests in several recently drilled wells as a result of the acreage trade and other land-related efforts noted above under \"Delaware Basin Acreage Acquisitions.\" The remaining $156.0 million in capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping wells compared to Matador's estimates of approximately $130.0 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nOther than the capital expenditures attributable to the positive land efforts previously noted, the majority of the capital expenditures above Matador's first quarter estimates was attributable to the timing of operations, including the following:\n(1) One more operated well was completed and turned to sales than originally estimated in the first quarter of 2018, and completion operations for three operated wells that were scheduled to be concluded in the second quarter of 2018 were substantially completed by the end of the first quarter as a result of completion operations proceeding ahead of schedule. Although some of these costs were already included in the Company's first quarter 2018 estimates, incremental costs associated with these operations in the first quarter were approximately $8.0 million;\n(2) Operations on the two additional salt water disposal wells scheduled to be drilled for San Mateo in the Rustler Breaks asset area in 2018, and accounted for in the Company's estimated 2018 midstream capital expenditures, were deferred and did not begin during the first quarter of 2018 as originally planned, and, as a result, the rig Matador expected to drill the salt water disposal wells continued drilling oil and natural gas wells. Incremental costs associated with these additional drilling operations in the first quarter were approximately $3.5 million; and\n(3) An additional five gross (0.7 net) non-operated wells were completed and turned to sales in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the Company's expectations as a result of operations on those wells being concluded faster than the Company had projected. Incremental costs associated with this additional non-operated activity in the first quarter were approximately $4.5 million.\nThe remaining $10.0 million in capital expenditures associated with drilling, completing and equipping wells in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to additional start-up costs associated with Matador's first three wells drilled in the Antelope Ridge asset area and longer-than-anticipated post-stimulation flowback operations on those three Antelope Ridge wells and for several newly completed wells in Matador's other asset areas during the first quarter of 2018. The Company anticipates future well costs in the Antelope Ridge area will improve as it continues to drill and complete additional wells in this asset area. The Company also expects that the extended post-stimulation flowback operations necessary on several wells in the first quarter will not be required for newly completed wells in subsequent quarters.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Matador's capital expenditures for midstream activities totaled approximately $23.3 million, representing 51% of San Mateo's capital expenditures of $45.7 million. Midstream capital expenditures of $23.3 million compared to Matador's estimate of $28.0 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $52.8 million in cash and restricted cash, no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and approximately $2.1 million in outstanding letters of credit. Matador's net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.4x at March 31, 2018 and was unchanged from December 31, 2017.\nHedging Positions\nAs of May 2, 2018, Matador had approximately 55% of its anticipated oil production and approximately 40% of its anticipated natural gas production hedged for the remainder of 2018 based on the midpoint of its 2018 production guidance. In addition, Matador had various Midland-Cushing oil basis swaps in place for approximately 3.5 million barrels of oil, or approximately 55% of its anticipated Delaware Basin oil production, for the remainder of 2018.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's open derivative financial instruments for the remainder of 2018 as of May 2, 2018.\nWeighted Average\nPrice Floor\n($/Bbl or $/MMBtu)\nWeighted Average\nPrice Ceiling\n($/Bbl or $/MMBtu)\nVolume Hedged\n(Bbl or MMBtu)\n2-Way Costless Collars Oil (WTI) $ 44.27 $ 60.29 1,920,000 Oil (LLS) $ 45.00 $ 63.05 480,000 Natural Gas $ 2.58 $ 3.67 11,200,000 Weighted Average\nPrice Floor\n($/Bbl)\nWeighted Average\nPrice (Short Call)\n($/Bbl)\nWeighted Average\nPrice (Long Call)\n($/Bbl)\nVolume Hedged\n(Bbl)\n3-Way Costless Collars Oil (WTI) $ 50.08 $ 63.50 $ 66.68 1,280,000 Weighted Average Price\n($/Bbl)\nVolume Hedged\n(Bbl)\nOil Basis Swaps Midland-Cushing Oil Basis Differential ($1.02 ) 3,480,000 The following is a summary of the Company's open derivative financial instruments for 2019 as of May 2, 2018.\nWeighted Average\nPrice Floor\n($/Bbl)\nWeighted Average\nPrice Ceiling\n($/Bbl)\nVolume Hedged\n(Bbl)\n2-Way Costless Collars Oil (WTI) $ 50.00 $ 64.75 2,400,000 Second Quarter 2018 Production Estimates\nMatador estimates that both its average daily oil production and its average daily natural gas production will increase approximately 3 to 4% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2018, with average daily oil production of approximately 27,500 barrels per day and average daily natural gas production of approximately 117.0 million cubic feet per day at the midpoint of the estimated range.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a live conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time to review its first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. \"GAAP\" means Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA helps it evaluate its operating performance and compare its results of operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, , accretion of asset retirement obligations, property impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses, certain other non-cash items and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and net gain or loss on asset sales and inventory impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined by GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components of understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. The following table presents the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively, that are of a historical nature.\nThree Months Ended (In thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation to Net Income: Net income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders $ 59,894 $ 38,335 $ 43,984 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries 5,030 4,106 1,916 Net income 64,924 42,441 45,900 Interest expense 8,491 8,336 8,455 Total income tax benefit â€” (8,157 ) â€” Depletion, 55,369 54,436 33,992 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 364 353 300 Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (10,416 ) 11,734 (20,631 ) Stock-based compensation expense 4,179 4,166 4,166 Net gain on asset sales and inventory impairment â€” â€” (7 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 122,911 113,309 72,175 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries (5,657 ) (4,690 ) (2,216 ) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders $ 117,254 $ 108,619 $ 69,959 Three Months Ended (In thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Unaudited Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 136,149 $ 76,609 $ 61,309 Net change in operating assets and liabilities (21,364) 36,886 2,455 Interest expense, net of non-cash portion 8,126 7,971 8,411 Current income tax benefit â€” (8,157) â€” Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries (5,657) (4,690) (2,216) Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders $ 117,254 $ 108,619 $ 69,959 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Common Share\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted common share. These non-GAAP items are measured as net income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders, adjusted for dollar and per share impact of certain items, including unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, the impact of full cost-ceiling impairment charges, if any, and non-recurring transaction costs for certain acquisitions or other non-recurring expense items, along with the related tax effect for all periods. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies. The Company believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted common share provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of the Company's performance across periods and to the performance of the Company's peers. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for items of income and expense that are often excluded by industry analysts and other users of the Company's financial statements in evaluating the Company's performance. The table below reconciles adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted common share to their most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Unaudited Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation to Net Income: Net income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders $ 59,894 $ 38,335 $ 43,984 Total income tax benefit â€” (8,157 ) â€” Income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders before taxes 59,894 30,178 43,984 Less non-recurring and unrealized charges to income before taxes: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (10,416 ) 11,734 (20,631 ) Net gain on asset sales and inventory impairment â€” â€” (7 ) Non-recurring transaction costs associated with the formation of San Mateo â€” â€” 3,458 Adjusted income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders before taxes 49,478 41,912 26,804 Income tax provision (1) 10,390 14,669 9,381 Adjusted net income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders (non-GAAP) $ 39,088 $ 27,243 $ 17,423 outstanding, including participating securities - basic 108,913 107,693 99,799 Dilutive effect of options and restricted stock units 499 492 499 Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 109,412 108,185 100,298 Adjusted earnings per share attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders (non-GAAP) Basic $ 0.36 $ 0.25 $ 0.17 Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.25 $ 0.17 (1) Estimated using federal statutory tax rate in effect for the period.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006675/en/\nMatador Resources Company\nMac Schmitz, 972-371-5225\nCapital Markets Coordinator\ninvestors@matadorresources.com\nSource: Matador Resources Company",
