    "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned his supporters against being \"complacent\" this fall, asking voters to send more Republicans to Congress while crediting Democrats with \"sticking together\" to oppose his agenda.\nTrump traveled to Nashville, Tennessee , as he steps up his efforts to stop Democrats aiming to regain control of the House or Senate -- if not both.\n\"We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half,\" Trump said of Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn , who's running for a Senate seat. \"To keep on winning, you have to vote Republican in November.\"\nTrump also headlined a fundraiser for Blackburn, who is expected to face Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker , who is retiring. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump's plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority.\nTrump criticized Bredesen for being backed by national Democrats, including the Senate and House leaders.\n\"He's a tool of Chuck Schumer and of course the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi,\" Trump said. Earlier this month, House Democratic Leader Pelosi criticized Trump's rhetoric and policies on immigrants after he called members of the international gang \"animals.\"\nTrump added that Bredesen donated to Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign in 2016, saying, \"Phil Bredesen supported her and he supported her ideas.\"\nTrump plans a series of political rallies and events in the coming months to boost Republicans and brand Democrats as obstructionists to his agenda. He says his supporters can't sit back and relax this fall after working to elect him in 2016. \"That's the worst thing that can happen,\" he said.\n\"In November, we will reverse a trend,\" Trump added, alluding to recent precedent in which the party holding the White House tends to lose congressional seats.\nHe said of Democrats, \"They're bad at everything but they're good at sticking together,\" and appealed for GOP unity come November.\nThe president held a similar rally in Indiana earlier this month, appearing with Republican businessman Mike Braun and ripping Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly as a \"swamp person\" who refused to aid the GOP agenda. Trump will also raise money for GOP candidates in Texas on Thursday.\nTrump is using the campaign appearances to mobilize his core backers by highlighting his accomplishments in office, like improving economic indicators and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and resurrecting some of his go-to lines from the 2016 campaign.\n\"I don't want to cause a problem, but in the end, Mexico's gonna pay for the wall,\" Trump said of his signature campaign promise.\nMexican President Enrique Pena Nieto quickly replied to Trump Tuesday, writing on his Twitter account -- in English, which Pena Nieto seldom does -- \"NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).\"\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump raised the prospect of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe affecting the November elections and blamed Democrats for \"Collusion.\" On Twitter, he said the \"13 Angry Democrats\" on Mueller's team \"will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls.\" Mueller is a Republican.\nTrump has also used his Twitter page to boost California Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox, hoping to strengthen the party's chances of securing a spot on the ballot in November. He has also set his sights on Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking re-election in a state Trump carried in a landslide. Both states have primaries June 5.\nTennessee has a history of electing centrist senators and the race could be complicated by Corker's up-and-down relationship with Trump. Corker once said Trump had turned the White House into an \"adult day care center\" and the president tweeted that Corker \"couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee.\"\nYet Corker was in the Oval Office on Saturday, receiving praise from the president for his help in securing the release of an American imprisoned in Venezuela. The breakthrough happened after Corker held a surprise meeting in Caracas with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Corker also greeted Trump at the Nashville airport Tuesday, joined by Blackburn and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., among other dignitaries.\nCorker has called Bredesen a friend and said he won't actively campaign against him.\nTrump offered an early endorsement of Blackburn in April, tweeting that she is \"a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime.\"\nBlackburn, who served on Trump's transition team, has embraced the president and called herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\"\nBredesen, who is attempting to become the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in Tennessee since Al Gore in 1990, has aired TV ads in which he says that he's \"not running against Donald Trump\" and that he learned long ago to \"separate the message from the messenger.\"",
