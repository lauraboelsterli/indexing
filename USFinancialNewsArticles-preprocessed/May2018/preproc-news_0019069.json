    "text": "8 COMMENTS A FEW WEEKS ago, as I tapped away at my iPhone, my toddler tugged at my leg. I asked her to please wait because Mom was doing something very important.\nSaying this was easier than confessing the truth, which was: “Mom’s shamelessly scouring the internet for the dress Meghan Markle just wore in London.”\nAlas, that green floral Self Portrait dress was already sold out. Clearly, I wasn’t the first, nor will I be the last, woman determined to copy the sartorial choices of the former “Suits” actress who’ll walk down the aisle with Prince Harry on May 19 and ascend to duchess status. In the tradition of Lady Diana and Kate Middleton, Ms. Markle, already a tabloid staple, is en route to becoming a style icon. Entire websites, like What Meghan Wore and Meghan’s Mirror, are dedicated to tracking her every tailored coat and Manolo Blahnik “BB” heel. And, like Ms. Middleton before her, Ms. Markle wields the power to instantly sell out her preferred pieces—from skinny jeans by Welsh brand Hiut to Everlane’s Day Tote.\nMs. Markle in a tan, below-the-knee Joseph skirt and Wolford turtleneck this past December. Photo: Getty Images Her “secret sauce,” according to Amanda Dishaw, editorial director of Meghan’s Mirror, is rare among royals: “Meghan is accessible.”\nMs. Dishaw pointed to her cheekily oversize white shirts and distressed denim, like the Misha Nonoo/Mother combo she wore in her public debut with Prince Harry last year; her signature messy bun; and mismatched earrings (a Zofia Smith design in one ear, Gabriela Artigas in the other): “It boils down to polished imperfection.”\nMany average, working women can get on board with imperfection. Venus Wong, 25, a content director in London at media startup Benku8, was inspired by photos of Ms. Markle in a tan, below-the-knee Joseph skirt and Wolford turtleneck this past December. She assembled a similar ensemble, mostly from her closet: “My outfit was a homage to hers, but I still made it my own, and I spent less than $20 on the whole look.”\n‘ Is it embarrassing for grown women to copy princess style? ’\nYes, even those who lack a royal budget or Ms. Markle’s yoga-toned body can swipe her styling tricks, like unexpectedly wearing a tailored pantsuit to an evening event, as she recently did in black Alexander McQueen. (Her jacket alone cost $1,995, but let’s focus on the principle.)\nIs it embarrassing, not to mention sadly conformist, for grown women to copy this nouveau-princess style? Jessica Morgan, co-author of the snarky fashion blog, Go Fug Yourself and co-author of the novel, “The Royal We,” said she wasn’t above buying Ms. Markle’s Mother jeans. “I fundamentally think that people should not be embarrassed about where they get their fashion inspiration,” said Ms. Morgan, who is 42. “Who hasn’t seen a friend wearing a cute blazer over a dress and decided to try it themselves? This is sort of how fashion works.”\nOf course, some Markle staples don’t exactly translate to everyday life for us commoners. The masses can’t countenance a $75,000 Ralph and Russo couture dress like the one Ms. Markle wore for her engagement photos, both in terms of price and wearability (it featured a sheer top with strategically placed stitching). And God save us from the strappy stilettos Ms. Markle braves at her many public engagements. “Meghan’s [shoes] are always chic, but they scream ‘I was driven here in a car,’” said Jessica Wakeman, a 34-year-old editor and Markle devotee in Brooklyn.\nYet the “Meghan Effect” on Ms. Wakeman is so powerful, it even extends to archival looks from Ms. Markle’s now-deleted Instagram feed. “She had a lot of pics of herself traveling around Italy wearing a Panama hat,” Ms. Wakeman said. “I have one, too, which I am self-conscious about wearing because hats are so tricky, but she’s inspired me to give it another go this summer.”\nSKIP THE TIARA // Three Looks Commoners Could Safely Consider Photo: Getty Images (Meghan Markle)\nUNFUSSY TUX\nMs. Markle’s evening pantsuit look is eminently stealable.
