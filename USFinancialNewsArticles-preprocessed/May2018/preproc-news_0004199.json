One of the six black rhinos due to be relocated to Chad is seen in an enclosure at Addo Elephant National Park, near Addo, South Africa, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Ed Stoddard\n“We have been using the history of conservation success in South Africa to repopulate other areas in Africa,” Andrew Parker, director of conservation at African Parks, told Reuters as a hulking rhino lumbered about its holding pen below him.\nThe Chad-bound rhinos were in the fortified enclosures or “bomas” for three months in preparation for their long haul.\nThe animals have been fed lucerne, a kind of super-nutritious hay, the past few weeks. It will be initially provided to them in Chad as they adjust their diet to new trees and shrubs.\nSecurity has been tight: the animals’ location was kept under wraps, they will be given a police escort to the airport, and in Chad they will be dehorned and fitted with transponders.\nJumbo-sized logistics and planning go into such an operation: the animals were tranquilized in Marakele National Park in northern South Africa and then brought to Addo, which has better facilities.\nCranes hoisted the crates containing the rhinos onto flat-bed trucks and they will be monitored carefully by vets on the plane for the 15-hour trip which involves two stops.
