    "text": "ISTANBUL, May 25 (Reuters) - Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek will tell investors at meetings next week that the simplification of monetary policy will continue, he said on Friday.\nSimsek also told broadcaster NTV in an interview that there were no tax hikes on the agenda. Investors have long called for a simplification of Turkeyâ€™s complex system of using multiple interest rates to set policy.\nSimsek and Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya will travel to London next week to meet with investors, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
