    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 1:29 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Trump says China has 'much to give' in trade negotiations - Twitter\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said “nothing has happened” with China’s ZTE Corp ( 000063.SZ ) and that Beijing has “much to give” Washington on trade. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump waves to the news media after returning on Marine One after visiting first lady Melania Trump at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n“Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal,” Trump said on Twitter.\n“We have not seen China’s demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give!” Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
