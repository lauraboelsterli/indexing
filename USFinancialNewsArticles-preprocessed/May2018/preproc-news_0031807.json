    "text": "CRANBURY, N.J., May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Palatin Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: PTN), a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted, receptor-specific peptide therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need and commercial potential, today announced results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Highlights\nBremelanotide - Under development for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (\"HSDD\"): March 2018 – our exclusive North American licensee for bremelanotide, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"AMAG\"), submitted a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for bremelanotide for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women. If approved, bremelanotide would become the first and only as desired pharmacologic option in the U.S. indicated for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women.\n\"The submission of this NDA represents a significant milestone for the bremelanotide clinical program and our efforts to develop a treatment for HSDD,\" said Carl Spana, Ph.D., CEO and President of Palatin Technologies.\nMelanocortin Receptor 1 Agonists (\"MC1r\") – under development for inflammatory bowel diseases and ocular indications: May 2018 – Presented positive preclinical MC1r agonist data at TIDES: Oligonucleotide and Peptide Therapeutics 2018 Meeting. April 2018 – Presented preclinical oral formulation data on PL-8177, an investigational MC1r agonist for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases at the 2018 Keystone Symposia on \"The Resolution of Inflammation in Health and Disease.\" Phase 1 First-in-Human clinical study of PL-8177 is in progress and on schedule for top line data in the third quarter of calendar year 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nPalatin reported a net loss of $(0.7) million, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $(3.6) million, or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nThe difference in financial results between the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was mainly attributable to the decrease in total operating expenses of $4.3 million that is offset by a decrease of $1.8 million of recognized revenue during the 2018 period pursuant to our license agreement with AMAG.\nRevenue\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Palatin recognized $9.0 million in license and contract revenue compared to $10.8 million in the same period in 2017. For both periods, 100% of the revenue Palatin recognized was related to our license agreement with AMAG. As of March 31, 2018, and June 30, 2017, there was $0.6 million and $35.1 million, respectively, of current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet related to this transaction.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $9.5 million compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly attributable to professional services rendered in connection with our license agreement with AMAG, which closed in February 2017, and secondarily to the decrease in development expenses of bremelanotide for HSDD as we continue our progress with our bremelanotide program.\nOther Income/Expense\nTotal other income/expense, net was $0.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2017. Total other income/expense, net for both periods consisted primarily of interest expense related to Palatin's venture debt.\nIncome Tax\nPalatin licensed bremelanotide to Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Industrial Development Co. Ltd. (\"Fosun\") for the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, and to Kwangdong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (\"Kwangdong\") for the Republic of Korea. Pursuant to the license agreements with Fosun and Kwangdong, $500,000 and $82,500, respectively, was withheld in accordance with tax withholding requirements in China and the Republic of Korea, respectively, and will be recorded as an expense during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Palatin recorded an income tax benefit of $18,746 related to those withholding amounts utilizing an estimated effective annual income tax rate applied to the loss for the quarter and the remaining balance of $275,111 was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at March 31, 2018. Any potential credit to be received by Palatin on its United States tax returns is currently offset by Palatin's valuation allowance.\nCash Position\nPalatin's cash, and cash equivalents were $25.7 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and investments of $55.6 million at June 30, 2017. Current liabilities were $13.6 million, net of current deferred revenue of $0.6 million, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $19.9 million, net of deferred revenue of $35.1 million, as of June 30, 2017.\nIn April 2018, Palatin entered into an equity distribution agreement (\"at-the-market program\") with Canaccord Genuity LLC, pursuant to which Palatin may, from time to time, sell shares of its common stock at market prices. Palatin has no obligation to sell any shares under this agreement and may, at any time, suspend solicitation and offers under this agreement.\nPalatin believes that existing capital resources, together with proceeds from sales of common stock in its at-the-market program (if any), will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least June 30, 2019.\nConference Call / Webcast\nPalatin will host a conference call and webcast on May 15, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results of operations in greater detail and provide an update on corporate developments.
