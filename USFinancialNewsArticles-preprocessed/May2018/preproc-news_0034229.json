    "text": "NEWTON, Mass., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynasil Corporation of America (NASDAQ: DYSL), a developer and manufacturer of optics and photonics products, optical detection and analysis technology and components for the homeland security, medical and industrial markets, today announced net income of $1.3 million or $0.08 per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.\n\"I am happy to report revenue in our Optics segment showed an 11% increase for the quarter as compared to the same period last year â€“ the second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Optics' revenue,\" said CEO Peter Sulick. \"Additionally, this quarter's results contain a $1.3 million benefit for income taxes as the result our ongoing review for the PATH 2015 federal R&E Tax Credit for the years 2012 thru 2016. We anticipate completing this review by the fiscal year end and we are expecting additional state credits will be determined as well.\n\"And although our Research segment's revenue decreased 10% this quarter, as compared to last year, largely due to a delay in commercial revenue, RMD's commercial revenue shows signs of picking up this quarter, as evidenced by the recently announced new purchase orders from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Overall, our revenue for the quarter was up 2% over the same period last year.\"\nCertain key metrics by segment for the current quarter and the same quarter last year are presented below:\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 5,910,000\n$ 4,345,000\n$ -\n$ 10,255,000\nGross profit\n2,050,000\n1,895,000\n-\n3,945,000\nGM %\n35%\n44%\n-\n38%\nOperating expenses\n1,858,000\n1,813,000\n194,000\n3,865,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 192,000\n$ 82,000\n$ (194,000)\n$ 80,000\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nOptics\nContract\nResearch\nBiomedical\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 5,281,000\n$ 4,804,000\n$ -\n$ 10,085,000\nGross profit\n1,913,000\n1,875,000\n-\n3,788,000\nGM %\n36%\n39%\n-\n38%\nOperating expenses\n1,597,000\n1,802,000\n392,000\n3,791,000\nOperating income (loss)\n$ 316,000\n$ 73,000\n$ (392,000)\n$ (3,000)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders was approximately $1.3 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and ($0.1) million or ($0.00) per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Dynasil's provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2018 was a benefit of $1.3 million as compared to a tax provision of $0.1 million for the same period in fiscal year 2017. The 2018 provision in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was the result of a PATH 2015 federal R&E Tax Credit for the years 2012 thru 2016 that we are estimating based on the review we are in the process of conducting.\nConference Call Information\nDynasil will host a conference call for investors and analysts at 5:00 p.m. ET today, Monday, May 14, 2018.
