    "text": "BRASILIA, May 22 (Reuters) - Brazilâ€™s central bank considered cutting interest rates last week, but ultimately decided to leave them untouched due to potential inflationary pressure stemming from a weak currency, the minutes of its last policy meeting showed on Tuesday.\nThe bank last week unexpectedly kept the benchmark Selic rate at an all-time low of 6.50 percent, ending the deepest easing cycle in a decade and contradicting widespread expectations of a 25 basis-point cut.
