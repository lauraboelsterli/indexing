    "text": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban set out a conservative vision for his country on Thursday in a speech accepting a new four-year term after winning a landslide in last month’s election.\n“We have replaced a shipwrecked liberal democracy with a 21st-century Christian democracy, which guarantees people’s freedom, security,” Orban, in power since 2010, told parliament.\n“It supports the traditional family model of one man and one woman, keeps anti-Semitism at bay, and gives a chance for growth,” he added.\nReporting by Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
