    "text": "Willson Contreras hit a pair of home runs, including a grand slam to highlight a big first inning, and the hot-hitting Chicago Cubs rolled over their crosstown rivals with an 11-2 win over the struggling Chicago White Sox on Friday at Wrigley Field.\nContreras hit his fourth and fifth home runs of the season and had two doubles, giving him seven extra-base hits in his last two games. He finished with a career-high seven RBIs on Friday.\nKris Bryant hit a solo home run, and Anthony Rizzo had an RBI single for the Cubs, who have won four in a row. They are averaging more than 10 runs a game in the first four-games of the current homestand. Bryant went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored. The Cubs had 15 hits.\nThe Cubs sent nine batters to the plate in a five-run first inning. Ben Zobrist started the inning with a leadoff double. After Rizzo drove home Zobrist, Contreras launched a 3-2 fastball from White Sox starter Carson Fulmer deep to center field to give the Cubs a 5-0 lead.\nBryant led off the fourth inning with a no-doubt shot off a high fastball from White Sox reliever Hector Santiago deep into the left field bleachers to make it 6-1. It was Bryant’s seventh home run of the season and third this week.\nDaniel Palka had an RBI double, and Jose Abreu drove in a run with a single for the White Sox, who have lost six in a row and 10 of 11. They’ve lost four straight and six of their last seven games against the Cubs.\nFulmer (2-3) gave up five runs on three hits in 1 2/3 innings.\nCubs starter Tyler Chatwood (3-3) allowed two runs on three hits with six strikeouts and five walks in five innings.\nGame 2 of the three-game series is Saturday. Jon Lester (2-1, 2.82 ERA) is slated to start for the Cubs, while the White Sox turn to James Shields (1-3, 5.14).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
