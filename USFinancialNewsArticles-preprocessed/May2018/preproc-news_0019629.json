    "text": "NEW YORK, WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (\"WhiteHorse Finance\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: WHF) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary Highlights\nNew investments of $54.1 million Net investment income of $8.6 million First quarter net investment income of $0.418 per share First quarter distribution of $0.355 per share\nStuart Aronson, WhiteHorse Finance's Chief Executive Officer commented, \"Our strong first quarter results were driven by our successful pursuit of high-yielding senior-secured direct originations. This transaction activity validates our rigorous and dynamic approach to sourcing, which facilitates business development in less competitive areas of the lower mid-market at leverage levels consistent with our historical averages. Our focus on companies with limited cyclicality, high free cash flow conversion, and no binary outcome risk is a meaningful differentiator that has created value for our shareholders.\"\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the fair value of WhiteHorse Finance's investment portfolio was $467.7 million, compared with $440.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The portfolio at March 31, 2018 consisted of 48 positions across 34 companies with an average investment size of $9.7 million and a weighted average effective yield of 12.0%. The majority of the portfolio was comprised of senior secured loans, and these loans were substantially all variable-rate investments (primarily indexed to LIBOR), which should continue to position the portfolio well for a rising interest rate environment.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, WhiteHorse Finance made investments in four new portfolio companies totaling $54.1 million. Gross proceeds from sales and repayments totaled $33.0 million for the quarter primarily driven by full repayment on three positions. In addition, WhiteHorse Finance refinanced two of its existing positions. The first, Clarus Commerce, LLC, was a net increase of $10.9 million (after taking into account refinancing proceeds of $6.0 million). The second was to Fluent, LLC which reduced the Company's position by $13.2 million (after taking into account refinancing proceeds of $25.7 million). The Company remained highly selective in deploying new investments.\nResults of Operations\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net investment income was $8.6 million, compared with $6.5 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of approximately 32.3%. The increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to an increase in fee income resulting from non-recurring prepayment and amendment fees as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, WhiteHorse Finance reported net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $5.3 million. This compares with realized and unrealized gains on investments of $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net realized and unrealized gains on investments was primarily attributable to favorable fair value adjustments on an aggregate basis.\nWhiteHorse Finance reported a net increase in net assets of $13.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which compares with a net increase of $9.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nWhiteHorse Finance's net asset value was $293.5 million, or $14.30 per share, as of March 31, 2018, as compared with $287.0 million, or $13.98 per share, reported as of December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, WhiteHorse Finance had cash and cash equivalents of $18.6 million, as compared with $38.9 million as of December 31, 2017, inclusive of restricted cash. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $45.0 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facility.\nDistributions\nOn March 12, 2018, the Company declared a distribution of $0.355 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, consistent for the twenty-second consecutive quarter since the Company's IPO. The distribution was paid on April 2, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 26, 2018.\nDistributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call\nWhiteHorse Finance will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter at 10:00 am ET on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

The one, three and six-month LIBOR were 1.9%, 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. The Prime was 4.8% as of March 31, 2018.\n(3) The interest rate is the \"all-in-rate\" including the current index and spread, the fixed rate, and the payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest rate, as the case may be.\n(4) The investment or a portion of the investment does not provide collateral for the Company's credit facility.\n(5) Not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of total assets. Qualifying assets represented 81% of total assets as of the date of the consolidated schedule of investments.\n(6) Investment is a non-controlled/affiliate investment as defined by the 1940 Act.\n(7) The investment has an unfunded commitment in addition to any amounts presented in the consolidated schedule of investments as of March 31, 2018.\n(8) The investment is on non-accrual status.\n(9) The fair value of the investment was determined using observable inputs.\n(10) Except as otherwise noted, the fair value of each investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs.\n : releases/whitehorse-finance-inc-announces-first-quarter-2018-earnings-results-300644139.html\nSOURCE WhiteHorse Finance, Inc.",
