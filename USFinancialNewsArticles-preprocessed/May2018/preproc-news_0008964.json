    "text": "SEATTLE, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAll figures in this release are based on U.S. GAAP unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables in this press release.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $79.6 million, compared to $59.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.0 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19.2 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $21.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $28.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nOverall gross profit margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2018 was 34%, compared to 40% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $51.8 million, compared to $56.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $48.5 million, compared to $53.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash, investments and restricted cash totaled $147 million. Working capital at the end of the first quarter was $332 million, compared to $354 million at December 31, 2017.\n“We are off to a strong start to the year,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “We completed several large acceptances during the first quarter at sites around the world, a few of these ahead of schedule. We had one of our strongest bookings quarters in several years, what we believe is another early sign that our target market is continuing to strengthen. Among these new awards, we were selected by the Japanese National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology to deliver our latest generation XC supercomputer to serve as their new flagship system. These are good examples of our strong competitive position, which is key for us to drive growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nOutlook\nFor 2018, while a wide range of results remains possible, Cray continues to expect revenue to grow in the range of 10-15% over 2017. Revenue is expected to be about $110 million for the second quarter of 2018. For 2018, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be in the low-30% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $190 million. For 2018, non-GAAP adjustments are expected to total about $14 million, driven primarily by share-based compensation. For the year, GAAP operating expenses are anticipated to be about $12 million higher than non-GAAP operating expenses, and GAAP gross profit is expected to be about $2 million lower than non-GAAP gross profit.\nBased on this outlook, Cray’s effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for 2018 are both expected to be in the low-single digit range, on a percentage basis.\nActual results for any future periods are subject to large fluctuations given the nature of Cray’s business.\nRecent Highlights\nIn March, Cray announced that the National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST) in Japan selected a Cray XC50 supercomputer to be its new flagship supercomputing system. Once installed, the new system is expected to be more than twice as powerful as the existing system. In March, Cray announced it was adding new options to its line of CS-Storm GPU-accelerated servers as well as improved fast-start Artificial Intelligence (AI) configurations, making it easier for organizations implementing AI to get started on their journey with AI proof-of-concept projects and pilot-to-production use. In April, Paderborn University in Germany announced that it selected a Cray CS500 cluster system as well as Cray’s ClusterStor storage appliance. The supercomputer will feature FPGA accelerators as well as the latest generation Intel Xeon processors. It is expected to be put into production in 2018 and to triple the performance of the previous flagship system. In April, Cray announced it is adding AMD EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 product line. Cray has integrated and optimized the Cray Programming Environment and libraries to enhance AMD EPYC processor performance. The new system is expected to be generally available in Summer 2018.\nConference Call Information\nCray will host a conference call today, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 1:15 p.m. PT (4:15 p.m. ET) to discuss its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 financial results.

A reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures that we have set forth provide additional insight for analysts and investors and facilitate an evaluation of Cray’s financial and operational performance that is consistent with the manner in which management evaluates Cray’s financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, as they exclude the financial impact of transactions necessary or advisable for the conduct of Cray’s business, such as the granting of equity compensation awards, and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Hence, to compensate for these limitations, management does not review these non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation from its GAAP results, nor should investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, or disclosures required by GAAP. These measures are adjusted as described in the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers at the end of this release, but these adjustments should not be construed as an inference that all of these adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this non-GAAP information as well as the GAAP financial results that are disclosed in Cray’s SEC filings.\nAdditionally, we have not quantitatively reconciled the non-GAAP guidance measures disclosed under “Outlook” to their corresponding GAAP measures because we do not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items such as share-based compensation, adjustments to the provision for income taxes, amortization of intangibles, costs related to acquisitions, purchase accounting adjustments, and gain on significant asset sales, as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations to the non-GAAP guidance measures are not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our financial results.\nAbout Cray Inc.\nGlobal supercomputing leader Cray Inc.
