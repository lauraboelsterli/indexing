    "text": "The company that perfected the stunt drink is unveiling two new drinks it plans to sell for the long-haul.\nFor the first time in 16 years, Starbucks is adding two new Frappuccinos to its permanent menu. The Ultra Caramel Frappuccino and the Triple Mocha Frappuccino debut on Tuesday in the U.S. and Canada.\nBoth are made with the chain's new Sweet Cold Brew Whipped Cream, infused with cold brew coffee, dark caramel sauce and white chocolate mocha sauce.\nThe Ultra Caramel Frappuccino is sweet cold brew whipped cream, dark caramel sauce, dark caramel coffee, milk, ice and smoky dark caramel drizzle.\nThe Triple Mocha Frappuccino is made of sweet cold brew whipped cream, dark mocha sauce, coffee, milk, ice and dark mocha drizzle.\nRead more from USA Today:\nDunkin' launches new intergalactic drinks, doughnut\nStarbucks CEO vows to learn from 'mistake' in racial incident\nBurger King's new ads go right into McDonald's backyards â€” of executives\nThe suggested retail price of a new tall, 12-ounce Frappuccino is $4.75-$4.95. Customers also may add Sweet Cold Brew Whipped Cream to any cold or hot beverage for 50 cents.\nA 12-ounce Ultra Caramel Frappuccino, made with whole milk and topped with whipped cream, has 350 calories, 44 grams of sugar and 17 grams of fat and a 12-ounce Triple Mocha Frappuccino, made with whole milk and topped with whipped cream, comes with 320 calories, 37 grams of sugar and 16 grams of fat.\nThe classic Caramel and Mocha Frappuccinos remain on the menu.\nThe announcement of the permanent additions to the Starbucks menu comes five days after the Seattle-based company announced it was cutting the number of limited-time offers it featured by 30 percent.\n\"In the past, we focused on a drumbeat of promotional offerings which have not led to sustained growth,\" Rosalind Brewer, the company's chief operating officer, said during Thursday's analyst call. \"Our new approach to marketing will be centered on meaningfully strengthening customer relationships by increasingly targeting our offers to each customer. While we still have unique products such as Crystal Ball Frappuccino, our focus will shift to leveraging platforms with broader appeal.\"\nStarbucks created a social-media sensation last April in the form of the brightly-colored Unicorn Frappuccino. After that, the coffee giant sporadically rolled out attention-grabbing, easily-Instagrammable new drinks for a few days at a time.\nOn Monday, Dunkin' Donuts launched two stunt drinks of its own -- the Cosmic Cotton Candy Coolatta and the Cosmic Pineapple Coolatta.\nStarbucks stock closed at $57.57, down 79 cents or 1.35 percent, on Monday.",
