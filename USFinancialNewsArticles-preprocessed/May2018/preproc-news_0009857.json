    "text": "BEIJING, May 3 (Reuters) - Smartphone and connected device maker Xiaomi filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering on Thursday, in what is expected to be one of the largest listings by a Chinese tech company in almost four years.\nThe announcement came as the company posted revenue of 114.62 billion yuan ($18 billion) in 2017, up 67.5 percent against 2016. It also said it made a net loss of 43.89 billion yuan versus a profit of 491.6 million yuan in 2016.\nOperating profit for 2017 was 12.22 billion yuan, up from 3.79 billion yuan a year ago.\nAlongside smartphones, Xiaomi makes dozens of internet connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers, although it derives most of its profits from internet services.
