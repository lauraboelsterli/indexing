    "text": "Achieves 10% Net Sales Growth and 12% Gross Profit Growth\nGREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ScanSource, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCSC), a leading global provider of technology products and solutions, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change (in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 895.6 $ 813.5 10 % Operating income 17.9 20.0 (10 )% Non-GAAP operating income (1) 27.8 26.2 6 % GAAP net income 10.6 12.4 (14 )% Non-GAAP net income (1) 17.5 16.4 7 % GAAP diluted EPS $ 0.42 $ 0.49 (14 )% Non-GAAP diluted EPS (1) $ 0.68 $ 0.65 5 % (1) Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and change in fair value of contingent consideration. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP financial information is presented in the Supplementary Information (Unaudited) below. “ScanSource delivered another quarter of very good financial results, with 10% net sales growth for both of our segments and 12% gross profit growth,” said Mike Baur, CEO, ScanSource, Inc. “Our teams did a great job this quarter achieving 5% organic sales growth, while executing our strategic plan for growth.”\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, net sales increased 10% to $895.6 million, driven by sales growth in both Worldwide segments. Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact from foreign currency translation and a recent acquisition, was 5.4%. Operating income decreased to $17.9 million from increased expense for the change in fair value of contingent consideration. Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% to $27.8 million, primarily from higher sales volume, higher gross margin and the addition of the POS Portal acquisition.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter totaled $10.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with net income of $12.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 increased to $17.5 million, or $0.68 per diluted share.\nForecast for Next Quarter\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, ScanSource expects net sales to range from $940 million to $1 billion, diluted earnings per share to range from $0.48 to $0.54 per share, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range from $0.74 to $0.80 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nWebcast Details and CFO Commentary\nAt approximately 4:15 p.m. ET, a CFO commentary, as a supplement to our press release and conference call, will be available on ScanSource's website, www.scansource.com (Investor Relations section). ScanSource will present additional information about its financial results and outlook in a conference call today, May 8, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET. A webcast of the call will be available for all interested parties and can be assessed at www.scansource.com (Investor Relations section). The webcast will be available for replay for 60 days.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements, including the forecast of sales and earnings per share for next quarter, that involve . Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated or forecasted results, including, but not limited to, changes in interest and exchange rates and regulatory regimes impacting our international operations, the impact of tax reform laws, the failure of acquisitions to meet our expectations, the failure to manage and implement our organic growth strategy, credit risks involving our larger customers and vendors, termination of our relationship with key vendors or a significant modification of the terms under which we operate with a key vendor, the decline in demand for the products and services that we provide, reduced prices for the products and services that we provide due both to competitor and customer actions, and other factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are summarized below. Non-GAAP financial measures are used to understand and evaluate performance, including comparisons from period to period. Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs and other non-GAAP adjustments.\nNet sales on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions: The Company discloses the percentage change in net sales excluding the translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between reporting periods and excluding the net sales from acquisitions prior to the first full year from the acquisition date. This measure enhances the comparability between periods to help analyze underlying trends on an organic basis.\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: To evaluate current period performance on a more consistent basis with prior periods, the Company discloses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP diluted “EPS”). These non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in the fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs and other non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures are useful in assessing and understanding the Company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods.\nReturn on invested capital (“ROIC”): Management uses ROIC as a performance measurement to assess efficiency in allocating capital under the Company's control to generate returns. Management believes this metric balances the Company's operating results with asset and liability management, is not impacted by capitalization decisions and correlates with shareholder value creation. In addition, it is easily computed, communicated and understood. ROIC also provides management a measure of the Company's profitability on a basis more comparable to historical or future periods.\nROIC assists management in comparing the Company's performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance. ROIC is calculated as adjusted EBITDA over invested capital. Adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) excludes the change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition costs, in addition to other non-GAAP adjustments. Invested capital is defined as average equity plus average daily funded interest-bearing debt for the period. Management believes the calculation of ROIC provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of the Company's performance during the year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company reports may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be considered in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial information to GAAP is set forth in the Supplementary Information (Unaudited) below.\nAbout ScanSource, Inc.\nScanSource, Inc.
