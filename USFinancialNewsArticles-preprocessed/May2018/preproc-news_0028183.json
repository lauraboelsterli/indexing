    "text": "Ford could reopen two US truck plants next Friday Published 15 Hours Ago Updated 14 Hours Ago Reuters\nFord Motor could resume production of its best-selling F-150 pickups as early as Friday, May 18 in Dearborn and Kansas City, according to a source familiar with the automaker's plans.\nFord shut truck plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kentucky earlier this week because of parts shortages caused by a supplier fire in Michigan.\nAlso on Friday, Mercedes-Benz said SUV production at its Alabama plant stopped on Thursday because of parts shortages caused by the same May 2 fire at a Meridian Magnesium Products plant in Eaton Rapids, Michigan.\nMercedes said it had exhausted its supply of cockpit cross-members on May 9 and did not have enough parts to resume full production. It said the Alabama plant will reopen next week on a \"modified production schedule\" while the automaker works with Meridian to restore parts production.\nFord's Louisville truck plant, which builds F-series Super Duty pickups, remains closed indefinitely.\nFord executives earlier this week said the company's quarterly earnings could be affected by shutdowns at the three truck plants, but affirmed its full-year earnings estimate.\nFord said it was working with Chinese-owned Meridian to shift production of the affected parts to other suppliers until the fire-damaged plant can be repaired and production resumed.\nFord shares were down slightly in after-hours trade, at $11.19.
