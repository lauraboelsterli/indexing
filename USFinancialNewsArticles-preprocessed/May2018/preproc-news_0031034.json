    "text": "BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - China vehicles sales in April jumped 11.5 percent from a year earlier to 2.32 million vehicles, an industry body said on Friday, gaining momentum after a sluggish start to the year.\nThe rise follows a 4.7 percent increase in the worldâ€™s biggest auto market in March and an 11.1 percent drop in February.\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said overall sales during the first four months of the year totaled 9.5 million vehicles, up 4.8 percent from the same period a year ago.\nCAAM has predicted 3 percent market growth this year, in line with 2017 but significantly below the steep 13.7 percent gain in 2016.
