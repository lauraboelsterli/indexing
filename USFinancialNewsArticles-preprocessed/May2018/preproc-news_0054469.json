    "text": "ISTANBUL, May 24 (Reuters) - Turkish central bank increased the maximum total amount of forward foreign exchange (NDF) sale positions to $8 billion from $6.15 billion in the second quarter of 2018, the bank said on Thursday, in a fresh move to support an ailing lira.\nThe upper limit for the total amount of forward foreign exchange sale position was determined to be $10 billion until the end of this year, it said.\nThe central bank raised its top interest rate to 16.5 percent at an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in a bid to break a relentless, weeks-long fall in the currency. The lira had depreciated as much as 23 percent so far this year before the bankâ€™s move. (Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen Editing by Ece Toksabay)\n ",
