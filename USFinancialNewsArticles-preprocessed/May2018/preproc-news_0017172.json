    "text": "Top News\nSoftBank Boo-Boo\nSoftBank’s CEO has pre-empted Walmart in announcing the latter’s official takeover of Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart. Softbank is a big Flipkart investor. “I think we announced it last night,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in an earnings call.” Then he read a note left for him. “Oh, I see here that the Flipkart-Walmart deal isn’t fully confirmed at this point in time,” he said. “Oops.” Fortune\nVodafone and Liberty\nJohn Malone’s Liberty Global is selling its German and Eastern European telecoms businesses to Vodafone for $22 billion. The deal gives Vodafone Europe’s second-largest cable network, Unitymedia, and helps the firm in its battle against German incumbent Deutsche Telekom. Vodafone and Liberty have been in talks for years, but had been disagreeing over valuations and debts. Bloomberg\nNet Neutrality\nCan the Senate save net neutrality in the U.S.? The Democrats think so—they will reportedly file a petition to force a vote on the FCC’s rollback today, with a vote likely to take place by the end of next week. Of course, the House would probably then sink the measure, or President Trump could veto it. The FCC still hasn’t said when its new, net-neutrality-free rules for Internet service providers will become effective. Fortune\nGlassdoor Takeover\nJapan’s Recruit Holdings is to buy the U.S. jobs website Glassdoor for $1.2 billion. The deal will boost Recruit’s presence in the U.S.—it’s already there, thanks to its 2012 purchase of Indeed. Glassdoor CEO Robert Hohman will stay on. Glassdoor’s last valuation, in 2016, was $1 billion. Investors in the round announced at that time included Google Capital, T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management. Reuters Advertisement Around the Water Cooler\nTrump and Xi\nPresidents Trump and Xi had a phone call yesterday in which the U.S. leader said trade talks must end up benefitting American businesses and workers. Xi called for a “mutually beneficial” outcome, rather than a trade war. A U.S. delegation visited China last week but came to no agreement with Chinese trade negotiators. Vice-Premier Liu He will visit Washington next week for further talks. South China Morning Post\nAudi Emissions\nThe stink around Volkswagen’s dodgy diesel emissions software just won’t go away. Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group, has now admitted that another 60,000 of its cars have software problems—that’s on top of 850,000 cars it already recalled last year. The affected cars are A6 and A7 models. Audi will be contacting customers and offering a software update. BBC\nCohen Payments\nTrump lawyer Michael Cohen received payments not only from a U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian oligarch—while the Russia investigation was already underway—but also AT&T. The latter revelation initially came via Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti, but the telco confirmed it, saying it paid Cohen in 2017 for “insights into understanding the new administration.” Avenatti said the AT&T figure was $200,000; CNN’s sources say it was more. CNN\nFacebook Payments\nWhat if you paid to use Facebook? That’s the question pondered by author Alex Salkever, who writes for Fortune that such a scheme might help fix the social network’s privacy problems. Salkever suggests that Facebook’s newly-announced dating service would provide a good starting point, and paid-for videos might sensibly follow.
