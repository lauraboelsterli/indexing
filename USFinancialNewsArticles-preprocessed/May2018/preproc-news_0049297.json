Marty Flanigan, AST’s Chief Financial Officer, has been appointed CEO, effective immediately.\nFlanigan has played a critical role in AST’s growth over the past six years, and has more than 30 years of experience helping companies enhance their offerings and executing strategic growth plans. As the newly appointed CEO, he will bring his deep experience with AST to build upon the company’s tech-enabled strategy, helping it unlock its full market opportunity.\n“I am truly honored to be able to lead AST during this pivotal time in its history,” Flanigan said. “I want to thank Brian for the tremendous work he has done setting us in the right direction, and I am confident that we have the right strategy to lead us during this next phase of AST’s growth.”\nAST will continue its transformation into a fully integrated firm that empowers companies by using secure corporate data, analytics, strategic consulting and advisory services. In the last several years, AST has accomplished a number of milestones – most notably the launch of Issuer Central, an industry-first, on-demand, analysis and intelligence platform that provides ownership data for C-suite teams in one consolidated location. AST has also developed an innovative blockchain-based proxy voting solution that enhances timeliness, accuracy and the related quality of service provided to customers.\n“As CEO, Brian built a strong foundation for our future growth and success,” said Simon Pillar, Managing Director of Pacific Equity Partners, which acquired AST in 2008. “We are grateful for Brian’s service and are excited that Marty will not only build on the foundation established by Brian, but also position us for continued success.”\nPrior to joining AST in 2012, Flanigan previously served as Chief Financial Officer for three FinTech companies controlled by Bluff Point Associates, a private equity firm. In this capacity, he oversaw the development and execution of strategic growth plans. He also served as Chief Financial Officer for a leading HR outsourcing firm, where he oversaw significant growth at the company.\nAbout AST\nAST was originally founded as a transfer agent over 45 years ago. Through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, AST has pioneered a new model of integrated ownership services and financial technology in the industry. AST affiliates include AST Trust Company (Canada), D.F. King & Co, Inc. and Donlin, Recano & Company, Inc.\nToday, AST offers a full scope of ownership services that include registry services, corporate proxy solicitation and advisory solutions, employee plan services, information agent, mutual fund proxy solicitation, shareholder identification and asset recovery offerings.
