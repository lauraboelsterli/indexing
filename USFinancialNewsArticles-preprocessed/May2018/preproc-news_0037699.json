We are extremely pleased to see marketplace leaders across several verticals not only making the investment to ensure full access for all digital content users, but also recognizing a clear return on investment with AudioEye's accessibility solution and enhanced usability. The increasing number of success stories and rising awareness of the emphasis on accessibility compliance have created an environment very favorable to a software-driven solution such as AudioEye.\n\"Our success reflects both direct sales to leaders in their respective fields, as well as the rapidly increasing contribution from our content management partners. Multiple partners have now fully integrated the AudioEye solution into their content management platforms, and are rolling accessibility out to customer sites at an accelerated pace. We anticipate onboarding an increasing number of new sites in the quarters ahead, affirming our partnership sales strategy. Our success in the reseller channel combined with the ongoing wins from our direct sales efforts to major customers has AudioEye well positioned to meet its full-year outlook of $6.5 million to $7.5 million in topline sales.\n\"Looking ahead, we are advancing multiple initiatives to further expand our addressable markets and growth opportunities. These include the ongoing roll out of our Dynamic PDF Remediation solutions and development of industry leading voice technologies that will create entirely new ways for users to interact with digital content, whether through accessibility tools or even as a primary means of using online content. Additionally, we are actively moving forward with efforts to develop our first international partnerships to leverage our multilingual capabilities in more than 25 native languages and dialects, moving AudioEye fully into the global market.\"\n2017 First Quarter Financial Results\nDuring the first quarter, AudioEye continued to ramp demand for its SaaS digital content accessibility platform across multiple end markets through both direct and reseller sales channels. The Company reported revenue of $1.149 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a 164% increase from revenue of $435 thousand in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter, AudioEye recorded new cash contract bookings of $2.2 million. Reflecting the rapid growth in AudioEye's partner channel, 60% of cash contract bookings were comprised of reseller contracted revenue, as compared to 18% of revenue recognized in the first quarter. For the full year 2018, AudioEye projects cash contract bookings of $11 million to $12 million, compared with full year 2017 cash contract bookings of $6.3 million.\nGross profit in the first quarter 2018 was $562 thousand, or 49% of revenue, compared with $536 thousand, or 61% of revenue in the fourth quarter 2017, and gross profit of $93 thousand, or 21% of revenue, in the first quarter 2017. The decline in gross margin from the previous quarter reflected lower capitalized software development as well as higher direct personnel costs, due to the rising number of sites launching AudioEye's services in 2018. AudioEye projects gross margin to continue to improve in 2018 as revenue increases, consistent with its high profit leverage SaaS business model.\nOperating expenses were $1.725 million, compared with $2.142 million in the fourth quarter 2017, and $1.208 million in the first quarter 2017. The increase in operating expenses reflects additional sales and implementation positions to support AudioEye's accelerating revenue and new contract bookings growth rates, including an increasing number of accounts driven by AudioEye's successful partnerships with multiple vertical-specific content management system (CMS) platforms.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter 2018 included non-cash expenses of $128 thousand in depreciation and amortization and $367 thousand in stock based compensation.\nFor the first quarter 2018, AudioEye reported net loss of $1.176 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $823 thousand, or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter 2017.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, AudioEye had a cash balance of $1.277 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $597 thousand in the first quarter. The Company anticipates further reduction in cash used to fund operations as it moves toward breakeven revenue results.\nOutlook\nAudioEye expects full year 2018 cash contract bookings of between $11 million and $12 million, and to recognize revenue of between $6.5 million and $7.5 million. AudioEye expects to continue to grow operating expenses at a rate well below revenue growth, targeting cash flow neutral by the end of 2018.\nAbout AudioEye, Inc.\nAudioEye is a technology company serving businesses committed to providing equal access to their digital content.
