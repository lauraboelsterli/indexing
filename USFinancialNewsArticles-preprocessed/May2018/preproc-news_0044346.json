    "text": "EditorsNote: Corrects a few statistical errors\nJean Segura singled in the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning as the host Seattle Mariners rallied to defeat Detroit 3-2 Sunday afternoon, spoiling an outstanding start by the Tigers’ Francisco Liriano.\nDee Gordon led off 11th by grounding a single into right field off right-hander Buck Farmer (0-3). Gordon stole second base, his American League-leading 16th of the season, and Segura grounded a 2-2 pitch into right field to score the speedy Gordon.\nNick Vincent (2-1) pitched a scoreless inning of relief for the victory.\nThe Mariners tied it in the bottom of the ninth on Mitch Haniger’s two-run homer off closer Shane Greene.\nWith one out in the ninth, Segura hit a chopper up the middle that shortstop Jose Iglesias was able to field, but his one-hop throw got past first baseman John Hicks. Segura was credited with an infield single and advanced to second on the throwing error. Haniger then belted a hanging slider from Greene on an 0-2 pitch into the upper deck in left field.\nLiriano, a 34-year-old left-hander, allowed one hit in eight scoreless innings. He walked three and struck out five.\nThe only hit Liriano allowed was a single to left-center field by Haniger with one out in the seventh inning. After walking two batters in the first, Liriano retired 17 consecutive batters before Haniger stepped to the plate.\nLiriano issued a one-out walk to Gordon Beckham in the eighth, bringing up pinch-hitter Mike Zunino as the potential tying run. Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire made a mound visit but left Liriano in the game. Liriano caught Zunino looking at a called third strike on a 3-2 count and struck out Andrew Romine on a slider in the dirt to end the inning.\nLiriano was attempting to pitch the second no-hitter of his career. While with the Minnesota Twins, he accomplished the feat May 3, 2011, in a 1-0 victory against the Chicago White Sox.\nHicks hit a two-run homer in the first inning, providing all the scoring until the ninth. Hicks, who was selected by the Mariners in the fourth round of the 2011 draft and made his major league debut with them in 2015, hit a 1-1 pitch from Seattle left-hander Wade LeBlanc into the Tigers bullpen in left field. That also scored Nicholas Castellanos, who reached on a two-out single to left.\nMariners starter Wade LeBlanc had allowed only one earned run in his previous four starts, but that was exceeded by one swing from Hicks in the first. It was Hicks’ fifth homer of the season as he fills in for the injured Miguel Cabrera.\nLeBlanc gave up seven hits in 5 1/3 innings, with one walk and five strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
