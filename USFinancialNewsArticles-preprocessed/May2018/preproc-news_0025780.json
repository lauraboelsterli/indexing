Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur v Newcastle United - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 9, 2018 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez after the match REUTERS/Dylan Martinez\nEngland international Trippier, who has established himself at Tottenham this season with 34 appearances across all competitions, limped off late in the second half at Wembley and was replaced by Toby Alderweireld.\n“I wish and I hope that he is OK. Of course we are a little bit concerned about the situation,” Pochettino told reporters of the 27-year-old.\n“I hope fitness is not a big issue, and he can be ready and fit to play at the World Cup. I think it was a twist of his knee.”\nThe victory helped Tottenham secure a top-four finish and seal Champions League qualification for next season.\nThe north London outfit host Leicester City in the final game of the current campaign on Sunday.\nEngland play Tunisia in their World Cup opener on June 18.
