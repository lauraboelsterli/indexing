REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Pool\nChina will sign a bilateral currency swap agreement with Japan, the Chinese government said on Tuesday, citing an article written by Premier Li that was published by Japan’s Asahi newspaper.\nIn 2016, China granted the United States a 250 billion yuan RQFII quota to help deepen ties between the world’s two largest economies.\nChina resumed a key outbound investment scheme in late April, granting qualified domestic financial institutions fresh quotas to buy overseas stocks and bonds for the first time since early 2015.\n($1 = 6.3728 Chinese yuan)",
