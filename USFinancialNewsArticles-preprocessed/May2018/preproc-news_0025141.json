    "text": "1 Min Ago CNBC.com\nI bought my GMC Terrain SLT in 2013, despite my friends telling me to lease rather than own. Technology in cars get outdated fast , meaning they're old news by next year. It's why car leases have boomed in the past decade, from 1.4 million vehicles in 2009 to 4.3 million in 2016 , and technology-minded millennials are responsible for that growth. They lease more than any other age group, nearly one out of three who purchase a new vehicle. I was not part of that equation, and it was my first mistake knowing I would only have the car for five years when I was stationed in Los Angeles. I had low expectations when I was selling my car, but luckily, it wasn't as bad as I thought. These are the misconceptions I had, and they worked out.\n1. I didn't think I would have a lot of buyers\nSince the technology on my car was outdated by five years (the 2014 make of my GMC had built-in WIFI), I assumed I would struggle with finding buyers.\n2. I didn't think it would be worth a lot of money\n1. You can go online to find the value.\nNot only will put value on your car they send out an email to local dealerships so you don't have to do all the work.\nOr Edmunds.\n2. Expect to get less than what you were quoted.\n3. ",
