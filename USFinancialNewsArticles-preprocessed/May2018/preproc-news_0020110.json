    "text": "Strong Quarter for Core Earnings\nAnnounced Proposed Acquisition of CYS Investments, Inc. Post Quarter End\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE: TWO), a leading hybrid mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), mortgage servicing rights (MSR) and other financial assets, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary\nReported book value of $15.63 per common share, representing a (1.3%) total quarterly return on book value. (1) Incurred a Comprehensive Loss of ($23.7) million, or ($0.14) per weighted average basic common share. Reported Core Earnings including dollar roll income of $83.8 million, or $0.48 per weighted average basic common share, representing a return on average common equity of 11.8%. (2) Dollar roll income of $3.4 million, or $0.02 per weighted average basic common share. Added $13.6 billion unpaid principal balance (UPB) of MSR through both a bulk purchase and monthly flow-sale arrangements, bringing total holdings to $111.7 billion UPB. Increased the capacity of an MSR financing facility by $100 million, to a total of $400 million, and continued to advance discussions with other potential MSR financing counterparties. Post quarter end, announced proposed acquisition of CYS Investments, Inc. (NYSE: CYS).\n“We delivered strong Core Earnings in the first quarter, driven primarily by growth in our MSR portfolio and additional servicing income,” stated Thomas Siering, Two Harbors’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, post quarter end, we were excited to announce our proposed acquisition of CYS Investments, Inc., which we believe represents a unique opportunity to create value for our stockholders.”\n(1) Return on book value for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 is defined as the decrease in book value per common share from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 of $0.68, plus the dividend declared of $0.47 per common share, divided by December 31, 2017 book value of $16.31 per common share.\n(2) Core Earnings and Core Earnings including dollar roll income are non-GAAP measures. Please see page 13 for a definition of Core Earnings and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information.\nBeginning with this reporting period, certain of the company’s non-GAAP earnings metrics will include to-be-announced (TBA) dollar roll income. TBA dollar roll income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. For various liquidity, hedging and leverage benefits, the company’s investment team may choose to invest in TBAs versus Agency pools. The ability to invest in more meaningful TBA exposure benefitted from the recent receipt of a tax opinion that will allow the company to hold these investments in the REIT. The company believes that the presentation of Core Earnings including dollar roll income is a meaningful indicator of its earnings power and provides investors with greater transparency into the company’s period-over-period financial performance.\nOperating Performance\nThe following table summarizes the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings measurements and key metrics for the first quarter of 2018:\nTwo Harbors Investment Corp.

As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Dollar roll income is the economic equivalent to holding and financing Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. We believe the presentation of Core Earnings, including dollar roll income, provides investors greater transparency into our period-over-period financial performance and facilitates comparisons to peer REITs.\nTWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP.
