    "text": "CHICAGO, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ansarada , an AI-powered dealmaking platform provider, has expanded North American operations with a series of key hires across its Chicago headquarters and offices in New York and San Francisco. The expansion is designed to meet surging demand for Ansarada's AI-powered Virtual Data Room and Material Information Platform from major companies, investors and advisors, including Google, VMWare, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, CBRE and Baird Capital. The company also appointed seasoned business executive Peter Santis as country manager for the Americas, based in Chicago.\n\"Companies are learning that Ansarada's platform delivers significant value in running smoother business transactions, while getting more deals done faster with less risk and agony,\" said Sam Riley, CEO and co-founder at Ansarada. \"We're seeing strong demand from advisors and corporates across North America who want to harness the power of AI to improve operations. Our expansion marks an important step forward as we continue scaling up operations in the United States while serving more clients around the world.\"\nAnsarada's North American expansion comes on the heels of a $18 million Series A investment in March.
