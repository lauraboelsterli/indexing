FILE PHOTO: Harvey Weinstein and wife Georgina Chapman ararrive at the 89th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, U.S., February 26, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\nChapman, co-founder of the Marchesa fashion label, told Vogue magazine in her first interview since the scandal broke last October, “I lost ten pounds in five days. I couldn’t keep food down.”\nThe accusations against Weinstein were first reported by the New York Times and New Yorker magazine.\n“My head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I’d ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn’t make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded and I realized that this wasn’t an isolated incident,” the British designer said.\nOn the day the New Yorker report was published, Chapman announced that she was leaving Weinstein, ending their 10-year marriage. The couple are in divorce proceedings.\nMore than 70 women have accused the Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.\nA representative for Weinstein declined to comment on Chapman’s interview. Chapman’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLooking back, Chapman told Vogue, “I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief. And I have moments when I just cry for my children.”\nMarchesa was once one of the biggest fashion brands on red carpets at the Oscars and other celebrity events, but few celebrities have worn the label in the past eight months.
