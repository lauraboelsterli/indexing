(NASDAQ: SSNT), a national provider of transformational business technology solutions and services, today announced its first quarter results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights for Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 As Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017:\n· Revenues increased to $9,310,074, rising 16.3% from $8,002,572.\n· Software sales increased 80.3% to $1,635,061 from $906,905.\n· Services revenues totaled $7,675,013, increasing 8.2% from $7,095,667.\nGross profit increased 16.3% to $3,940,738 as compared to $3,387,049. Gross margin was 42.3% of revenue, compared to 42.3% in 2017.

Our record first quarter revenue reflects the success of our various growth initiatives across all our platforms. We generated record quarterly sales of both our Sage Enterprise Management (formerly Sage X3) and Acumatica product offerings. Our inside sales team, selling product into our installed customer base, generated record quarterly revenue. Our proprietary Partner Success Program (“PSP”), which encourages smaller Sage Software channel partners to contractually align their customers with our sales organization, was successful in increasing the growth of our customer base by over 25% in the first quarter alone.\n“In addition, our award-winning managed service provider generated revenue 21% higher than the first quarter of 2017. Finally, our Mapadoc EDI solution remains the solution of choice for users of Sage 100c, Sage Enterprise Management, and Acumatica. We are very confident about the continued upward trajectory of all our business lines.”\nMeller continued, “Sales, marketing and general and administrative expenses all increased in the first quarter, as we continued to invest in the resources and infrastructure necessary to support a larger organization. This has had a temporary negative impact on profitability, but we have taken steps to more closely align our cost structure with our growth targets, and we expect to deliver on our target operating margins in the second quarter and beyond. All in all, we are extremely optimistic about our prospects for the balance of 2018, and look forward to continuing to deliver positive results for the benefit of all our stakeholders in the coming months and years ahead.”\nAbout SilverSun Technologies, Inc.\nWe are a business application, technology and consulting company providing strategies and solutions to meet our clients' information, technology and business management needs.
