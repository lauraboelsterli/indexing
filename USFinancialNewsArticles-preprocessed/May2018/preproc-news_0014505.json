    "text": "BALTIMORE, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Medifast, Inc. (NYSE: MED), a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven, healthy living products and programs, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nMedifast revenue of $98.6 million, an increase of 39.6% year-over-year Active earning OPTA VIA Coaches of 16,700, an increase of 28.5% year-over-year Net income of $12.2 million compared to net income of $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 Earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $1.01 compared to EPS of $0.51 for the first quarter of 2017\n\"We are off to a strong start in 2018 driven by our focused, transformational business model that continues to deliver optimal health to our clients through our community of OPTA VIA Coaches,\" said Dan Chard, Medifast's Chief Executive Officer. \"This helped fuel growth and profitability that exceeded our expectations for the first quarter and has led to our raising our annual sales and earnings outlook.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nEffective at the beginning of the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, we changed how we report sales going forward to simplify and align with changes in the way we now manage the business, review operating performance, and allocate resources. We previously disclosed entity-wide disclosures for sales by channel for OPTA VIA, Medifast Direct, Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers and Medifast Wholesale. Due to the interchangeable nature of our customers amongst sale channels, sales migration to OPTA VIA, and realignment of internal operations, we will now be operating and reporting as a single sales channel. This change in our financial reporting structure is a testament to our success in transforming and restructuring the business and reflection of how the business is managed today.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, revenue increased 39.6% to $98.6 million from revenue of $70.6 million for the first quarter last year. OPTA VIA branded products represented 58% of consumable units sold for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 17% for the first quarter of last year. The total number of active earning OPTA VIA Coaches for the first quarter of 2018 increased to 16,700, compared to 13,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The average revenue per active earning OPTA VIA Coach for the first quarter of 2018 increased 18.3% to $5,278 compared to $4,463 for the first quarter last year.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $74.8 million from $52.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Company's gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points to 75.9% from 74.9% for the first quarter last year. The increase in gross margin percentage was a result of improved inventory management and shipping expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased $15.8 million to $60.1 million compared to $44.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of higher OPTA VIA commission expense as a result of higher sales. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 170 basis points to 61.0% compared to 62.7% in the first quarter last year.\nOperating income increased $6.1 million to $14.7 million from $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased 270 basis points to 14.9% compared to 12.2% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe first quarter 2018 effective tax rate was 18.1%, compared to 29.5% for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in the Federal statutory rate pursuant to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act as well as the discrete accounting for taxes associated with share-based compensation. Excluding the discrete accounting for taxes associated with share-based compensation, the first quarter effective tax rate would have been 23.1%.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.2 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, based on approximately 12.1 million shares outstanding. First quarter 2017 net income was $6.1 million, or $0.51 per diluted share based on approximately 12.0 million shares outstanding.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company's balance sheet remains strong with stockholders' equity of $113.6 million and working capital of $92.9 million as of March 31, 2018. Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities increased $10.4 million to $109.2 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $98.8 million at December 31, 2017. The Company remains free of interest bearing debt.\nThe Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.7 million, or $0.48 per share, during the first quarter of 2018. The Company has approximately 850,000 shares remaining on its repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2018.\nAdoption of Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\")\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 on a modified retrospective basis. As a result, the Company did not restate financial information for the three months ending March 31, 2017. The results of ASU 606 primarily impact the Company's timing of revenue recognition for product shipments, as product revenue will be recognized upon customer receipt in lieu of at the time of shipment.\nThe following are the impacts to the financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from the implementation of ASC 606. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, revenue increased $1.3 million, or 1.4%, which resulted in gross profit increasing $1.1 million, or 1.5%. Reported gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 75.9% from 75.8%. Income from operations was positively impacted by $0.5 million, or 3.3%, resulting in increased net income and diluted earnings per share of $0.4 million, or $0.03 per share, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, working capital decreased $2.1 million and stockholders' equity decreased $1.6 million as a result of the impact ASC 606.\nOutlook\nThe Company expects second quarter revenue to be in the range of $99.0 million to $102.0 million and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97. The Company is raising its guidance for the full year 2018, expecting revenue of $385 million to $395 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.55 to $3.65. This compares to the Company's previous annual guidance for revenue of $350 million to $360 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.25. The full year 2018 earnings guidance assumes a 21% to 22% effective tax rate.\nConference Call Information\nThe conference call is scheduled for today, Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET.
