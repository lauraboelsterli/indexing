    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) Board of Directors approved the construction of a galvanizing line at the company's sheet mill in Arkansas to support Nucor's growth into a wider and more diverse set of strategic end-market applications. The new galvanizing line is a $240 million investment with an annual capacity of approximately 500,000 tons. It is expected to be operational in the first half of 2021.\nThis project complements the $230 million investment currently underway to construct a specialty cold mill complex at Nucor Steel Arkansas. These projects are important components of Nucor's long-term strategy for profitable growth and will accelerate the company's goal of increasing its automotive market share.\n\"At Nucor Steel Arkansas, we are building one of the most modern and efficient steel mills in the world,\" said John Ferriola, Chairman, CEO & President of Nucor. \"This new galvanizing line, coupled with our new specialty cold mill complex, will allow us to efficiently produce products beyond the capability of any North American mill, and to have the flexibility to meet current and future demand for advanced high-strength steel products.\"\nThe company is also evaluating building additional galvanizing lines at its other sheet mills as part of Nucor's initiative to further expand its sheet business.\n\"Building this galvanizing line will diversify the product mix at Nucor Steel Arkansas and allow us to better serve our automotive and value-added customers,\" said MaryEmily Slate, Vice President and General Manager, Nucor Steel Arkansas. \"We are positioning ourselves to become a major supplier to the growing galvanized market in the U.S.\"\nNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; hollow structural section tubing; electrical conduit; steel piling; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; steel grating; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor, through The David J. Joseph Company, also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HBI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.\nCertain statements contained in this news release are \"forward-looking statements\" that involve risks and uncertainties. The words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could\" and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including competition from imports and substitute materials; (2) U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting steel imports or exports; (3) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to prevailing steel prices and the changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including scrap steel; (4) market demand for steel products; and (5) energy costs and availability. These and other factors are discussed in Nucor's regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those in Nucor's fiscal 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A. Risk Factors. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release speak only as of this date, and Nucor does not assume any obligation to update them.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nucor-announces-plans-to-build-galvanizing-line-at-arkansas-sheet-mill-300646968.html\nSOURCE Nucor Corporation",
