    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cato Corporation (NYSE: CATO) today reported sales of $71.8 million for the four weeks ended May 5, 2018, an 11% decrease from sales of $80.5 million for the four weeks ended April 29, 2017. Same-store sales for the four weeks ended May 5, 2018 decreased 6% from the four weeks ended May 6, 2017. April 2018 same-store sales are compared to the four week period ended May 6, 2017 due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017.\nSales for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018 were $236.0 million, a 1% decrease from sales of $237.5 million for the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. Same-store sales for the first quarter decreased 1% compared to last year. The first quarter same-store sales are compared to the thirteen week period ended May 6, 2017 due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2017.\nApril sales were impacted by the shift of Easter from April last year to March this year.
