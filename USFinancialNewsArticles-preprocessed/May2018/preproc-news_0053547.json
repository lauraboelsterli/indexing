    "text": "Maximilian Stock Ltd. | Getty Images The East Coast supermarket chain Stop & Shop is recalling some frozen broccoli due to listeria concerns .\nAt issue are the 16-ounce bags of Private Brands Frozen Broccoli Cuts with a March 15, 2020, best-by date and a 068826700926 UPC.\nA store sample the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection's Food and Standards Division pulled tested positive for listeria, according to Stop & Shop's website.\nCustomers may return the frozen broccoli a full refund.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes sickens about 1,600 people every year and kills an estimated 260. Most at risk are pregnant women, newborn babies, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.\nListeriosis symptoms depend on the person and what body part has been affected. Among them are fever, diarrhea, aches, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, the CDC said.\nStop & Shop is owned by the Dutch company Ahold Delhaize, whose other U.S. holdings include the supermarket chains Food Lion, Giant Food and Hannaford and the online grocery retailer Peapod.\nMore from USA Today:\nTrump calls for new tariffs on imported cars and trucks, escalating trade wars\nLooking for new investment?
