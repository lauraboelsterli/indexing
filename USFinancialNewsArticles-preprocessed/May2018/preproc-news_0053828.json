One lap after the other, quicker and quicker and quicker,” he told Canadian reporter Gerald Donaldson some time later.\n“I was at one stage just on pole, then by half a second, and then one second... and I kept going. Suddenly, I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car.\n“And I suddenly realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously.”\nMidway through the session, Senna recorded a lap of one minute 25.6 seconds. Then he clocked a 1:24.4. And finally a 1:23.998.\nHis French team mate Alain Prost, who had won two of his four world championships by then, joined Senna on the front row but was an astonishing 1.427 seconds slower.

They did, but Senna hit the barriers at Portier, the right-hander before the tunnel.\nWhile he strode off to brood in his nearby apartment, Prost won — pain and glory in one weekend.
