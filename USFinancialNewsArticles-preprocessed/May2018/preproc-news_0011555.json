Net earnings increased 9% to $643 million and were ahead of Company expectations. Earnings before income taxes increased to $853 million, or 3%. Adjusted EBIT increased to $901 million, or 8%. Adjusted EBIT margin declined about 20 basis points in the quarter to 24.4% largely due to the impact of acquisition-related expenses and continued pressure from growth in PEO pass-through revenues, which were partially offset by operational and selling efficiencies. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, and 24.3% on an adjusted basis. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.45 and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.52.\n“I am pleased with our successful results this quarter and with the continued signs of improvement in some of our key performance indicators such as our new business bookings, which grew 9%, and our Employer Services retention, which improved 170 basis points,” said Carlos Rodriguez, President and Chief Executive Officer, ADP. “Our results reflect the fundamental strength of our business model, and demonstrate that our strategy to drive sustainable long-term growth is working.”\n“ADP delivered another solid quarter coupling strong revenue growth with improving trends underlying our margin performance,” said Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer, ADP. “Our transformation initiatives continue to drive positive changes in how we are doing business, and we were pleased to build on our momentum this quarter by raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance.”\nAdjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, and organic constant currency revenue are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables at the end of this release for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Segment Results\nEmployer Services – Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of HCM and human resources outsourcing solutions.\nEmployer Services revenues increased 7% on a reported basis, 4% organic constant currency, compared to last year’s third quarter. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States increased 2.9% for the third quarter when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses. Employer Services client revenue retention was up 170 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter. Employer Services segment margin decreased approximately 20 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter. This decrease includes approximately 70 basis points of combined pressure from acquisitions and foreign currency.\nPEO Services – PEO Services provides comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship.\nPEO Services revenues increased 10% compared to last year’s third quarter driven primarily by a 9% increase in average worksite employees for the quarter. PEO Services segment margin increased approximately 40 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services were about 512,000.\nInterest on Funds Held for Clients – The safety, liquidity and diversification of ADP clients’ funds are the foremost objectives of the company’s investment strategy. Client funds are invested in accordance with ADP’s prudent and conservative investment guidelines and the credit quality of the investment portfolio is predominantly AAA/AA.\nFor the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 21% to $135 million from $112 million a year ago. Average client funds balances increased 6% in the third quarter to $28.8 billion compared to $27.3 billion a year ago. For the third quarter, the average interest yield on client funds was 1.9% which was up 20 basis points compared to a year ago.\nOther Matters\nOn March 1, 2018, ADP announced that it is offering a voluntary early retirement program to certain eligible U.S.-based associates in support of ongoing transformation initiatives. ADP anticipates recording a special termination charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and expects to fund a significant majority of the program costs from the existing surplus in ADP’s U.S. defined benefit plan. The Company expects this initiative to help reduce its pre-tax operating expenses starting in early fiscal 2019.\nOn April 11, 2018, ADP declared a regular quarterly dividend of 69 cents per share. This 10% increase represents a return to shareholders of a portion of the benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017. The Board of Directors anticipates consideration of another dividend increase in November 2018 consistent with ADP’s historical pattern throughout its 43 year track record of annual dividend increases.\nIn addition, on April 18, 2018, ADP announced that Thomas J. Lynch and Scott F. Powers have been appointed to the Board of Directors, effective April 18, 2018. These appointments reflect ADP's commitment to thoughtfully bringing in fresh perspectives and insights as the Company continues to execute on its strategy and transformation initiatives to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nCertain components of ADP’s fiscal 2018 outlook and related growth comparisons exclude the impact of the following items and are discussed on an adjusted basis where applicable. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these adjusted amounts to their closest comparable GAAP measure.\nFiscal 2017 pre-tax restructuring charges of $90 million related to transformation initiatives. Fiscal 2017 second quarter pre-tax gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205 million. Fiscal 2018 pre-tax proxy contest charges of about $33 million. Fiscal 2018 one-time net tax benefit of about $43 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Fiscal 2018 anticipated pre-tax charges of about $46 million related to transformation initiatives. This estimate does not include anticipated fourth quarter charges related to the Company’s recently announced voluntary early retirement program.\nADP continues to expect full-year fiscal 2018 revenue growth of 7% to 8%. This revenue forecast includes approximately two percentage points of growth from acquisitions and the impact from foreign currency. ADP now anticipates growth in worldwide new business bookings of 6% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of up 5% to 7%. ADP now estimates adjusted EBIT margin to be about flat for the full year compared to the prior forecast of down 50 basis points.\nADP expects full year diluted earnings per share to be up 11% to 12% compared to our prior forecast of up 8% to 9%; and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to be 16% to 17% compared to our prior forecast of 12% to 13% growth. ADP now anticipates an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.2% compared to the prior forecasted rate of 26.9%.\nReportable Segments Fiscal 2018 Forecast\nFor the Employer Services segment, ADP anticipates revenue growth of approximately 5%, compared to our prior forecast of 4% to 5%, and now expects margins to be about flat compared with our prior forecasted margin contraction of 50 to 75 basis points. ADP maintains expectations for an increase in pays per control of 2.5% for the year. For the PEO Services segment, ADP now anticipates revenue growth of approximately 12% compared to our prior forecast of 12% to 13%. ADP now expects PEO margins to be about flat compared with our prior forecast of about flat to down 25 basis points for the year.\nClient Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2018 Forecast\nThe interest assumptions in our forecasts are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of April 30, 2018. The Fed Funds futures contracts used in the client short and corporate cash interest income forecasts assume an increase in the Fed Funds rate in June 2018. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of April 30, 2018 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client and corporate extended, and client long portfolios, respectively.\nInterest on funds held for clients is expected to increase about $65 million, or 16%, compared to the prior forecast of up $55 to $65 million. This is based on anticipated growth in average client funds balances of approximately 5% from $23.0 billion in fiscal 2017, compared to the prior forecast of 4 to 5% growth and an average yield which is still anticipated to increase about 20 basis points to 1.9% compared to the fiscal 2017 average yield of 1.7%. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to increase about $50 million compared to the prior forecast of up $45 to $55 million.\nInvestor Webcast Today\nADP will host a conference call for financial analysts today, Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. The conference call will be webcast live on ADP’s website at investors.adp.com and will be available for replay following the call.

The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, % Change March 31, % Change 2018 2017 As\nReported Constant\nCurrency\nBasis (h) 2018 2017 As\nReported Constant\nCurrency\nBasis (h) Net earnings $ 643.1 $ 587.9 9 % 8 % $ 1,512.1 $ 1,467.6 3 % 2 % Adjustments: Provision for income taxes 209.5 240.0 454.4 675.1 All other interest expense (a) 14.8 14.6 44.8 44.6 All other interest income (a) (6.1 ) (5.2 ) (16.7 ) (14.3 ) Gain on sale of business — — — (205.4 ) Transformation initiatives (b) 39.7 0.6 39.7 41.6 Proxy contest matters (f) — — 33.2 — Adjusted EBIT $ 901.0 $ 837.9 8 % 6 % $ 2,067.5 $ 2,009.2 3 % 2 % Adjusted EBIT Margin 24.4 % 24.6 % 20.7 % 21.6 % Provision for income taxes $ 209.5 $ 240.0 (13 )% (14 )% $ 454.4 $ 675.1 (33 )% (34 )% Adjustments: Gain on sale of business (c) — — — (84.0 ) Transformation initiatives (d) 9.7 0.2 9.6 15.7 Proxy contest matters (f) — — 10.4 — Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (g) (2.8 ) — 42.9 — Adjusted provision for income taxes $ 216.4 $ 240.2 (10 )% (11 )% $ 517.3 $ 606.8 (15 )% (16 )% Adjusted effective tax rate (e) 24.3 % 29.0 % 25.4 % 30.7 % Net earnings $ 643.1 $ 587.9 9 % 8 % $ 1,512.1 $ 1,467.6 3 % 2 % Adjustments: Gain on sale of business — — — (205.4 ) Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of business (c) — — — 84.0 Transformation initiatives (b) 39.7 0.6 39.7 41.6 Income tax benefit for transformation initiatives (d) (9.7 ) (0.2 ) (9.6 ) (15.7 ) Proxy contest matters (f) — — 33.2 — Income tax benefit for proxy contest matters (f) — — (10.4 ) — Income tax benefit from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (g) 2.8 — (42.9 ) — Adjusted net earnings $ 675.9 $ 588.3 15 % 13 % $ 1,522.1 $ 1,372.1 11 % 10 % Diluted EPS $ 1.45 $ 1.31 11 % 9 % $ 3.40 $ 3.25 5 % 4 % Adjustments: Gain on sale of business (c) — — — (0.27 ) Transformation initiatives (b) (d) 0.07 — 0.07 0.06 Proxy contest matters (f) — — 0.05 — Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (g) 0.01 — (0.10 ) — Adjusted diluted EPS $ 1.52 $ 1.31 16 % 15 % $ 3.43 $ 3.04 13 % 12 %\n(a) We continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as \"All other interest expense\" and \"All other interest income.\" (b) The charges within transformation initiatives represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of $13.1 million, and other transformation initiatives of $26.6 million which consist primarily of severance charges totaling $22.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Charges for transformation initiatives in other periods presented primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Severance charges have been taken in the past and are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. (c) The taxes on the gain on sale of the business were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the period ended March 31, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business. (d) The tax benefit on transformation initiatives was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. (e) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes. (f) Represents non-operational costs associated with proxy contest matters. The tax benefit on the non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. (g) The one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Act is comprised of the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances partially offset by the one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments. (h) \"Constant currency basis\" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. \"Constant currency basis\" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. (i) The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic revenue which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, Revenue growth consolidated: 2018 2017 2018 2017 Employer Services 7 % 2 % 5 % 4 % PEO Services 10 % 12 % 13 % 12 % Consolidated revenue growth as reported 8 % 5 % 7 % 6 % Adjustments: Impact of acquisitions (1 )% — % (1 )% — % Impact of dispositions — % 1 % — % 1 % Impact of foreign currency (1 )% — % (1 )% — % Consolidated organic revenue growth, constant currency 6 % 6 % 6 % 7 % Segment: Employer Services revenue growth as reported 7 % 2 % 5 % 4 % Adjustments: Impact of acquisitions (1 )% — % (1 )% — % Impact of dispositions — % 1 % 1 % 1 % Impact of foreign currency (2 )% — % (1 )% — % Employer Services organic revenue growth, constant currency 4 % 3 % 3 % 5 %\n(j) The following tables reconcile our \"Total interest income\" and \"Total interest expense\" to “Corporate extended interest income” and “Corporate interest expense-short-term financing,” related to our client funds investment strategy which are non-GAAP measures. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Corporate extended interest income $ 4.9 $ 5.0 $ 42.7 $ 40.1 All other interest income 6.1 5.2 16.7 14.3 Total interest income on corporate funds $ 11.0 $ 10.1 $ 59.4 $ 54.5 Corporate interest expense-short-term financing $ 3.8 $ 2.2 $ 29.3 $ 12.6 All other interest expense 14.8 14.6 44.8 44.6 Total interest expense $ 18.6 $ 16.8 $ 74.1 $ 57.2\nAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal 2018 GAAP to Non-GAAP Guidance Reconciliation (Unaudited) Twelve Months Ended Fiscal 2018 June 30, 2017 Forecast Earnings before income taxes / margin (GAAP) $ 2,531.1 20.4 % ~(160)bps All other interest expense 59.3 +50bps - a All other interest income (22.4 ) (20)bps - a Gain on sale of business - 2Q F17 (205.4 ) (170)bps +170bps b Workforce Optimization Effort - 4Q F17 (5.0 ) (5)bps +5bps c Transformation initiatives - F17 90.0 +75bps (75)bps d Transformation initiatives - F18 +35bps e Proxy contest matters - F18 +25bps f Adjusted EBIT margin (Non-GAAP) $ 2,447.6 19.8 % ~ Flat Effective tax rate (GAAP) 31.5 % 24.5 % Gain on sale of business - 2Q F17 (0.9 %) - b Workforce Optimization Effort - 4Q F17 (0.0 %) - c Transformation initiatives - F17 +0.4 % - d Transformation initiatives - F18 - (0.0 %) e Proxy contest matters - F18 - +0.1 % f Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - F18 +1.7 % g Adjusted effective tax rate (Non-GAAP) 30.9 % 26.2 % Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 3.85 18 % 11% - 12 % Gain on sale of business - 2Q F17 (0.27 ) (7 %) ~+7 % b Workforce Optimization Effort - 4Q F17 (0.01 ) (0 %) ~+0 % c Transformation initiatives - F17 0.12 +3 % ~(3 %) d Transformation initiatives - F18 - - ~+2 % e Proxy contest matters - F18 - - ~+1 % f Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - F18 - - ~(3 %) g Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 3.70 13 % 16% - 17 % a) We continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. These adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.” No material impact is expected from changes in all other interest expense or income in fiscal 2018. b) Second quarter fiscal 2017 impact from gain on the sale of CHSA and COBRA businesses. c) Fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Workforce Optimization Effort adjustment is a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate and is not expected to recur in fiscal 2018. The majority of charges relating to the Workforce Optimization Effort represent severance charges. Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges related to a broad-based, company-wide Workforce Optimization Effort. d) Impact of Fiscal 2017 charges in connection with the Service Alignment Initiative. e) The charges within transformation initiatives primarily represent expected severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of $20 million, and other transformation initiatives of $27 million. Severance charges have been taken in the past and are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. Unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. This estimate does not reflect charges related to the Company's announced voluntary early retirement program. f) Expected impact of Fiscal 2018 charges in connection with proxy contest matters. g) Expected Fiscal 2018 one-time benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP may contain “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
