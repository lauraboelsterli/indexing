    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (“Patriot”) announces that it has completed its acquisition of Prime Bank (“Prime”). The closing of the transaction, which became effective upon the close of business, Thursday, May 10, 2018, adds a second branch in New Haven County for Patriot, bringing its total branch and ITM kiosk count to 11 and total assets to $928 million, on a pro forma basis as of March 31, 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Prime had approximately $65 million in total assets. The addition of Prime’s customers and scale promote operating efficiencies, while adding to Patriot’s core deposits, liquidity and earnings. Patriot remains on track to surpass its $1 billion milestone in total assets in the 2 nd half of 2018.\nPatriot’s Chairman and CEO, Michael Carrazza, stated, “Patriot welcomes Prime Bank’s employees and customers to our family and to the expanded array of banking products and services we offer. The closing of this acquisition completes the first of two announced transactions that promote our business objectives to increase growth, diversification, earnings strength and shareholder value creation.”\nJay Jaser, Prime Bank’s former Chairman and CEO added “We are excited that Prime Bank’s customers are now part of Patriot, where they can benefit from a larger and more entrepreneurial banking platform.”\nIn February, Patriot announced its now-pending acquisition of Los Angeles-based Hana Small Business Lending (“Hana SBL”). In 2017, Hana SBL was the third most active non-bank SBA lender in the nation by origination volume. Upon the closing of this pending acquisition, Patriot will become one of the nation’s leading SBA 7(a) lenders.\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is based on Patriot’s historical consolidated financial statements and Prime’s historical financial statements adjusted to give effect to the Company’s acquisition of Prime. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet was prepared as if the merger occurred on March 31, 2018 and includes pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the merger and are factually supportable.\nAbout Patriot Bank\nFounded in 1994, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. is the parent holding company of Patriot Bank N.A.
