After its extensive review and consultation process, the Company concluded that the Recapitalization Transaction represents the best available alternative to realign the Company's capital structure and to position the business for long-term growth.\nMPA Morrison Park Advisors Inc. (\"MPA\") has provided opinions to Concordia's Board of Directors that (i) the Recapitalization Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view to Concordia, (ii) the Secured Debtholders, the Unsecured Debtholders and the Shareholders provided consideration under the Recapitalization Transaction, respectively, would be in a better position, from a financial point of view, under the Recapitalization Transaction than if the Company were liquidated; (iii) the consideration provided to the Secured Debtholders under the Recapitalization Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Secured Debtholders; (iv) the consideration provided to the Unsecured Debtholders under the Recapitalization Transaction, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Unsecured Debtholders; and (v) the consideration provided to Shareholders under the Recapitalization Transaction, is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Shareholders.\nAfter careful consideration and based on a number of factors, including the opinions of MPA, the legal advice from its counsel and the Company's counsel, the financial advice from the Company's financial advisor, and the terms of the Recapitalization Transaction, Concordia's Board of Directors determined that the Recapitalization Transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, and unanimously recommends that the Secured Debtholders, the Unsecured Debtholders and the Shareholders of Concordia support and vote in favour of the Recapitalization Transaction and the CBCA Plan.\nThe Recapitalization Transaction is also supported by Secured Debtholders holding in the aggregate approximately US$1.6 billion in principal amount, or approximately 72%, of the Company's Secured Debt and Unsecured Debtholders holding approximately US$1.0 billion in principal amount, or approximately 64%, of the Company's Unsecured Debt, pursuant to the Support Agreements discussed above. The Company expects to receive additional support from its stakeholders over the coming weeks as the Recapitalization Transaction process advances.\nThe Meetings and Voting and Early Consent Matters\nThe Meetings are scheduled to be held at the offices of Goodmans LLP at 333 Bay Street, Suite 3400, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2S7 on June 19, 2018. The Secured Debtholders' Meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time), the Unsecured Debtholders' Meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. (Toronto time) and the Shareholders' Meeting is scheduled to begin at 11:00 a.m. (Toronto time).\nPursuant to the Interim Order, the Record Date for the Meetings is 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on May 9, 2018. Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders as at the Record Date will be entitled to vote on the CBCA Plan at the applicable Meeting based on one vote per US$1,000 of principal amount of Secured Debt or Unsecured Debt, respectively, held as at the Record Date. Shareholders as at the Record Date will be entitled to vote on the CBCA Plan at the Shareholders' Meeting based on one vote per common share held as at the Record Date. On the Record Date, the agents under each of the Company's secured term loans and unsecured equity bridge loan will freeze the ledgers in respect of such loans, and from and after the Record Date the agents will not record or process transfers of such loans.\nIn order for Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders to be eligible to receive the Secured Debtholder Early Consent Cash Consideration or the Unsecured Debtholder Early Consent Shares, respectively, such Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders must submit a vote in favour of the CBCA Plan by the Early Consent Date of June 6, 2018, as such date may be extended by Concordia, except as otherwise provided in the Interim Order.\nThe deadline for Secured Debtholders, Unsecured Debtholders and Shareholders to submit their proxies or voting instructions in order to vote on the CBCA Plan and other items to be considered at the applicable Meeting is 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on June 15, 2018 (the \"Voting Deadline\").\nBanks, brokers or other intermediaries that hold the Secured Debt, Unsecured Debt or common shares on a securityholder's behalf may have internal deadlines that require securityholders to submit their votes by an earlier date in advance of the Early Consent Date and/or the Voting Deadline, as applicable. Securityholders are encouraged to contact their intermediaries directly to confirm any such internal deadline.\nTo be approved, the CBCA Plan requires the affirmative vote of at least 66⅔% of the votes cast at each of Secured Debtholders' Meeting and the Unsecured Debtholders' Meeting, and the affirmative vote of at least 66⅔% of the votes cast at the Shareholders' Meeting; provided that, the Company has the right under the Interim Order to seek Court approval of the CBCA Plan even if it is not approved by the Shareholders at the Shareholders' Meeting.\nShareholder Approvals\nPursuant to the OBCA, the Continuance requires shareholder approval. In addition, under the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"), shareholder approval is required in connection with the Recapitalization Transaction as it will (a) \"materially affect control\" of the Company by creating a holding or holdings in excess of 20% of the Company's voting securities, and (b) result in dilution exceeding 25% of the outstanding common shares at an issue price that is less than the current market price.\nAccordingly, at the Shareholders' Meeting, in addition to voting in respect of the CBCA Plan, Shareholders will also be asked to consider and vote in respect of the Continuance, the issuance of common shares of Concordia pursuant to the Recapitalization Transaction that \"materially affect control\" of Concordia, the issuance of common shares of Concordia pursuant to the Recapitalization Transaction that amount to greater than 25% of the common shares of Concordia outstanding today at a price per share below the current market price, and the adoption of the Management Incentive Plan.\nAnnual Shareholders' Meeting\nThe Shareholders' Meeting in connection with the CBCA Plan is scheduled to be held concurrently with Concordia's annual meeting of shareholders (the \"Annual Shareholders' Meeting\"), at which Shareholders will also be asked to consider and approve other matters set out in the Circular (as defined below) relating to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and such other matters as may otherwise be properly brought before such Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\nCourt Approval and Implementation\nIf the CBCA Plan is approved by the requisite majorities at the Secured Debtholders' Meeting and the Unsecured Debtholders' Meeting, the Company and its subsidiary, Concordia Healthcare (Canada) Corp. (\"CHCL\"), will attend a hearing before the Court currently scheduled for June 26, 2018 or such other date as may be set by the Court, to seek Court approval of the CBCA Plan.\nCompletion of the Recapitalization Transaction will be subject to, among other things, approval of the CBCA Plan by the requisite majorities of the Secured Debtholders and the Unsecured Debtholders at the Meetings to be held on June 19, 2018, such other approvals as may be required by the Court or the TSX, other applicable regulatory approvals, approval of the CBCA Plan by the Court and the satisfaction or waiver of applicable conditions precedent. If all requisite approvals are obtained and the other conditions to completion of the Recapitalization Transaction are satisfied or waived, it is expected that the Recapitalization Transaction will be completed on or about the end of July 2018. Upon implementation, the CBCA Plan would bind all holders of the Secured Debt and the Unsecured Debt and the Shareholders of the Company.\nAs part of the Court approval of the Recapitalization Transaction, the Company will seek a permanent waiver of any and all: (a) defaults resulting from the commencement of these CBCA proceedings, and (b) third party change of control provisions that may be triggered by the implementation of the Recapitalization Transaction.\nAdditional Information and Materials\nThe information circular for the Meetings (the \"Circular\") will contain, among other things, information regarding procedures for voting on the CBCA Plan, eligibility for early consent consideration and elections in respect of the New Senior Secured Term Loans and the New Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the terms of the Recapitalization Transaction and the Interim Order, as well as other background and material information regarding the Recapitalization Transaction.

Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nAlternative Implementation Process\nThe Recapitalization Transaction is being implemented pursuant to the CBCA Plan. In order to be in the best position to advance the Recapitalization Transaction pursuant to insolvency proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (a \"Chapter 11 Process\"), if applicable, Concordia is soliciting votes in respect of the CBCA Plan contemporaneously with soliciting votes in respect of a Chapter 11 Process. Concordia intends to complete and implement the CBCA Plan pursuant to the CBCA Proceedings. Contemporaneous solicitation of votes in respect of a Chapter 11 Process ensures that the Company has the future ability to also complete the Recapitalization Transaction under such an alternative implementation process if the Company elects to do so in the future, subject to certain conditions and consent requirements as provided for in the Support Agreement. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Interim Order, a vote cast in favour of the CBCA Plan at the Meetings may also be counted in favour of implementing a plan of arrangement on substantially similar terms in any insolvency proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) that may be commenced by the Company, to the extent such proceedings are consented to by the Majority Private Placement Parties and the Majority Initial Consenting Debtholders (each as defined in the schedule to this news release).\nDisclosure of Certain Information Pursuant Confidentiality Agreements\nConcordia also announced today the disclosure of certain non-public information (the \"Disclosure Materials\") that has been provided to certain Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders that entered into confidentiality agreements (collectively, the \"Confidentiality Agreements\") with Concordia in connection with advancing the Recapitalization Transaction.

The inclusion of the FOFI herein and in the Disclosure Materials should not be regarded as an indication that Concordia considers the FOFI to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the FOFI should not be relied upon as such.\nRisks and other factors related to FOFI include those risks and other factors referenced in this press release as well as in Concordia's filings with the Canadian Securities Regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, including (a) the factors described under the heading \"Forward-looking Statements\" in Concordia's Management's Discussion and Analysis dated March 8, 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and (b) the factors described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Concordia's Annual Report on Form 20-F dated March 8, 2018, both of which are available on SEDAR, online at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR, online at www.sec.gov .\nNotice regarding non-IFRS measures\nCertain financial data included in the Disclosure Materials, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit and Pre-Interest Free Cash Flow, are \"non-IFRS measures.\" These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures to provide supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures.\nNotice regarding forward-looking statements and information:\nThis press release and the Disclosure Materials include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, regarding Concordia and its business, which may include, but are not limited to statements with respect to: the terms of the Recapitalization Transaction including, but not limited to, with respect to raising new equity capital, the exchange of Secured Debt for cash and New Secured Debt, the exchange of Unsecured Debt for new common shares, the aggregate consideration payable to Secured Debtholders and Unsecured Debtholders, and the percentage of the common shares outstanding to be retained by existing Shareholders;
