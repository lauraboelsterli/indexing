    "text": "WATERTOWN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bright Horizons Family Solutions ® Inc. (NYSE: BFAM), a leading provider of high-quality child care, early education and other services designed to help employers and families better address the challenges of work and family life, today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and updated certain financial guidance for the full year 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (compared to first quarter 2017):\nRevenue increased 10% to $464 million Income from operations increased 8% to $55 million Net income decreased 10% to $37 million and diluted earnings per common share decreased 9% to $0.62\nNon-GAAP measures\nAdjusted income from operations* increased 8% to $56 million Adjusted EBITDA* increased 6% to $83 million Adjusted net income* increased 15% to $43 million and diluted adjusted earnings per common share* increased 18% to $0.72\n“We are pleased with the strong start to 2018, as we continue to grow each of our service offerings, expand our portfolio of client partners, and support working families so they can thrive and prosper at work and at home,” said Stephen Kramer, Chief Executive Officer. “This continued success is the direct result of the hard work of more than 30,000 Bright Horizons employees committed to making a lasting difference in the lives of others.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue increased $41.5 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 2018 from the first quarter of 2017 on contributions from new and ramping full service child care centers, average price increases of 3-4%, and expanded sales of back-up dependent care and educational advisory services. As of January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance, which had an immaterial impact on the Company’s results from operations, and upon adoption, no adjustment was recorded to the opening retained earnings.\nIncome from operations was $55.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase from $51.4 million in the same 2017 period, due to increases in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in gross profit reflects contributions from enrollment gains in mature and ramping centers, new child care centers, back-up dependent care and educational advisory clients that have increased utilization levels or been added since the first quarter of 2017, and strong cost management. These gains were partially offset by investments in marketing and technology to support our customer user experience, service delivery and operating efficiency, costs incurred during the pre-opening and ramp-up phase of newer lease/consortium centers and amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. Net income was $37.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $41.4 million in the same 2017 period, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 10%, attributable to higher tax expense. Tax expense increased for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefit associated with certain equity transactions from $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $5.5 million in the same 2018 period. Diluted earnings per common share was $0.62 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.68 in the same 2017 period.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased $4.8 million, or 6%, to $83.2 million, and adjusted income from operations increased $4.2 million, or 8%, to $55.6 million, from the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the expanded gross profit. Adjusted net income increased by $5.7 million, or 15%, to $42.6 million on the expanded income from operations and a lower effective tax rate. Diluted adjusted earnings per common share was $0.72 compared to $0.61 in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company operated 1,051 child care and early education centers with the capacity to serve 117,250 children and families.\n*Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, straight line rent expense, stock-based compensation expense, and transaction costs. Adjusted income from operations represents income from operations before transaction costs. Adjusted net income represents net income determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense, transaction costs and the income tax provision (benefit) thereon. Diluted adjusted earnings per common share is a non-GAAP measure, calculated using adjusted net income. These non-GAAP measures are more fully described and are reconciled from the respective measures determined under GAAP in “Presentation of Non-GAAP Measures” and the attached table “Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated approximately $105.8 million of cash flows from operations compared to $106.7 million for the same 2017 period and invested $29.5 million in fixed assets and acquisitions compared to $22.9 million in the same 2017 period. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $79.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $77.1 million for the same 2017 period. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.9 million to $20.3 million.\n2018 Outlook\nAs described below, the Company is updating certain financial guidance. For the full year 2018, the Company currently expects:\nRevenue growth in 2018 in the range of 8-10% Net income in the range of $150 million to $152 million and diluted earnings per common share in the range of $2.53 to $2.56 Adjusted net income in the range of $183 million to $186 million and diluted adjusted earnings per common share in the range of $3.12 to $3.16 Diluted weighted average shares of approximately 59 million shares\nFor a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, refer to the attached table “Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\nConference Call\nBright Horizons Family Solutions will host an investor conference call today at 5:00 pm ET. Interested parties are invited to listen to the conference call by dialing 1-877-407-9039 or, for international callers, 1-201-689-8470, and asking for the Bright Horizons Family Solutions conference call moderated by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Kramer. Replays of the entire call will be available through May 21, 2018 at 1-844-512-2921 or, for international callers, 1-412-317-6671, conference ID #13678190. The webcast of the conference call, including replays, and a copy of this press release are also available through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site, www.brighthorizons.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes statements that express the Company’s opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements.” The Company’s actual results may vary significantly from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements, which can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “projects,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or “anticipates,” or, in each case, their negatives or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They include statements regarding the Company’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth plan, strategies, our service offerings, our clients, estimates and impact of recently enacted tax legislation and excess tax benefits, and our 2018 financial guidance. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The Company believes that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in the demand for child care and other dependent care services, including variation in enrollment trends and lower than expected demand from employer sponsor clients; the possibility that acquisitions may disrupt our operations and expose us to additional risk; our ability to pass on our increased costs; our indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness; our ability to withstand seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our services; our ability to implement our growth strategies successfully; the impact of recently enacted tax legislation; and other risks and uncertainties more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 28, 2018, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the time of this release and we do not undertake to publicly update or revise them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) throughout this press release, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements - adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share - which present operating results on a basis adjusted for certain items. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures as key performance indicators for the purpose of evaluating performance internally, and in connection with determining incentive compensation for Company management, including executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in connection with the determination of certain ratio requirements under our credit agreement. We also believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. The use of the terms adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share are reconciled from the respective measures under GAAP in the attached table “Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. Non-GAAP Reconciliations.”\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, expenses related to the completion of secondary offerings and debt financing transactions, and expenses associated with completed acquisitions as well as tax effects associated with these items. These adjustments to net income and diluted earnings per common share in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the types of charges and costs excluded from adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share in prior quarters, although we can provide no assurance as to the timing or magnitude of any such adjustments. The exclusion of these charges and costs in future periods will have an impact on the Company’s adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per common share.\nAbout Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.\nBright Horizons Family Solutions ® is a leading provider of high-quality child care, early education and other services designed to help employers and families better address the challenges of work and family life.

(b) Represents rent expense in excess of cash paid for rent, recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, Leases.\n(c) Represents non-cash stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\n(d) Represents transaction costs incurred in connection with a secondary offering. (e) Represents income tax expense calculated on adjusted income before income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 23% and 27% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The tax rate for 2018 represents a tax rate of approximately 27-28% applied to the expected adjusted income before tax for the full year, less the estimated effect of additional excess tax benefits related to equity transactions for the full year 2018, which the Company estimates will be in the range of $10.5 million to $12.5 million. However, the timing, volume and tax benefits associated with such future equity activity will affect these estimates and the estimated effective tax rate for the year. (f) Represents estimated income tax expense using an effective tax rate of approximately 22% for the year ended December 31, 2018, based on projected consolidated income before income tax and including the estimated impact of excess tax benefits related to equity transactions, which the Company estimates in the range of $10.5 million to $12.5 million for the full year in 2018. However, the timing, volume and tax benefits associated with such future equity activity will affect these estimates and the estimated effective tax rate for the year. In addition, the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may differ from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued, and tax planning the Company may undertake. (g) Represents estimated tax on adjusted income before income tax using an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. (h) Forward guidance amounts are estimated based on a number of assumptions and actual results could differ materially from the estimates provided herein.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430006425/en/\nInvestors:\nBright Horizons\nElizabeth Boland, 617-673-8125\nCFO\neboland@brighthorizons.com\nor\nSolebury Communications Group\nKevin Doherty, 203-428-3233\nMD\nkdoherty@soleburyir.com\nor\nMedia:\nBright Horizons\nIlene Serpa, 617-673-8044\nVP - Communications\niserpa@brighthorizons.com\nSource: Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.",
