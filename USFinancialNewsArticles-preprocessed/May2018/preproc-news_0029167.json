Slideshow (4 Images)\nBurnley, who were guaranteed a seventh-placed finish before the kick off, broke the deadlock in the first half after Ashley Westwood’s shot inexplicably struck Chris Wood on its way into the net in the 39th minute.\nBut the Cherries, who stay 12th in the league table, responded after the break with a curling finish from Joshua King before Wilson completed the comeback.
