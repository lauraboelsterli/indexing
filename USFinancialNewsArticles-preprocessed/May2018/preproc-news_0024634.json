    "text": "1 COMMENTS In cybersecurity, it pays to be paranoid. Investors in Symantec SYMC -33.10% are following that advice.\nThe company, which provides security software to both businesses and consumers, shed a third of its market value Friday after it announced that its audit committee was investigating concerns raised by a former employee. The disclosure was made in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter report late Thursday, which also included a revenue outlook for the current fiscal year that was below Wall Street’s forecasts. Symantec said it notified the Securities and Exchange Commission, and executives declined to take questions of any nature on the subsequent conference call.\nPhoto: Bloomberg News The reaction was predictably harsh. At least five brokers cut their buy ratings on the stock, downgrading the shares to neutral. Symantec’s share price was below $19 at midday, which was about the level the stock was trading at when the company split off from its Veritas data storage business to focus solely on cybersecurity in early 2016. The result is a stock trading around 12 times forward earnings, making Symantec one of the cheapest plays in cybersecurity.\nBut that doesn’t make for a bargain. While Symantec gave no further details on the internal probe, it did warn that the resulting investigation could affect its previously reported financials as well as its outlook. That makes both past and future numbers hard to rely on.\nAnd the company has not exactly been free of drama before. Symantec cycled through three CEOs in four years before current chief Greg Clark got the job in mid-2016. And LifeLock, the identity-protection business bought later that year for $2.3 billion, has previously been in hot water with federal regulators over its advertising practices.\nAside from the probe, Symantec’s revenue growth has been decelerating over the last few quarters. And that’s following an acquisition spree that has netted seven deals since the split from Veritas. Adam Holt of MoffettNathanson believes Symantec has been losing share, in the markets for enterprise and email security, to newer companies such as Mimecast and Proofpoint. The company says its revenue weakness is more a factor of enterprise customers shifting to longer-term contracts. That could end up being the case. But in cybersecurity, it generally doesn’t pay to assume the best.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",
