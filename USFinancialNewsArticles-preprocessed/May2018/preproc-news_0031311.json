Bessenger has been appointed Senior Vice President, Finance and Strategy.\nMs. Bessenger has more than 25 years of experience in finance and biotechnology. She most recently served as Chief Financial Officer at 3D Forensic, a San Francisco-based technology company from 2012 until earlier this year.
