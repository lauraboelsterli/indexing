Palestinian demonstrators run for cover during a protest against U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of Nakba, at the Israel-Gaza border in the southern Gaza Strip May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa\n“There should be an investigation into this,” junior foreign office minister Alistair Burt told parliament. “The United Kingdom has been clear in calling for urgently a need to establish the facts of what happened, including why such a volume of live fire was used ...”\n“There are different forms of inquiry that are possible through the United Nations and we have to find the right formula, but it is important to find out all the facts.”\nBurt also called for an easing of restrictions on movement in Gaza and international support for infrastructure and development projects there.
