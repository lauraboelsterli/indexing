    "text": "SAN DIEGO and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sophiris Bio Inc. (NASDAQ: SPHS) (the \"Company\" or \"Sophiris\"), a biopharmaceutical company studying topsalysin (PRX302), a first-in-class, pore-forming protein, in late stage clinical trials for the treatment of patients with urological diseases, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\n\"It has been an exciting quarter at Sophiris as we continue to make progress in advancing topsalysin,\" said Randall E. Woods, president and CEO of Sophiris. \"We are looking ahead to two key events in 2018. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to announce the biopsy results from all patients receiving the first administration of topsalysin in our Phase 2b study, and by the end of the year, we expect complete data from all patients including those patients who received a second administration of topsalysin. In advance of these milestones, we have been actively preparing for a Phase 3 registration study, including engaging in initial discussions with European regulatory agencies. In addition, we are actively moving forward with our manufacturing plans to provide sufficient drug substance for a potential Phase 3 registration study in localized prostate cancer and also a potential second Phase 3 in BPH.\"\nUpcoming Milestones:\nAdvancement of Phase 2b Localized Prostate Cancer Study. The Company announced in December 2017 that it had completed enrollment in its Phase 2b localized prostate cancer study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topsalysin in treating men with clinically significant localized prostate cancer. A total of 38 patients have been treated with topsalysin in the study. The Company expects biopsy data from all patients receiving the first dose of topsalysin to be available by the end of the second quarter for 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) for the Phase 2b trial met to review the reported adverse events from all patients after the first administration of topsalysin. The IDMC unanimously recommended the clinical trial continue without changes to the protocol. The Company believes that topsalysin continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile.\nThe Phase 2b study was designed to include an option to re-treat patients who did not have any clinically significant adverse events and who responded to the first administration of topsalysin but still had a clinically significant lesion. These patients will have the option to receive a second administration of topsalysin followed by an additional, targeted biopsy six months following the second administration. The Company expects to have final biopsy data in the fourth quarter of 2018 from all patients who receive a second administration. This will be the first data potentially supporting repeat administration of topsalysin.\nFinancial Results:\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale of $22.1 million and working capital of $19.2 million. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations to the middle of 2019, assuming no new clinical trials are initiated. The Company reported a net loss of $3.3 million or $(0.11) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million or $(0.09) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in research and development costs is primarily attributable to increases in the costs associated with manufacturing activities for topsalysin, and to a lesser extent, an increase in clinical costs associated with our Phase 2b clinical trial of topsalysin for the focal treatment of localized prostate cancer.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily due to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense which was partially offset by an increase in professional services.\nGain (loss) on revaluation of the warrant liability\nGain on revaluation of the warrant liability was $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $86,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As these warrants may require the Company to pay the warrant holder cash under certain provisions of the warrant, the Company accounts for these warrants as a liability, and the Company is required to calculate the fair value of these warrants each reporting date. The non-cash gain reported for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is associated with a decrease in the fair value of the Company's warrant liability from December 31, 2017, to March 31, 2018, which is calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Certain inputs utilized in the Company's Black-Scholes fair value calculation may fluctuate in future periods based upon factors which are outside of the Company's control. A significant change in one or more of these inputs used in the calculation of the fair value may cause a significant change to the fair value of the Company's warrant liability, which could also result in a material non-cash gain or loss being reported in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAbout Sophiris\nSophiris Bio Inc. is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company developing topsalysin (PRX302) for the treatment of patients with urological diseases. Topsalysin is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of localized prostate cancer as well as Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of the lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Topsalysin is a highly potent ablative agent that is selective and targeted in that it is only activated by enzymatically active PSA that is found in high concentrations in the transition zone of the prostate and in and around prostate tumor cells. More than 400 patients have received topsalysin, which continues to appear to be safe and well tolerated.
