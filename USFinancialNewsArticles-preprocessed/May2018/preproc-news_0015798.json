    "text": "BEIJING, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SINA Corporation (the \"Company\" or \"SINA\") (NASDAQ: SINA), a leading online media company serving China and the global Chinese communities, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We had a good start to the year 2018.\" said Charles Chao, Chairman and CEO of SINA. \"Weibo delivered robust growth of revenues and profit on the back of greater user scale, stronger platform effect and improved monetization efficiency. Weibo continue to benefit from ad budget shift toward social, mobile and video features which the platform combines.\" said Mr. Chao. \"SINA portal business demonstrated its recovery trend with progress achieved in mobile monetization of SINA media properties.\" Mr. Chao added.\nAdoption of New Revenue Guidance\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue guidance ASC Topic 606 , \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\", using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606 ('New Basis'), while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting method under Topic 605 ('Old Basis'). The New Basis requires the presentation of value added tax ('VAT') recognized in revenues from \"gross\" to \"net\", which results in equal decrease in revenues and cost of revenues, and recognition of revenues and expenses at fair value for advertising barter transactions ('Barter Transaction').\nThe Company recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $0.3 million resulting from Barter Transaction as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606.\nAdoption of the standards related to revenue recognition which impacted the Company's current period reported results are as follows:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\nAdjustments\nOld Basis\nASC 605 1\nVAT\nBarter\nTransaction\nNew Basis\nASC 606 2\n($ In thousands, except for percentage)\nNet revenues\n456,101\n(25,161)\n9,812\n440,752\n- Portal\n96,091\n(5,267)\n82\n90,906\n- Weibo\n360,047\n(19,894)\n9,730\n349,883\nCost of revenues\n133,868\n(25,161)\n-\n108,707\nOperating expenses\n246,006\n-\n12,750\n258,756\n- Sales and marketing\n126,937\n-\n12,750\n139,687\nIncome from operations\n76,227\n-\n(2,938)\n73,289\nGross margin\n70.6%\n75.3%\nOperating margin\n16.7%\n16.6%\nNote 1.

Other than the inclusion of marketing expense related to Barter Transactions under ASC Topic 606 as illustrated above, the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred for marketing campaigns and step-up of user acquisition costs for Weibo and SINA News application, as well as the increase in product and development expenses in relations to personnel-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $237.3 million, compared to $127.4 million for the same period last year.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $73.3 million, an increase of 63% compared to $45.0 million for the same period last year.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher profitability with a relatively stable tax rates in our PRC operation.\nNet income attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $28.7 million, compared to $38.5 million for the same period last year. Diluted net income per share attributable to SINA's ordinary shareholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.38, compared to $0.52 for the same period last year.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies. Accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how the Company defines its non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude recognition of deferred revenues related to the license granted to Leju, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, adjustment for non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, gain (loss) on sale of investment, deemed disposal, fair value changes and impairment on investment, and income tax effects of above non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items and adjustment for non-GAAP to GAAP reconciling items for the income attributable to non-controlling interests and amortization of convertible debt issuance cost. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their financial and operating decision-making, because management believes these measures reflect the Company's ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in the following ways: (i) in comparing the Company's current financial results with the Company's past financial results in a consistent manner, and (ii) in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items (i) that are not expected to result in future cash payments or (ii) that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.\nUse of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures do not include all income and expense items that affect the Company's operations. They may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures are set forth in the section below titled \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Results.\"\nConference Call\nSINA will host a conference call from 8:10 a.m. – 8:40 a.m. Eastern Time on May 9 , 2018 (or 8:10 p.m. – 8:40 p.m. Beijing Time on May 9 , 2018) to present an overview of the Company's financial performance and business operations.
