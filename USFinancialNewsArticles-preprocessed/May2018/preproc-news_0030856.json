    "text": "BRANFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sachem Capital Corp. (NYSE American: SACH) announced today its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company also announced that on May 11, 2018 it closed on a new $35 million revolving credit facility to replace its existing $20 million credit facility with Bankwell Bank.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $2.7 million compared to approximately $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 111%. The increase in revenue represents an increase in lending operations. For the 2018 period, interest income from mortgage loans was approximately $2.0 million compared to approximately $1.0 million for the corresponding 2017 period. Origination fees for the 2018 period were approximately $350,000 compared to approximately $97,000 in the corresponding 2017 period. Other income also increased to approximately $295,000 in the 2018 period from approximately $46,000 in the corresponding 2017 period.\nComponents of other income include earnings from advances to borrowers, approximately $60,000, lender fees from closings other than origination fees, approximately $138,000, loan modification fees, approximately $45,000 and legal fees from closings performed in-house, approximately $35,000.\nTotal operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $744,000 compared to approximately $392,000 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately $352,000, or 90%. The increase in operating costs and expenses is due to the increase in lending operations as well as a change in status from a limited liability company to a publicly-held real estate investment trust (REIT) subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs in the 2018 period were approximately $223,000 compared to approximately $116,000 in the 2017 period, an increase of approximately 92%, reflecting the increase in the amount outstanding under the Bankwell credit facility. Similarly, as a result of the Company’s status as a public company, the Company experienced significant increases in professional fees (approximately $116,000 in the 2018 period compared to approximately $84,000 in the corresponding 2017 period), and general and administrative expenses (approximately $98,000 in the 2018 period compared to approximately $46,000 in the 2017 period). In addition, compensation and related costs in the 2018 period was approximately $246,000 compared to $0 in the 2017 period. However, this was offset, in part, by a decrease in compensation to manager which was approximately $36,000 in the 2017 period and $0 in the 2018 period.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $2.0 million compared to approximately $900,000 for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately 120%. Basic and diluted net income per weighted average common share outstanding for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.13 compared to $0.06 per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nResults of operations for 2017 include those of Sachem Capital Partners LLC from January 1 through February 9, 2017. For the 2017 period, net income per weighted average number of shares is calculated based on net income and shares outstanding for the period beginning on February 9, 2017 (the effective date of the Company’s IPO) through March 31, 2017. Net income for that period was approximately $610,000.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total assets were approximately $73.4 million, compared to approximately $67.5 million at December 31, 2017. The Company’s loan portfolio at March 31, 2018 was approximately $69.6 million compared to approximately $63.3 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, at March 31, 2018 interest and fees receivable from borrowers increased to approximately $780,000 from approximately $645,000 at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total liabilities were approximately $18.5 million, including approximately $14.1 million outstanding under the Bankwell credit facility and approximately $300,000 outstanding under the term mortgage loan from Bankwell secured by the property expected to become the Company’s new corporate headquarters in late 2018. In comparison, at December 31, 2017, the Company’s total liabilities were approximately $12.9 million, including approximately $9.8 million outstanding under the Bankwell credit facility and $301,000 outstanding on the Bankwell mortgage loan. In addition, at March 31, 2018, the Company had a mortgage funding payable of $2.0 million.\nShareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 was approximately $54.9 million compared to approximately $54.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, on May 11, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation, Bankwell Bank and Berkshire Bank (collectively, the “Lenders”) under which the Lenders agreed to provide the Company with a $35 million revolving credit facility to replace the Bankwell credit facility, which has now been repaid in full and terminated. The new credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets. Amounts outstanding under the new credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 4.00% per annum and will be due and payable on May 11, 2022.\nJohn Villano CPA, co-chief executive officer of Sachem Capital Corp., stated: “The first quarter of 2018 marked our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in terms of revenue, net income, net income per share, portfolio growth and shareholders’ equity. Our primary focus continues to be delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. To achieve this goal, we continue to look for low-risk, high yield lending opportunities. In addition, we continue to search for new sources of capital. To that end, we are extremely pleased to announce that we have just recently successfully refinanced our revolving credit facility. The new credit facility, $35 million, is being provided by a consortium of banks, including Bankwell Bank, which has been our primary lender for the last four years and we are pleased that they are included in the syndicate for the new facility. We are also looking forward to developing a similar long-term relationship with the other syndicate members, Webster Business Credit Corporation and Berkshire Bank.”\nAbout Sachem Capital, Corp.\nSachem Capital Corp. (SCC), is the successor to Sachem Capital Partners, LLC (SCP) having acquired all of SCP’s assets and assumed all of SCP’s liabilities in February 2017. Immediately thereafter, SCC completed an underwritten initial public offering of its shares. (Except where otherwise stated to the contrary, SCC and SCP are, collectively, referred to as the “Company”.) The Company specializes in originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage loans. It offers short term (i.e., three years or less) secured, non­banking loans (sometimes referred to as “hard money” loans) to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, development, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located primarily in Connecticut. The Company does not lend to owner occupants. The Company’s primary underwriting criteria is a conservative loan to value ratio. The properties securing the Company’s loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are held for resale or investment. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate and may also be secured with additional real estate collateral. Each loan is also personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower. The Company also makes opportunistic real estate purchases apart from its lending activities. SCC believes that it qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes and intends to make the election to be taxed as a REIT when it files its 2017 federal income tax return.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.
