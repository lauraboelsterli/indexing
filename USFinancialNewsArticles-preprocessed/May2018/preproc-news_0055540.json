    "text": "Moody's said on Tuesday it would downgrade Italy if the fiscal policies of the next government were unable to place the country's public debt ratio on a sustainable downward trend.\nThe political developments of the last few days have no bearing on Friday's decision to place Italy's ratings under review for downgrade, the credit rating agency said.\nThe agency was referring to the failed attempt by Italy's far right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement to form a government. Moody's added the review of Italy's ratings could last more than the usual three month period.",
