    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem encouraged Israeli forces to kill dozens of Palestinian protesters on the Gaza border, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday, adding that the embassy move disregarded the rights of Palestinians.\nA fire truck is seen in a burning field on the Israeli side of the border fence between Israel and Gaza near kibbutz Mefalsim, Israel, May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen “We curse the massacre carried out by Israeli security forces, encouraged by this step, on the Palestinians participating in peaceful demonstrations,” the statement said after health officials said Israeli forces killed at least 28 Palestinians along the Gaza border on Monday.\nReporting by Daren Butler; Editing by Dominic Evans\n ",
