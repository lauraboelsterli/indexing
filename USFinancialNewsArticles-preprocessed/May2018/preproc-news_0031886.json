Our strong profitability clearly demonstrates the resilience of our core business model despite the changes in the operating and regulatory environment during the past few months. With delinquency trends improving and volume growth resuming since March, we are confident the consumer lending market in China will continue to present significant growth opportunities for PPDAI.\n\"We are committed to driving the expansion of our core business and also investing in new avenues of growth. One of those avenues is capitalizing on our proprietary technological capabilities, massive data sets and accumulated expertise garnered throughout our 11-year operating history to provide a suite of cutting-edge technologies as a service to third party financial services providers. As a pioneer and industry leader, we are dedicated to delivering the most innovative technology solutions in China's consumer finance market.\" concluded Mr. Zhang.\nMr. Simon Ho, the Chief Financial Officer of PPDAI, added, \"During the quarter, we remained focused on enhancing operating efficiencies and increasing profitability as well as implementing operational adjustments to ensure regulatory compliance. Notably, we achieved non-GAAP adjusted operating income growth of 47.5% year-over-year and a healthy non-GAAP operating margin of 43.9%. We believe our scalable operations and advanced technology platform position us well to capture increasing opportunities as market conditions improve while also ensuring we maintain regulatory compliance.\"\nAccounting Policy Change\nEffective January 1, 2018, PPDAI adopted the new revenue recognition policy, ASC 606 â€” Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method in accordance with US GAAP (\"ASC 606\"). As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the revenue standard as an increase of approximately RMB176.0 million to the opening balances of retained earnings, and the Company also recognized an increase in revenue of approximately RMB170.0 million (US$27.1 million). These adjustments primarily arose from the timing of revenue recognition for transaction fees collected in monthly instalments related to our loan products being recognized earlier under ASC 606. The Company provides the loan facilitation services and post-facilitation services as multiple derivable arrangements. Under ASC 605, transaction fees collected in monthly instalments are considered contingent and, therefore, are not allocable to different deliverables until the contingency is resolved (i.e. upon receipt of the monthly transaction fee). Upon adoption of ASC 606, revenue is recognized upon successful matching of borrowers and investors using the total consideration estimated to be received and allocated to the different performance obligations based upon their relative fair value. Other significant changes relate to timing of revenue recognition for the accounting management fee of certain investment programs. The Company begins to recognize revenue from account management fee from certain types of investment programs over the term of the investment programs, which is substantially within twelve months, rather than waiting until the maturity of the investment program, generally twelve months after the date of issuance of the investment program.\nThe ASC 606 revenue recognition standard also considers certain loan collection fees as variable consideration related to loan facilitation and post-facilitation performance obligations, and therefore loan collection fees of RMB110.3 million (US$17.6 million) have been allocated from other revenues to loan facilitation and post-facilitation service fees in the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nOperating revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 37.1% to RMB916.8 million (US$146.2 million) from RMB668.5 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in loan facilitation service fees, post-facilitation service fees and other revenues as a result of an increase in loan origination volume. As a result of the adoption of the ASC 606, revenue is generally recognized earlier in the life of the contract. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of applying the new revenue standard resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately RMB170.0 million (US$27.1 million).\nLoan facilitation service fees increased by 22.8% to RMB620.8 million (US$99.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB505.3 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to an increase in loan origination volume on the Company's platform and the adoption of ASC 606 new revenue recognition standard effective January 1, 2018. Loan collection fees of RMB83.1 million (US$13.3 million) have been allocated from other revenues to loan facilitation services fees related to the adoption of ACS 606. The average rate of transaction fees charged to borrowers was 6.32% in the period, compared to 6.24% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 6.95% in the first quarter of 2017.\nPost-facilitation service fees increased significantly by 166.0% to RMB227.2 million (US$36.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB85.4 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in loan origination volume, the rolling impact of deferred transaction fees and the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. Loan collection fees of RMB27.2 million (US$4.3 million) have been allocated from other revenue to post facilitation service fees related to the adoption of ASC 606.\nOther revenue decreased by 11.5% to RMB68.8 million (US$11.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB77.8 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 from January 1, 2018, offset by an increase in management fees from investment programs that invest in loans protected by the quality assurance fund.\nNet interest income and loan provision losses for the first quarter of 2018 was a gain of RMB27.0 million (US$4.3 million), compared to a gain of RMB0.5 million in the same period of 2017, mainly due to the increased number of trusts we set up in 2017 for the purpose of serving institutional investors.\nOrigination and servicing expenses increased by 42.5% to RMB247.1 million (US$39.4 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB173.4 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in headcount related costs.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 10.1% to RMB151.1 million (US$24.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB137.2 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in expenses associated with (i) online customer acquisition, which mainly include expenses paid to internet marketing channels for online advertising and search engine marketing, as well as to certain websites that give PPDAI access to quality borrowers, and (ii) enhancing brand image.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 88.7% to RMB145.5 million (US$23.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB77.1 million in the same period of 2017, primarily due to the increase in staff costs. General and administrative expenses for the period included share-based compensation of RMB14.7 million (US$2.3 million).\nOperating income increased by 42.3% to RMB400.1 million (US$63.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB281.2 million in the same period of 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income , which excludes share-based compensation before tax, was RMB414.7 million (US$66.1 million), representing an increase of 47.5% from RMB281.2 million in the same period of 2017.\nOther income was RMB132.1 million (US$21.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB209.2 million in the same period of 2017. Other income primarily consisted of a RMB59.7 million (US$9.5 million) gain from the quality assurance fund resulting from increase in loans facilitated on the Company's platform that are protected by the quality assurance fund, and a gain of RMB71.5 million (US$11.4 million) from fair value change of financial guarantee derivatives due to an improvement in the expected default rate for loans invested by outstanding investment programs protected by the investor reserve funds, a realized loss of RMB45.2 million (US$7.2 million) from financial guarantee derivatives due to the amount of investment programs maturing during the period. The Company re-evaluates the fair value of outstanding guarantee derivatives at each balance sheet date to reflect the views of market participants on the expected default rate based on the latest market changes. For the first quarter of 2018, RMB7.8 billion of loans facilitated on the Company's platform were protected by the quality assurance fund.\nIncome tax expenses were RMB94.6 million (US$15.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB73.6 million in the same period of 2017.\nNet profit increased by 5.0% to RMB437.6 million (US$69.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018 from RMB416.8 million in the same period of 2017.\nNet profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company was RMB439.0 million (US$70.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018, compared with net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB285.1 million in the same period of 2017 due to the accretion losses on the Company's Series A, B and C preferred shares in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB1,476.2 million (US$235.3 million) and short-term investments mainly in wealth management products of RMB2,261.9 million (US$360.6 million).\nThe total balance of the quality assurance fund, which includes restricted cash of RMB1,163.6 million (US$185.5 million) and the quality assurance fund receivable of RMB1,325.3 million (US$211.3 million), was equivalent to 19.0% of the total outstanding loans protected by the quality assurance fund.\nThe following table provides the delinquency rates for all outstanding loans on the Company's platform as of the respective dates indicated.\nAs of\n15-29\ndays\n30-59\ndays\n60-89\ndays\n90-119 days\n120-149 days\n150-179 days\nMarch 31, 2015\n0.79%\n1.75%\n1.10%\n1.01%\n0.87%\n0.67%\nJune 30, 2015\n0.88%\n1.06%\n0.67%\n0.54%\n0.89%\n0.67%\nSeptember 30, 2015\n0.67%\n0.89%\n0.61%\n0.54%\n0.44%\n0.35%\nDecember 31, 2015\n0.80%\n0.93%\n0.51%\n0.49%\n0.39%\n0.32%\nMarch 31, 2016\n0.62%\n0.93%\n0.72%\n0.61%\n0.48%\n0.32%\nJune 30, 2016\n0.82%\n1.01%\n0.63%\n0.43%\n0.47%\n0.44%\nSeptember 30, 2016\n0.83%\n1.11%\n0.80%\n0.63%\n0.49%\n0.39%\nDecember 31, 2016\n0.63%\n0.91%\n0.75%\n0.79%\n0.69%\n0.57%\nMarch 31, 2017\n0.57%\n0.95%\n0.79%\n0.59%\n0.54%\n0.51%\nJune 30, 2017\n0.86%\n1.11%\n0.79%\n0.51%\n0.55%\n0.52%\nSeptember 30, 2017\n0.89%\n1.40%\n1.15%\n1.02%\n0.79%\n0.60%\nDecember 31, 2017\n2.27%\n2.21%\n1.72%\n1.63%\n1.36%\n1.20%\nMarch 31, 2018\n0.87%\n2.11%\n2.43%\n3.83%\n2.29%\n1.89%\nThe following chart and table display the historical cumulative 30-day plus past due delinquency rates by loan origination vintage for all continuing loan products facilitated through the Company's online marketplace.\nClick here to view the chart.\nMonth on Book\nVintage\n2 nd\n3 rd\n4 th\n5 th\n6 th\n7 th\n8 th\n9 th\n10 th\n11 th\n12 th\n2015Q1 . . . .\n1.95%\n2.75%\n3.46%\n3.98%\n4.36%\n4.58%\n4.67%\n4.69%\n4.73%\n4.76%\n4.74%\n2015Q2 . . . .\n1.74%\n2.66%\n3.38%\n3.75%\n4.02%\n4.15%\n4.30%\n4.38%\n4.45%\n4.46%\n4.46%\n2015Q3 . . . .\n1.46%\n2.13%\n2.70%\n3.15%\n3.47%\n3.68%\n3.77%\n3.85%\n3.93%\n4.01%\n4.02%\n2015Q4 . . . .\n1.54%\n2.27%\n2.88%\n3.17%\n3.53%\n3.77%\n3.97%\n4.12%\n4.26%\n4.32%\n4.33%\n2016Q1 . . . .\n1.00%\n1.57%\n2.21%\n2.82%\n3.33%\n3.77%\n4.09%\n4.33%\n4.45%\n4.57%\n4.59%\n2016Q2 . . . .\n1.75%\n2.49%\n3.21%\n3.77%\n4.17%\n4.39%\n4.59%\n4.76%\n4.88%\n4.94%\n4.96%\n2016Q3 . . . .\n1.67%\n2.45%\n2.96%\n3.47%\n3.87%\n4.11%\n4.27%\n4.44%\n4.59%\n4.70%\n4.77%\n2016Q4 . . . .\n1.29%\n2.07%\n2.66%\n3.15%\n3.59%\n3.97%\n4.32%\n4.62%\n4.88%\n5.07%\n5.18%\n2017Q1 . . . .\n1.20%\n2.01%\n2.68%\n3.32%\n3.87%\n4.33%\n4.68%\n4.98%\n5.33%\n5.61%\n5.80%\n2017Q2 . . . .\n1.72%\n2.89%\n3.81%\n4.55%\n5.14%\n5.78%\n6.32%\n6.79%\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n2017Q3 . . . .\n1.82%\n2.93%\n4.08%\n5.16%\n6.13%\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\n2017Q4 . . . .\n2.51%\n4.12%\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nBusiness Outlook\nPPDAI currently expects total loan volume for the fiscal year 2018 to be in the range of RMB70 billion to RMB80 billion.
