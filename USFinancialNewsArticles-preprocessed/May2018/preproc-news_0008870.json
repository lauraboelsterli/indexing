    "text": "Todd Bonin was named Senior Executive Producer for CNBC's Squawk on the Street in July 2011. He is responsible for leading the two-hour show, which airs live from Post 9 on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He works closely with his editorial team and CNBC anchors Jim Cramer , Carl Quintanilla , David Faber and Sara Eisen . The program focuses on breaking news through the lens of high profile interviews and CNBC reporting. Squawk on the Street has led CNBC's coverage of stock market volatility and historic initial public offerings such as Facebook, Twitter, and Alibaba. Todd was named Executive Producer of the newly minted Squawk Alley in May 2014. The program, featuring Carl Quintanilla, Jon Fortt and Morgan Brennan , reports on the intersection of Wall St. and technology. Squawk Alley leverages both newsmaking interviews and CNBC's access to Silicon Valley at its One Market bureau in San Francisco. In 2016, Todd oversaw the launch of Binge â€” a digital interview series with Carl Quintanilla looking at the future of media, content and the streaming phenomenon.\nPrior to joining Squawk on the Street , Todd spent 4 years as the Senior Producer of CNBC's landmark morning broadcast, Squawk Box . He came to CNBC after 9 years with CNN, with successful roles both in the field and the control room on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and American Morning .\nTodd also led that network's coverage of events such as the Enron trial and the launch of the original Apple iPhone. Todd holds a B.A. in Communications from the University of Pennsylvania. He lives with his wife and two sons in New York.\nFollow Todd Bonin on Twitter @toddbonin and LinkedIn toddbonin .",
