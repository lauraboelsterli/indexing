    "text": "ROCKVILLE, Md., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) today reported operating results for its first quarter . Highlights of the quarter include:\nGenerated earnings per diluted share of $0.81 for the quarter compared to $0.78 in first quarter 2017. Generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) per diluted share of $1.52 for the quarter compared to $1.45 in first quarter 2017. Generated comparable property property operating income (POI) growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. Signed leases for 403,250 sf of comparable space in the first quarter at an average rent of $31.51 psf and achieved cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 22%. Maintained our 2018 FFO per diluted share guidance range to $6.08 - $6.24.\n\"We're very pleased with our first quarter results,\" said Donald C. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The combination of new retail tenant openings on both coasts, strong residential occupancy at our mixed use destinations and disciplined spending have come together for an impressive and powerful financial result in the quarter.\"\nFinancial Results\nNet income available for common shareholders was $59.2 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.81 for first quarter 2018 versus $56.1 million and $0.78, respectively, for first quarter 2017.\nIn the first quarter 2018, Federal Realty generated FFO of $112.4 million, or $1.52 per diluted share. This compares to FFO of $105.8 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in first quarter 2017.\nFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.\nPortfolio Results\nIn first quarter 2018, comparable property POI increased 3.8%. Comparable property POI represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment.\nThe overall portfolio was 94.8% leased as of March 31, 2018 compared to 94.6% on March 31, 2017. Federal Realty's comparable property portfolio was 95.3% leased on March 31, 2018 compared to 95.1% on March 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, on a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty signed 78 leases for 403,250 square feet at an average cash basis contractual rent increase (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 22%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $31.51 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $25.91 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases. The previous average contractual rent was calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a straight-line basis, rent increases for comparable retail space averaged 31% for first quarter 2018.\nRegular Quarterly Dividends\nFederal Realty also announced today that its Board of Trustees declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, resulting in an indicated annual rate of $4.00 per common share. The regular common dividend will be payable on July 16, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of June 22, 2018.\nGuidance\nFederal Realty maintained its 2018 guidance for FFO per diluted share of $6.08 to $6.24 and updated 2018 earnings per diluted share guidance to $3.05 to $3.21.\nConference Call Information\nFederal Realty's management team will present an in-depth discussion of the Trust's operating performance on its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call, which is scheduled for Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00AM ET.

Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in the forward- on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. These factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in our K filed on February 13, 2018, and include the following:\nrisks that our tenants will not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire; risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopments or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete, or fail to perform as expected; risks that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may not perform as planned, may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded; risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected, that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions, that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space, insurance and other operations may increase, that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and, because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate; risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital; risks associated with general economic conditions, including local economic conditions in our geographic markets; risks of financing, such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.\nGiven these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this press release. Except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully review the risks and risk factors included in our K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2018.\nFederal Realty Investment Trust\nConsolidated Balance
