    "text": "SHANGHAI, China, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GDS Holdings Limited (“GDS Holdings,” “GDS” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GDS), a leading developer and operator of high-performance data centers in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet revenue increased by 83.7% year-over-year (“Y-o-Y”) to RMB562.2 million (US$89.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018 (1Q2017: RMB306.0 million, excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million). Service revenue increased by 84.1% Y-o-Y to RMB551.5 million (US$87.9 million) in the first quarter of 2018 (1Q2017: RMB299.6 million, excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million). Net loss was RMB85.9 million (US$13.7 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of RMB44.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased by 127.0% Y-o-Y to RMB181.3 million (US$28.9 million) in the first quarter of 2018 (1Q2017: RMB79.9 million, excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million). See “Non-GAAP Disclosure” and “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” elsewhere in this earnings release. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) increased to 32.2% in the first quarter of 2018 (1Q2017: 26.1%, excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million).\nOperating Highlights\nTotal area committed increased by 79.8% Y-o-Y to 122,819 sqm as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 68,313 sqm). Area utilized (or revenue-generating space) increased by 76.5% Y-o-Y to 66,905 sqm as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 37,898 sqm). Area in service increased by 69.4% Y-o-Y to 103,475 sqm as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 61,092 sqm). Commitment rate for area in service was 93.8% as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 90.0%) and utilization rate was 64.7% as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 62.0%). Area under construction was 40,357 sqm as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 35,055 sqm). Pre-commitment rate for area under construction was 63.8% as of March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: 37.9%).\n“We delivered robust financial results in the first quarter of 2018 backed up by continued strong sales momentum,” said Mr. William Huang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In the first quarter of 2018, we added over 20,000 sqm (net) to our total area committed, which is almost 50% of what we did for the full year of 2017. The key to maintaining our sales growth momentum is resource supply and ensuring we have the capacity to fulfill not only the needs of our large internet and cloud customers, but also those of our growing number of financial service institution and enterprise customers. We have made significant progress in building up our development pipeline. During the second quarter of 2018, we have initiated two new projects in Beijing, where supply is very tight, and a further project in Shanghai. In addition, our recently announced GZ3 acquisition will double our capacity in the Guangzhou market when fully-developed. We are very confident of our ability to sustain our outstanding sales performance, maintain resource supply to our customers, and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\n“We achieved double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth rates for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA during the traditionally slow first quarter of the year,” said Mr. Dan Newman, Chief Financial Officer of GDS Holdings. “We continued to realize operating leverage by expanding our adjusted EBITDA margin. In January, we successfully completed the follow-on offering, and raised approximately US$200 million of net proceeds to support our fast-growing business plan. We will keep delivering during the course of the year and are fully on track to achieve our targets.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB562.2 million (US$89.6 million), a 60.6% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and an 11.2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million booked in the first quarter of 2017, net revenue increased by 83.7% Y-o-Y. Service revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB551.5 million (US$87.9 million), a 60.5% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and an 11.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million booked in the first quarter of 2017, service revenue increased by 84.1% Y-o-Y. The sequential increase in net revenue and service revenue was mainly due to the full quarter revenue contribution from additional area utilized in the previous quarter and the contribution from 5,192 sqm of net additional area utilized in the first quarter of 2018. Revenue from IT equipment sales was RMB10.8 million (US$1.7 million), compared with RMB6.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB11.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCost of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB439.3 million (US$70.0 million), an 80.2% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and a 13.4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to an increase in utility costs as a result of higher area utilized by customers, an increase in depreciation and amortization costs and other related costs such as personnel and maintenance as a result of the completion of Beijing 3 (“BJ3”), Shenzhen 4 (“SZ4”) Phase 1 and Shanghai 4 (“SH4”) data centers in the previous quarter, as well as the completion of Shanghai 5 (“SH5”) Phase 1 data center in the first quarter of 2018.\nGross profit was RMB122.9 million (US$19.6 million) in the first quarter of 2018, a 15.7% increase over the first quarter of 2017 and a 4.0% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million booked in the first quarter of 2017, gross profit increased by 97.8% Y-o-Y. Gross profit margin was 21.9% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 20.3% (excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million) in the first quarter of 2017 and 23.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin over the previous quarter was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization costs and other related costs as a result of new data centers coming into service in the previous quarter and in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted Net Operating Income (“Adjusted NOI”) (non-GAAP) is defined as gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and share-based compensation expenses allocated to cost of revenue. Adjusted NOI was RMB252.0 million (US$40.2 million) in the first quarter of 2018, a 40.5% increase over the first quarter of 2017 of RMB179.4 million and a 10.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 of RMB227.2 million. Excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million booked in the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted NOI (non-GAAP) increased by 86.2% Y-o-Y.\nAdjusted NOI margin (non-GAAP) was 44.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 44.2% (excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million) in the first quarter of 2017, and 44.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The minor decrease from the previous quarter was mainly due to fixed costs of new data centers coming into service in the previous quarter and in the first quarter of 2018 which are at an early stage of ramping-up.\nSelling and marketing expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB5.0 million (US$0.8 million), were RMB21.8 million (US$3.5 million) in the first quarter of 2018, a 29.1% increase over the first quarter of 2017 of RMB16.9 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB4.4 million) and a 29.2% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 of RMB16.9 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB5.6 million). The increase over the previous quarter was primarily due to higher personnel expenses as a result of sales bonus booked in the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB7.5 million (US$1.2 million), were RM55.4 million (US$8.8 million) in the first quarter of 2018, a 33.7% increase from the first quarter of 2017 of RMB41.5 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB7.3 million), and a 5.1% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2017 of RMB58.4 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB10.0 million). The decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to less activities during the Chinese New Year leading to a decrease in office and travelling expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were RMB2.7 million (US$0.4 million) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with RMB1.5 million in the first quarter 2017 and RMB2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were RMB115.1 million (US$18.3 million), a 46.4% increase over the first quarter of 2017 of RMB78.6 million and a 15.6% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2017 of RMB136.3 million. The decrease over the previous quarter was mainly due to interest expenses ceasing on convertible bonds which were fully converted in the previous quarter, and a one-time debt issuance cost write-off related to refinancing facilities booked in the previous quarter, partially offset by higher interest expenses paid on a higher total debt balance in the first quarter of 2018.\nForeign currency exchange loss for the first quarter of 2018 was RMB3.2 million (US$0.5 million), compared with a loss of RMB2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a loss of RMB6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB85.9 million (US$13.7 million), compared with a net loss of RMB44.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a net loss of RMB116.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is defined as net loss excluding net interest expenses, income tax benefits, depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was RMB181.3 million (US$28.9 million) in the first quarter of 2018, a 46.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017 of RMB123.9 million and an 17.0% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 of RMB154.9 million. Excluding the termination fee of RMB44.1 million booked in the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased by 127.0% Y-o-Y.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 32.2% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 26.1% (excluding the one-time termination fee of RMB44.1 million) in the first quarter of 2017 and 30.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase over the previous quarter was due to the operating leverage realized on corporate overhead costs.\nBasic and diluted loss per ordinary share in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB0.09 (US$0.01), compared with RMB0.06 in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBasic and diluted loss per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB0.71 (US$0.11), compared with RMB0.47 in the first quarter of 2017 and RMB1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares.\nSales\nTotal area committed by customers at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was 122,819 sqm, compared with 68,313 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 102,528 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 79.8% Y-o-Y and 19.8% Q-o-Q. In the first quarter of 2018, net additional area committed was 20,291 sqm, including contributions from significant pre-commitments by one of our largest customers for two new build-to-suit data centers. The sales increase was driven by rapid cloud adoption and data growth in China leading to higher demand from cloud and large internet players, as well as significant new commitments from large enterprise and financial service institution customers.\nData Center Resources\nArea in service at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was 103,475 sqm, compared with 61,092 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 101,258 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 69.4% Y-o-Y and 2.2% Q-o-Q. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the construction of the SH5 Phase 1 data center.\nArea under construction at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was 40,357 sqm, compared with 35,055 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 24,505 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, as disclosed previously, the Company started construction of the Shanghai 8 (“SH8”), Hebei 2 (“HB2”) and Hebei 3 (“HB3”) data centers, and upsized Shenzhen 5 (“SZ5”) Phase 2 from 5,000 sqm to 7,858 sqm due to higher power capacity secured.\nCommitment rate of area in service was 93.8% at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared with 90.0% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 91.8% at the end of fourth quarter 2017. Pre-commitment rate of area under construction was 63.8% at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared with 37.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 39.0% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. The significantly higher pre-commitment rate reflected the strong sales momentum and higher visibility of future requirements by the hyper-scale customers.\nArea utilized at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was 66,905 sqm, compared with 37,898 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 61,713 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 76.5% Y-o-Y and 8.4% Q-o-Q.\nUtilization rate of area in service was 64.7% at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared with 62.0% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 and 60.9% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash was RMB2,978.6 million (US$474.9 million).

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company obtained new debt financing facilities of RMB 500.0 million (US$79.7 million).\nRecent Developments\nData Center Acquisition in Guangzhou\nOn April 18, 2018, the Company announced the acquisition of a data center project in Guangzhou (“GZ3”). GZ3 is a new purpose-built data center with potential for around 13,000 sqm of total IT area. It is being developed in three phases, the first of which, comprising approximately 6,600 sqm, has just entered service and is 100% committed by one of the Company’s largest cloud and internet customers. GZ3 is strategically located in the same vicinity as the existing GZ1 and GZ2 data centers, creating a data center cluster all anchored by major cloud and internet customers. The acquisition has closed during the second quarter of 2018.\nNew Data Centers Under Construction\nThe Company recently initiated the construction of two new projects in the Beijing market, Beijing 4 (“BJ4”) and Beijing 5 (“BJ5”) Phase 1, and one new project in the Shanghai market, Shanghai 9 (“SH9”).

BJ5 will be developed in two phases with Phase 1 comprising an IT area of approximately 5,000 sqm currently under construction. SH9 is a converted data center located in Waigaoqiao district, close to the Company’s existing Shanghai data centers. It will provide approximately 3,800 sqm of IT area and is currently under construction. Customer commitments are expected shortly. These projects will come into service during 2019.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 10, 2018 (8:00 p.m. Beijing Time on May 10, 2018) to discuss financial results and answer questions from investors and analysts. Listeners may access the call by dialing:\nUnited States: 1-845-675-0437 International: +65-6713-5090 Hong Kong: +852-3018-6771 China: 400-620-8038 Conference ID: 7399323 A telephone replay will be available approximately two hours after the call until May 18, 2018 by dialing:\nUnited States: 1-646-254-3697 International:\nHong Kong:\nChina: +61-2-8199-0299\n+852-3051-2780\n400-632-2162 Replay Access Code: 7399323 A live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relation website at investors.gds-services.com .\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nOur management and board of directors use adjusted NOI, adjust NOI margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, establish budgets and develop operational goals for managing our business. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted NOI and adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure of our core operating performance.\nWe also present these non-GAAP measures because we believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as measures of the financial performance of companies in our industry.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flows used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures instead of their nearest GAAP equivalent. First, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted NOI, and adjusted NOI margin are not substitutes for gross profit, net income (loss), cash flows used in operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Second, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. Finally, these non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the impact of net interest expenses, incomes tax benefits, depreciation and amortization, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs, and share-based compensation expenses, each of which have been and may continue to be incurred in our business.\nWe mitigate these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance.\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.\nExchange Rate\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“USD”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to USD were made at the rate of RMB6.2726 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on March 30, 2018 in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or USD amounts referred could be converted into USD or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\nStatement Regarding Preliminary Unaudited Financial Information\nThe unaudited financial information set out in this earnings release is preliminary and subject to potential adjustments.
