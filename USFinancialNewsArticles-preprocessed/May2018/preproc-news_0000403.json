    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Galenfeha, Inc. (OTC: GLFH ) announced today the company signed a Letter of Intent to acquire Fleaux Services of Louisiana, LLC, a leading oil and gas measurement company, for $18,000,000 USD. The acquisition is contingent on Galenfeha's ability to raise the funds, and the Company has engaged Wall Street firm Paulson Investment Company, LLC as the lead placement agent for financing the transaction.\nGalenfeha's founder, Mr. James Ketner stated: \"We have a lot of work to do, and I want to inform the public of some upcoming changes, so there are no surprises. Mr. Trey Moore, President/CEO, and founder of Fleaux Services, is assuming the role of Galenfeha's Chief Executive Officer. I believe there is nobody more qualified to take the position, as he is a young, charismatic leader with a great operational history in the oil and gas industry. He has the ability to lead the company to continued growth in the future. I will be working directly with Mr. Moore over the next several months as he transitions into the role.\"\nBuilding on his historic relationships in the oil and gas industry, Trey Moore founded Fleaux Services six years ago. The company is now a premier provider of oil and gas measurement, automation, and control equipment, boasting revenues of approximately $21m in 2016, approximately $36m in 2017, and revenues for first quarter 2018 of approximately $12m.\nMr. Trey Moore, Galenfeha's newly appointed CEO commented: \"I am excited about what lies ahead of us with this potential acquisition, and our most recent acquisition. I also want to thank Mr. Ketner for his personal sacrifices over the last year and a half in order to prepare Galenfeha for these opportunities. He has done a tremendous job staying focused and diligent in getting us to this point. We are looking forward to his continued involvement, direction, and leadership in our promising future.\"\nMr. Ketner added: \"In addition to the change in the CEO position, we will also be electing a new board of directors. In order to meet the listing requirements for the NYSE-MKT exchange, we need to have board independence, and have already identified two experienced candidates to fill the roles of Chairman and Audit committee chair.\"\n\"Lastly, our investment firm has advised us to eliminate the preferred stock to make our capital structure less complicated for potential investors funding this transaction. All preferred shares will move 1:1 into the common. This should by no means be perceived as a rush for the door by our current affiliates. I personally believe there is a tremendous opportunity here for all investors going forward over the next several years,\" Mr. Ketner concluded.\nAbout Galenfeha, Inc.:\nGalenfeha, Inc. was founded by James Ketner in March 2013 as an Engineering Services/Research and Development company headquartered in Ft.
