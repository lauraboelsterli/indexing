It’s because investors hate uncertainty, and these elections create a healthy dose of just that.\nBelow, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.\nPLANNING & INVESTING\nWalmart Bets $15 Billion on an E-Commerce Passage to India: The retailer is poised to acquire a 75% stake in India’s free-wheeling online-sales giant, Flipkart.\nA Star Bond-Fund Manager Avoids the Shortcuts .

He says banks run into problems from time to time and Wells Fargo’s issues aren’t different. In fact, he says Wells Fargo’s issues are less egregious than big banks during the financial crisis when many of these banks falsely bundled mortgages in the act of selling MBS. He finishes by saying that he doesn’t have an issue that it’s an insider — Tim Sloan — who is now going to be cleaning up Wells Fargo. (geoffrey.rogow@wsj.com; @grogow)\nWhat Is Going on With Warren Buffett’s Cash Pile? : One of the big questions about Berkshire Hathaway these days is what is it going to with all its cash: recently north of $100B. The firm put $15B of cash into stocks in the first quarter and will continue to look for ways to deploy the money, says Warren Buffett on CNBC. That could be buying $50B in stocks or Berkshire could find a $50B business to buy. He notes, “something will happen,” adding “I’d rather have that [cash position] be $30 billion.” ( geoffrey.rogow@wsj.com, @grogow)\nBUSINESS & PRACTICE\nWhat Is a ‘Sudden Stop’ in Markets?: Capital flows into emerging-markets economies can shift course abruptly, sparking an investor stampede for the exits.\nTALKING POINTS\nWarren Buffett’s Lieutenants Are Increasingly Running Berkshire: New leaders are helping to steer the sprawling conglomerate with the boss now ‘semiretired’ .\nTRAVEL & LIFESTYLE\nDerby Winner Justify Looks to the Preakness: Horse racing’s newest star is drawing comparisons to 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.\n$$$\nThe WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing covers topics of interest to wealth managers, financial planners and other advisers.
