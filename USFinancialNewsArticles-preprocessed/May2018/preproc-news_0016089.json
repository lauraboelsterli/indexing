Greg will play a critical role in developing, expanding, and enhancing those efforts.”\nBartolomei will lead NRTC’s portfolio of smart grid solutions, which includes metering and metering networks, analytics, demand management, smart energy (including solar), and storage. In addition, he will look for ways to more closely integrate NRTC’s broadband network solutions division (Pulse Broadband), as NRTC continues to work with rural utilities to improve network connectivity through fiber optics and fixed wireless technologies.\n“I’m honored to be joining NRTC at such a critical time,” Bartolomei said. “Leveraging technology to help rural utilities improve their internal operations, engage their members and customers and continue their pioneering work in the communities they serve is very exciting, and NRTC is well positioned to continue its leadership in this critical effort.”\nBartolomei brings nearly 30 years of engineering and utility experience. Most recently, he led the development, quality assurance and program management teams responsible for all electric automation solutions at Eaton.

He also worked at Ciena Corporation where he led efforts to revolutionize optical transport, intelligent switching and software tools for large-scale communications networks.\nBartolomei holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineer from the University of Maryland and Master’s Degrees in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from The Catholic University of America.\nAbout NRTC\nWe are Member Driven and Technology Focused.
