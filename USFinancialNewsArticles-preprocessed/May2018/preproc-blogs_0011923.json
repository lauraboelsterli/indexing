    "text": "Getty Images Elon Musk\nTesla saw its worst day in more than a month, shedding 5.5percent Thursday — a day after an earnings beat and bizarre call with analysts .\nShares closed at $284.45after trading as low as $275.23.\nThe company's earnings report on Wednesday showed a narrower-than-expected loss as Tesla continued to burn through cash — but investors seemed to have weathered all of that just fine. The stock ticked up a few percent immediately following the report.\nIt wasn't until the company's earnings call — during which CEO Elon Musk refused to answer what he called \"boring bonehead questions\" from analysts — that shares tanked.\nAs of Thursday's close, the stock is down nearly 9 percent on the year and more than 25percent off its 52-week high.
