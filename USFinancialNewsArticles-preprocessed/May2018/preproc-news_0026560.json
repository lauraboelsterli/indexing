Income from Operations decreased 2% to $15.0 million, for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018, versus same period during prior year. Net Income decreased 15% to $ 14.1 million, for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018, versus same period during prior year mostly due to net tax adjustments of $2.2 million or 13.3% of the 15% decrease. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net provision of $0.9 million and a net benefit of $1.3 million ($1.9 million benefit offset by a $0.6 million provision) for the nine-months ended March 31, 2017. Diluted Net Income per Common Share available to Common Shareholders decreased 19% to $1.66, for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018, versus same period during prior year. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 52% to $15.4 million over the first nine-months of Fiscal 2018. Working Capital increased by 25% to $48.8 million over the first nine-months of Fiscal 2018.\nMELVILLE, N.Y., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FONAR Corporation (NASDAQ:FONR), The Inventor of MR Scanning ™, announced today its financial results for the 3rd Fiscal Quarter of 2018 and the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s two industry segments are: development, manufacturing and servicing of the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI, aka Stand-Up® MRI , and management of 26 MRI centers through its subsidiary, Health Management Company of America (HMCA).\nThe FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI scanner is the world’s only MRI scanner licensed under FONAR’s multiple UPRIGHT® MRI patents to scan all the patient’s body parts in their normal full weight-bearing UPRIGHT® position. FONAR’s substantial list of patents includes recent patents for its technology enabling full weight-bearing MRI imaging on all the gravity sensitive regions of the human anatomy, especially the brain, extremities, spine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.\nStatement of Operations Items\nRevenues for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $21.0 million as compared to $20.0 million for the corresponding quarter one year earlier. Revenues increased to $ 60.5 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $57.1 million for the corresponding period one year earlier.\nNet Income for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $4.3 million as compared to $7.1 million for the corresponding quarter one year earlier mostly due to a tax provision of $0.2 million as compared to $1.1 million benefit for the corresponding quarter one year earlier. Net Income was $14.1 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018 from $16.6 million for the corresponding period one year earlier mostly due to a tax provision of $0.9 million as compared to a $1.3 million benefit for the corresponding period one year earlier.\nIncome from Operations for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $4.4 million as compared to $6.0 million for the corresponding quarter one year earlier. Income from Operations for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $15.0 million as compared to $15.4 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017. During the period, costs of approximately $1.1 million are related to the acquisition of MRI scanners in Great Neck, NY, and White Plains, NY and the installation of a FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI in the Bronx, NY.\nDiluted Net Income Per Common Share Available to Common Shareholders for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.51 as compared to $0.88 for the corresponding quarter one year earlier. Diluted Net Income Per Common Share Available to Common Shareholders for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 was $1.66 as compared to $2.05 for the corresponding period one year earlier. Diluted Net Income was adversely affected due to deferred tax asset adjustments and costs related to the addition of MRI scanners.\nTotal Costs and Expenses for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $16.6 million as compared to $14.0 for the corresponding quarter one year earlier. Total Costs and Expenses for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 were $45.5 million as compared to $41.8 for the corresponding period one year earlier and the increase was mainly due to increased patient volume plus the three additional aforementioned MRIs.\nBalance Sheet Items\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents at March 31, 2018, was $ 15.4 million, as compared to $10.1 million at June 30, 2017.\nTotal Assets ended March 31, 2018 were $106.5 million, as compared to $98.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nTotal Current Assets ended March 31, 2018 were $ 61.2 million, as compared to $53.4 million at June 30, 2017.\nTotal Liabilities ended March 31, 2018 were $ 13.9 million, as compared to $15.9 million at June 30, 2017.\nTotal Current Liabilities ended March 31, 2018 were $ 12.3 million, as compared to $14.2 million at June 30, 2017.\nManagement Discussion\nFor the nine-month period, Total Revenues increased by $3.3 million and Total Costs and Expenses increased by $3.7 million. However, $1.2 million of the Total Costs and Expenses is attributable to the accompanying operating costs and depreciation expense resulting from the acquisition of Turnkey Equipment of Great Neck, LLC, the addition of a new imaging center in White Plains, NY, and, due to popular demand for FONAR technology, the addition of a third MRI scanner in our Bronx, NY location.\nPresident and CEO, Timothy R. Damadian said, “We’ve grown our Company by increasing scan volume at our existing facilities, establishing de novo centers, and making key acquisitions. The increase in scan volume is reflected in the Company’s 6% increase in Revenue and its continuing profitability.”\n“Regarding the dip in net income, the addition of the three aforementioned MRI scanners was certainly a contributing factor, but it’s only temporary and is to be expected when you’re making investments that will soon mature and add to the Company’s continuing growth in revenue, net income, and earnings per share. The installation of a second Stand-Up® MRI in the Bronx was due to extremely high patient demand for our flagship MRI scanner.\n“We remain actively engaged in exploring new growth opportunities, whether it’s new locations, adding MRI scanners at existing locations, or strategic acquisitions that will add value to our Company,” said Mr. Damadian. “With Cash up by 52% and Working Capital up by 25%, we are well positioned, eager, and poised for continuing success.”\n\"It's rewarding to me,\" said Raymond V. Damadian, M.D., Chairman of the Board of Directors of FONAR Corporation, \"how consistently profitable we are while continuing to grow the Company. Our UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ (aka Stand-Up®) MRI scanner, for example, is unique. Its ability to medically visualize the spine of a patient with back pain (which condition is responsible for a very significant percentage of all MRI scans performed by all MRI scanners worldwide each year) in its normal upright fully weight bearing position is unique. Its power to visualize the spine supporting the full weight load that it normally has to sustain each day and to position the patient in the exact position (that he/she specifies to the MRI technologist who is positioning him/her in the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI) that generates his/her pain (which the conventional recumbent MRI cannot do) is unparalleled.\"\n\"This power of the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI to completely visualize ALL the anatomy components under their full weight load that are giving rise to the patient's pain, which the conventional recumbent MRI cannot do, assures that the surgical procedure chosen for his/her treatment will be the optimal treatment for the patient and achieve optimal outcome. Most importantly FONAR’s latest findings from its quantitative UPRIGHT® MRI are measurements of cerebrospinal fluid flow that constitute a a revolutionary new medical frontier with strong prospects of being able to bring substantial medical benefit to patients suffering from Multiple Schlerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Amyotrophis Lateral Schlerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), and Autism (the neurodegenerative diseases) that currently are impaired by the limited prospects of permanent solutions for these ailments.\"\n\"In addition,\" continued Dr. Damadian, \"Please read my 2018 Letter to Shareholders . In the letter, I report that as of December 31, 2017, FONAR posted 31 consecutive quarters of positive net income and positive income from operations. Now, with another quarter reported, the tally becomes 32 quarters or 8 years of FONAR achieving a profit, which is something I am quite proud of.\"\nAbout FONAR\nFONAR, The Inventor of MR Scanning ™, is located in Melville, NY, was incorporated in 1978, and is the first, oldest and most experienced MRI company in the industry. FONAR introduced the world’s first commercial MRI in 1980, and went public in 1981. FONAR’s signature product is the FONAR UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI (also known as the Stand-Up® MRI), the only whole-body MRI that performs Position™ Imaging (pMRI™) and scans patients in numerous weight-bearing positions, i.e. standing, sitting, in flexion and extension, as well as the conventional lie-down position. The FONAR UPRIGHT® MRI often detects patient problems that other MRI scanners cannot because they are lie-down and ”weightless” only scanners. The patient-friendly UPRIGHT® MRI has a near-zero patient claustrophobic rejection rate. As a FONAR customer states, “If the patient is claustrophobic in this scanner, they’ll be claustrophobic in my parking lot.” Approximately 85% of patients are scanned sitting while watching TV.\nFONAR has new works-in-progress technology for visualizing and quantifying the cerebral hydraulics of the central nervous system, the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) , which circulates throughout the brain and vertebral column at the rate of 32 quarts per day. This imaging and quantifying of the dynamics of this vital life-sustaining physiology of the body’s neurologic system has been made possible first by FONAR’s introduction of the MRI and now by this latest works-in-progress method for quantifying CSF in all the normal positions of the body, particularly in its upright flow against gravity. Patients with whiplash or other neck injuries are among those who will benefit from this new understanding.\nFONAR’s substantial list of patents includes recent patents for its technology enabling full weight-bearing MRI imaging of all the gravity sensitive regions of the human anatomy, especially the brain, extremities and spine. It includes its newest technology for measuring the Upright cerebral hydraulics of the central nervous system. FONAR’s UPRIGHT® Multi-Position™ MRI is the only scanner licensed under these patents.\nUPRIGHT® and STAND-UP® are registered trademarks and The Inventor of MR Scanning™ , Full Range of Motion™, Multi-Position™ , Upright Radiology™, The Proof is in the Picture™ , True Flow™, pMRI™ , Spondylography™, Dynamic™ , Spondylometry™, CSP™ , and Landscape™, are trademarks of FONAR Corporation.\nThis release may include forward-looking statements from the company that may or may not materialize.
