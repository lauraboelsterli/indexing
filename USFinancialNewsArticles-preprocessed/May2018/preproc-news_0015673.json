    "text": "Avengers: Infinity War\nMore \"Avengers\" movies could be on their way, Disney said on Tuesday, following the globalsuccess of \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" which has smashed box office records since its release last month.\nWalt Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts on an earnings call that the fourth, already announced \"Avengers\" movie in the Marvel comic book franchise, due to be released in May 2019, would have a \"significant conclusion.\"\nBut, Iger added, \"Given the popularity of the characters and given the popularity of the franchise, I don't think people should conclude that there will never be another 'Avengers' movie.\"\n\"There's certainly a lot more stories to tell, a lot more characters to populate those stories with,\" he said.\n\"Avengers: Infinity War,\" which brought together more than 20 Marvel superheroes, set a new opening weekend box office record for North America of $250 million when it debuted at theend of April. The movie has earned more than $1 billion globally, even before it opens in China.\nDirectors Joe and Anthony Russo shot an as yet untitled follow-up back-to-back with \"Infinity War.\" That movie is scheduled for release on May 3, 2019. Details of the plot have not been released.\nIger added that Disney would also likely \"try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers,\" noting that there were some 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe that could be explored in film.\nIger was speaking after Disney announced quarterly profits that topped Wall Street forecasts, partly based on the success of Marvel movie \"Black Panther.\"\nDisney already has two other Marvel movies set to be released within the next year â€“ \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" in July, and \"Captain Marvel\" in March 2019. WATCH: Disney now has 9 of the 10 biggest U.S. box office openings show chapters ",
