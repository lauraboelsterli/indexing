    "text": "HOUSTON, May 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PLx Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:PLXP) (“PLx” or the “Company”), a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing two patent-protected products, Aspertec™ 325 mg and Aspertec™ 81 mg (referred to together as “Aspertec”™), announced today certain financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights of, and certain events subsequent to, the first quarter of 2018 include:\nNet income totaled $5.0 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to net loss of $1.4 million, or ($0.33) per share, for the first quarter of 2017. This includes a non-cash gain of $8.4 million for a change in the fair value of warrant liability, or $0.97 per share;\nAttended American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) conferences, to build awareness and articulate the clinical value proposition of Aspertec with the medical community and with key members of the retail trade;\nProgressing in our plan to obtain an alternate supply of material and anticipate launching Aspertec by mid-2020.\n“We continue to engage with members of the medical community and the retail trade to build awareness of Aspertec. We have received additional positive feedback as these important constituents learn more about the benefits of Aspertec, namely its more predictable and reliable antiplatelet efficacy than enteric-coated aspirin, and improved gastrointestinal safety over regular aspirin. We believe our products have the potential to change the standard of care in the treatment of coronary disease,” said Natasha Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer of PLx Pharma.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe Company recognized revenue of $81,000 in the first quarter of 2018, attributable to work performed under an award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) federal grant received in 2017. The Company had no revenue in the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were approximately $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the initiation of technology transfer, contract manufacturing activities, and other product development activities for Aspertec. The Company incurred $128,000 of research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expense totaled $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to $0.6 million of increased compensation and benefits, including non-cash stock compensation expense, and prelaunch marketing to healthcare professionals of $0.2 million and other professional and administrative fees of $0.2 million.\nOther income (net of expense), was $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.1 million of net expense in the first quarter of 2017. This increase related to the non-cash gain related to the change in fair value of a warrant liability of $8.4 million, partially offset by $0.2 million of additional interest expense and debt discount amortization related to the Company’s term loan with Silicon Valley Bank in the 2018 period.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.0 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or ($0.33) per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, The Company had $20.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nAbout Aspertec\nAspertec 325 mg is an FDA-approved aspirin product being developed to provide high-risk cardiovascular and stroke patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric-coated aspirin, while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting. PLx is focused on manufacturing, scale-up and label finalization for Aspertec 325 mg aspirin dosage form and preparing an sNDA for Aspertec 81 mg maintenance dose form.\nAbout PLx Pharma Inc.\nPLx Pharma Inc. is a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing its clinically validated and patent-protected PLxGuard™ delivery system to provide effective and safe aspirin products. The PLxGuard delivery system works by targeting delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to various portions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. PLx believes this has the potential to improve the absorption of many drugs currently on the market or in development, and to reduce acute GI side effects—including erosions, ulcers and bleeding—associated with aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially other drugs.\nTo learn more about PLx Pharma Inc. and its pipeline, please visit www.plxpharma.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements made in this press release relating to future financial or business performance, conditions, plans, prospects, trends, or strategies and other financial and business matters, including without limitation, the prospects for commercializing or selling any products or drug candidates, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
