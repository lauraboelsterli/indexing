    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - The life of a professional athlete can seem a dream, but these days Naomi Osaka is happy to be lost in her virtual world.\nMay 28, 2018, Paris, France; Naomi Osaka (JPN) during her match against Sophia Kenin (USA) on day two of the 2018 French Open at Roland Garros. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports The Japanese 20-year-old scooted into the French Open third round on Wednesday with a quick-fire 6-4 7-5 win over Zarina Dyas before offering a glimpse into her life.\n“Well, I’m only here if I have to be, to be honest,” she said, when asked how much time she spends in the picturesque grounds of Roland Garros in the French capital.\n“Like, if I have a match or something and just to eat lunch. Before, when I was younger, I used to love walking around and just experiencing the atmosphere. But now I just sort of think of this as my job, so it’s like clocking in and clocking out.\n“(I’m) hoping to spend as little time as possible...”\nMay 28, 2018, Paris, France; Naomi Osaka (JPN) in action during her match against Sophia Kenin (USA) on day two of the 2018 French Open at Roland Garros. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports In fact the 21st seed prefers to spend time in her hotel room in a virtual world, and is traveling with her Sony Playstation games console.\n“For me, it’s just sometimes I’m really bored in my room, and I feel like I really want to play a game or something, so that’s why I started bringing it,” she said.\n“And now it’s sort of consumed my time a little bit because literally, if I have 30 minutes, then I’ll just sit there, and I might be a little bit late.\n“Like, I’ll spend 35 minutes, and then I’m like, ‘Oh, my God. It’s 30 minutes past’, and then I have to rush out the door. So if I’m ever late to anything, you know why...”\nReporting by Ken Ferris\n ",
