Consolidated net loss from continuing operations of $21.2 million, consolidated net loss attributable to EchoStar common stock of $21.6 million, and diluted losses per share of $0.22. Included in these amounts are net losses on investments of $36.7 million. Excluding these net losses, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.16. Consolidated EBITDA of $165.7 million, including net losses on investments of $36.7 million. Excluding these net losses, EBITDA would have been $202.4 million (see discussion and the reconciliation of GAAP to this non-GAAP measure below).\nAdditional Highlights:\nApproximately 1,267,000 Hughes broadband subscribers as of March 31, 2018. Cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities of $3.3 billion as of March 31, 2018\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted two new accounting pronouncements:\nTopic 606 relating to revenue recognition and the related costs from contracts with customers. The adoption decreased our revenue by $1.2 million and increased our net income by $1.1 million for the three months\nTopic 321 relating to accounting for investments. The adoption decreased our net losses on investments by $19.1 million and correspondingly increased our net income by $19.1 million.\nSet forth below is a table highlighting certain of EchoStar's segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nRevenue\nHughes\n$\n400,818\n$\n329,320\nEchoStar Satellite Services\n96,753\n100,326\nCorporate & Other\n4,221\n3,505\nTotal\n$\n501,792\n$\n433,151\nEBITDA\nHughes\n$\n136,713\n$\n100,852\nEchoStar Satellite Services\n84,150\n83,063\nCorporate & Other:\nCorporate overhead, operating and other\n(17,870)\n(18,952)\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates, net\n(1,009)\n6,408\nGains (losses) on investments, net\n(36,268)\n11,943\nSub-total\n(55,147)\n(601)\nTotal\n$\n165,716\n$\n183,314\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations\n$\n(21,171)\n$\n30,775\nNet income from discontinued operations\n$\n—\n$\n6,577\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(21,171)\n$\n37,352\nExpenditures for property and equipment from continuing operations\n$\n50,982\n$\n89,950\nThe following table reconciles GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(21,171)\n$\n37,352\nInterest income and expense, net\n47,116\n37,105\nIncome tax benefit, net\n(5,403)\n(12)\nDepreciation and amortization\n145,554\n115,083\nNet income from discontinued operations\n—\n(6,577)\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(380)\n363\nEBITDA\n$\n165,716\n$\n183,314\nNote on Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA is defined as \"Net income (loss)\" excluding \"Interest income and expense, net,\" \"Income tax provision (benefit), net,\" \"Depreciation and amortization,\" \"Net income (loss) from discontinued operations,\" and \"Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\" This measure is not determined in accordance with US GAAP. EBITDA is reconciled to \"Net income (loss)\" in the table above and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses this non-GAAP measure as a measure of our operating efficiency and overall operating financial performance for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business and is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our financial performance. Management also believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of companies in our industry.\nThe consolidated financial statements of EchoStar for the periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are attached to this press release.
