    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evolus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EOLS) (“Evolus”), a lifestyle aesthetics company focused on delivering advanced aesthetic procedures and treatments to physicians and consumers, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights:\nRaised gross proceeds of approximately $60.6 million through the sale of 5,047,514 shares of common stock at a price of $12.00 per share in an initial public offering; Presented European and Canadian Phase III EVB-003 head-to-head comparative trial data at the American Academy of Dermatology 2018 Annual Meeting, the 2018 Aesthetic and Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress and The Aesthetic Meeting, hosted by The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Appointed David Moatazedi as President and Chief Executive Officer\nDavid Moatazedi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evolus, said, \"Our objective is to build the most dynamic customer centric platform company in aesthetics. I believe that we are optimally positioned to do so with our anticipated introduction of DWP-450, particularly following our initial public offering completed in February. In the first quarter, we began preparing our corporate and commercial infrastructure expansion and maintained a strong presence at a number of leading medical meetings to showcase our compelling phase III clinical data.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $6.0 million, an increase of 52% from $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to becoming a public company and higher headcount, offset by a reduction in clinical trial costs associated with completion of Evolus' Phase III clinical trials and a reduction in related expenses allocated to Evolus from ALPHAEON Corporation, Evolus’ sole stockholder prior to Evolus' initial public offering.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.2 million or $0.30 basic and diluted net loss per share, compared with a net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.24 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $49.6 million as of March 31, 2018.\nAbout Evolus, Inc.\nEvolus is a lifestyle aesthetics company dedicated to bringing advanced aesthetic procedures and treatments to physicians and consumers. Evolus focuses on the self-pay aesthetic market and its lead product candidate DWP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA), an injectable 900 kilodalton purified botulinum toxin type A complex.\nEVOLUS™ and the Evolus logo are trademarks of Evolus, Inc.
