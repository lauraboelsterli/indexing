    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nMYM Nutraceuticals Inc., (CSE: MYM.CN) (the \"Company\" or \"MYM\") is pleased to announce that the Company has acquired an additional 23% of the Laval, Quebec production facility from CannaTechnology (the \"seller\"), bringing total ownership of the late stage ACMPR applicant up to 74%. The Company also announces it has retained Cannabis Compliance Inc., the country's leading experts in cannabis regulatory compliance, as the consultant on file for both Quebec projects and all other Health Canada licenses with respect to cannabis production, sale, and R&D.\n\"We are thrilled to obtain an additional 23% of the Laval facility, bringing MYM ownership up to 74%,\" said Rob Gietl, CEO of MYM. \"Construction on phase one of the facility is now complete and the ACMPR application is currently with Health Canada under final review.\"\nImmediately issued to the seller is 350,000 MYM common shares and 100,000 transferable warrants.
