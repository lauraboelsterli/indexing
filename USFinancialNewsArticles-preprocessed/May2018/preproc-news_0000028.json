    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., Kforce Inc. (Nasdaq:KFRC), a provider of professional staffing services and solutions, today announced results for its first quarter of 2018. Revenues for the 2018 were $346.3 million compared to $334.0 million for the 2017, an increase of 3.7%. Net income for the 2018 was $9.2 million, or $0.37 per share, as compared to $5.9 million, or $0.23 per share, for the 2017.\nDavid L. Dunkel, Chairman and CEO, commented, “We are very pleased with our first quarter results as our year-over-year growth rates in our largest business, Tech Flex, meaningfully accelerated to 6.7% from 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. As we head into Q2 2018, we are experiencing continued strength in our Tech Flex business as companies continue to invest in technology to more effectively and efficiently meet the needs of their customers. Clients are continuing to look to a flexible human capital model to meet this demand, particularly given the project-based nature of technology. We continue to have success in improving our operating leverage as operating margins increased 80 basis points year-over-year. In addition, our guidance for the second quarter indicates our expectation of attaining our operating margin target of 6.3% when quarterly revenues reach $350 million. As stated previously, we expect to make continued incremental improvements in meeting our next milestone of 7.5% in a quarter, without seasonality impacts, where revenues reach $400 million. I want to thank all of our clients, consultants and core employees for making our mutual success possible.\"\nJoseph J. Liberatore, President, said, “We experienced solid acceleration in key activity levels within Tech Flex in the first quarter primarily as a result of the actions taken over the last couple of years to optimize the alignment of our revenue-generating associates, enhance the segmentation of our client portfolio and improve the productivity of our associates. The growth we are experiencing in Tech Flex is broad-based and we expect to further accelerate revenue growth and improve associate productivity.\"\nMr. Liberatore noted additional operational quarter include:\nFlex revenues of $332.8 million in Q1 2018 increased 4.2%, from $319.3 million in Q1 2017.\nQuarterly year-over-year growth in Flex revenues for Tech and GS was 6.7% and 24.5%, respectively, while FA experienced a decrease of 7.9%.\nDavid M. Kelly, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Our Flex gross profit margins in Tech and FA improved 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, which we believe is reflective of our focus, discipline and enhanced training around pricing as well as changes in the mix of our business. We also continue to demonstrate solid progress in improving operating margins through leverage gained from our revenue growth and improving productivity as well as appropriately controlling our SG&A expenses.\"\nMr. Kelly continued, \"During the first quarter, we repurchased 318 thousand shares, or approximately $8.7 million. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend on Kforce common stock of $0.12 per share. The cash dividend will be payable on June 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 8, 2018.”\nLooking forward to the second quarter of 2018, there will be 64 billing days, which is the same as the second quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. Current estimates for the second quarter of 2018 are:\nRevenue of $355 million to $360 million Earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.65 Gross profit margin of 30.0% to 30.2% Flex gross profit margin of 27.0% to 27.2% SG&A expense as a percent of revenue of 23.0% to 23.2% Operating margin of 6.3% to 6.5% Effective tax rate of 26.0%\nOn Tuesday, May 1, 2018, Kforce will host a conference call to discuss these results.

Kforce Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures presented may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company views these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental and they are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided below.\nFree Cash Flow\n“Free Cash Flow”, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined by Kforce as net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, less capital expenditures. Management believes this provides an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and is useful information to investors as it provides a measure of the amount of cash generated from the business that can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business, making acquisitions, repurchasing common stock or paying dividends. Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a complement to our financial statements.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 9,175 $ 5,902 Non-cash provisions and other 5,445 6,932 Changes in operating assets/liabilities (4,370 ) (23,347 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 10,250 (10,513 ) Capital expenditures (1,469 ) (2,272 ) Free cash flow 8,781 (12,785 ) Change in debt 6,677 20,419 Repurchases of common stock (12,038 ) (2,887 ) Cash dividend (2,973 ) (3,037 ) Other (569 ) (454 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents $ (122 ) $ 1,256 Adjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA”, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined by Kforce as net income before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, net and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our past and future financial performance, and this presentation should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess our operations including our ability to generate cash flows and our ability to repay our debt obligations. Management believes it is useful information to investors as it provides a good metric of our core profitability in comparing our performance to our competitors, as well as our performance over different time periods. The measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows or other financial statement information presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. The measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, and as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended, Mar. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Mar. 31, 2017 Net income $ 9,175 $ 6,140 $ 5,902 Depreciation and amortization 2,115 2,135 2,103 Stock-based compensation expense 2,260 1,933 2,064 Interest expense, net 1,297 1,226 1,173 Income tax expense 3,074 11,749 3,320 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,921 $ 23,183 $ 14,562 AT THE FIRM\nMichael R.
