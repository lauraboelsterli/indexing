    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May is focussed on getting the right decision on Britain’s future customs arrangements with the European Union rather than meeting any deadlines, her spokesman said on Monday.\nPrime Minister Theresa May speaks to party supporters at Sedgley Conservative Club in Dudley, United Kingdom May 4, 2018. Anthony Devlin/Pool via REUTERS “At the end of last week, the PM established two working groups which will be conducting work in relation to refining the two options. I haven’t put a timeframe on the completion of that work,” the spokesman told reporters.\n“The focus is on getting this right.”\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Alistair Smout\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
