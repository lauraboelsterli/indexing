The K-F45 Certificates are backed by corresponding classes issued by the FREMF 2018-KF45 Mortgage Trust (KF45 Trust) and guaranteed by Freddie Mac. The KF45 Trust will also issue certificates consisting of the Class B, C and R Certificates, which will be subordinate to the classes backing the K-F45 Certificates and will not be guaranteed by Freddie Mac.\nFreddie Mac Multifamily is a leading issuer of agency-guaranteed structured multifamily securities. K-Deals are part of the company's business strategy to transfer a portion of the risk of losses away from taxpayers and to private investors who purchase the unguaranteed subordinate bonds. K Certificates typically feature a wide range of investor options with stable cash flows and structured credit enhancement.\nThis announcement is not an offer to sell any Freddie Mac securities.
