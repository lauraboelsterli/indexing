REUTERS/Eric Gaillard Variety critic Alissa Simon called it an “exciting, intelligent mix of romance, Nordic noir, social realism and supernatural horror that defies and subverts genre conventions”.\nLead actress Eva Melander said: “It’s a very unpredictable story and people watching it are really touched by it. They go out from the cinema and they kind of forget their mobile phone and wonder: ‘What’s this and what did I just see?’”\nUn Certain Regard is the second-tier competition at Cannes, which closes on Saturday with the award of the Palme d’Or and other prizes for the films in the main selection.\n71st Cannes Film Festival – Un Certain Regard Prize - Cannes, France.
