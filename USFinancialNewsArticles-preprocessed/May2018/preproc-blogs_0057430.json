    "text": "By Lisa Marie Segarra 11:12 AM EDT\nBattlefield 5’s creators are not backing down from the female characters they added in the latest installment of the game.\nA small, but vocal, group of Battlefield 5 fans criticized the historical accuracy, despite women’s involvement in World War II during which the game is set, and said Battlefield 5 was pandering to modern audiences. However, Oskar Gabrielson, general manager at Battlefield developer EA DICE, responded by saying that female characters would not be going anywhere.\n“First, let me be clear about one thing. Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay. We want Battlefield V to represent all those who were a part of the greatest drama in human history, and give players choice to choose and customize the characters they play with,” Gabrielson said over a series of tweets. First, let me be clear about one thing. Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay. pic.twitter.com/fvi9riUZDM\n— Oskar Gabrielson (@ogabrielson) May 25, 2018 Our commitment as a studio is to do everything we can to create games that are inclusive and diverse. We always set out to push boundaries and deliver unexpected experiences. But above all, our games must be fun!\n— Oskar Gabrielson (@ogabrielson) May 25, 2018 The Battlefield sandbox has always been about playing the way you want. Like attempting to fit three players on a galloping horse, with flamethrowers. With BFV you also get the chance to play as who you want.
