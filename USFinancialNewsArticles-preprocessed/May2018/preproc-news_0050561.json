Those prices averaged $2.93 nationally per gallon as of Tuesday.\n\"Gas prices are nearly 60 cents more expensive than last year and will likely jump a few more pennies heading into Memorial Day weekend,\" said AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano. \"As nearly 37 million Americans travel by car this weekend, motorists will find gas for $3 or more at 25 percent of all gas stations across the country.\"\nThose costs are not likely to deter many travelers, Casselano said, many of whom booked their trips months in advance.\nA record number of Americans — more than 41.5 million — are expected to take to the roads, tarmacs and water on the weekend that kicks off summer, according to research released by AAA earlier this month.\nThat's the highest number of travelers in more than 12 years and about a 5 percent increase from last year.\nshow chapters The Week That Was: Gas prices jump ahead of summer driving season 6:21 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 01:12 The good news for travelers is that airfares have fallen 7 percent from last Memorial Day to an average of $168 for a round-trip flight for popular domestic routes, AAA said.\nA daily car rental will cost an average of $59, about 11 percent cheaper than last year and the lowest rate in the past four years.\nThe busiest days for travel over the holiday weekend are expected to be this Thursday and Friday.\nHere are the worst days and times to travel, according to global analytics company INRIX, which partnered with AAA for the study.\nWorst times to travel Metro area Worst day for travel Worst time for travel Delay multiplier of normal trip Atlanta Thursday, May 24 3:30 - 5:30 p.m. 1.6x Houston Thursday, May 24 4:30 - 6:00 p.m. 1.5x Boston Thursday, May 24 4:30 - 6:30 p.m. 1.8x Washington, D.C.
