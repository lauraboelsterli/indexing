    "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich., May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Unique Fabricating, Inc. (\"Unique\" or the \"Company\")(NYSE MKT: UFAB), which engineers and manufactures multi-material foam, rubber, and plastic components utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management and air/water sealing applications for the automotive and industrial appliance market, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue of $47.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $47.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 Net income of $1.5 million, or $0.15 per basic diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, including $1.7 million for non-cash charges specifically related to depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock awards, compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, including $1.6 million for non-cash charges specifically related to depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock awards (1) Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2018 versus $0.23 in the first quarter of 2017 (1) Declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on June 7, 2018 for stockholders of record as of May 31, 2018\n(1) For a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted earnings per share please refer to the financial tables below.\n\"Our first quarter results are in-line with our expectations given the production adjustments that were made mid-quarter by auto manufacturers to reduce their inventory levels,\" commented John Weinhardt, Chief Executive Officer. \"Since that time, vehicle production and OEM inventory has returned to more normalized levels, and the independent forecasting firms project relatively stable production for the remainder of 2018. We are executing according to our business plan for 2018, including the continued pursuit of new opportunities with active prototyping and testing of our molded products for new programs and new applications, creating a foundation of bookings to drive revenue in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 and 2020.\"\n\"Operationally, we have continued to adjust our manufacturing capacity to take advantage of our larger geographic footprint. On-going process improvements and capital investment are part of our normal course of business as we continue to identify opportunities to increase efficiency and manage operating costs,\" Weinhardt added. \"The actions we are taking during the first half of 2018 to streamline operations and better align our production assets geographically will not only help improve our short term productivity but they are freeing up capacity in key locations that will allow Unique to take on more production with limited additional capital. We believe these initial efforts will yield annualized cost savings in excess of $800,000 beginning later this year.\"\n\"Our outlook for the full year 2018 remains unchanged as we benefited from the continued market shift towards light trucks and SUVs as well as new business that begins production in the second half of the year,\" concluded Weinhardt.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 declined to $47.3 million, down 1.2%, or $0.6 million from $47.9 million during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in North American auto production of 2.1% quarter over quarter, partially offset by increased market penetration.\nGross profit for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 was $11.1 million, or 23.4% of total revenue, compared to $11.1 million, or 23.2% of total revenues, for the corresponding period last year. While lower than planned due to the production adjustments made by auto OEMs during the quarter, the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily related to a continue shift in our product mix to higher valued products.\nRestructuring expense for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 of $0.4 million was related to previously announced manufacturing facility closures in Port Huron, Michigan and Fort Smith, Arkansas and compares to $0 in the same period last year.\nNet income for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 was $1.5 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower sales due to the decreases in production and volume listed above as well as the restructuring expenses described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 was $4.9 million compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of lower sales described above. Please refer to the financial tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended April 1, 2018 was $0.21 compared to $0.23 in the first quarter of 2017. Please refer to the financial tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results.\nFurther non-cash purchase accounting impacts associated with the Company's acquisitions are detailed in the Purchase Accounting Impacts and Other Effects table below accompanying this release.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of April 1, 2018 the Company had approximately $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to December 31, 2017 when the Company had $1.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total debt outstanding as of April 1, 2018 was $55.4 million compared to $53.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of April 1, 2018, the Company had $4.6 million of available unused capacity, further subject to borrowing base restrictions and outstanding letters of credit, under its $30.0 million revolving credit facility.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, Unique Fabricating is reaffirming its outlook based on industry production forecasts of 17.2 million light vehicles manufactured for the year, based on independent industry research published in April, and the mix of production by light vehicle platform contained in such research.\nRevenue\n$181 million to $185 million\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$0.82 to $0.86\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$20.0 million to $21.0 million\nDividend\nUnique's Board of Directors approved payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on May 10, 2018. The dividend will be payable on June 7, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 31, 2018.\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nUnique Fabricating will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss these results today at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Company is headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. For more information, visit http://www.uniquefab.com/ .\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in this press release to provide a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock award, non-recurring integration expense, transaction fees related to our acquisitions, restructuring expenses, and one-time consulting and licensing ERP system implementation costs as we implement a new ERP system at all locations. We calculate Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share based upon earnings before non-cash stock awards, non-recurring expenses, transaction fees, and restructuring expenses, including the tax impact associated with these adjusting items. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are useful performance measures used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance and earnings on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) can provide alone. Our board and management also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for Company management. In addition, the financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility are based on Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this press release, subject to dollar limitations on certain adjustments and certain other addbacks permitted by our senior secured credit facility. These non-GAAP financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for analysis of Unique Fabricating's results as reported under GAAP.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this news release include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
