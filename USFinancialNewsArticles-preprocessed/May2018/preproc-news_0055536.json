    "text": "WROCLAW, Poland (Reuters) - A Polish zoo is celebrating the latest addition to its park - a baby bear cuscus.\nWroclaw Zoo, in southwestern Poland, said the birth of the marsupial, a grey-black furry creature, with claws and a long tail, was a rare event, with only 13 of the animals in captivity in four zoos around the world.\nThe arboreal leaf-eating animals, native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, are described as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species, with deforestation and hunting the main threats facing them.\nThe bear cuscus, which does not have the name, was born to a pair who have been at Wroclaw Zoo for three years, according to the park. For now, it is being kept away from the public eye.\nReporting by Reuters Television; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
