    "text": "DALLAS, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The EnLink Midstream companies (EnLink), EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENLK) (the Partnership or ENLK) and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC) (the General Partner or ENLC), reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018, reaffirmed full-year 2018 guidance, and announced an expansion of its crude oil gathering system in Central Oklahoma.\nHighlights\nENLK reported net income attributable to ENLK after non-controlling interest of approximately $60 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to approximately $18 million for the first quarter of 2017. This represents approximately 230 percent growth quarter over quarter. ENLK achieved approximately $244 million of adjusted EBITDA net to ENLK for the first quarter of 2018, compared to approximately $208 million for the first quarter of 2017. This represents approximately 17 percent growth quarter over quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" ENLC reported net income attributable to ENLC after non-controlling interest of approximately $12 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of approximately $2 million for the first quarter of 2017. This represents approximately $14 million growth quarter over quarter. ENLC achieved approximately $57 million of cash available for distribution for the first quarter of 2018, compared to approximately $51 million for the first quarter of 2017. This represents approximately 12 percent growth quarter over quarter. Cash available for distribution is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" EnLink reaffirmed full-year 2018 guidance for both ENLK and ENLC. EnLink completed construction of the first phase of its previously announced Black Coyote crude oil gathering system during the first quarter of 2018, with the system becoming operational during April 2018. EnLink also signed a new commercial contract to provide crude oil gathering services for an existing large, active customer in the STACK. EnLink is now the primary crude oil gathering service provider for two of the largest producers in the STACK. EnLink expects to spend approximately $40 million of growth capital during 2018 related to this strategic expansion, called the Redbud crude oil gathering system, with an expected operational date during the second half of 2018. EnLink's Oklahoma segment realized strong volume growth during the first quarter of 2018. Average gas gathering and transmission volumes increased by approximately 10 percent from fourth quarter 2017 and 49 percent from first quarter 2017. Average processing volumes increased approximately 9 percent from fourth quarter 2017 and 64 percent from first quarter 2017.\n\"EnLink continues to execute well on our long-term strategic plan and continues to deliver solid growth in financial results,\" said Michael J. Garberding, EnLink President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Operating in the right places with the right partners has enabled us to develop an opportunity-rich inventory of projects, highlighted by today's announcement of an exciting crude oil gathering expansion in the STACK. We continue to enhance our strategic asset positions while putting highly efficient capital to work across our key growth areas. Our long-term growth outlook is robust, and we remain committed to returning value to unitholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\"\nEnLink Midstream Partners, LP: First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe Partnership reported net income attributable to ENLK of $60.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $18.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Partnership achieved $243.7 million of adjusted EBITDA net to ENLK for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $207.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Partnership reported net cash provided by operating activities of $192.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $174.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow attributable to ENLK's common units was $171.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $153.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" ENLK reaffirmed its full-year 2018 guidance, which includes net income of $255 million to $315 million and adjusted EBITDA of $950 million to $1.02 billion. Distribution coverage was 1.12x for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.01x for the first quarter of 2017. Debt to adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2018 was 3.85x, compared to 3.99x as of March 31, 2017. Growth capital expenditures net to ENLK for the first quarter of 2018 totaled approximately $138 million. Total EnLink funded capital expenditures outlook remains unchanged for 2018, however, segment level growth capital expenditure outlook has been adjusted to reflect the new Redbud crude oil gathering system expansion in Oklahoma and the expected timing of gas opportunities in and around the Gulf Coast region: Crude and condensate range has increased by $40 million Louisiana range has decreased by $40 million Full-year 2018 growth capital expenditure outlook net to ENLK is now at a range of $580 million to $710 million, which reflects a $5 million reduction from the previous range of $585 million to $715 million. The reduction in growth capital expenditures outlook net to ENLK is offset by an equal increase in ENLC's growth capital expenditure outlook due to a reduction in projects funded solely by ENLK and the addition of Redbud which is jointly funded. As of April 26, 2018, ENLK had 350,243,418 common units outstanding.\nEnLink Midstream, LLC: First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe General Partner reported net income attributable to ENLC of $12.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. ENLC's cash available for distribution totaled $56.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $51.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The cash available for distribution for the first quarter of 2018 included $8.9 million related to ENLC's approximately 16 percent interest in EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing LP (together with its subsidiaries, \"EnLink Oklahoma T.O.\"). ENLC reaffirmed its full-year 2018 guidance, which includes net income of $233 million to $291 million, and cash available for distribution of $230 million to $240 million. Growth capital expenditures net to ENLC for the first quarter of 2018 totaled approximately $12 million. Full-year 2018 growth capital expenditure outlook net to ENLC has increased due to the crude oil gathering expansion in the STACK, with the expected range now being $50 million to $60 million, up $5 million from the previous range of $45 million to $55 million. Distribution coverage was 1.18x for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.09x for the first quarter of 2017. As of April 26, 2018, ENLC had 181,042,318 common units outstanding.\nRegional Updates:\nCentral Oklahoma:\nEnLink's Oklahoma segment reported strong segment profit growth during the first quarter of 2018, achieving an approximate 11 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 and achieving an approximate 80 percent increase from the first quarter 2017. The pace of growth in the Oklahoma segment anchors management's confidence in the strength of the STACK play and the ability to achieve 2018 year guidance. EnLink's Oklahoma segment experienced solid volume growth during the first quarter of 2018, including average gas gathering and transmission volume increases of 10 percent and average processing volume increases of 9 percent, in each case, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Average gas gathering and transmission volumes increased 49 percent and average processing volumes increased approximately 64 percent, in each case, from the first quarter of 2017. Volume growth in Central Oklahoma is expected to remain robust as Devon Energy Corp. and other large active producer customers on EnLink's dedicated acreage continue to deliver strong well results and transition to full-field development. EnLink's previously announced Thunderbird processing plant is progressing well and remains on track to be operational during the first quarter of 2019. Once operational, Thunderbird will increase EnLink's gas processing capacity in Central Oklahoma by 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d), bringing total gas processing capacity to approximately 1.2 Bcf/d and reinforcing EnLink's position as one of the largest and most cost-efficient providers of natural gas processing in the STACK. During the first quarter of 2018, Devon brought Coyote on-line, its first large scale development. Coyote is comprised of seven wells, four of which are currently producing, and the development is delivering record flow rates. Devon announced that its Showboat development, which is comprised of 24 wells, is in progress and is currently 40 days ahead of plan. According to Devon, Showboat's first production was achieved in April, and well tie-ins are staggered over the next two months. Devon has indicated that it expects Showboat to be fully producing by the end of the second quarter of 2018. EnLink placed the first phase of its crude oil gathering system, Black Coyote, into service in April of 2018. Black Coyote will initially gather volumes primarily from Devon's Showboat development and is expected to connect to all of Devon's near-term large-scale development projects. Devon is concentrating resources in the over-pressured oil window, which has the best returns in the play, and Devon expects to have eight large-scale developments underway by year end. EnLink continues to enhance its core position in Central Oklahoma with the signing of a new commercial contract to provide additional crude oil gathering services for an existing large and active customer in the STACK. This project, called the Redbud crude oil gathering system, will build upon the Black Coyote footprint, with total 2018 growth capital expenditures related to this expansion expected to be approximately $40 million. ENLC will fund approximately 16 percent of the capital expenditures related to this project, with ENLK funding the remainder. EnLink is now the primary crude oil gathering service provider for two of the largest producers in the STACK.\nMidland Basin:\nEnLink's Midland Basin natural gas volume activity remained sequentially flat, as the pace of well completions in the first quarter of 2018 was slower than forecasted. Volumes exited March 2018 above the quarterly average and have continued to increase since the end of the quarter. Volumes have increased by approximately 12 percent from the first quarter of 2017, and one of EnLink's largest producer customers recently announced the acquisition of another of EnLink's largest producer customers. The combined company is expected to run one of the largest drilling program in the Permian Basin, which will likely benefit EnLink. EnLink's Midland Basin natural gas processing facilities averaged approximately 60 percent utilization of total capacity in the first quarter of 2018. EnLink's position in the Midland Basin reflects an attractive opportunity for additional low-cost, high-return expansions, including filling available capacity. EnLink also has the infrastructure in place to cost effectively expand the Riptide processing facility by an additional 100 MMcf/d as system volumes continue to increase. EnLink's Chickadee crude oil gathering operations in the Midland Basin have achieved recent success with the addition of two new customers to the system. The new projects are expected to be accretive to volumes and segment profit during 2018, and leverage the gathering platform in place. EnLink continues to successfully execute its crude oil gathering strategy in the Permian Basin, and EnLink's proven capabilities are attracting new opportunities.\nDelaware Basin:\nVolumes across EnLink's Delaware Basin Joint Venture (JV) system were roughly flat sequentially, as the pace of well completions in the first quarter of 2018 was slower than forecasted. Volumes exited the first quarter of 2018 above the quarterly average, and have continued to increase since the end of the quarter. Volumes have increased by approximately 110 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Rig activity remains strong on the JV's footprint, and solid volume growth is expected for the second half of 2018 and into 2019. The JV previously announced the construction of Lobo III, a new 200 MMcf/d expansion of gas processing capacity at the existing Lobo complex. The construction of the facility is progressing well and is expected to be operational during the second half of 2018.\nLouisiana:\nEnLink's natural gas liquids (NGL) network continues to benefit from growth in liquids output from EnLink's Chisholm processing complex in the STACK. NGLs produced from EnLink's Chisholm complex are preferentially shipped to EnLink's Gulf Coast operations for further transportation, fractionation and downstream value creation. NGL volumes on EnLink's system were up slightly during the first quarter of 2018 from a very strong fourth quarter of 2017, and volumes are expected to remain roughly in-line with first quarter of 2018 levels for the remainder of 2018. EnLink continued to experience increased volumes on its Louisiana gas system during the first quarter of 2018, driven by strong demand across its Gulf Coast network. Gathering and transmission throughput on EnLink's Louisiana gas system hit record highs during the first quarter of 2018, exceeding, on average, 2.2 Bcf/d. This growth reflects a six percent increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 15 percent growth as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Volumes are expected to remain above initial guidance expectations for the balance of 2018.\nNorth Texas:\nDevon recently announced a joint venture with Dow Chemical Co. in the liquids-rich area of the Barnett Shale, where the two companies plan to partner in the drilling of up to 116 new wells over a five-year period, with approximately 20 wells expected to be drilled in 2018. Devon's stated intention is to execute a capital program that stabilizes production for its retained assets in the area, which in turn will assist in stabilizing EnLink's long-term volume outlook as volumes naturally decline in this mature basin. Devon also recently announced the sale of its Johnson County acreage, and EnLink is encouraged by the potential for the incoming producer to bring an increased focus on optimizing existing wells, new refrac activity and potential new well drilling plans. The acreage produces volumes that represent approximately 7 percent of EnLink's North Texas revenues, and incremental capital and focus in this area is expected to positively impact volumes.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Call Details\nThe General Partner and the Partnership will hold a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time).

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, impairments , unit-based compensation, (gain) loss on non-cash derivatives, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, successful acquisition transaction costs (if any), accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations, non-cash rent and distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments less payments under onerous performance obligations, non-controlling interest and (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments. We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA (defined above), net to the Partnership, less interest expense (excluding amortization of the EnLink Oklahoma T.O. acquisition installment payable discount), litigation settlement adjustment, adjustments for the redeemable non-controlling interest, interest rate swaps, current income taxes and other non-distributable cash flows, accrued cash distributions on Series B Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Units paid or expected to be paid, and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding maintenance capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities. The General Partner's cash available for distribution is defined as net income (loss) of the General Partner less the net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership, which is consolidated into the General Partner's net income (loss), plus the General Partner's (i) share of distributions from the Partnership, (ii) share of EnLink Oklahoma T.O.'s non-cash expenses, (iii) deferred income tax expense (benefit), (iv) corporate goodwill impairment, if any, and (v) successful acquisition transaction costs, if any, less the General Partner's interest in maintenance capital expenditures of EnLink Oklahoma T.O., and less third-party non-controlling interest share of the Partnership's net income (loss) from consolidated affiliates.\nThe Partnership's distribution coverage is calculated by dividing distributable cash flow by distributions declared to the General Partner and the common unitholders. The General Partner's distribution coverage is calculated by dividing cash available for distribution by distributions declared by the General Partner.\nGrowth capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our asset base, operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Maintenance capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives.\nThe Partnership and General Partner believe these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously-reported results and a meaningful measure of each of the Partnership's and the General Partner's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital and related requirements of its operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA achievement is a primary metric used in the Partnership's credit facility and short-term incentive program for compensating its employees.\nSegment profit (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, impairments and (gain) loss on litigation settlement. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 – Segment Information\" in ENLK's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and, when available, \"Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11—Segment Information\" in ENLK's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, for further information about segment profit (loss)\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and cash available for distribution, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of the Partnership's and the General Partner's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following tables. See ENLK's and ENLC's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
