    "text": "NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. 10-Year treasury note futures prices were down slightly on Sunday evening, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier that the U.S. trade war with China was “on hold”.\nTreasury futures were down 0.1 percent in the opening minutes of trading.\nMnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said an agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing future trade imbalances, effectively putting any trade war between the world’s largest economies on hold.
