    "text": "— Quarterly Operating Income Up 63.3% YoY\n— Quarterly Diluted Net Income Per ADS Up 73.9% YoY\nGUANGZHOU, China, May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fanhua Inc., (Nasdaq:FANH), (the \"Company\" or \"Fanhua\"), a leading independent online-to-offline (\"O2O\") financial services provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 1 and declared quarterly dividend.\nThe Company also announced that on May 12, 2018, its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared an annual aggregate dividend of US$1.0 per ADS, or $0.05 per ordinary share, payable on a quarterly basis. The dividend declaration reflects management and the Board's current view on the Company's first quarter of 2018 financial results and its earnings growth outlook for 2018. The first quarterly dividend for the year 2018 will be US$0.25 per ADS, or US$0.0125 per ordinary share, amounting to a total of US$16.3 million, payable on or around June 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 30, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018 :\n(In thousands, except per ADS) 2017Q1\n（ RMB ） 2018Q1\n(RMB) 2018Q1\n(US$) Change % Total net revenues 1,333,587 843,263 134,436 -36.8 Operating income 55,214 90,181 14,376 63.3 Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders 2 69,740 130,218 20,758 86.7 Diluted net income per ADS 1.15 2.00 0.32 73.9 Commenting on the first quarter 2018 financial results, Mr. Chunlin Wang, chairman and chief executive officer of Fanhua, stated, \"We delivered another quarter of solid results that beat our expectation, with operating income growing by 63.3% year-over-year to RMB90.2 million, and net income attributable to shareholders increasing by 86.7% year-over-year to RMB130.2 million.\n\"The performance of our core business, life insurance business, was in line with our expectation. Our total life insurance premiums grew by 40.1% from a year ago, outpacing industry growth, primarily owing to strong year-over-year growth of 186.5% in renewal life insurance premiums during the quarter, reflecting the attractive business nature of the long-term life insurance business. i.e. the snowball effect created by the accumulation of renewal business. First year annualized premiums equivalent (\"APEs\") were down 12% year-over-year, consistent with our expectation, mainly affected by the continued adjustment in annuity products and the high base in the same period of last year. In the meantime, the fundamentals of our life insurance segment remain solid, as evidenced by the strong growth momentum in both registered sales agents and performing sales, and over 40% year-on-year growth in APEs of health insurance products for the first quarter of 2018.\n\"We are also happy to see positive operational and financial contributions from our various internet platforms which have demonstrated leading advantages in each of their respective areas and started to generate commercial value. These achievements have fully demonstrated the foresight and accuracy of the business strategies that we've implemented over the past few years. We believe our internet platforms will become a new driver for the continued growth of the company in the future.\n\"Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2018, we expect the life insurance industry will be on track for a healthier development, in view of current financial and insurance regulatory trends. But we firmly believe that the decoupling of manufacturing from distribution is an irreversible trend and the industry's transition towards protection-oriented business is favorable for Fanhua. As such, we expect to achieve positive growth in first year life insurance APEs and operating income of no less than RMB100 million in the second quarter of 2018.\"\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter of 2018\nTotal net revenues were RMB 843.3 million (US$134.4 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 36.8% from RMB 1,333.6 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nNet revenues for the life insurance business were RMB 673.0 million (US$107.3 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 9.7% from RMB613.4 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to growth in the number of sales agents and the rapid growth of renewal commissions. Revenues generated from our life insurance business accounted for 79.8% of our total net revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Net revenues for the P&C insurance business were RMB 92.5 million (US$14.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 85.9% from RMB655.6 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to 1) the disposal of the equity interests of some entities in the P&C insurance division in October 2017, and 2) the transition of our P&C insurance business from a commission-based business model towards a platform business model starting from the fourth quarter of 2017. The revenue for P&C insurance business mainly represent commission revenues generated from Baoxian.com and technology service fees based on the volume of insurance premiums transacted through CNpad. Revenues generated from the P&C insurance business accounted for 11.0% of our total net revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Net revenues for the claims adjusting business were RMB 77.8million (US$12.4 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 20.4% from RMB64.6 million for the corresponding period in 2017. Revenues generated from the claims adjusting business accounted for 9.2% of our total net revenues in the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal operating costs and expenses were RMB753.1 million (US$120.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 41.1% from RMB 1,278.4 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nCommission costs were RMB597.4 million (US$95.2 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 45.3% from RMB 1,092.8 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in commission cost was mainly due to the decrease in P&C insurance business, partially offset by the growth of our life insurance business. Costs of the life insurance business were RMB468.3 million (US$74.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 7.6% from RMB435.1 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was in line with the growth in sales. Costs incurred by the life insurance business accounted for 78.4% of our total commission costs in the first quarter of 2018. Costs of the P&C insurance business were RMB80.2 million (US$12.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 86.8% from RMB607.4 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to 1) the disposal of the equity interests of some entities in the P&C insurance division in October 2017, and 2) the transition of our P&C insurance business from a commission-based business model towards a platform business model starting from the fourth quarter of 2017. The cost of the P&C insurance business mainly represents the cost incurred for business on Baoxian.com . Costs incurred by the P&C insurance business accounted for 13.4% of our total commission costs in the first quarter of 2018. Costs of claims adjusting business were RMB49.0 million (US$7.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 2.6% from RMB50.3 million for the corresponding period in 2017. Costs incurred by the claims adjusting business accounted for 8.2% of our total commission costs in the first quarter of 2018. Selling expenses were RMB48.7 million (US$7.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 6.9% from RMB52.3 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in expenses related to P&C insurance agencies as a result of the disposal of most of our P&C insurance agency subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2017, as part of the implementation of a platform business model for our auto insurance business. Gen eral and administrative e x penses were RMB107.0 million (US$17.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 19.7% from RMB133.2 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in expenses related to P&C insurance agencies as a result of the disposal of most of our P&C insurance agency subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2017, as part of the implementation of a platform business model for our auto insurance business.\nAs a result of the preceding factors, we had an operating income of RMB90.2 million (US$14.4 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 63.3% from RMB55.2 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nOperating margin was 10.7% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.1% for the corresponding period in 2017.\nInvestment income was RMB33.1 million (US$5.3 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing a increase of 221.4% from RMB10.3 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The investment income represented yields from short-term investments in financial products that mainly consist of inter-bank deposits or collective trust products with terms ranging from half a year to two years and interest payable on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Our investment income fluctuates from quarter to quarter because investment income is recognized when received.\nInterest income was RMB10.8 million (US$1.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 17 times from RMB0.6 million for the corresponding period in 2017, primarily due to interest related to amounts due from Shenzhen Chuangjia Investment Limited Partnership, which beneficially owns 84.6% of Fanhua Puyi Fund Sales Limited.\nIncome tax expense was RMB43.8 million (US$7.0 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 60.4% from RMB27.3 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to 1) an increase in operating income and investment income, and 2) provision of withholding income tax for dividend payment. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 33.0% compared with 40.3% for the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in effective tax rate was mainly due to the increase of deferred tax assets arising from operation loss incurred by certain of our subsidiaries and the loss is expected to be utilized in the future.\nShare of income of affiliates was RMB40.5 million (US$6.5 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 128.8% from RMB17.7 million for the corresponding period in 2017, mainly attributable to an increase of profits from Sincere Fame, a company in which we own 20.6% of the equity interest.\nNet income from continuing operations was RMB129.6 million (US$20.7 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 123.4% from RMB58.0 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nNet income from discontinued operations 2 was nil for the first quarter of 2018. Net income from discontinued operation was RMB6.8 million for the corresponding period in 2017, representing net income from operation of brokerage segment contribute to the Company.\nNet income attributable to the Company’s shareholders was RMB130.2 million (US$20.8 million) for the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 86.7% from RMB 69.7 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nNet margin was 15.4% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 4.7% for the corresponding period in 2017.\nBasic and diluted net income per ADS were RMB2.00 (US$ 0.32) and RMB2.00 (US$0.32) for the first quarter of 2018, respectively, representing increases of 66.7% and 73.9% from RMB1.20 and RMB1.15 for the corresponding period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had RMB2,937.4 million (US$468.3 million) in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments .\nKey Operational Metrics for Fanhua's Online Initiatives for 2018 :\nCNpad Auto Insurance Mobile Application (\"CNpad Auto Insurance App\") - Our proprietary mobile sales support system: CNpad Auto Insurance App had been downloaded and activated 418,342 times as of March 31, 2018, representing an increase of 66.1% from 251,819 times as of March 31, 2017; The number of active users of CNpad Auto Insurance App 3 was 63,955 in the first quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 13.3% from 56,446 in the first quarter of 2017; I nsurance premiums generated through CNpad Auto Insurance App were RMB 571.0 million (US$91.0 million) in the first quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 38.2% from RMB924.0 million for the first quarter of 2017.
