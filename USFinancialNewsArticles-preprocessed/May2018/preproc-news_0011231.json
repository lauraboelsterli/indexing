    "text": "(Reuters) - Phillips 66 reported unplanned flaring due to a breakdown at its 139,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in Wilmington, California, according to a filing with state pollution regulators.\nThe filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District listed event start date as Apr. 30, 11:12 p.m.(local time) and event end date as Apr. 30, 11:59 p.m.(local time).\nThe refinery has two linked facilities about five miles apart in Carson and Wilmington. The former processes crude oil while the latter upgrades the products.\nA refinery uses its safety flare when hydrocarbons cannot be processed normally due to a malfunction or planned work.\nBengaluru Commodities desk\n ",
