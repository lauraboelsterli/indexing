    "text": "If there's one thing most of us can agree on in this age of cultural and political divisiveness, it's that rhetoric has replaced reality in our daily discourse and has reinforced a tendency toward finger-pointing versus collaboration.\nAt the same time, for-profit companies have become something of a punching bag. It's not hard to see why.\nMultinationals are often blamed for a host of society's ills, including income inequality, environmental, health, public safety and diversity issues. Not to mention the shredded social safety net.\nHaving held leadership roles in the public, private and nonprofit sectors, I recognize the critical importance of cross-sector collaboration and the problem with finger-pointing. This is especially true when we as a society — citizens, and leaders from business and government — set out to improve the quality of life for ourselves and others.\nWhen we demonize immigrants for \"taking our jobs,\" educators for \"failing our children\" or corporations for \"threatening economic opportunity,\" we shut ourselves off from a realistic opportunity to achieve progress.\nBut there is a better way.\nMy just-released book, \"The Challenge for Business and Society: From Risk to Reward,\" attempts to substitute facts for anger with a new understanding about the role corporations have played and could play in addressing today's challenges . How many people realize the private sector established benefits such as paid vacations, free health care and retirement pensions long before government did?\nCompanies lead government, rather than follow Consider the following:\nAmerican Express created the first pension plan in the U.S. in 1875. Macy's launched a free health-care program for employees in 1870. By 1905, 25 percent of companies in a survey already offered a week of paid vacation before any government entity did. The company where I worked, IBM , opened the first integrated manufacturing plant below the Mason-Dixon Line and drove public school integration more than a decade before passage of the Civil Rights Act. In 1946, IBM, working with Columbia University, helped create the academic discipline called computer science, which later revolutionized technology in the nation. Before government got involved, companies such as IBM, 3M and Dow Chemical (now part of Dow DuPont ) instituted conservation and environmental stewardship policies for themselves and their suppliers. \"When we demonize immigrants for 'taking our jobs,' educators for 'failing our children' or corporations for 'threatening economic opportunity,' we shut ourselves off from a realistic opportunity to achieve progress.\"\nOf course, along the way there were bad corporate stewards. From the robber barons of the early 20th century to more the recent actions of Bernie Madoff, Enron and Worldcom, it's not hard to find examples.\nYet today, many in the private sector are leading the charge to improve public education, enable economic development at home and abroad and improve health outcomes in the developing world:\nIBM's P TECH grade 9 to 14 school program , will reach 200 schools by 2019 with registrations of close to 100,000 students, offering a clear path from school to college and eventually a career. AT&T has invested millions to retrain and protect its existing workforce from layoffs due to the lack of education or skills. J.P. Morgan has invested in cities such as Detroit, spurring economic activities connected to growth and employment. DowDuPont and 3M, among others, are investing in efforts to protect the environment. Asset manager BlackRock has made it clear their investments will be restricted to those companies that combine the interests of business and society , connecting social good to the bottom line. show chapters",
