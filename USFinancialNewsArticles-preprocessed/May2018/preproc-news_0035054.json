    "text": "MANILA, May 16 (Reuters) - London copper futures struggled to recover on Wednesday after a two-day slide as the U.S. dollar hovered near a five-month high versus a basket of major currencies following a surge in Treasury yields. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was little changed at $6,812.50 per tonne by 0139 GMT. Also weighing on risk appetite was news that North Korea cancelled high-level talks with Seoul, denouncing military exercises between South Korea and the United States, breaking from several months of easing relations on the peninsula. SHANGHAI COPPER: The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange slipped 0.5 percent to 51,030 yuan ($8,002) a tonne. DOLLAR: The dollar index against a group of major currencies rose 0.1 percent to 93.321, not far from Tuesday's peak of 93.457, its highest since Dec. 22. A firmer greenback makes dollar-denominated assets more expensive for holders of other currencies. SHANGHAI EXCHANGE: The Shanghai Futures Exchange said it will launch China's first real-time platform for trading physical commodities from copper to chemicals, as it seeks to improve transparency and challenge rivals in the global futures market. CHINA DATA: China's new home prices rose 0.5 percent in April from a month earlier, compared with an increase of 0.4 percent in March. LITHIUM: China's Tianqi Lithium is nearing a deal to buy a 24 percent stake in Chile's Sociedad Quimica Y Minera, one of the world's biggest lithium producers, for about $4.3 billion. MINING: Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said resource companies needed to build \"the United Nations of the mining industry\" to tackle rising resource nationalism and cost inflation. U.S.-CHINA TRADE: The United States is seeking to make a trade deal with China, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said as bilateral talks between the world's two economic powerhouses resume in Washington this week. ASIAN SHARES: Asian markets fell after Pyongyang called off talks with Seoul, throwing a major U.S.-North Korean summit into question, and a spike in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to a seven-year high knocked sentiment on Wall Street.
