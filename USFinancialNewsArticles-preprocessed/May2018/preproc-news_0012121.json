    "text": "GENEVA, May 3 (Reuters) - Basque separatist group ETA said on Thursday it had completely dismantled and put an end to all its activity, ending a 60-year existence in which it killed some 850 people.\nIn a letter read out at the headquarters of a Geneva-based conflict resolution group, ETA, founded to fight for an independent state in northern Spain and southern France, said its journey had ended.\n“We have made this, our last decision, in order to foster a new historical phase,” said the letter, signed Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA - Basque Country and Freedom in English).\n“ETA was born from the people and now it dissolves back into the people,” said the letter, which was read by David Harland, executive director of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue.\nIn a letter dated April 16 and made public on Wednesday on news website El Diario, the group said it had completely dismantled all its structures. El Diario said the letter had been sent to Basque organisations including trade unions.\nThe group is due to formalise its dissolution at an official event in France on Friday.
