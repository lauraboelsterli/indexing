    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 4:34 PM / Updated an hour ago Explainer: The man sent by North Korea leader to U.S. for high-level talks Doina Chiacu 3 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Kim Yong Chol lands in New York this week, he will become the most senior North Korean envoy to hold talks with American officials on U.S. soil in 18 years. Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Closing ceremony - Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 25, 2018 - Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party Central Committee, watches the closing ceremony. REUTERS/Patrick Semansky/Pool\nThe former spy chief is a trusted adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, playing a pivotal role in preparations for an historic summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn a sign of his importance, Trump announced Kim Yong Chol’s New York trip on Twitter on Tuesday. Kim Yong Chol is due to fly to the United States on Wednesday after speaking to Chinese officials in Beijing, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, citing an unidentified source.\nThe White House said he would meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later in the week. It will be the most high-level contact between the two countries in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a marshal, met President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000. DIPLOMATIC HEAVYWEIGHT\nKim Yong Chol, who holds the rank of general, is vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee and director of the United Front Department, which is responsible for relations with South Korea. His many positions in party and government make him one of the most powerful people in North Korea, according to the website North Korea Leadership Watch.\nHe has played a central role in the recent thaw in relations between the North and South Korea, as well as the United States.\nHe coordinated Kim Jong Un’s two meetings with Pompeo in April and May. He and Kim Jong Un’s sister were the only North Korean officials to attend the historic inter-Korean summit of leaders in April. SPY UNDER SANCTIONS\nKim Yong Chol previously was chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, a top North Korean military intelligence agency, and has spent nearly 30 years as a senior member of the intelligence community.\nThe United States and South Korea blacklisted him for supporting the North’s nuclear and missile programs in 2010 and 2016, respectively, so a visit to the United States would indicate a waiver was granted.\nDuring his tenure as a senior intelligence official, Kim was accused by South Korea of masterminding deadly attacks on a South Korean navy ship and an island in 2010. He was linked by U.S intelligence to a devastating cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.\nNorth Korea denied any involvement in the attack on the ship and on Sony Pictures. BODYGUARD TO KIM’S FATHER\nKim Yong Chol served in the military police in the demilitarized zone on the border of the two Koreas. He also was a bodyguard to Kim Jong Il, the former leader and late father of Kim Jong Un, according to North Korea Leadership Watch, an affiliate of the 38 North think tank.\nHe has been closely linked to Kim Jong Un’s succession and has been seen flanking the leader on several public visits.\nKim Yong Chol is known to be difficult to work with, sarcastic and not sufficiently deferential to his superiors, the leadership watch website said.
