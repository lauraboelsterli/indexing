    "text": "DARIEN, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) (NYSE:GWR)\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Highlights Compared with First Quarter 2017\nOperating revenues increased 10.7% to $574.7 million from $519.1 million. Reported operating income increased 14.5% to $86.9 million; Adjusted operating income increased 2.7% to $87.4 million. (1) Reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) increased to $1.19 with 62.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with reported diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2017 of $0.42 with 62.4 million weighted average shares outstanding; Adjusted diluted EPS increased 32.1% to $0.70. (1) Reported net income and diluted EPS included a $31.6 million, or $0.50 per share, income tax benefit associated with the U.S. Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2017 that was enacted in February 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $16.3 million to $101.4 million; Adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W decreased $7.9 million to $43.1 million, primarily due to the timing of core capital expenditures. (1) G&W repurchased 792,921 shares of its Class A Common Stock for $57.4 million during the first quarter of 2018.\nJack Hellmann, Chairman, President and CEO of G&W, commented, “G&W reported diluted earnings per share of $1.19 in the first quarter of 2018, or $0.70 per diluted share excluding the retroactive benefit from the U.S. Short Line Tax Credit for 2017. Although our adjusted diluted EPS increased 32%, our financial results in North America were adversely impacted by congestion at several connecting Class I railroads that limited car supply as well as by lower utility coal shipments in the Midwest. Meanwhile, our results in Australia and the U.K./Europe were consistent with our expectations.”\n“Our North American business strengthened in March and we see a favorable outlook for rates and volume for the remainder of 2018, despite ongoing pockets of rail system congestion. In Australia, we continue to see an uplift in our business in the second half of 2018 as we take delivery of new rail cars for spot coal movements in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales.”\n“In the U.K., we are accelerating improvements to our rail, terminal and road business through an optimization plan to further rationalize rail equipment, to streamline management and to implement technology investments to enhance productivity. Over the coming 12 months, we plan to incur approximately US$55 million in restructuring and related costs so as to unlock annualized savings of approximately US$18 million, with the initial benefits recognized in the second half of 2018. We believe the reorganization will not only meet strong customer demand for all of our supply chain services but also will enhance the quality and efficiency of our operations.” (1)\n“Finally, given G&W’s strong free cash flow generation and modest leverage, in the first quarter we commenced a share repurchase program under our existing $300 million authorization. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of G&W stock. At the same time, we are actively evaluating acquisition and investment opportunities in all geographies in which we operate. We expect to continue to pursue both traditional M&A opportunities as well as opportunistic share repurchases in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter Segment Highlights\nNorth America: Operating revenues from G&W's North American Operations increased 1.9% to $325.6 million from $319.5 million. Reported operating income from G&W's North American Operations increased 8.1% to $73.2 million; Adjusted operating income from G&W's North American Operations increased 0.6% to $73.4 million. (1) Australia: Operating revenues from G&W's 51.1% owned Australian Operations increased 1.3% to $74.8 million from $73.9 million. Reported operating income from G&W's Australian Operations decreased 6.9% to $16.0 million; Adjusted operating income from G&W's Australian Operations decreased 9.3% to $16.0 million. (1) U.K./Europe: Operating revenues from G&W's U.K./European Operations increased 38.6% to $174.2 million from $125.7 million, primarily due to new operations. Reported operating loss from G&W's U.K./European Operations decreased to $2.2 million from $8.9 million; Adjusted operating loss from G&W's U.K./European Operations decreased to $2.0 million from $5.5 million. (1)\nFinancial Results\nG&W's operating revenues increased $55.6 million, or 10.7%, to $574.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $519.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. G&W's operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $86.9 million, compared with $75.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. G&W's adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $87.4 million, compared with $85.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nReported net income attributable to G&W in the first quarter of 2018 was $75.1 million, compared with reported net income attributable to G&W of $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the net impact of certain items affecting comparability between periods discussed below, G&W's adjusted net income attributable to G&W in the first quarter of 2018 was $43.8 million, compared with $32.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nG&W's reported diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 were $1.19 with 62.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with reported diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2017 of $0.42 with 62.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. G&W's adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.70 with 62.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2017 of $0.53 with 62.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. (1)\nG&W's benefit from income taxes in the first quarter of 2018 was $15.9 million, while the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2017 was $21.9 million. Excluding the $31.6 million benefit from the retroactive extension of the U.S. Short Line Tax Credit, G&W's effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 26.2%, compared with 44.6% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in G&W's effective income tax rate was primarily a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), which decreased the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nIn the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, G&W's results included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts):\nIncome/(Loss)\nBefore Income\nTaxes Impact\nAfter-Tax Net\nIncome/(Loss)\nAttributable to\nG&W Impact\nDiluted EPS\nImpact\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nCorporate development and related costs $ (0.2 ) $ (0.1 ) $ — Restructuring costs $ (0.3 ) $ (0.2 ) $ — 2017 Short Line Tax Credit $ — $ 31.6 $ 0.50 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nCorporate development and related costs $ (5.4 ) $ (3.2 ) $ (0.05 ) Restructuring costs $ (3.8 ) $ (3.5 ) $ (0.06 ) In the first quarter of 2018, G&W's results included a $31.6 million income tax benefit associated with the U.S. Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2017 that was enacted in February 2018.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, G&W's results included corporate development and related costs of $5.4 million, about half of which related to the Providence and Worcester integration and the remainder of which related to other corporate development activities, as well as restructuring costs of $3.8 million, primarily related to severance costs associated with G&W's restructuring of ERS Railways B.V. (ERS).\nFirst Quarter Results by Segment\nOperating revenues from G&W's North American Operations increased $6.2 million, or 1.9%, to $325.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $319.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNorth American Operations traffic increased 2,997 carloads, or 0.7%, to 406,013 carloads in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding 1,570 carloads from new operations, same railroad traffic increased 1,427 carloads, or 0.4%. The same railroad traffic increase was principally due to increases of 2,583 carloads of pulp and paper (primarily in the Southern and Central regions), 2,131 carloads of other commodity traffic (primarily Class I overhead traffic in the Central and Midwest regions) and 1,662 carloads of lumber and forest products traffic (primarily in the Western Region), partially offset by decreases of 3,597 carloads of agricultural products traffic (primarily in the Midwest and Central regions) and 2,835 carloads of chemicals and plastics (primarily in the Western and Northeast regions). All remaining traffic decreased by a net 1,483 carloads.\nG&W's North American Operations had operating income of $73.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $67.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating ratio for North American Operations was 77.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an operating ratio of 78.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income from G&W's North American Operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $73.4 million, compared with adjusted operating income of $73.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted operating ratio for North American Operations was 77.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an adjusted operating ratio of 77.2% in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nOperating revenues from G&W's Australian Operations increased $0.9 million, or 1.3%, to $74.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $73.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding a $2.7 million increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, Australian Operations same railroad revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a decrease in switching revenues. (2)\nAustralian Operations traffic decreased 5,901 carloads to 143,515 carloads in the first quarter of 2018. The traffic decrease was principally due to a decrease of 2,154 carloads of agricultural products traffic and 2,035 carloads of metallic ores traffic. All remaining traffic decreased by a net 1,712 carloads.\nG&W's Australian Operations had operating income of $16.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $17.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating ratio for Australian Operations was 78.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an operating ratio of 76.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income from G&W's Australian Operations was $16.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with adjusted operating income of $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted operating ratio for Australian Operations was 78.6% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an adjusted operating ratio of 76.1% in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nOperating revenues from G&W's U.K./European Operations increased $48.5 million, or 38.6%, to $174.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $125.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding $34.7 million from new operations and a $16.9 million increase due to the impact of foreign currency appreciation, U.K./European same railroad revenues decreased $3.2 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to a decrease in Continental Europe intermodal revenues following the discontinuation of certain intermodal train services as part of the restructuring of ERS Railways B.V. (ERS) in the first half of 2017 and decreased U.K. infrastructure revenues, partially offset by increased revenues from minerals and stones traffic in Poland. (2)\nU.K./European Operations traffic decreased 7,031 carloads, or 2.6%, to 261,785 carloads in the first quarter of 2018. The traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of 13,033 carloads of intermodal traffic in the U.K. and Continental Europe and 4,666 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the U.K.), partially offset by an increase of 11,215 carloads of minerals and stone traffic (primarily in Poland). All remaining traffic decreased by 547 carloads.\nG&W's U.K./European Operations had an operating loss of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an operating loss of $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Of note, the recent change in U.S. GAAP accounting to reclassify pension returns and interest costs from operating to non-operating income had the impact of reducing U.K./Europe's operating income by $2.3 million and $1.6 million for the periods ending March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The operating ratio for U.K./European Operations was 101.3% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an operating ratio of 107.1% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating loss from G&W's U.K./European Operations was $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an adjusted operating loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted operating ratio for U.K./European Operations was 101.2% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with an adjusted operating ratio of 104.4% in the first quarter of 2017. (1)\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Measures (1)\nAdjusted free cash flow measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 101.4 $ 85.0 Allocation of adjusted cash flow to noncontrolling interest (a) (9.0 ) (6.4 ) Adjusted net cash provided by operating activities attributable to G&W $ 92.4 $ 78.6 Core capital expenditures (b) (41.4 ) (28.9 ) Adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W before new business\ninvestments and grant funded projects\n$ 51.0 $ 49.7 New business investments (7.5 ) (0.1 ) Grant funded projects, net of proceeds received from outside parties (c) $ (0.4 ) $ 1.4 Adjusted free cash flow attributable to G&W $ 43.1 $ 51.0 (a) Allocation of adjusted cash flow to noncontrolling interest (Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets' (MIRA's) 48.9% equity ownership of G&W Australia Holdings LP (GWA) since December 1, 2016) is calculated as 48.9% of the total of (i) cash flow provided by operating activities of G&W’s Australian Operations, less (ii) net purchases of property and equipment of G&W’s Australian Operations. The timing and amount of actual distributions, if any, from GWA to G&W and MIRA made in any given period will vary and could differ materially from the amounts presented. There were no such distributions made for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. G&W expressly disclaims any direct correlation between the allocation of adjusted cash flow to noncontrolling interest and actual distributions made in any given period. (b) Core capital expenditures represent purchases of property and equipment as presented on the Statement of Cash Flows less grant proceeds from outside parties, insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets and proceeds from disposition of property and equipment, each of which as presented on the Statement of Cash Flows, less new business investments and grant funded projects.\n(c) Grant funded projects represent purchases of property and equipment for projects partially or entirely funded by outside parties, net of grant proceeds from outside parties as presented on the Statement of Cash Flows.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, G&W repurchased 792,921 shares of Class A Common Stock for $57.4 million, which resulted in a 51,106 reduction in our weighted average diluted shares during the first quarter.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nAs previously announced, G&W's conference call to discuss financial results for the first quarter of 2018 will be held on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 11 a.m. EDT.

In accordance with these rules, G&W has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nManagement views these non-GAAP financial measures as important measures of G&W’s operating performance or, in the case of the adjusted free cash flow measures, a useful indicator of cash flow that may be available for discretionary use by G&W. Management also views these non-GAAP financial measures as a way to assess comparability between periods. Key limitations of the adjusted free cash flow measures include the assumptions that G&W will be able to refinance its existing debt when it matures and meet other cash flow obligations from financing activities, such as principal payments on debt.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent, and should not be considered more meaningful than, or as an alternative to, their most directly comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables set forth reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure ($ in millions, except per share amounts).\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Ratio\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 North\nAmerican\nOperations\nAustralian\nOperations\nU.K./\nEuropean\nOperations\nTotal\nOperations\nOperating revenues $ 325.6 $ 74.8 $ 174.2 $ 574.7 Operating expenses 252.5 58.9 176.4 487.7 Operating income/(loss) (a)\n$ 73.2 $ 16.0 $ (2.2 ) $ 86.9 Operating ratio (b) 77.5 % 78.7 % 101.3 % 84.9 % Operating expenses $ 252.5 $ 58.9 $ 176.4 $ 487.7 Corporate development and related costs (0.2 ) — 0.1 (0.2 ) Restructuring costs — — (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Adjusted operating expenses $ 252.2 $ 58.8 $ 176.2 $ 487.3 Adjusted operating income/(loss)\n$ 73.4 $ 16.0 $ (2.0 ) $ 87.4 Adjusted operating ratio 77.5 % 78.6 % 101.2 % 84.8 % (a) Operating income is calculated as operating revenues less operating expenses.
