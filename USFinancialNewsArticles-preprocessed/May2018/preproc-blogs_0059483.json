    "text": "0 COMMENTS As worries about Italy’s potential exit from the eurozone ripple across the bloc’s bond markets , France’s bonds have emerged as an unexpected haven.\nOn Tuesday, yields on 10-year French government debt dropped below 0.7%, moving in lockstep with the bonds of countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, and in the opposite direction of yields in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.\nIt’s a further sign that, under President Emmanuel Macron’s government, France is now considered by investors part of the “core” set of countries that will remain part of the single currency no matter what.\n“France has reaffirmed its position in Europe, the new government and the president elected last year are really pro-euro,” said Isabelle Vic-Philippe, head of eurozone government debt at Amundi Asset Management , Europe’s top investor, with €1.4 trillion ($1.6 trillion) under supervision.\nIt’s no small feat.\nOver the last decade, every time markets have experienced turmoil, money managers have dumped the debt of those countries more likely to exit the eurozone—fearing that, if conditions deteriorated, they could be repaid in currencies other than euros—and bought the bonds of those likely to remain.\nDuring the euro crisis of 2010-2012, French bonds fell clearly in the former category, with 10-year yield spreads versus Germany widening to close to two percentage points.\nEver since, France’s debt, as well as its neighbor Belgium’s, has sometimes traded like Germany’s, but only as long as there wasn’t a direct threat to the eurozone. As early as last year, when French euroskeptic leader Marine Le Pen gained support in the polls, French bonds switched back to ape Italian ones .\nBut now, with Italy’s new antiestablishment parties once again posing a direct challenge to the euro, French and Belgian bonds are clearly tracking German ones, correlations between daily bond moves show—even though spreads have widened because German debt has rallied even faster.\nShare this: eurozone Italy Macron Previous Brexit & Beyond: Eurozone Crisis Fears Revived Next WSJ City PM: Eurozone Risk Aversion Is Back, Why Bank Investors Fear Return of Doom Loop",
