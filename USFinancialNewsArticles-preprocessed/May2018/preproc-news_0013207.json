    "text": "1Q18 GAAP EPS of $0.66, up 20%; 1Q18 non-GAAP EPS of $0.67, up 22% Strong revenue growth of 7% with expanding segment margins Consolidated backlog remains healthy at $3.6 billion Reiterated 2018 guidance: EPS of $2.45 to 2.55; revenue of $1.75 to 1.85 billion\nLYNCHBURG, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) (“BWXT” or the “Company”) reported first quarter 2018 revenue of $457 million, a 6.8% increase compared to $428 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income for the first quarter 2018 was $66.4 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $55.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter 2018 was $67.6 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $55.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Year-over-year earnings per share improvements were driven primarily by strong operational performance and the benefit of lower expense due to tax reform. A reconciliation of non-GAAP results is detailed in Exhibit 1.\n“Our first quarter performance provides a strong start to the year,” said Rex D. Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The company continues to perform exceptionally well with EPS growth of 22 percent on top of strong revenue gains. We saw continued strength in all three segments of the business with an especially strong showing from the Nuclear Power Group.\n“A few weeks ago we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sotera Health’s Nordion medical isotope business. This was an opportunistic addition that is aligned with the strategic initiative to commercialize our breakthrough medical isotope manufacturing technology, creating the first new major business line for the company in over 25 years.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Results\nNuclear Operations Group (NOG) segment revenue was $317 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 2.6% decrease from the prior-year period due to timing of contract activities. NOG operating income was $67.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, about flat compared with the prior-year period. Year-over-year segment operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 21.4%.\nNuclear Power Group (NPG) segment revenue was a record $113 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 45.2% increase from the prior-year period due to material timing on a China steam generator project and increased field service activity. NPG operating income was robust at $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 68% increase from the prior-year period. Year-over-year segment operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 19.3%.\nNuclear Services Group (NSG) segment operating income was $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, up $0.8 million versus the prior-year period.\nLiquidity and Debt\nThe Company utilized cash in operating activities of $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with net cash utilized in operating activities of $54.7 million, inclusive of a $30 million settlement payment, in the first quarter of 2017. At the end of the first quarter, the Company’s cash and short-term investments position, net of restricted cash, was $144.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, outstanding balances under our credit facility included $502.8 million in term loans, no revolving line of credit borrowings, and $73.8 million in letters of credit. As a result, the Company had $326.2 million in remaining availability under its credit facility, excluding an additional $250 million accordion provision.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per common share. The dividend will be payable on June 6, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 18, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nBWXT reiterated guidance for 2018:\nEPS in a range of $2.45 to $2.55 (excluding mark-to-market of pension and post-retirement benefits) Revenue in a range of $1.75 to $1.85 billion NOG revenue in a range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion and operating margin in the high teens with upside potential NPG revenue in a range of $300 to $350 million and operating margin of approximately 12% NSG operating income of approximately $20 million Research and development costs of approximately $15 million Corporate unallocated costs of approximately $20 million Other income primarily related to pension and other post-employment benefit plans in a range of $30 to $35 million Effective non-GAAP tax rate in a range of 22% to 25% Capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, primarily to support growth in Navy business Depreciation and amortization of approximately $60 million\nLong-term Outlook\nBWXT reiterated long-term guidance that beyond 2017, and excluding the benefit of tax reform, it anticipates an EPS Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the low-double digits over a three to five year period based on a robust organic growth strategy and balance sheet capacity.\nConference Call to Discuss First Quarter 2018 Results\nDate: Monday, May 7, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. EDT\nLive Webcast: Investor Relations section of website at www.bwxt.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nBWXT cautions that this release contains , including, without limitation, statements relating to backlog, to the extent they may be viewed as an indicator of future revenues; the anticipated benefits of our proposed acquisition of Nordion’s medical isotope business; timing of future revenues from the acquisition of Nordion’s medical isotope business and new medical isotope business; our plans and expectations for the NOG, NPG and NSG segments; and our outlook and guidance for 2018 and beyond.
