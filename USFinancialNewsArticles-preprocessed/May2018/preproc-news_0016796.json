    "text": "Matt Adams hit two homers and drove in five runs, and two Nationals with ties to San Diego played prominent roles Monday night as visiting Washington scored an 8-5 win over the Padres at Petco Park.\nSan Diego State product Stephen Strasburg (4-3) held the Padres to three runs on six hits over seven innings. The right-hander struck out five and walked one.\nNationals shortstop Trea Turner, who was a top Padres prospect before going to Washington in a three-team, 2014 trade that brought Wil Myers to the Padres, homered and scored three runs in his first game ever at Petco Park.\nTurner’s third homer of the season, off Padres starter Tyson Ross, gave the Nationals a quick 1-0 lead in the first.\nThe Padres tied the game in the fourth on a leadoff single and stolen base by Travis Jankowski and two ground outs to the right side of the infield.\nThe game remained even until the Nationals scored four runs in the sixth and three in the seventh. Adams homered in both innings.\nTurner walked to lead off the sixth and raced home from first on Anthony Rendon’s double to left to put the Nationals ahead to stay. Adams then hit a two-run homer off Ross. The Nationals added a fourth run in the inning on a double by Howie Kendrick and an RBI single by Matt Wieters.\nRoss (2-3) allowed five runs on six hits and three walks with six strikeouts in six innings.\nAdams’ three-run homer in the seventh was off left-handed reliever Matt Strahm, whom the Padres activated from the disabled list earlier Monday.\nBryce Harper walked to open the seventh and was forced at second on Turner’s grounder to second. Turner stopped at third on Rendon’s second double.\nAdams then launched his second homer into the right field seats. It was the seventh two-homer game of his career and his second in the past seven days.\nManuel Margot tripled leading off the bottom of the sixth for the Padres and scored on pinch hitter Carlos Asuaje’s sacrifice fly. Franchy Cordero doubled leading off the seventh and scored on Jose Pirela’s two-out single. The Padres added two runs in the ninth.\nPirela finished 3-for-4.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
