    "text": "TÜBINGEN, Germany and BOSTON, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CureVac AG, a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company pioneering the field of mRNA-based drugs, today announced that Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ingmar Hoerr, intends to transition from his current CEO position to the Supervisory Board at the upcoming Annual General Meeting on June 20, 2018 and will stand for election as Chairman of the Supervisory Board afterwards. Daniel L. Menichella, currently Chief Business Officer and Chief Executive Officer of CureVac AG and CEO of CureVac’s U.S. subsidiary, will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of CureVac AG effective on June 20, 2018.\nIngmar Hoerr commented: “I am honored that CureVac’s majority investor, dievini Hopp Biotech holding GmbH & Co. KG of SAP Founder Dietmar Hopp, and our Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Friedrich von Bohlen, have been supportive of my plans to make this important transition. The company is positioned for success as it accelerates development of its clinical pipeline of exciting new treatments based on mRNA technology. In my new role, I will look ahead to future applications of mRNA, as well as the company’s long-term strategy and vision. In Dan Menichella, we have an ideal CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board who is at home on both continents, has a strong network in the U.S., and knows the company very well. I am delighted that he has accepted this new challenge, and look forward to continuing our excellent collaboration.”\nDan Menichella added: “I am excited to have been selected as CureVac’s CEO by the Board of Directors. Ingmar had a very clear vision and strategy when founding CureVac 18 years ago. He has since established a leading mRNA platform and experienced team without which this technology would not exist today. I am focused on taking the company through its next stage, advancing the current clinical programs and adding additional pipeline assets into the clinic in the coming year and beyond. We will build on our German roots while tapping resources in the U.S. and globally to support us in developing the first mRNA medicines.”\n“CureVac is a leader in mRNA technology and therapeutics,” said Friedrich von Bohlen. “This is very much so because of Ingmar’s vision and leadership. We are convinced that the new constellation in the Executive and Non-Executive Boards of the company will enable a faster, value driving progress and growth of CureVac.”\nCureVac will continue to expand its financial and scientific presence in the U.S. through its office in Boston, MA, with Tübingen remaining the global headquarters of the company’s R&D and manufacturing operations.\nDaniel L. Menichella joined CureVac in early 2017. As a member of the Executive Board, he served as head of the U.S. subsidiary as well as global business development, alliance management and commercial development. Since October 2017, CureVac has been collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company for the development and commercialization of up to five potential cancer vaccine products. Other important collaborations include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Boehringer Ingelheim, CRISPR Therapeutics, Arcturus Therapeutics, and Acuitas. CureVac reached an important milestone in March 2018 when the company was granted a U.S. patent for the production of in vitro transcribed RNA, the first U.S. patent of its kind granted in the mRNA field.\nAbout CureVac AG\nCureVac is a leading company in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology with more than 18 years’ expertise in handling and optimizing this versatile molecule for medical purposes. The principle of CureVac's proprietary technology is the use of mRNA as a data carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases. The company applies its technologies for the development of cancer therapies, prophylactic vaccines and molecular therapies.\nTo date, CureVac has received approximately $420 million (€400 million) in equity investments including significant investments from SAP founder Dietmar Hopp’s Dievini and an investment of $52 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. CureVac has also entered into collaborations with multinational corporations and organizations, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly & Co, CRISPR Therapeutics, Arcturus Therapeutics, Acuitas, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nFor more information, please visit www.curevac.com .\nMedia Contacts\nVerena Lauterbach, Senior Manager Communications\nCureVac AG, Tübingen, Germany\nT: +49 7071 9883 1756\nverena.lauterbach@curevac.com\nBrad Miles\nBMC Communications, New York\nT: +1 646 513-3125\nbmiles@bmccommunications.com\nSource:CureVac AG",
