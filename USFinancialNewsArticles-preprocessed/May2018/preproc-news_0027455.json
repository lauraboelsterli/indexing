REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo\n“We regret to inform you that, at today’s meeting, the negotiations with Ryanair’s management have been broken off as they have not accepted our minimum requirements document, 90 percent of which corresponded to their proposals,” SEPLA said in a newsletter to members.\nSEPLA said Ryanair did not want to allow union members three days a month to carry out union duties.\nRyanair did not immediately comment on the SEPLA talks.
