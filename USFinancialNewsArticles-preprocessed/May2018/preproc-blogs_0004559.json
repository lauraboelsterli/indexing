    "text": "1 COMMENTS Combined revenue at large cloud-service firms has grown 51% over the past year to nearly $15 billion, Synergy Research Group says.\nThat outpaces full-year revenue growth of 44% in 2017, and 50% in 2016, the research group said.\nThe results are based on an analysis of quarterly earnings reported in recent weeks by Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. International Business Machines Corp., and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\nThe analysis includes reported revenue data from Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and hosted private cloud services.\nIt shows AWS, Amazon’s cloud unit, extending a 12-quarter lead in the cloud-services market, with a 33% share of the global market. Amazon was among the first tech firms to rent computer power and storage, launching AWS over a decade ago.\nCurrently its closest rival is Microsoft, with 13% market share, followed by IBM at 8%, Google at 6% and Alibaba at 4%, according to Synergy.\nThat market dynamic has held roughly steady even as the broader cloud market itself has “almost tripled in size” over the past 12 quarters, it said.\nGains among big cloud vendors have mostly come at the expense of small-to-medium sized operators, who are being outspent by the bigger providers and have seen their market shares diminish, Synergy said.\nAWS generated $5.4 billion of revenue for Amazon during the quarter, up 49% from the same period last year, while operating profits from cloud rose 57% to $1.4 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported .\nLikewise, Microsoft last week reported that its Azure cloud business and the commercial version of its Office 365 online-productivity service grew 58% during its fiscal third quarter, accounting for $6 billion in revenue.\nJohn Dinsdale, Synergy’s chief analyst and research director, said cloud growth in the last two quarters has been unexpectedly strong.\n“Normal market development cycles and the lawof large numbers should result in growth rates that slowly diminish,” Mr. Dinsdale said in a statement, citing declines in “late 2016 and through most of 2017.”\nShare this: ALIBABA AMAZON WEB SERVICES CLOUD GOOGLE CLOUD IBM MICROSOFT AZURE Previous The Morning Download: Artificial Intelligence Transforms the Sales Process Next The Morning Download: Cloud Giants Experience Even Faster Growth Rates",
