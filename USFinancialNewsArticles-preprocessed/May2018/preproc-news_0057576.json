European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Vitor Constancio holds a news conference at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n“Italy knows the rules. They might want to read them again,” Constancio told Spiegel magazine in an interview, according to a pre-release, when asked if the central bank would intervene in the case of an emergency and rescue Italy from an insolvency.
