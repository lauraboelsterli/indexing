    "text": "May 3, 2018 / 2:05 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago U.S. prisoner release would be goodwill move by North Korea - White House Makini Brice , Jeff Mason 5 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday it would welcome the release of three Americans imprisoned in North Korea as a goodwill gesture before a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but that it could not confirm reports that they are about to be freed.

KCNA via Reuters/File Photo\nExpectations have grown that North Korea would soon release the three ahead of the unprecedented summit in the coming weeks.\nRudy Giuliani, a member of Trump’s legal team, told Fox News Channel that Pyongyang would release them as early as Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Giuliani had direct knowledge of negotiations around the issue.\nCNN, citing an unnamed source, said on Thursday the prisoners’ release was imminent, adding the groundwork for the move was laid two months ago when North Korea’s foreign minister travelled to Sweden and proposed the idea.\n“We can’t confirm the validity of any of the reports currently out about their release, but we certainly would see this as a sign of goodwill if North Korea were to release the three Americans ahead of discussions between President Trump and Kim Jong Un,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.\nThe three are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong Chul; Kim Sang-duk, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017, and Kim Hak Song, who also taught at PUST.\nTrump did not mention Korea or the prisoners when he spoke at a prayer event at the White House on Thursday. “Our country is doing very well. You’ll see some very good announcements very shortly,” he said.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said on Twitter, “As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!”\nThe U.S. government is looking into reports that the Americans had recently been relocated from a labour camp to a hotel near Pyongyang, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.\nThe summit between Trump and Kim is expected to take place in late May or early June. Related Coverage White House sees North Korea's possible release of Americans as 'sign of goodwill' DENUCLEARIZATION\nIn preparing for the summit, Trump’s administration has said it wants North Korea’s “complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization” but has offered few details of the strategy it will employ at the talks.\nKim told the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, on Thursday that he is committed to denuclearization, China’s foreign ministry said, as diplomatic efforts to bring lasting peace to the Korean peninsula gather pace.\n“Kim Jong Un said achieving the denuclearization of the peninsula is the firm position of the North Korean side,” China’s foreign ministry said after Wang met Kim in Pyongyang.\nNorth Korea announced on Sunday that it would close its main nuclear test site next month but some U.S. officials are sceptical that Pyongyang will give up its nuclear arsenal.\nTrump has promised to ensure that North Korea does not get the capability to build a nuclear bomb that can hit the mainland United States.\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence is postponing his plans to travel to Brazil this month in order to ensure foreign policy resources are focussed on Trump’s talks with Kim, Pence’s spokeswoman said.\nThe exact date and location has yet to be fixed for the meeting between Trump and Kim, who lobbed personal insults and lambasted each other last year over North Korea’s nuclear arms ambitions.\nThe change in tone has been helped by last week’s meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, at which the two pledged to work for “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula. Trump said he would maintain pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions ahead of his own meeting with Kim.\nEven as Washington presses for the release of the three American prisoners, the parents of a U.S. college student who died last year soon after being release from captivity in North Korea have sued Pyongyang over their son’s death, saying Otto Warmbier was “brutally tortured and murdered.” Reporting by Makini Brice and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Beijing, Christine Kim and Jane Chung in Seoul and David Stanway in Shanghai; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Frances Kerry",
