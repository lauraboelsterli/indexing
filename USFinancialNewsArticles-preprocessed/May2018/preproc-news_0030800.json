Huge will look to further integrate these capabilities into an end-to-end offering that will change industries and foster meaningful relationships with their clients' end users.\n\"For nearly 20 years, Huge has been defining and evangelizing the power of user-centric design. We've been helping the world's most ambitious companies realize the potential of organizing around their users, and we are now seeing these same ideals transform industries, disrupt categories, and irrevocably alter the business and communications landscape,\" said Michael Koziol, CEO of Huge.\nKoziol added: \"We are now entering a new era where our clients' business models continue to be disrupted, and they need our way of thinking more now than ever.
