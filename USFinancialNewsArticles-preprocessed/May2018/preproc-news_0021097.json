    "text": "President Donald Trump 's nominee to be the next CIA director said the spy agency learned \"tough lessons\" from its use of harsh detention and interrogation tactics on terror suspects after 9/11.\nGina Haspel said that in hindsight it's clear that the spy agency was not prepared and did not have the expertise to use techniques like sleep deprivation and waterboarding, which simulates drowning, to get terror suspects to talk.\nHaspel said that when she saw a video of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center in New York, she knew \"in my gut\" that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was to blame.\nShe said she got up from her desk on 9/11 and, like many other CIA officers, walked over to the spy agency's Counterterrorism Center to volunteer to help. She said she didn't leave for three years.\nHaspel said that after 9/11, many men and women at the CIA worked seven days a week and that some postponed weddings and having babies. She said the first CIA personnel on the ground in Afghanistan were her colleagues.\nHaspel is giving her opening remarks at Wednesday's confirmation hearing before the Senate intelligence committee.\nShe said that if she's confirmed, she will follow the clear and legal framework the U.S. has since imposed that bans any corrosive tactic not spelled out in the Army Field Manual.",
