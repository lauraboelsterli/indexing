    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meta Financial Group, Inc. ® (Nasdaq:CASH) (“Meta” or the “Company”)\nHighlights for the 2018 Fiscal Second Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nThe Company recorded net income of $31.4 million, or $3.23 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $32.1 million, or $3.42 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 2%. The 2018 fiscal second quarter pre-tax results included $2.2 million of merger and acquisition related expenses, $0.5 million payout of severance costs related to synergy efforts in the Company's tax divisions, and a $0.2 million loss on sale of investments. The 2018 fiscal second quarter pre-tax results also included $2.7 million in amortization of intangible assets and $1.3 million in non-cash stock-related compensation associated with executive officer employment agreements (see Select Quarterly Expenses table).\nNet interest income was $27.4 million in the 2018 fiscal second quarter, an increase of $3.4 million, or 14%, compared to $24.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was largely driven by increased loan balances, primarily in the portfolios of community banking, purchased student loans, and commercial insurance premium finance loans. A rise in interest expense, largely due to an increase in short-term funding rates and an increase in wholesale funding balances due to retaining more tax services loans on the Company's balance sheet, partially offset the increase in interest income.\nCard fee income increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $26.9 million for the 2018 fiscal second quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2017. Card fee growth with respect to the 2018 fiscal second quarter compared to the same period of the prior year was negatively affected by a promotional campaign during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 that has since expired as expected. Excluding the year over year change for the promotional campaign's partner, card fee income would have been up $1.3 million, or 5%, when comparing the 2018 fiscal second quarter to the same period of the prior year. The Company expects fiscal year 2018 total card fee income to be between $95.0 million and $101.0 million and expects total card processing expense to be between $23.0 million and $27.0 million.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the prior year, tax product fee income increased $4.0 million, or 6%, from $63.6 million to $67.6 million, tax product expense decreased $2.0 million, or 15%, from $13.3 million to $11.3 million and provision for loan losses related to tax services loans increased $10.2 million, or 130%, from $7.9 million to $18.1 million. The increase in tax product fee income and provision for loan losses was primarily due to retaining all tax advance loans originated during the 2018 tax season, as opposed to the previous year when a majority of these loans were sold. When comparing pre-tax income for the tax services business, the 2018 fiscal first quarter was higher than the same period of the prior year, while the 2018 fiscal second quarter was lower than the same period of the prior year. The Company expects 2018 fiscal third quarter pre-tax income to be higher than the same period of the prior year and now expects total fiscal 2018 pre-tax income for our tax services business to be approximately $1 million to $3 million lower than for total fiscal 2017.\nThe Company's 2018 fiscal second quarter average assets grew to $4.70 billion, compared to $4.41 billion in the 2017 fiscal second quarter, an increase of 7%, primarily driven by growth in loan balances.\nTotal loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $353.9 million, or 31%, at March 31, 2018, compared to March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily related to growth in commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, due to the purchased student loan portfolios and tax advance loans, and commercial insurance premium finance loans.\nPayments division average deposits increased $190.9 million, or 8%, for the 2018 fiscal second quarter when compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nNon-performing assets (“NPAs”) were 0.84% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.12% at March 31, 2017. See Credit Quality section below for further detail.\nBusiness Updates\nOn April 30, 2018, Meta announced an expanded, four-year agreement with AAA. Together, Meta and AAA anticipate bringing robust payments solutions to US-based AAA Clubs. Under this new agreement, MetaBank and AAA will expand distribution of the payments products, as well as enhancing them based on member feedback and consumer preference, adding features like mobile applications for card management and additional load capabilities.\nOn April 30, 2018, Meta announced an agreement with CURO Group Holdings Corp (\"CURO\"), a leader in providing short-term credit to underbanked consumers. Together, the organizations will launch a new line of credit product that the parties believe will be more flexible and transparent than others in the market, and well-suited for US-based underbanked consumers. CURO and Meta expect to unveil the new, joint brand and a timeline for the pilot launch later this year. In the first three years of the agreement with CURO, Meta expects to hold up to $350 million in product receivables on its balance sheet.\nOn April 3, 2018, Meta announced it entered into a three-year agreement with Health Credit Services (\"HCS\"), a technology-driven, patient financing company. MetaBank will approve and originate loans for elective procedures for select HCS provider offices throughout the country. During the three-year agreement, MetaBank expects to originate at least several hundred million dollars in personal loans.\nOn March 12, 2018, Meta announced a 10-year renewal of a relationship with Money Network Financial, LLC (\"Money Network\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data (NYSE:FDC). MetaBank supports a range of Money Network payments programs, most notably the Money Network® Electronic Payment Delivery Service, which large organizations use to provide employees the option of receiving wages electronically.\n\"We are excited to announce that we have delivered strong quarterly earnings of $31.4 million,\" said Chairman and CEO J. Tyler Haahr. “The production and results of the 2018 tax season and the effectiveness of our processing standards and partner relationships aided in our outstanding performance. Our tax season infrastructure has once again performed very well and we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver positive results into the future.\n\"Adding to a very active quarter, we renewed multi-year agreements with two of our largest prepaid partners, Money Network Financial and AAA, and added relationships in our national consumer lending business. Meta will originate and provide consumer lending opportunities to the customers of Liberty Lending, LLC, Health Credit Services, and CURO. We expect that these renewed and new relationships will provide us continued momentum and allow us to further diversify our financing products.\n\"Work towards the integration of the anticipated Crestmark acquisition is continuing behind the scenes, and we expect the acquisition to be completed by June 30. While we are earnestly engaged with acquisition details, we are actively making investments in people and systems to build out our platforms for our consumer credit business and to enhance growth for Crestmark and our other current business initiatives. We anticipate making significant investments in the next twelve months to lay the groundwork for what we believe will be good growth in fiscal 2019 and significantly more meaningful drivers for earnings performance in 2020 and beyond.\"\nFinancial Summary\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $124.8 million, compared to $116.1 million for the same quarter in 2017, an increase of $8.7 million, or 7%. This increase was primarily due to growth in interest income from community banking loans, as well as the purchased student loans and income from tax-exempt securities (included in other investment securities), and growth in tax product fee income.\nNet Income\nThe Company recorded net income of $31.4 million, or $3.23 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $32.1 million, or $3.42 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net income was due to an increase of $9.7 million in provision for loan losses, primarily related to the Company holding all tax services loans on the balance sheet, and a $1.6 million increase in non-interest expense, partially offset by increases of $5.2 million in non-interest income and $3.4 million in net interest income along with a decrease in income tax expense of $1.9 million, primarily due to the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").\nThe 2018 fiscal second quarter pre-tax results included $2.7 million of amortization of intangible assets, $2.2 million of acquisition expenses, $0.5 million payout of severance costs related to ongoing synergy efforts in the Company's tax divisions, and a $0.2 million loss on sale of investments. In addition, pre-tax results included $1.3 million in non-cash stock-related compensation in connection with three executive officers signing long-term employment agreements in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017. These stock awards vest over eight years but the associated expense is heavily front loaded (see Select Quarterly Expenses table).\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $27.4 million, up $3.4 million, or 14%, from the same quarter in 2017, due to an enhanced interest-earning asset mix primarily due to increases in the community banking loan portfolio, the purchased student loan portfolios, and commercial insurance premium finance loans. Excluding the additional borrowing costs related to retaining all tax services loans, net interest income for the fiscal 2018 second quarter would have been approximately $28.4 million, or an increase of 18% compared to the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The quarterly average outstanding balance of loans from all sources as a percentage of interest-earning assets increased from 33% as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2017 to 44% as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2018. In addition, lower-yielding agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (\"MBS\") decreased from 19% of interest-earning assets in the fiscal second quarter of 2017 to 15% of interest-earning assets for the same quarter in 2018. Net interest income for the fiscal 2018 second quarter was up $1.2 million from the Company's fiscal 2018 first quarter, primarily due to a combination of increased loan balances and yields and higher investment yields on mortgage and asset backed securities, offset in part by higher short-term funding costs.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin, tax equivalent (\"NIM\") was 2.89% in the fiscal 2018 second quarter, a decrease of two basis points from 2.91% in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The decrease was primarily related to the increase in non-interest bearing tax-related loans retained on the Company's balance sheet in the current year's tax quarter when compared to the previous year, as well as the change in the corporate tax rate. Had corporate tax rates remained at previous rates, excluding changes resulting from the adoption of the Tax Act, the reported NIM of 2.89% would have been 3.08%. If the average balance of tax services loans for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 had been at similar levels to the same period of fiscal 2017, NIM would have been another seven basis points higher.\nThe Company estimates, when adjusting for certain seasonal tax program related items as discussed below, a normalized NIM for the 2018 fiscal second quarter would have been between 3.30% and 3.33%, which also reflects the adjusted tax rate due to the adoption of the Tax Act. These adjustments include removing the impact of tax related lending, normalizing cash balances, and making borrowing adjustments by removing borrowing expense if cash balances were available. This Company estimate of normalized NIM would compare favorably to a similarly adjusted fiscal first quarter of 2018 NIM of 3.14%. The quarter to quarter estimated improvement primarily relates to improving earning asset yields and an increase in average non-interest bearing deposits in the current quarter.\nThe overall reported tax equivalent yield (“TEY”) on average earning asset yields increased by 16 basis points to 3.46% when comparing the fiscal 2018 second quarter to the 2017 second quarter, which was driven primarily by the Company's improved earning asset mix, with increased exposure to its high-quality commercial insurance premium finance, student, and community banking loan portfolios. The reported 3.46% TEY on earning assets reflects the lowered corporate prorated tax rate of the Company's tax-exempt securities portfolio. Had corporate tax rates remained at previous rates, excluding changes resulting from the adoption of the Tax Act, reported TEY on earning assets would have been 3.65%.\nThe fiscal 2018 second quarter TEY on the securities portfolio decreased by six basis points to 3.18% compared to the same period of the prior year TEY of 3.24%, primarily due to the adoption of the Tax Act, which lowered the TEY on tax-exempt securities. Had corporate tax rates not changed due to the Tax Act, reported securities portfolio TEY yield would have been increased to 3.52% due to new investments being made in higher-yielding investment securities and MBS.\nThe Company’s average interest-earning assets for the fiscal 2018 second quarter grew by $289.0 million, or 7%, to $4.25 billion, from the comparable quarter in 2017, primarily from growth in the loan portfolio of $552.4 million, of which $239.4 million was attributable to an increase in volume of tax services loans. This increase was partially offset by decreases in cash and fed funds sold and total investment securities of $170.5 million and $92.8 million, respectively. The Company's management believes it has the flexibility to reasonably manage total balance sheet growth moving forward, if needed.\nOverall, the Company's cost of funds for all deposits and borrowings averaged 0.58% during the fiscal 2018 second quarter, compared to 0.39% for the 2017 second quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term funding rates and higher average overall funding balances due to the Company's utilization of more of its capital during non-tax season with higher investment balances and funding, and in preparation to hold more tax loans on the Company's balance sheet. The Company's overall cost of deposits was 0.33% in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, compared to 0.24% in the same quarter of 2017. When excluding wholesale deposits, the Company's cost of deposits for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 0.06%.\nNon-Interest Income\nFiscal 2018 second quarter non-interest income of $97.4 million increased $5.2 million, or 6%, from $92.2 million in the same quarter of 2017, largely due to an increase in tax product fee income of $4.0 million, or a 6% increase, when comparing the current quarter to the same period of the prior year. The increase in tax product fee income was primarily due to retaining all tax advance loans originated during the 2018 tax season, as opposed to the previous year when most of those loans were sold.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense increased $1.6 million, or 2%, to $68.5 million for the 2018 fiscal second quarter, compared to the same quarter in 2017. This increase was primarily caused by increases of $5.4 million in compensation expense and $1.7 million in legal and consulting expense, offset in part by decreases of $4.4 million in amortization expense and $2.0 million in total tax product expense. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to increased staffing to support the Company's growing business initiatives in consumer credit, the business to be conducted following the proposed acquisition of Crestmark, and other business units, along with the aforementioned payout of severance costs. The integration of EPS Financial and Specialty Consumer Services allowed the Company to gain some scale and cost savings in the tax services divisions this year, and the Company expects to gain further efficiencies during fiscal 2018. During the fiscal 2018 second quarter, the Company had $2.2 million of merger and acquisition related expenses. The Company expects additional intangible amortization expense of between $6 million and $10 million for fiscal year 2019, attributable to the proposed Crestmark acquisition, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The Company will provide an update after further analysis and valuation is completed. See Select Quarterly Expenses table for a breakdown of current anticipated select expenses for future quarters.\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $6.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.2%, compared to $8.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.7%, for the 2017 fiscal second quarter. Although net income before tax was $2.6 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 than the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the income tax expense and effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the provisions of the Tax Act, which lowered Meta’s statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% in fiscal year 2017 to 24.53% in fiscal year 2018.\nLoans\nTotal loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $353.9 million, or 31%, from $1.14 billion at March 31, 2017, to $1.49 billion at March 31, 2018. Among lending categories, this included a $212.4 million, or 45%, increase in commercial real estate loans from $473.1 million at March 31, 2017, to $685.5 million at March 31, 2018. Also contributing to the loan growth was a $99.2 million, or 54%, increase in consumer loans, $53.1 million of which was attributable to the purchased student loan portfolios and $43.9 million of which was attributable to refund advance loans, an increase in commercial insurance premium finance loans of $53.6 million, or 29%, from $187.0 million at March 31, 2017, to $240.6 million at March 31, 2018, and an increase in residential mortgage loans of $27.7 million, or 16%, from $178.3 million at March 31, 2017, to $206.0 million at March 31, 2018. The growth in net loans receivable from March 31, 2017, to March 31, 2018, was partially offset by a decrease of $39.1 million, or 40%, from $97.9 million to $58.8 million in total agricultural loans, which made up only 1.37% of total assets at March 31, 2018. Excluding the purchased student loan portfolios and refund advance loans, total loans receivable, net of allowance for loan losses, at March 31, 2018, would have increased $267.3 million, or 27%, compared to March 31, 2017. Community banking loans increased $208.2 million, or 26%, from $802.0 million at March 31, 2017, to $1.01 billion at March 31, 2018, even with the reduction in total agricultural loans of $39.1 million.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $18.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a provision for loan losses of $8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The provision was predominantly driven by an $18.1 million reserve related to tax services loans, which is higher than the previous year because the Company retained all tax advance loans originated during the 2018 tax season, as opposed to the previous year when most of those loans were sold.\nThe Company’s allowance for loan losses was $27.1 million, or 1.8% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to an allowance of $14.6 million, or 1.3% of total loans, at March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the additional provision expense related to tax services loans.\nCredit Quality\nMetaBank’s NPAs at March 31, 2018, were $36.1 million, representing 0.84% of total assets, compared to $5.0 million and 0.12% of total assets at March 31, 2017, and $37.9 million and 0.72% at September 30, 2017. The increase in NPAs from the comparable previous year period was primarily related to a large, well-collateralized agricultural loan relationship, with respect to which the Company took ownership of the properties serving as collateral upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and transferred the loans to foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets on January 2, 2018. If the properties are sold prior to the end of the agreed-upon receivership period set forth in the settlement agreement, as expected, the Company will be entitled to all principal, note interest, legal and other fees and expenses. After the receivership period ends, if the properties are not sold, the Company will be entitled to the fair value of the properties, which the Company believes to be significantly in excess of all principal, note interest, legal and other fees and expenses. The increase in NPAs as a percentage of total assets from September 30, 2017 to March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in total assets of $926.6 million, offset in part by the payment in full of a previously disclosed $7.0 million nonperforming agricultural loan relationship during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Payments segment had no NPAs at March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017, or September 30, 2017.\nInvestments\nInvestment securities and MBS decreased by $115.3 million, or 5%, to $2.31 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.42 billion at March 31, 2017. This included a decrease of $102.0 million in MBS and $13.3 million in investment securities.\nAverage TEY on the securities portfolio decreased six basis points to 3.18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from 3.24% in the same quarter of 2017. Overall TEY of other investment securities decreased by 23 basis points from 3.65% to 3.42% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act and a reduction of TEY due to the reduced overall tax rate. Average yields increased within MBS by 18 basis points to 2.56% in the second quarter of 2018 from 2.38% in the same quarter of 2017.\nAverage yields on asset backed securities increased to 4.41% in the second quarter of 2018 from 2.49% in the same quarter of 2017.\nThe TEY on the securities portfolio of 3.18% for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 reflects the lowered corporate prorated tax rate on the Company's tax-exempt municipal portfolio. Had corporate tax rates not changed due to the Tax Act, reported securities portfolio yield would have been 3.52%, and the TEY of investment securities would have been 3.90% at the previous corporate rate. The 3.42% overall TEY of other investment securities reflects the lowered corporate prorated tax rate.\nWhen comparing the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, average TEY on the securities portfolio increased by 25 basis points to 3.18% from 2.93%, investment securities TEY increased 19 basis points to 3.42% from 3.23%, and MBS increased 35 basis points to 2.56% from 2.21%.\nDuring the 2018 second fiscal quarter, the Company continued to execute its investment strategy of primarily purchasing U.S. Government-related securities and U.S. Government-related MBS, as well as AAA and AA rated non-bank qualified (NBQ) municipal bonds; however, the Company also continues to review opportunities to add other diverse, high-quality securities at attractive relative rates when opportunities arise. With the Company’s funding base being comprised of a large percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits, and even with the lower corporate tax rate, the TEY for these NBQ bonds is higher than a similar term investment in other investment categories of similar risk and higher than many other banks can realize on the same instruments due to the Company’s current cost of funds and its projected cost of funds if interest rates rise.\nDeposits, Other Borrowings and Other Liabilities\nTotal end-of-period deposits increased $468.3 million, or 16%, to $3.34 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.87 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in end-of-period deposits was primarily a result of increases in non-interest-bearing deposits of $213.7 million, or 8%, wholesale deposits of $159.2 million, or 726%, interest-bearing checking of $79.1 million, or 179%, and certificates of deposits of $10.5 million, or 17%.\nThe increase in wholesale deposits at March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily due to the Company utilizing those funds at advantageous rates when compared to the overnight borrowing rates, thereby lowering funding costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, wholesale deposits were primarily used to target strategic maturities related to our seasonal tax advance lending, and many of those deposits had matured by March 31, 2017.\nTotal average deposits for the fiscal 2018 second quarter decreased by $78.8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2017. Average non-interest-bearing deposits for the 2018 fiscal second quarter were up $143.6 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe average balance of total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was $4.17 billion for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.92 billion for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 7%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in total borrowings of $335.9 million and an increase in non-interest-bearing deposits of $143.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale deposits of $301.9 million.\nCapital Ratios\nThe Company and MetaBank remain above the federal regulatory minimum capital requirements to remain classified as well-capitalized institutions. Regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2018 are stated in the table below.\nThe tables below also include certain non-GAAP financial measures that are used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. Management reviews these measures along with other measures of capital as part of its financial analysis.\nRegulatory Capital Data (1)\nMinimum Requirement to Be Minimum Well Capitalized Requirement For Under Prompt Capital Adequacy Corrective Action At March 31, 2018 Company MetaBank Purposes Provisions Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.26 % 8.93 % 4.00 % 5.00 % Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 13.74 17.43 4.50 6.50 Tier 1 capital ratio 14.18 17.43 6.00 8.00 Total qualifying capital ratio 18.48 18.59 8.00 10.00 (1) Regulatory ratios are estimated.\nThe following table provides certain non-GAAP financial measures used to compute certain of the ratios included in the table above, as well as a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP:\nStandardized Approach (1) March 31, 2018 (Dollars in Thousands) Total equity Adjustments: $ 443,703 LESS: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities 95,262 LESS: Certain other intangible assets 47,724 LESS: Net deferred tax assets from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards — LESS: Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities (21,166 ) Common Equity Tier 1 (1) 321,882 Long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 1 10,310 LESS: Additional Tier 1 capital deductions — Total Tier 1 capital 332,192 Allowance for loan losses 27,285 Subordinated debentures (net of issuance costs) 73,418 Total qualifying capital 432,896 (1) Capital ratios were determined using the Basel III capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2015. Basel III revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum CET1 ratio; those changes are being fully phased in through the end of 2021.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of tangible common equity used in calculating tangible book value data.\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Dollars in Thousands) Total Stockholders' Equity $ 443,703 Less: Goodwill 98,723 Less: Intangible assets 47,724 Tangible common equity 297,256 Less: AOCI (21,166 ) Tangible common equity excluding AOCI 318,422 Due to the predictable, quarterly cyclicality of non-interest bearing deposits in connection with tax season business activity, management believes that a six-month capital calculation is a useful metric to monitor the Company’s overall capital management process. As such, MetaBank’s six-month average Tier 1 leverage ratio, Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and Total qualifying capital ratio as of March 31, 2018, were 9.58%, 16.72%, 16.72%, and 17.84%, respectively.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company and MetaBank may from time to time make written or oral “forward-looking statements,” including statements contained in this press release, the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Company’s reports to stockholders, and in other communications by the Company and MetaBank, which are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “may,” “hope,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “could,” “future,” or the negative of those terms, or other words of similar meaning or similar expressions.
