    "text": "Industry leaders to accelerate firm’s growth in potable reuse and advanced water treatment\nWALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Brown and Caldwell, a leading environmental engineering and construction firm, today announced the expansion of the firm’s water reuse practice with four key hires. The additions of Dr. Kati Bell, Melanie Holmer, Dr. Allegra da Silva, and Melissa Meeker will provide industry-recognized expertise to clients on a host of water and environmental challenges, further establishing Brown and Caldwell’s position as reuse and One Water leader.\nDr. Kati Bell has joined the firm as managing director of water strategy. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Bell has over 20 years of professional and research experience in water, wastewater, and reuse, most recently serving as global water reuse practice leader at Stantec. She is internationally-renowned for her applied research and innovation, advanced technical expertise, and thought leadership. Dr. Bell has extensive experience with the advancement of regulatory guidance, having served as project manager for the development of the most recent U.S. EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse. Current interests have her working with multidisciplinary teams to apply big data analytics to help clients implement more holistic approaches in water utility management.\nDr. Bell holds a doctorate in environmental engineering from Vanderbilt University, master’s degrees in civil engineering and biology from Tennessee Technological University, and a bachelor’s in biochemistry from the University of Dallas.\nMelanie Holmer joins Brown and Caldwell in the role of national water reuse leader. With 20 years’ experience in the planning, design, and construction of water supply and treatment facilities, Holmer’s expertise covers all aspects of drinking water, wastewater, stormwater, and reuse. Prior to her new role, she was Stantec's water reuse leader for California involved in high-profile reuse projects throughout the U.S., including the Pure Water San Diego program, an initiative to provide one-third of the area’s water supply locally by 2035. Based in Sacramento, California, Holmer sits on the Water Research Foundation's (WRF) Water Reuse Issue Area Team that sets the national research agenda for water reuse.\nShe holds a master’s degree in civil engineering from the University of Colorado and a bachelor’s in environmental engineering from California Polytechnic State University.\nWith an impressive water reuse career spanning 20 years, Dr. Allegra da Silva makes the move from Stantec where she held the title of water reuse practice leader for the Rocky Mountain region. In her new role as regional water reuse leader, the specialties she brings to Brown and Caldwell’s clients include water reuse, advanced treatment technology, policy development, feasibility studies, and research design and execution. Passionate about aligning engineering with policy, Dr. da Silva served as a technical author for the 2012 U.S. EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse, the 2017 U.S. EPA Potable Reuse Compendium, and the 2017 Water Environment Federation (WEF) Water Reuse Roadmap. She is on the WRF Water Reuse Issue Area Team and serves in project advisory roles for the foundation.\nResiding in Denver, Colorado, Dr. da Silva has a doctorate and master’s degree in environmental engineering from Yale University and a bachelor’s in chemical engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\nMelissa Meeker completes the assembly as she assumes the role of Rocky Mountain area leader based in Denver, Colorado. Bringing more than 25 years’ public, private, and non-profit sector experience, Meeker’s expertise covers public policy, regulation, and management, with a focus on resilient water supplies, ecosystem restoration, and policy development. Recently co-CEO of WRF, she was instrumental in facilitating the merging of the Water Environment and Reuse Foundation (WE&RF) and WRF to create a $700 million portfolio of water sector research funding. Before that, Meeker was CEO of WE&RF and the executive director of the WateReuse Research Foundation and the WateReuse Association. Being the executive director of the South Florida Water Management District, which provides flood protection and water supply for 7.7 million residents, is another standout feature of her impressive career.\nMeeker has a master’s degree in environmental resource management from the Florida Institute of Technology and a bachelor’s in marine biology from Palm Beach Atlantic University.\n“As our clients negotiate water supply shortages in the face of growing demand and climate change, reuse is an essential solution in water supply diversification,” said Brown and Caldwell Chief Technical Officer Cindy Paulson. “Our expanding One Water team is committed to the development of integrated water management, reuse, and advanced treatment for resilient and reliable water systems that support the economy, the environment, and our communities.”\nThe leadership, unparalleled knowledge and experience of these strategic hires will be a catalyst for Brown and Caldwell’s future growth strategy.\n“The recognized statures of Kati, Melanie, Allegra, and Melissa will continue to enhance Brown and Caldwell’s exceptional service and overall experience to clients while complementing our ability to innovate in this market and solve the most complex water-related and environmental challenges,” said Brown and Caldwell CEO Rich D’Amato. “These game-changing additions to our team reinforces our reputation as being the company of choice for the brightest minds in the industry.”\nAbout Brown and Caldwell\nHeadquartered in Walnut Creek, Calif., Brown and Caldwell is a full-service environmental engineering and construction firm with 45 offices and 1,500+ professionals across the country.
