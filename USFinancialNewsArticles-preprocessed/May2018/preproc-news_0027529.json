    "text": "Delivers Solid Total Revenue and Earnings Growth\nEnhanced Financial Flexibility Through Continued Deleveraging\nProvides Update to Fiscal Year 2018 Guidance\nNEW YORK, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Presidio, Inc. (NASDAQ:PSDO) (“Presidio” or the “Company”), a leading North American IT solutions provider delivering Cloud, Security and Digital Infrastructure solutions to middle-market customers, today announced its financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThree months ended Nine months ended (in $ millions, except per share data) March 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 % Chg March 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 % Chg Total Revenue $ 628.8 $ 665.1 5.8 % $ 2,088.3 $ 2,091.7 0.2 % Total Gross Margin $ 142.1 $ 139.4 (1.9 )% $ 433.6 $ 433.2 (0.1 )% Gross Margin % 22.6 % 21.0 % 20.8 % 20.7 % Net Income (loss) $ (15.0 ) $ 0.6 n.m. $ (6.0 ) $ 119.5 n.m.

Security solutions decreased 5.9% during the third quarter, reflecting that a number of very large orders in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 did not reoccur. However, Security solutions have increased 23.3% year-to-date, and we continue to see robust demand in this solution area. Cloud revenues declined during the third quarter, driven by the overall market softness experienced by our primary OEM in the space. We have seen double and triple digit growth in many of our other Cloud partners in both the private and public cloud space and remain bullish on this solutions area,” said Bob Cagnazzi, Chief Executive Officer of Presidio.\nCagnazzi continued, “Our third quarter results reflect a strong recovery from last quarter’s weakness in revenue, however, based on our performance year-to-date, we have revised our revenue guidance for the full year to low single digit growth. Our backlog continues to grow, increasing 19% year-over-year at the end of the third quarter from an increase of 13% at the end of the second quarter. This positive momentum has been driven by the highly beneficial long term trends of continued growth in multi-year contracted recurring revenue, which has increased 17% year-over-year, and larger, more complex projects which have elongated project delivery cycles. We remain optimistic about the fundamentals of our business and our ability to deliver mid-single digit growth over the medium term. In addition, the business continues to deliver consistent and strong free cash flow, which allows us to enhance our financial flexibility by improving our balance sheet to drive profitability.”\n“In early April, we acquired Red Sky Solutions, LLC, a fast growing solutions-driven company with a strong team that gives us an enhanced presence in the mountain states. This is consistent with our stated growth strategy of pursing complementary acquisitions. We are very excited to welcome the Red Sky team to Presidio,” Cagnazzi concluded.\n1 This financial measure is not based on U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section of this press release entitled \"About Non-GAAP and Pro Forma Financial Measures\" for additional information and to the attached reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\n2 This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain transactions. Please refer to the section of this press release entitled \"About Non-GAAP and Pro Forma Financial Measures\" for additional information and to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" for reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nFinancial Highlights for the Fiscal Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal Revenue increased $36.3 million, or 5.8%, to $665.1 million, compared to $628.8 million in the prior year period. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by delivery of orders that were in backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2018 into revenue, strong growth in Digital Infrastructure solutions, and a higher proportion of services as part of our solutions. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by continued weakness in sales to the federal government as compared to the prior year period, and the accelerating growth in our backlog orders believed to be firm which was 19% higher as of March 31, 2018, compared to the prior year period. The backlog growth included increasing demand for our public cloud solutions, managed services offerings and other recurring revenue projects, which highlights the transition of a growing component of our revenue that will be recognized over time.\nDigital Infrastructure revenue increased 13.9% to $479.0 million, compared to $420.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was led by substantial investments by our mid-market and government clients to support their multi-cloud projects.\nCloud revenue decreased 14.1% to $102.2 million, compared to $119.0 million in the prior year period, driven by the overall market softness experienced by our primary OEM in the space. In addition, we lapped a very strong third quarter fiscal 2017 where we achieved 52% growth driven by a number of large data center modernization projects that did not reoccur.\nSecurity revenue decreased 5.9% to $83.9 million, compared to $89.2 million in the prior year period. During the third quarter, we experienced strong demand for Security solutions in the form of client orders, but delays in delivering these solutions resulted in lower revenue recognition which drove the decline in Security revenue as compared to the prior year period. Total Gross Margin decreased $2.7 million, or 1.9%, to $139.4 million, compared to $142.1 million in the prior year period, driven by the contraction of Total Gross Margin as a percent of Total Revenue to 21.0% in the third quarter from 22.6% in the prior year period, partially offset by Total Revenue growth of 5.8%. Margin contraction was driven by the combination of lower margins on the delivery of product as part of our solutions, a decline in vendor incentive rebates, higher incentive compensation for our engineering resources, and continued investments to enhance the capabilities of our managed services offerings and cloud-related service offerings. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was passed, resulting in a significant impact to the Company’s provision for income taxes in the period. As we have a fiscal year ending on June 30, the impact will be realized over the next two fiscal years. The most significant changes to the Company’s accounting for income tax associated with Tax Reform included:\nthe reduction of our statutory federal tax rate for the year ending June 30, 2018 from 35.0% to 28.1% the reduction of our statutory federal tax rate for the year ending June 30, 2019 to 21.0%; and the revaluation of our deferred income tax liabilities as of December 22, 2017 based on the aforementioned tax rates. Net Income was $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million, or $(0.20) per diluted share, in the prior year period. The increase was comprised of the following:\nthe favorable impact of lower interest expense in the third quarter, attributable to (1) the redemption and retirement of senior and subordinated notes in connection with our March 2017 initial public offering, (2) the impact of the 2018 Refinancing (described below), and (3) the impact of voluntary prepayments of our term loan facility, lower transaction costs as compared to the prior year period, and the favorable impact of Tax Reform as described above. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.7 million, or 7.0%, to $49.0 million compared to $52.7 million for the prior year period, driven by gross margin percent contraction and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period benefited from lower incentive compensation to employees that did not reoccur in the current year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.4% as compared to 8.4% in the prior year period. Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income increased $0.1 million, or 0.4%, to $26.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $26.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the prior year period, driven by the favorable impact of Tax Reform and lower pro-forma interest expense.\nFinancial Highlights for the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal Revenue increased $3.4 million, or 0.2%, to $2,091.7 million, compared to $2,088.3 million in the prior year period. Total Revenue growth was negatively impacted by a decline in sales to the federal government, the impact of a higher proportion of our revenue being recognized over time, a 19% increase in backlog orders believed to be firm as of March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by the 23.3% growth of Security solutions and a higher proportion of services as part of our solutions. Our growth in backlog includes increasing demand for recurring revenue solutions such as public cloud and managed services offerings.\nDigital Infrastructure revenue decreased 1.9% to $1,466.9 million, compared to $1,495.5 million in the prior year period. Government clients, including federal as well as state and local governments, experienced the most pronounced decline in core infrastructure solutions.\nCloud revenue decreased 5.6% to $346.6 million, compared to $367.1 million in the prior year period, driven by a combination of overall market softness experienced by our primary OEM in the space, a very strong third quarter fiscal 2017 where we achieved 52% growth driven by a number of large data center modernization projects that did not reoccur, and the migration of clients to public cloud instances as part of a multi-cloud solution, where revenue is recognized over time.\nSecurity revenue increased 23.3% to $278.2 million, compared to $225.7 million in the prior year period as the continued disclosure of high-profile data security breaches by companies without sufficient security protection have driven strong demand for our security solutions. We have experienced broad-based growth across our portfolio of security services and technology partners driven by higher demand across all of our market segments particularly in the mid-market and large sector. Total Gross Margin decreased $0.4 million, or 0.1%, to $433.2 million, compared to $433.6 million in the prior year period. Total Gross Margin as a percent of Total Revenue contracted to 20.7% from 20.8% in the prior year period. The decline in total margins was driven by lower services margins as a percent of service revenue, mostly offset by higher product margins. Income tax benefit was $83.5 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $9.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by the $92.4 million tax benefit associated with the revaluation of our net deferred income tax liabilities using our new federal tax rate of 28.1% for the year ending June 30, 2018 as a result of Tax Reform. Net Income was $119.5 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $6.0 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, in the prior year period. We benefited from the following:\nthe impact of Tax Reform as described above, a decline in transaction costs, as compared to the prior year, and lower interest expense, attributable to (1) the redemption and retirement of senior and subordinated notes in connection with our March 2017 initial public offering, (2) the impact of the 2018 Refinancing, and (3) the impact of voluntary prepayments of our term loan facility. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, to $165.8 million, from $165.7 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.9%, or flat as compared to the prior year period. Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income increased $8.8 million, or 10.4%, to $93.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $84.4 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to the positive impact of Tax Reform and lower interest expense in the nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources and Free Cash Flow\nOn January 5, 2018, the Company completed certain refinancing transactions (the “2018 Refinancing”) consisting of: refinancing all $576.6 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding under our existing credit agreement (the “Existing Term Loans”) and borrowing $140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans, in each case with new term loans (the “New Term Loans”) under our existing credit agreement, which New Term Loans have an interest rate margin that is 0.50% lower than the interest margin applicable to the Existing Term Loans and a maturity date in 2024 (two years later than the maturity date of the Existing Term Loans); and applying the proceeds from the New Term Loans to (i) refinance all of the Existing Term Loans, (ii) redeem all of the $125.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of Presidio Holdings, Inc.'s 10.25% senior notes due 2023 (the “senior notes”), and (iii) pay the redemption premium on the senior notes, accrued and unpaid interest, and other fees and expenses payable in connection with the foregoing. Subsequent to the 2018 Refinancing, the Company voluntarily prepaid $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loans. This is consistent with our plan to reduce debt to target levels. As we approach our target debt levels we will look at all available options to efficiently deploy our cash, including further debt pay downs, additional tuck-in acquisitions, and other capital allocation priorities such as share repurchases or dividends. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $24.9 million, total long-term debt of $691.6 million comprised entirely of our term loan facility, and total net debt (defined as the total principal of debt outstanding, excluding discounts and issuance costs less cash and cash equivalents) of $666.7 million, representing 2.9x net total leverage (defined as total net debt divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA). For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated Free Cash Flow of $25.9 million, an increase of 47.2% or $8.3 million, compared to $17.6 million in the prior year period. The increase in Free Cash Flow was driven primarily by lower cash interest expense, partly offset by an increase in working capital primarily related to higher prepaid expenses, which includes higher prepaid income taxes and higher deferred product costs related to recurring revenue projects. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated Free Cash Flow of $74.5 million, an increase of 18.1% or $11.4 million, compared to $63.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in Free Cash Flow was driven by higher operating cash flow and higher Net Income in the period, mostly offset by the unfavorable impact of the timing of cash flows associated with the leasing business and higher prepaid income taxes in the current period as compared to the prior year period.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe have revised our outlook for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 as follows:\nTotal Revenue growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range; Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the high 7% range; Pro Forma Diluted EPS is expected to grow in the mid to high single-digit range; Net total leverage is expected to be 3.0x at the end of our fiscal year 2018, including the impact of the Red Sky acquisition.\nAbout Non-GAAP and Pro Forma Financial Measures\nOur management regularly monitors certain financial measures to track the progress of our business against internal goals and targets. In addition to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income, Pro Forma Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow (collectively, “non-GAAP measures,” as further described below) in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or revenue, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP and they include adjustments for items that may occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time.\nWe also adjust certain historical data on a pro forma basis following certain significant transactions. Specifically, we have provided a calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income to adjust our reported results for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 for:\nlower after-tax interest expense associated with the redemption and repurchase of notes as part of our IPO as if the IPO occurred on July 1, 2016; lower after-tax interest expense associated with the term loan repricing that occurred in January 2017 as if the repricing occurred on July 1, 2016; and lower after-tax interest expense associated with the redemption of the senior notes in connection with the 2018 Refinancing as if the redemption occurred on July 1, 2016.\nThe calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 includes adjustments for:\nlower after-tax interest expense associated with the redemption of the senior notes in connection with the 2018 Refinancing as if the redemption occurred on July 1, 2016; and lower after-tax interest expense associated with the term loan repricing as part of the 2018 Refinancing as if it occurred on July 1, 2017.\nPro Forma Adjusted Net Income is for illustrative and informational purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our financial condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions occurred on the dates indicated. Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income should not be considered representative of our future financial condition or results of operations.\nConference Call Information\nWe have scheduled a conference call for Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss our financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.
