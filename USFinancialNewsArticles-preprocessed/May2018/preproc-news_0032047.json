    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - An economics professor at a Milan University, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had been contacted by the leaders of the 5-Star Movement and the League about becoming the head of a coalition government.\n“I’ve been contacted by both parties to become prime minister, and I told them I was available,” Sapelli told Reuters. “I gave them one condition, that Domenico Siniscalco be economy minister.”\nGiuseppe Conte, a law professor, is another possible candidate for the premiership, Sapelli told Reuters. Siniscalco is an ex-economy minister who served under former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\nThe 5-Star Movement and League were near to a deal on Monday to form a coalition, though they had not announced their choice for prime minister. The parties are due to hold pivotal talks with the country’s president in the afternoon.\nReporting by Luca Trogni, writing by Steve Scherer in Rome\n ",
