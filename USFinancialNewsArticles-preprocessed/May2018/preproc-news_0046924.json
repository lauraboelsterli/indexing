    "text": "By Bloomberg 5:25 AM EDT\nChina will cut the import duty on passenger cars to 15%, boosting auto makers such as BMW and Ford Motor (f) just as the immediate threat of a trade war with the U.S. recedes .\nThe Finance Ministry said Tuesday the levy will be lowered effective July 1 from the current 25% that has been in place for more than a decade. Bloomberg News had reported last month that China was weighing proposals to reduce the car import levy to 10% or 15%.\nA reduction in import duty follows a truce between President Donald Trump’s administration and Chinese officials as they seek to defuse tensions and avert an all-out trade war. While the levy reduction could be claimed in some quarters as a concession to Trump and will be a boon to U.S. carmakers such as Tesla (tsla) , the move will also end up benefiting European and Asian manufacturers from Daimler (ddaif) to Toyota Motor (tm) .\nShares of Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors (ttm) and BMW (bmwyy) jumped on the news.\nTata Motors gained as much as 4.7% in Mumbai while BMW rose as much as 1.5% in Frankfurt. Daimler added as much as 1.3%.\nThe latest round of tariff easing is part of a flurry of policy announcements in recent months aimed at demonstrating China’s commitment to opening the economy — partly in response to the accusations of protectionism leveled by the Trump administration. Beijing has also pledged to slash ownership limits in the auto sector as well as in banking, and last November reduced import tariffs on almost 200 categories of consumer products.\nThe import duty on car parts will be reduced to 6%, the Finance Ministry said.\nChina announced May 18 that it would end its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into imports of U.S. sorghum, citing “public interest.” That move, coupled with recent steps including restarting a review of Qualcomm’s application to acquire NXP Semiconductors (nxpi) , signal a conciliatory stance from the Chinese side.\nPresident Trump retreated from imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods because of White House discord over trade strategy and concern about harming negotiations with North Korea, according to people briefed on the administration’s deliberations.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that the administration’s plan to impose tariffs had been suspended, and Trump said on Twitter on Monday that the Chinese had agreed to purchase unspecified amounts of American farm products. China’s Imports\nChina imported 1.22 million vehicles last year, or about 4.2% of the country’s total sales of about 28.9 million automobiles. At the Boao Forum in April, President Xi Jinping reiterated China’s commitment to reduce import tariffs on vehicles.\nOf the $51 billion of vehicle imports in 2017, about $13.5 billion came from North America including sales of models made there by non-U.S. manufacturers like BMW.\nChina imported 280,208 vehicles, or 10% of total imported automobiles, from the U.S. last year, according to China’s Passenger Car Association, an industry trade body.\nA duty cut would typically benefit luxury carmakers or manufacturers, like Tesla, that don’t have a local production site. Most automakers produce mass-market models in China.\nFor Tesla, a tariff cut will provide a boon until the company manages to set up local production. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company has been working with Shanghai’s government since last year to explore assembling cars in China. China’s announcement by Beijing that it will allow foreign new-energy vehicle makers to fully own auto factories as early as this year removed the primary hurdle in the way of founder and billionaire Elon Musk.\nLuxury sales leader Audi, part of Volkswagen, has been making cars in China since 1990s. General Motors Co.’s Cadillac, which has relegated Lexus to fifth in the luxury-car rankings, opened a factory in Shanghai in 2016.\nHigh-end autos will feel the effects of a tariff cut because less of their production has moved locally. For example, Toyota’s Lexus would benefit as the only premium Japanese marque that doesn’t manufacture in China or hasn’t announced plans to do so.\nForeign carmakers have long pleaded for freer access to China’s auto market, while its own manufacturers are expanding abroad. In April, China announced a timetable to permit foreign automakers to own more than 50% of local ventures. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
