An anti-Brexit protester waves EU and Union flags and holds up a placard opposite the Houses of Parliament, on a sunny day in London, Britain, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nIn a presentation entitled “Framework for the UK-EU Security Partnership, Britain outlined its plan for a new internal security treaty that would maintain levels of cooperation, including through EU agencies, and data-driven law enforcement.\nhere\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has long said she wants the closest possible security ties with the EU, arguing that it would only reduce the continent’s safety if established organisations and communication lines were broken or weakened.\nEU political leaders are keen on keeping the closest possible security relations with London, one of the world’s leading powers in intelligence and crime-fighting.\nBut the European Commission, which is negotiating for governments, says EU rules do not allow such access for non-members.\nHighlighting its use of various EU measures, such as the European arrest warrant and Britain’s participation in the EU police agency Europol, Britain said it wanted a security partnership that would maintain and strengthen “our ability to meet the ever evolving threats we both face”.\n“Our assessment and engagement suggests there are no insurmountable legal barriers to our proposal,” the document said.\nBritain plans to leave the EU on March 29, 2019.
