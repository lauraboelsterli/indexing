She joined Progressive's Board in 2009, and has served as Lead Independent Director for the past two years. Fitt is a Retired Partner and Managing Director with Goldman Sachs. Progressive is currently the only publicly-traded Fortune 500 company with two women in its top leadership roles – CEO and Chairperson. As previously announced, Progressive Chairman Glenn Renwick has retired from the Board.\n\"I want to thank Glenn for his service to Progressive, as well as his friendship and mentorship, and wish him well in retirement,\" said CEO Tricia Griffith. \"And I want to congratulate Lawton on being elected Chairperson of the Board of Directors.
