    "text": "NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES\nCALGARY, Alberta, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- High Mountain Capital Corporation (the “ Corporation ”) (TSXV:BUZD.P) is pleased to announce that it has successfully completed its initial public offering of 3,500,000 common shares of the Corporation (“ Common Shares ”) at a price of $0.10 per Common Share for gross proceeds of $350,000 (the “ Offering ”). After completion of the Offering, the Corporation now has 5,700,000 Common Shares issued and outstanding.\nHaywood Securities Inc. (the “ Agent ”) acted as the agent for the Offering and in connection therewith, the Corporation granted the Agent non-transferable warrants (the “ Agent’s Warrants ”) which entitle the Agent to purchase up to 350,000 Common Shares at an exercise price $0.10 per Common Share. The Agent’s Warrants will expire 24 months from the date the Common Shares were listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “ Exchange ”), which was May 30, 2018. In connection with the Offering, the Agent also received a cash commission equal to 10% of the gross proceeds of the Offering, a corporate finance fee and was reimbursed for its legal fees and reasonable expenses.\nConcurrent with the closing of the Offering, the Corporation also granted options to acquire an aggregate of 570,000 Common Shares at an exercise price of $0.10 per Common Share to directors and officers of the Corporation, which options expire ten years from the date of grant.\nThe Corporation is a “capital pool company” and intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to identify and evaluate assets or businesses for acquisition with a view to completing a “Qualifying Transaction” under the policies of the Exchange. On May 28, 2018, the Exchange issued a bulletin listing the Common Shares as of market open on May 30, 2018 and immediately halting trading pending completion of closing (the “ Exchange Bulletin ”). The Corporation expects that the Common Shares will resume trading under the trading symbol “ BUZD.P ” on or about June 1, 2018.\nInvestors are cautioned that trading in the securities of a capital pool company should be considered highly speculative.\nFor further information, please contact:\nHigh Mountain Capital Corporation\nBill Kanters – President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\nPhone: (403) 619-7118\nForward-Looking Information Cautionary Statement\nCertain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking information.
