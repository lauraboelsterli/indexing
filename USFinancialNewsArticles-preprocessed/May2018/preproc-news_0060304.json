Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nThe EU’s new data-privacy rules leave unclear how information given to whistleblower hotlines should be handled. Heline Vanbeselaere/Zuma Press Good morning. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation that took effect last week left unclear exactly how companies should handle tips that come in from whistleblower hotlines. The stakes are high, Risk & Compliance Journal’s Henry Cutter reports .\nData submitted to whistleblower hotlines may contain sensitive allegations about corporate staff or management, but GDPR left gray areas about how the rules will work in different countries, the scale of penalties for a given violation, and even how to balance individuals’ rights against corporations’ needs, said privacy and compliance experts.\n“It’s a much steeper set of penalties associated with getting it wrong,” said Hilary Wandall, a former chief data-privacy officer at Merck & Co., who is now the head of data governance at TrustArc, a privacy-technology company. Fines can reach 4% of a firm’s annual revenue for certain violations.\nTwenty-eight national agencies will be in charge of enforcement. The regulation allows each country to spell out how the rules will work within its borders on a variety of fronts.\nThe national systems are expected to be similar but differences are likely, leaving it unclear what companies can expect, said John Wilson, chief executive officer at Expolink, a U.K.-based hotline-services company.\nWhat penalties companies should expect for what types of noncompliance—and what areas national authorities will focus on—is another area of uncertainty, said Shon Ramey, general counsel at Navex Global Inc., a compliance-software company that operates whistleblower hotlines for companies.\nFirms will be watching the first enforcement actions to see how seriously each national regulator takes different cases of noncompliance, he said.\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to Bayer AG ’s acquisition of Monsanto Co. after requiring the German company to sell about $9 billion in assets to preserve competition. The Bayer assets are being sold to chemicals rival BASF SE , WSJ reports.\nGermany’s Bayer, a pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate, is a leading player in the pesticide industry. JASPER JUINEN/BLOOMBERG NEWS Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens said he would resign as state lawmakers weighed his impeachment amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign-finance violations. The governor denied breaking any laws but said multiple investigations by prosecutors and lawmakers had taken a toll, WSJ reports.\nThe booming business of online dating faces new risks from a law designed to prevent sex trafficking and prostitution. The law, which holds digital platforms responsible for encouraging such illicit behavior, is creating uncertainty about liability across social media, WSJ reports.\nDATA SECURITY\nThousands of information-security jobs are going unfilled as the industry in the U.S. struggles with a shortage of properly trained professionals. Median starting salary for a data-security analyst is $121,000, according to a survey by Robert Half International Inc. , WSJ reports.\nSeveral firms have lost more than $100 million in revenue over the past year due to an often overlooked issue : outdated software. The WannaCry attack in May 2017, the NotPetya attack a month later and the breach at Equifax Inc. in September show how hard it can be to stay on top of security updates, WSJ reports.\nGOVERNANCE\nAt least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10% for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a WSJ analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows. Many changes are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders.\nREPUTATION\nWalt Disney Co. ’s ABC canceled the sitcom “Roseanne” on Tuesday after its star sent a racist tweet about a top aide of former President Barack Obama, a stunning end for a show that had become the centerpiece of the network’s prime-time schedule. Ms. Barr apologized for her tweet, WSJ reports.\nA Tesla Inc. Model S hit an unoccupied, parked police vehicle in Laguna Beach, Calif., on Tuesday. Police said the driver, who suffered minor injuries, told investigators the Tesla was in “Autopilot” mode at the time, Reuters reports. Tesla said Autopilot doesn’t prevent all accidents.\nRISK\nThe White House’s surprise decision to move forward with tariffs and other sanctions against China threatens to derail talks this weekend, WSJ reports. If preliminary talks fail to make progress, a visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Saturday could be canceled.\nOPERATIONS\nTrain conductors and engineers went on strike at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Tuesday night, stranding large volumes of commodities and manufactured goods, WSJ reports. Commodity producers experienced significant delays over the winter as railroads struggled to keep up with a surge in demand for commodities.\nSTRATEGY\nMGM Resorts International is buying a harness-racing track and casino outside New York City for about $605 million, helping the gambling-venue owner’s to expand on the East Coast. MGM will acquire the Empire City Casino in Yonkers, N.Y., from the Rooney family, WSJ reports.\nMGM Resorts International is buying the Empire City Casino in Yonkers, N.Y., just outside of New York City PHOTO: MARK ABRAMSON FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Managed-care company WellCare Health Plans Inc. has reached a deal to buy Meridian , which operates a pharmacy-benefit manager and health plans in Illinois and Michigan, for $2.5 billion. The purchase is the latest in a string of insurance-sector deals in recent months, WSJ reports.\nMarketing firm Didit is close to acquiring Gawker.com and hopes to relaunch the blog, only posting content it considers positive. Advisers liquidating the blog’s former publisher agreed to sell the website to Didit for $1.13 million, subject to higher offers at a potential auction, WSJ reports.\nFollow the WSJ Risk & Compliance Team on Twitter: @srubenfeld , @BenDiPietro1 , @henry_cutter , and @LikelyMara .\nSend complaints, comments and kudos to news editor Henry Cutter at henry.cutter@wsj.com .\nShare this: BASF Bayer Canadian Pacific Railway Didit Disney Gawker GDPR General Data Protection Regulation Greitens Meridian MGM Resorts International Missouri Monsanto online dating Risk Report Roseanne software Tesla WellCare Health Plans Previous Corruption Currents: Ivanka Trump Receives Trademarks Days Before ZTE Move Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte How Boards Can Help Strengthen the Link Between Strategy and Risk Appetite Boards have worked steadily to enhance their oversight of both risk and the strategy developed by management by seeking more risk information, strengthening organizational risk governance, and, in some cases, supporting the appointment of CROs or forming board-level risk committees. Yet risks and challenges continue to multiply and evolve, and management must continually revise strategies in pursuit of organizational goals. Learn how boards are enhancing their risk oversight practices by clarifying and formally approving the organization’s risk appetite — the aggregate level of risk that management is willing to take in pursuit of its strategy.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
