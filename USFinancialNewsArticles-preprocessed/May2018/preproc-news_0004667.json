    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces it is investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Iconix Brand Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ICON) resulting from allegations that Iconix may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.\nOn May 3, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced that it had filed a subpoena enforcement action against Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter as part of an investigation of potential violations of the federal securities laws related to Iconix. According to the SEC, Iconix paid Jay-Z more than $200 million to acquire intangible assets associated with his Rocawear clothing label, only to write down $169 million of that investment in March 2016 and an additional $34 million in March 2018. The SEC’s application seeks Jay-Z’s testimony to inquire about, among other things, his joint ventures with Iconix. On this news, shares of Iconix fell more than $.05 per share or over 7.8% to close at $0.59 per share on May 3, 2018.\nRosen Law Firm is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by Iconix investors.
