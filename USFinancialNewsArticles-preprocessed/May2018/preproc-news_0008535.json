FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United v Arsenal - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - April 29, 2018 Manchester United's Ashley Young in action with Arsenal's Alex Iwobi REUTERS/Phil Noble\nThe 21-year-old Nigeria international played 90 minutes during Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday but Wenger said after the match Iwobi was struggling with a hamstring injury.\n“I believe it is very good. I am still being assessed but to me it is good and I will be okay,” Iwobi told Sky Sports.\n“We will have to wait and see but I believe I will be okay and fit (for Atletico).”\nArsenal goalkeeper David Ospina (rib) and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan (knee) are also doubtful for the trip to Madrid after picking up injuries at Old Trafford.\nThe north London club need a win at Atletico’s Wanda Metropolitano stadium to reach the final after the two teams played out a 1-1 draw at the Emirates last week.
