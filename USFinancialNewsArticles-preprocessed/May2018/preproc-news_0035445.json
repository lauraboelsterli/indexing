    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 12:13 PM / Updated 39 minutes ago Several killed, wounded in suicide bombing north of Baghdad Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBAGHDAD (Reuters) - Several people were killed or wounded north of Baghdad on Wednesday when a man wearing an explosive belt blew himself up in the middle of a group of people receiving condolences, Iraqi security services said.\nThe attack took place in the region of Tarmiya, 25 km (15 miles) north of Baghdad, they said.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet.\nIraq declared victory in December over Islamic State, which had seized control of nearly a third of the country in 2014, but it continues to carry out attacks and bombings in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq. The group claimed responsibility for a deadly gun attack near Tarmiya two weeks ago. Reporting by Maher Chmaytelli; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
