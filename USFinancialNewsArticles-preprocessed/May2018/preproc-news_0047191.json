The decrease of ore mined at the GC Mine was mainly due to the impact arising from a changeover of a mining contractor and lack of skilled miners in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018.\nHead grades were 98 g/t for silver, 1.5% for lead, and 2.8% for zinc in Fiscal 2018, compared to 94 g/t for silver, 1.4% for lead, and 2.8% for zinc in the prior year.\nThe GC Mine sold 603,000 ounces of silver, 6.8 million pounds of lead, and 13.4 million pounds of zinc in Fiscal 2018, compared to 564,000 ounces of silver, 7.1 million pounds of lead, and 12.4 million pounds of zinc sold in Fiscal 2017.\nTotal and cash mining costs at the GC Mine were $45.73 and $37.48 per tonne, respectively, in Fiscal 2018, compared to $40.03 and $32.10 per tonne, respectively, in Fiscal 2017. The increase in cash mining costs was mainly due to a $0.9 million increase in mining preparation costs resulting from more underground drilling expensed in Fiscal 2018.\nTotal and cash milling costs at the GC Mine were $19.17 and $15.72 per tonne, respectively, in Fiscal 2018, compared to $17.40 and $14.35 per tonne, respectively, in Fiscal 2017. The increase in milling costs was mainly due to higher raw material supply costs.\nCorrespondingly, cash production costs per tonne of ore processed in Fiscal 2018 at the GC Mine increased by 14% to $53.20 from $46.45 in the prior year due to the increase in both per tonne cash mining and milling costs.\nCash costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, at the GC Mine, was negative $12.37 in Fiscal 2018, compared to negative $6.64 in the prior year. The improvement was mainly due to a 45% increase in by-product credits, mainly arising from an 8% increase in zinc sold and a 32% and 50% increase in net realized lead and zinc selling prices, offset by a 4% decrease in lead sold. Sales from lead and zinc accounted for 76% of the total sales at the GC Mine in Fiscal 2018, and amounted to $21.2 million, an increase of $6.9 million, compared to $14.3 million in the prior year.\nAll-in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, in Fiscal 2018 at the GC Mine was negative $3.69 compared to $0.20 in the prior year. The improvement was mainly due to higher by-product credits achieved as discussed above.\nIn Fiscal 2018, approximately 21,717 m or $1.1 million of underground diamond drilling (Fiscal 2017 – 12,484 m or $0.8 million) and 15,811 m or $4.5 million of tunnelling (Fiscal 2017 – 14,690 m or $4.0 million) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the GC Mine. In addition, approximately 320 m or $0.3 million of horizontal tunnels, raises and declines (Fiscal 2017 – 1,721 m or $0.7 million) were completed and capitalized.\nii) Q4 Fiscal 2018 vs. Q4 Fiscal 2017\nIn Q4 Fiscal 2018, a total of 29,442 tonnes of ore were mined and 26,252 tonnes were milled at the GC Mine compared to 40,224 tonnes mined and 39,929 tonnes milled in Q4 Fiscal 2017.\nAverage head grades were 96 g/t for silver, 1.3% for lead, and 2.9% for zinc compared to 91 g/t for silver, 1.3% for lead, and 2.6% for zinc, respectively, in Q4 Fiscal 2017.\nMetals sold were approximately 63,000 ounces of silver, 0.7 million pounds of lead, and 1.5 million pounds of zinc, compared to 53,000 ounces of silver, 0.8 million pounds of lead, and 0.5 million pounds of zinc in Q4 Fiscal 2017.\nThe cash mining costs at the GC Mine was $45.92 per tonne, an increase of 21%, in Q4 Fiscal 2018, compared to $37.91 per tonne in Q4 Fiscal 2017. The increase in cash mining costs was mainly due to lower production output resulting in higher unit costs allocation.\nCorrespondingly, the cash milling costs at the GC Mine in Q4 Fiscal 2018 increased by 25% to $25.07 per tonne, compared to $20.06 per tonne in Q4 Fiscal 2017.\nCash costs per ounce of silver and all-in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by‐product credits, at the GC Mine, in Q4 Fiscal 2018, were negative $13.95 and negative $4.57, respectively, compared to negative $1.72 and $14.55 in Q4 Fiscal 2017. The improvement is mainly due to higher by-product credits achieved arising from a 225% increase in zinc metal sold along with a 34% and 48% increase, respectively, in lead and zinc realized selling prices.\nIn Q4 Fiscal 2018, approximately 3,464 m or $0.2 million of underground diamond drilling (Q4 Fiscal 2017 – 2,995 m or $0.2 million) and 1,526 m or $0.7 million of tunnelling (Q4 Fiscal 2017 – 2,714 m or $0.8 million) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the GC Mine. In addition, approximately 40 m or $0.1 million of horizontal tunnels, raises, and declines (Q4 Fiscal 2017 – 40 m or $0.1 million) were completed and capitalized.\nFull Milling Operations Resumed at Ying\nAs announced on April 16, milling operations at the Ying Mining District were temporarily suspended due to a spillage incident. On April 28, one floatation line of 1,000 tonnes per day at the No. 2 mill, using the No. 1 tailing storage facility resumed operation. On May 23, the No. 2 tailing storage facility resumed usage after the fifth overflow well was permanently plugged, and full mill operations resumed.\nMr. Guoliang Ma, P.Geo., Manager of Exploration and Resource of the Company, is the Qualified Person for Silvercorp under NI 43-101 and has reviewed and given consent to the technical information contained in this news release.\nThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for the corresponding period, which have been posted on SEDAR under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company's website at www.silvercorp.ca.
