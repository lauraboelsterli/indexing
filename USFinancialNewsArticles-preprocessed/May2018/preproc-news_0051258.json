    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 9:28 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago Indian state seeks permanent closure of Vedanta's copper smelter: officials Sudarshan Varadhan 3 Min Read\nTHOOTHUKUDI, India (Reuters) - India’s Tamil Nadu state said on Thursday that it was seeking a permanent closure of a big copper smelter run by London-listed Vedanta Resources after 13 people died in protests demanding the closure of the plant on environmental grounds. Charred vehicles are pictured near a government office, after at least 13 people were killed when police fired on protesters seeking closure of plant on environmental grounds in town of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Sudarshan Varadhan\n“The government’s position is very clear, it doesn’t want the plant to run,” said Sandeep Nanduri, the top official of the district where the plant is located, after a meeting with senior state government officials.\nOther state officials confirmed the government’s position.\nOn Tuesday, police opened fire on protesters demanding that the smelter in the port city of Thoothukudi be shut down. In all, 13 protesters have been killed this week.\nResidents and environmental activists say emissions from the plant, India’s second biggest, are polluting the air and water, affecting people’s health.

REUTERS/P.Ravikumar\nEarlier on Thursday, authorities cut the power to the smelter. The pollution control board of Tamil Nadu said the smelter, which was shut pending renewal of its operating license, was found last week to be preparing to resume production without permission.\nA company spokesman did not respond to a Reuters’ email seeking comment on Tamil Nadu’s closure plan and the allegation that it had been preparing to resume production without approvals.\nIn a statement late on Thursday, it said only that it was working with authorities to restore power to the plant, which has been offline since March 27.
