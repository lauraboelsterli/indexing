    "text": "0 COMMENTS Global stocks rose Thursday, recovering some of the ground lost amid the political upheaval in Europe early this week and as signals of Italian political risk in the bond market continued to recede.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.1% in European trading, with Italy’s FTSE MIB 0.9% higher.\nMore on Italy’s Political Crisis\nAnalysis: Italy Can Still Avert Disaster The Italian Crisis in Seven Charts Bill Gross Fund Takes Hit From Italy Italian government debt continued to rally sharply Thursday. Italy’s two-year government bond yields dropped to 1.13%, down from 1.763% Wednesday and 2.099% on Tuesday. Yields fall as prices rise.\nThe Euro Stoxx index, which includes only stocks in the eurozone, rose 0.2%. Eurozone banks were among the best-performing sectors, rising by 0.5%.\nS&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each flat Thursday after a rally in U.S. equities Wednesday .\nThe political impasse in Rome caused a sharp selloff in global markets early this week, following President Sergio Mattarella’s decision to block the formation of a euroskeptic coalition government and to ask ex-International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli to form a caretaker government.\nThe deadlock means that Italy’s voters may soon return to the polls.\n“Cotarelli is a credible, market-friendly prime minister, but the market clearly doubts that he will be a stabilizing force for long,” said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.\nThe Quirinal Palace, the Italian president’s residence, in Rome. Photo: riccardo antimiani/epa-efe/rex/s/EPA/Shutterstock The country’s benchmark 10-year bond yield was also lower, dropping to 2.74% from 3.019%.\nInvestors around the world were closely watching Italian political developments, particularly for any signs that the crisis could cause the country to leave the eurozone.\n“It doesn’t seem like something that’ll be resolved quickly, so I need to be comfortable that there isn’t too much of a risk to the rest of Europe,” said Nicole Kornitzer, portfolio manager at Buffalo Funds specializing in European equity investments for U.S. clients.\n“Any spillover into the international financial system, we’d have to keep paying attention to that and it could affect economic growth at least slightly, driven by the instability and uncertainty,” she said.\nEurozone inflation in May was slightly stronger than analysts expected, according to data out Thursday. Consumer prices rose by 1.9% on the year, with core consumer prices, which strip out volatile items like food and energy, rising 1.1%.\nNewsletter Sign-up The eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in April, from 8.6% in March.\nMost Asian markets rose Thursday, with China’s Shenzhen A-Share index rising 1.8%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 1.4% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.8%. Despite the rally, most Asian bourses recorded declines in May.\nIn foreign exchange markets, the euro continued to recover lost ground , rising 0.2% to $1.169 against the dollar, after falling to as low as $1.153 Tuesday.\n“We may now have a period of calm while investors await the latest attempt of the forming of a government and gauge the future policy path in the wake of the turmoil. The scope for further euro gains will likely be limited for now,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG.\nWrite to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com",
