    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 4:53 AM / a minute ago Toyota to ramp up hydrogen fuel cell vehicle sales around 2020 Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on Thursday said it plans to set up a facility to mass manufacture hydrogen fuel cell stacks, a key component of fuel cell vehicles, as it seeks to ramp up production of hydrogen-powered cars and expand their usage as a zero-emission alternative to gasoline vehicles. Employees of Toyota Motor Corp. work on the assembly line of Mirai fuel cell vehicle (FCV) at the company's Motomachi plant in Toyota, Aichi prefecture, Japan, May 17, 2018.

It is also constructing a dedicated line at the nearby Shimoyama plant to produce tanks for storing high-pressure hydrogen gas inside vehicles.\nToyota declined to give details about their latest investment in this technology, but said mass production of components will begin around 2020, enabling the company to meet its target for global annual fuel cell vehicle sales of more than 30,000 units, including passenger cars and buses.

The model starts at about 7.2 million yen ($65,807.51) in the Japan market.\nDue to its high cost and complexity of building its components, the Mirai is produced in small lots. Only around 5,300 units have been sold since its 2014 launch, a fraction of regular production models.\nMass manufacturing of the two components - hydrogen fuel cell stacks and hydrogen tanks - will enable Toyota to lower the price of FCEVs, and expand its fuel cell technology.\nHonda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) and Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) also manufacture fuel cell vehicles, while other automakers are also developing the technology. However, many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ), are focusing on all-battery electric cars as a solution to reduce vehicle emissions.\nToyota, which developed the Prius, the world’s first gasoline hybrid vehicle, sees hydrogen FCEVs as a zero-emission alternative, which requires less time to refuel compared with the time it takes recharge electric vehicle batteries.
