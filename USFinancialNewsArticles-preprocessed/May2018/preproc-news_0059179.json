We look forward to additional pipeline progress later this year, including the advancement of SRF373, targeting CD73, into clinical trials.”\nProgram Highlights:\nSRF231, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting CD47: In February 2018, Surface initiated a Phase I trial of SRF231. The multi-center, open-label Phase I trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of SRF231 in multiple ascending doses with the goal of establishing a recommended dose for further study. Following the dose escalation phase, the Company intends to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SRF231 in a targeted set of solid and hematologic malignancies. Initial clinical results from this trial are expected in the first half of 2019. Surface holds worldwide rights to SRF231. SRF373, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting CD73: An IND for SRF373 was sponsored and filed by Surface’s collaborator, Novartis, in February 2018. A Phase 1 trial is anticipated to begin later this year. SRF373 has been licensed on a worldwide basis by Novartis.\nSRF617, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting CD39: Surface recently identified a development candidate and has initiated IND-enabling studies for SRF617. Surface holds worldwide rights to SRF617. SRF388, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-27: Surface recently identified a development candidate and has initiated IND-enabling studies for SRF388. Novartis has the right to purchase an option to SRF388.\nCorporate Highlights:\nCompleted upsized initial public offering (IPO): In April 2018, Surface completed its IPO of 7,200,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share and a concurrent private placement of 766,666 shares of common stock to Novartis at the public offering price. Total gross proceeds to Surface were $119.5 million, or $108.7 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Received $45.0 million milestone payment from Novartis: In February 2018, Surface received an additional milestone payment of $45.0 million from Novartis related to SRF373.\nExpanded board of directors with the appointment of three industry and scientific leaders: Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D., former Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D for Bristol-Myers Squibb; Geoff McDonough, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Generation Bio; and Laurie Stelzer, Chief Financial Officer of Halozyme Therapeutics.\nExpanded management team: In April 2018, Bob Steininger joined Surface as Senior Vice President, CMC. He brings over three decades of biologics manufacturing experience. Previously, he was Director, Manufacturing Operations at Voyager Therapeutics, SVP of Manufacturing and Process Development at Acceleron Pharma and held multiple manufacturing roles of increasing responsibility at Millennium Pharmaceuticals (now Takeda) and Genetics Institute (now Pfizer).\nFinancial Results\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $93.8 million, compared to $63.3 million on December 31, 2017. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2018 did not include total net proceeds of approximately $108.7 million from the Company’s IPO and concurrent private placement completed in April 2018.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $11.1 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was largely due to expenditures associated with Surface’s advancing product pipeline, including increased R&D personnel costs associated with the growth of the Company. R&D expenses included $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense were $3.4 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was largely due to increased G&A personnel associated with the growth of the company and increased professional fees. G&A expenses included $0.5 million in stock-based compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, net income was $31.2 million, or $1.59 per share attributable to common shares outstanding basic or $1.05 per share attributable to common shares outstanding diluted compared to a net loss of $8.6 million, or $3.60 per share, for the same period in 2017. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the receipt of a $45 million milestone payment under the Novartis collaboration during the first quarter of 2018.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\nCertain statements set forth in this press release constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
