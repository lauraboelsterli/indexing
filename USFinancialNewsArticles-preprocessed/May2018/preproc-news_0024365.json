    "text": "It's no secret that buying a home for under US$1 million in the San Francisco Bay Area is a nearly impossible task. Case in point: Somebody has paid over US$900,000 for a burned-out home.\nThe one-story, single-family house at 1375 Bird Avenue in San Jose, California, was ravaged by fire two years ago. In photos, the structure appears dilapidated and held together with plywood.\nAccording to real-estate site Redfin and the Silicon Valley Business Journal, the home sold for US$938,000 in April â€” more than US$130,000 over the listing price of US$799,000.\nMore from the South China Morning Post:\nZTE ceases 'major operating activities' as seven-year ban on selling it US technology shuts down most of its operations\nChina bitcoin miner Canaan Creative ditches US for Hong Kong IPO",
