    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s far-right League leader Matteo Salvini said on Sunday that the coalition of his party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement should be able to name the ministers it wants.\nLeague party leader Matteo Salvini speaks at the media after a round of consultations with Italy's newly appointed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the Lower House in Rome, Italy, May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile Salvini’s comments came as Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte was meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to discuss the list of cabinet candidates the League/5-Star coalition is proposing.\nA source close to the coalition said on Sunday Mattarella had rejected the coalition’s nomination of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as Economy Minister.\n“If we have a minister who is not appreciated in Berlin it means he’s the right minister ... In Italy, Italians decide,” Salvini said.\n“In a democracy, if we are still in a democracy, there’s only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,” he said.\nReporting by Steve Scherer, writing by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
