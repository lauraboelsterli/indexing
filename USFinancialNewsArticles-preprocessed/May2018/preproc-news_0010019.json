    "text": "MELVILLE, N.Y. and DAVIDSON, N.C., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MSC INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CO. (NYSE: MSM) , a premier distributor of Metalworking and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) products and services to industrial customers throughout North America, has acquired All Integrated Solutions (AIS) from New York-based private equity firm High Road Capital Partners. AIS is a leading value-added distributor of industrial fasteners and components, MRO supplies and assembly tools based in Franksville, Wisconsin. The stock purchase transaction closed on April 30, 2018.\nAIS delivers production fasteners and custom tool and fastener solutions for use in the assembly of manufactured commercial and consumer products. The company's 135-plus associates serve customers in a region that includes Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and North Dakota. AIS's revenue in calendar 2017 was approximately $66 million.\nMSC plans to maintain AIS's operations, providing the company's customer base access to MSC's 1.5 million-plus product portfolio to support their full metalworking and MRO needs. Similarly, MSC will extend AIS's production fastener and vendor-managed inventory (VMI) solutions to MSC's manufacturing customers.\n\"AIS represents an exciting opportunity to advance MSC's growth plan. Its assembly and fastener products and specialists extend our expertise and fortify our experienced team of associates in delivering solutions to help customers solve their mission-critical challenges on the plant floor,\" said MSC president and chief executive officer Erik Gershwind. \"In addition, AIS also complements our robust Class C fastener offering and VMI solutions.\"\nRustom Jilla, MSC's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, \"This acquisition of AIS aligns very well with our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy, representing an exciting opportunity for MSC. The purchase price was roughly $86 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Inclusive of transaction and post-closing costs, we expect approximately 5 cents of EPS dilution in fiscal 2018, a roughly neutral impact on EPS in fiscal 2019 and steadily increasing accretion going forward.\"\nJim Ruetz, chief executive officer of AIS, added, \"MSC shares our passion for delivering high-touch, custom solutions that go well beyond ordering MRO and production products online. Both organizations make sure the right fasteners and supplies are available when our customers need them without fail.
