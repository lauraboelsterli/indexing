Reuters Good morning. Executives weighing a decision to expand overseas could learn many lessons from Ford Motor Co.’s experience in China. The Detroit auto maker’s $5 billion bet on the Middle Kingdom, the world’s biggest auto market, has yet to pay off, write the WSJ’s Christina Rogers and Trefor Moss.\nAs Ford added more models and expanded the number of dealerships across China, the country generated profits for the company. However, the car maker’s market share declined from the sixth-largest by passenger-car sales in China in 2014 to 18th place in the first three months of this year, according to research firm LMC Automotive. Analysts attribute the drop largely to Ford’s failure to innovate and customize its cars for technology-loving Chinese customers.\nFord’s China business posted a loss in the first quarter of 2018 as the company launched a new effort to turn its China unit around.

President Trump’s decision to reinstate Iranian sanctions could hit Boeing Co. and Airbus SE the hardest as the world’s largest plane makers signed more than $40 billion in combined deals with Iranian carriers. The sanctions also hamper a tentative effort by smaller European banks to plug the Middle Eastern country back into the global financial system.\nCorporate America is facing $4 trillion in refinancing. Companies will need to refinance roughly two-thirds of all their outstanding debt — around $4 trillion — at the same time as an expected uptick in interest rates will translate into higher borrowing costs, reports Bloomberg.\nZTE halted major operations following U.S. sales ban. Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp. said it halted major business operations, marking the deepest wound inflicted yet in the escalating trade rift between China and the U.S.\nU.S. drinkers abandon beer.

Chief Executive James Murdoch — arguing that they’re “substantial Tesla shareholders.”\nMeanwhile, a U.S. transportation-safety agency said it would begin examining the crash of a Tesla Model S car that killed two teenagers Tuesday evening, marking the fourth active federal probe involving the company’s vehicles.\nBlackRock courts young investors.
