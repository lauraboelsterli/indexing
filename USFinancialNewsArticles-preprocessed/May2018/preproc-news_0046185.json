Football Soccer - Mexican First Division Final Second Leg - Toluca v Santos Laguna - Nemesio Diez stadium, Toluca, Mexico May 20, 2018. Players of Santos Laguna celebrate after winning the Mexican First Division Final. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\nArgentine Julio Cesar Furch put Santos ahead after nine minutes but his countryman Gabriel Hauche brought things level for the home side in the 82nd minute.\nToluca laid siege on the Santos goal, even after Oscar Velazquez was sent off with seven minutes remaining, but they could not get the goal that would have forced the match into extra-time.\nThe title is one of two issued each year in Mexico, where the season is split in half - the Apertura and Clausura. It followed similar titles for the club from Torreon in 1996, 2001, 2008, 2012 and 2015. Reporting by Carlos Pacheco. Writing by Andrew Downie, editing by Nick Mulvenney",
