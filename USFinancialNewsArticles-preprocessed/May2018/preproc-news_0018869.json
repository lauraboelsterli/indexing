    "text": "nuclear deal@\n* Pullout would stoke Middle East strains\n* Iranians fear fresh U.S. sanctions, rial slumps\n* Critics say Trump pullout would hit N.Korea talks\n* End of deal would remove tough nuclear inspection regime (Adds Netanyahu, Bagheri, IAEA, North Korea)\nWASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will announce on Tuesday whether he will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal or stay in and work with European allies who have struggled to persuade him that it has halted Iran's nuclear ambitions.\nTrump has consistently threatened to pull out of the 2015 agreement because it does not address Iran's ballistic missile program or its role in wars in Syria and Yemen, and does not permanently prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.\nEuropean leaders have warned that a U.S. withdrawal would undo years of work that led to and sustained a landmark deal that has kept nuclear weapons out of Iran's hands\nBut a senior French official doubted Trump had taken heed of European concerns.\n\"I think in Washington it was quite clear the president was convinced that Trump was heading to a negative decision so we have been preparing more aggressively the hypotheses of a partial or total pullout\", the official said.\nTwo other European officials also said they expected Trump to pull out of the accord.\nSuch a move could ratchet up tensions in a region riven with interrelated wars, including the multi-layered conflict in Syria where Iran's presence has brought it into conflict with Israel.\nReflecting those strains, Iran's Armed Forces Chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri said Iran's military power would defuse any threat to Tehran, while accused Iran of deploying \"very dangerous weapons\" in Syria to threaten Israel.\nA decision to quit the deal could also rattle oil markets due to Iran's role as a major exporter, and critics say it could also harm Trump's efforts to reach a deal in nuclear talks with North Korea, a prospect he has dismissed.\n\"This deal ... is a factor of peace and stabilisation in a very eruptive region,\" French Defence Minister Florence Parly told RTL radio.\nTrump, in a tweet on Monday, said he would make the announcement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday.\nIran suggested its economy would not be hurt whatever happened, but its rial was near record lows against the dollar in the free market as Iranians tried to buy hard currency, fearing financial turmoil if Trump quits the deal.\n\"We are prepared for all scenarios. If America pulls out of the deal, our economy will not be impacted,\" central bank chief Valiollah Seif said on state television.\n'STAND ON OUR OWN FEET'\n\"One man in one country might create some problems for us for a few months, but we will overcome those problems,\" President Hassan Rouhani said. \"If we are under sanctions or not, we should stand on our own feet.\"\nA senior U.S. official close to the process said France, Germany and Britain had moved significantly to address Trump's concerns over the ballistic missile program, the terms under which international inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites and \"sunset\" clauses under which some terms of the deal expire.\nThe deal, negotiated during the administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program.\nTrump has called it the \"worst deal ever negotiated\" and he wants Britain, France and Germany - which also signed the pact along with Russia and China - to toughen up the terms.\nIn the past few weeks, Trump has consulted with leaders of all three countries. Still, European diplomats privately said they expected Trump to leave the agreement.\nTwo White House officials and a source familiar with the debate inside the administration said last week Trump had all but decided to pull out.\nUnder the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States committed to ease a series of U.S. sanctions on Iran and it has done so under \"waivers\" that effectively suspend them.\nWAIVERS\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano has said in Iran his agency had the world's most robust nuclear verification regime. If the deal were to fail it would be \"a great loss\".\nTrump has until Saturday to decide whether to extend the waivers or withdraw and reintroduce sanctions related to Iran's central bank and Iranian oil exports.\nThat would dissuade foreign companies from doing business with Iran because they could be subject to U.S. penalties.\nRouhani suggested on Monday that Iran might remain in the nuclear deal even if Trump abandons it and imposes sanctions. But he also warned that Tehran would fiercely resist U.S. efforts to limit its influence in the Middle East.\nThe Kremlin said on Tuesday a U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have harmful consequences.\nIsrael is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, although it neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons.\nFinancial markets are watching Trump's decision closely. On Tuesday, oil retreated from 3-1/2 year highs as investors waited for Trump's statement.\n(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed in Washington, Sybille de La Hamaide and John Irish in Paris, Parisa Hafezi in Ankara, Bozorgmehr Sharafedin in London, Andrew Torchia in Dubai, Writing by William Maclean, Editing by Janet Lawrence)",
