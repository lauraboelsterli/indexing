In the first quarter of 2018, the aggressive portfolio of Lingxi has beat 92% of equity funds and hybrid funds in terms of return\nMr. Zhiwei Zhao, Chairman and CEO of China Finance Online, commented, \"As we continued to ramp up our cloud-based software sales, our bottom line losses narrowed. After four quarters of streamlining our business units, our efficiency reached a new recent high. With the bulk of our investment in our cloud system and user interface completed, we will continue to improve operational efficiency and leverage our intelligent-finance driven fintech business to drive better economy of scale.\"\n\"We will continue to focus on fundamental operational measures to further strength our professional journalism and content quality. We strongly believe that our continued improvement on content will be recognized by more and more readers of financial market news,\"\n\"During the development and extension of our new product for the enterprise market, Genius Zhisheng, a cloud-based one-stop investment research platform for institutional investors, we continued to find new services scenarios. Our products and services draw interest from brokerage firms and wealth management advisors. As more potential users are partaking beta testing, we have started monetizing our products and services for enterprise market gradually,\" Mr. Zhao concluded.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenues were $13.3 million, compared with $8.7 million during the first quarter of 2017 and $13.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, revenues from financial services, the financial information and advisory business, and advertising services contributed 50%, 37% and 13% of the net revenues, respectively, compared with 62%, 33% and 5%, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2017.\nRevenues from financial services were $6.7 million, compared with $5.4 million during the first quarter of 2017 and $8.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues from financial services mainly represent equity brokerage services. The equity brokerage business grew 47.1% year-over-year and decreased 27.2% quarter-over-quarter.\nRevenues from the financial information and advisory business were $4.9 million, an increase of 72.7% from $2.8 million during the first quarter of 2017 and 69.2% from $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues from the financial information and advisory business were comprised of subscription services from individual and institutional customers. During the first quarter, subscription revenue from individual investors grew by 1314.3% year-over-year, mainly due to the increased subscription of the Company's cloud-based analytical tools among retail investors. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases of revenues from the financial information and advisory business were mainly due to the increase of subscription revenue from individual investors.\nRevenues from advertising were $1.7 million, compared with $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increased traffic to our site and readership recognition of our premium content also helped to elevate our advertising revenues.\nGross profit was $8.2 million, compared with $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 was 61.9%, compared with 46.4% in the first quarter of 2017 and 49.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross margin were mainly due to revenue mix changes associated with the growth of the financial information and advisory business, which carries a higher margin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.3 million, a decrease of 20.9% from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, and a decrease of 19.8% from $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were mainly attributable to more stringent expense control measures and streamlining operations.\nSales and marketing expenses were $6.2 million, a decrease of 25.2% from $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, and a decrease of 8.8% from $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were mainly attributable to the reduction in headcount and rental expenses associated with the terminated commodity brokerage operation.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.8 million, a decrease of 12.4% from $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and with no significant difference from $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to improved efficiency after the consolidation of the R&D team. The Company continues to maintain a team of senior software engineers, data scientists and capital market professionals to support further development in its fintech capabilities.\nTotal operating expenses were $13.3 million, a decrease of 20.8% from $16.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, and a decrease of 9.9% from $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were mainly due to improved operational efficiency and effective cost controls.\nLoss from operations was $5.0 million, compared with a loss from operations of $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a loss from operations of $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet loss attributable to China Finance Online was $5.2 million, compared with a net loss of $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFully diluted loss per American Depository Shares (\"ADS\") attributable to China Finance Online was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2018, compared with fully diluted loss per ADS of $0.51 for the first quarter of 2017 and fully diluted loss per ADS of $0.37 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Basic and diluted weighted average numbers of ADSs for the first quarter of 2018 were 22.8 million, compared with basic and diluted weighted average number of ADSs of 22.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Each ADS represents five ordinary shares of the Company.\nAs of March 31, 2018, total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were $24.7 million.\nRecent Developments\nLingxi Robo-Advisor recorded strong performance in first quarter of 2018\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company's Robo-Advisor product, Lingxi, posted an average return of 2.4% (an annualized return of 10.0%) with an average drawdown rate of 4.0% which significantly outperformed the Shanghai Composite Index in return with a significantly lower drawdown. According to China Finance Online's internal research, Lingxi's performance in the first quarter of 2018 also exceeded most of its peer products in the market for its better return with a lower drawdown. Even though experiencing several market fluctuations in the first quarter of 2018, one of the best-performing strategies by Lingxi produced an annualized return of 15.81%. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2018, the aggressive portfolio of Lingxi beats 92% of equity funds and hybrid funds in terms of return. Since its inception in late 2016, Lingxi provides Chinese middle-class retail investors with a wide array of investment combinations and personalized global asset allocations through Chinese domestic mutual funds.\nLingxi Platinum Product, which targets mass affluent investors in China, outperformed the average level of public Fund of Funds in return with a significantly lower drawdown in the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 China Finance Online Value Discovery Forum for Public Companies on Chinese Stock Markets\nIn order to leverage China Finance Online's market influence as the leading financial media in China and share its robust machine learning and research capability on public companies' value creation, in May 2018, the Company hosted the \"2018 Value Discovery Forum for Public Companies on Chinese Stock Markets\" in Chengdu.
