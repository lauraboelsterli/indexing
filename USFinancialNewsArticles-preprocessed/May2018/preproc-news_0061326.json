Global contagion is a risk, he said, with the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stocks index breaching key “technical” support levels.\nHardy recalled a promise made in 2012 by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep the euro intact.\n“If this continues for another couple of sessions, I think you will have to see some official (European) response. A ‘whatever it takes’ kind of moment,” he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 276.17 points, or 1.12 percent, to 24,476.92, the S&P 500 lost 22.03 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,699.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.84 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,415.02.\nShort-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared as much as 150 basis points to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in 26 years .\nThe euro dropped towards $1.15 for the first time this year, down 0.8 percent on the day. Against the Swiss franc , it fell to 1.15 francs.\nStocks in Milan slid 2.3 percent on the main index after a 2.1 percent fall on Monday. Bank shares slumped more than 4 percent after losing the same amount in the previous session, bruised by the sell-off in government bonds, a core part of bank portfolios.\nAdding to the uncertainty in Europe, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday.\nSpain’s bond-yield spread with Germany also went to its widest this year at 132 bps. Madrid’s IBEX bourse was down 2.2 percent.\nAsia flinched, too. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent. Chinese and Hong Kong shares ended 0.6 to 0.7 percent in the red.\nThe dollar was up against almost all major currencies except the safe-haven Japanese yen.\nThe U.S. currency is heading for its best month since late 2015 - a move that is hurting many emerging market countries that borrow in dollars.\n“The biggest contributor is fear of a euro zone crisis, and the spillover from that into demand for safe-haven currencies,” said Koon Chow, an FX strategist at UBP.\nPLAYING IT SAFE Away from Europe, the focus was on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship.\nAn aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to the city to meet the North Koreans.\nThe reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead even though President Donald Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details.\nItalian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli will see the President Sergio Mattarella at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT), the president’s office said in a statement.\nMattarella effectively vetoed a coalition government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and League party at the weekend. He has asked Cottarelli to form a stop-gap government to lead the country to early elections instead. Cottarelli is expected to announce his cabinet after the meeting.\nOIL UNDER PRESSURE Oil struggled to rebound to the near-four-year highs it set earlier in the month. Crude is under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil, even as U.S. output rises.\nThat has pushed the spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R to nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015 because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared with Brent.\nU.S. crude fell 1.87 percent to $66.61 per barrel and Brent was last at $75.42, up 0.13 percent on the day.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Swati Pandey in Sydney Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
