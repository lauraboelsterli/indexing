    "text": "MONTREAL, May 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Earth Alive Clean Technologies Inc. (CSE:EAC) (“ Earth Alive ” or the “ Company ”), a Canadian Clean-Tech company, developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art microbial technology-based products for sustainable agriculture and mining, is pleased to report its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This press release should be read in conjunction with Earth Alive’s financial statements for such quarter and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) which can be found on the Company’s website www.earthalivect.com and on SEDAR www.sedar.com . All amounts referred to are in Canadian dollars.\nFinancial Highlights from the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nSales of $453,730 compared to $133,303 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; Gross Margin of $217,996 (48%) compared to $19,371 (14.5%) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; Operating Loss of $486,244 and Net Loss of $607,519 for the quarter which includes the non cash financial expense of $121,275 incurred in connection with the convertible debentures outstanding; 63% of sales were generated by the Soil Activator, with Dr Marijane representing 20%, after less than one year on the market; and 67% of the sales were to repeat clients.\nKey Developments during the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nDr Marijane, the Company’s specially formulated cannabis biofertilizer which was launched in April 2017, is now distributed in Canada and the United States. It can be found online through US websites of Walmart, and the Home Depot. It is also available via Amazon in North America and Europe. Earth Alive’s EA1 Dust Supressant gained much attention when Earth Alive was invited to participate at the live event of #DisruptMining accelerator challenge at the Innovation Expo, during the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference held in Toronto this year, where the EA1 product made it to the semi finals. The Board of director’s international profile was strengthened with the nomination of Mr. Ousmane Paye in March of 2018. The court proceedings brought by the Corporation’s former CEO were settled, putting an end to all pending court proceedings. The former CEO subsequently sold all of his shareholdings in Earth Alive to several groups of investors.\n“We are pleased to report that sales for this first quarter of 2018 have already surpassed those for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales and operations are steadily improving and we are slowly building a customer base with 67% of the orders having come from existing customers that have tried and tested our products. Although, the slow rates of adoption for innovative products in the agricultural industry have been and continue to be an important challenge, moving forward, we are gaining an in-depth understanding of the process and we expect to build on these early adopters by adding industry leaders to our client base. Furthermore, we are excited by the renewed interest in the EA1 Dust Supressant following Earth Alive’s participation at the live event of #DisruptMining, during the PDAC, where Earth Alive had the unique opportunity to connect with a large audience of mining industry executives, many of whom where surprised by EA1’s simple, environmentally friendly solution to several challenges faced by today’s mining operations. We are and will continue to develop this market as well.” stated Michael Warren, the President & Chief Executive Officer.\nSubsequent Events\nIn April 2018, Earth Alive entered into a distribution agreement covering the United Kingdom, with The Growers Wholesale Ltd., a strategic long term partner that has committed to a minimum annual purchase of $200,000 during the initial twelve month period. The first sale of Earth Alive’s EA1 Dust Suppressant following our recent relaunch of the product, was made to a leading global mining group (Q2-2018) for trial purposes. Groupe Lune Rouge Inc. agreed to amend the terms of the subscription agreement entered into on October 11, 2017, in regards to their second tranche investment of up to $1M as part of the secured convertible debenture financing, to allow for draws in three equal tranches over the next twelve month period. A first convertible debenture in the principal amount of $333,000 has been issued on April 27, 2018. Mr. Steve Saviuk joined the Board of Directors in April of 2018, bringing extensive knowledge and experience in finance, venture capital investing as well as IP and licensing strategies to the Board.\nAbout Earth Alive Clean Technologies\nEarth Alive aims to be a key player in world markets of environmentally sustainable industrial solutions.
