    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 5:03 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago Irish women open up about abortion ahead of referendum Emily G Roe 4 Min Read\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - When posters with the words ‘Licence To Kill’ were put up in her neighbourhood in advance of Ireland’s referendum on abortion, Amy Callahan decided to share the story of travelling to Britain to terminate her pregnancy.\nCallahan, 35, and her partner Connor Upton were told 12 weeks into her pregnancy that the foetus had anencephaly, a rare condition that prevents the normal development of the brain. It meant the baby, who would have been their second child, would most likely die in utero or live for a matter of minutes.\nIn Ireland, where abortions are permitted only when the mother’s life is in danger, the couple could either wait until their baby’s heart stopped beating or go to Britain for an abortion, as more than 3,000 Irish women do each year.\n“I know that birth is not easy on a baby and the head is such an important part. I started to think about what would be the kindest thing that we could do and I didn’t think it was a pregnancy we were going to continue,” Callahan said in an interview in her home in North Dublin.\nCallahan and her husband told few people about that trip nearly a year ago.\nBut with a vote on whether to liberalise Ireland’s abortion regime due on May 25, she and scores of other women are sharing their stories on both sides of the issue on social media, at campaign launches and through media interviews.

She carried the baby to full term, instead.\n“My baby was born at 32 weeks, then she died. I got to take her home, spend time with her,” she said. Pro-Life and Pro-Choice posters are seen outside the home of Amy Callahan who received a fatal foetal diagnosis at 12 weeks into her pregnancy and travelled to Liverpool for a termination in Dublin, Ireland, May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nThe referendum - which would repeal a 1983 amendment to the constitution - is the first opportunity in 35 years to overhaul one of the world’s strictest abortion regimes in the once deeply Catholic country. A complete ban was lifted only five years ago.\nPolls show those in favour of change with a strong lead but one in five are still undecided.\nCallahan recalled her grief and exhaustion in the two weeks ahead of their appointment at the clinic in Liverpool.\nShe wondered how she would have explained things to her son, then one-and-a-half, had she carried the baby to full term, and how she would have responded to friends and colleagues when they asked about the progress of her pregnancy and when she was due.\n“It felt like we were abandoned by this country,” Callahan said. “We weren’t looked after here, we weren’t received with compassion at such a difficult time.\nThe referendum will mark almost a year to the day that Callahan and Upton returned to Dublin on May 23 with the ashes of their daughter, Nico, in their hand luggage.
