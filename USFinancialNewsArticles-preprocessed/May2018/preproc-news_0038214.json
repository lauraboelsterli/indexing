As of previous close, the Hang Seng climbed 2.38 percent this month. ** The top gainers among H-shares were CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd up 4.32 percent, followed by Huaneng Power International Inc gaining 3.22 percent and CGN Power Co Ltd up by 1.84 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were Tencent Holdings Ltd which was down 3.40 percent, New China Life Insurance Co Ltd which fell 3.1 percent and PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd down by 2.4 percent. ** About 1.62 billion Hang Seng index shares were traded, roughly 95.2 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 1.70 billion shares a day. The volume traded in the previous trading session was 1.85 billion. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 21.54 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng index was 12.63 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 3.1 percent.
