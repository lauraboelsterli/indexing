The data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nShares of Home Depot Inc slipped 2.5 percent in premarket trading the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores. Peer Lowe’s was down 1.8 percent.\nAt 7:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 77 points, or 0.31 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 5.75 points, or 0.21 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 19.75 points, or 0.28 percent.\nOil prices touched a 3-1/2-year high, supported by tight supply and prospects of restricted crude oil exports from Iran due to planned U.S. sanctions.\nHigher oil prices have boosted the market in the past few days.\nAmong stocks, Symantec rose 2.2 percent after the anti-virus maker’s bullish 2020 forecast eased concerns over the impact of an internal accounting probe.\nFord dipped 0.2 percent after Piper Jaffray cut its rating to “neutral” on the automaker’s shares.
