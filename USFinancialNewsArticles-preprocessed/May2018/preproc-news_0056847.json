Soccer Football - League Two Play-Off Final - Exeter City vs Coventry City - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 28, 2018 Coventry City celebrate after winning the League Two Play-Off Final Action Images/Matthew Childs\nCoventry, one of the founding members of the Premier League in the 1992-93 season, broke the deadlock just after half time when defender Jordan Willis curled a shot into the far corner.\nMidfielder Jordan Shipley doubled the lead for Mark Robins’ side with a first-time finish before Jack Grimmer scored a third. Kyle Edwards netted Exeter a consolation goal.\nCoventry, who lifted the 1987 FA Cup title, have been in a freefall since relegation from the Premier League after 34 years in the top-tier in 2001.\nThe victory hands them their first promotion from any division since 1967.
