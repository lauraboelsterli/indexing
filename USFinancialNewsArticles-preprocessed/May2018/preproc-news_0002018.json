    "text": "GreenPath’s fourth acquisition in a year will enhance financial well-being services for Montana and Idaho residents\nFARMINGTON HILLS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GreenPath Financial Wellness , a national nonprofit credit counseling and financial health organization, has acquired Rural Dynamics, Inc. (RDI) , a nonprofit credit counseling and financial advocacy organization based in Montana and Idaho.\nThis is the fourth addition to the GreenPath organization in the last 12 months. It’s part of a long-term growth strategy to support their mission to remix the American Dream so it works for everyone. GreenPath uses human-centered principles to guide people to make healthy financial choices that support their goals.\nRDI’s credit counseling and financial education services will continue under the GreenPath brand. Clients can expect the same local, in person service, in addition to expanded hours for telephone counseling and new technology tools through GreenPath. The charitable and community programs, such as the Tax Help Montana program, will continue to be provided under the RDI brand, as an affiliate of GreenPath.\n“This is an exciting affiliation, because it preserves access to important community services, and it offers the people of Montana and Idaho expanded access to services that strengthen their financial well-being,” says Kristen Holt, CEO, GreenPath Financial Wellness.\nLast year, GreenPath served more than 200,000 people nationally. Those from Montana and Idaho reduced more than $670,000 in household debt working with GreenPath.\n“For RDI, this affiliation makes perfect sense,” says Tom Jacobson, CEO, RDI. “Our missions are aligned – both are centered around empowering people to be financially informed, and both maintain strong partnerships with community and like-minded organizations.”\nIn addition to acquiring RDI, in the last 12 months GreenPath acquired Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County, California, Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Central Oklahoma, and completed a strategic affiliation with the Homeownership Preservation Foundation. These transactions have added 40 employees and 8 locations to the GreenPath footprint. The organization now has about 65 branch offices in 22 states.\nFor nearly 60 years, GreenPath Financial Wellness has provided counseling, education, housing and debt management services to guide people on their financial wellness journey throughout life. For more information, or for credit counseling assistance, contact greenpath.org or 800-550-1961.\nGreenPath Financial Wellness is a national nonprofit organization that provides financial counseling, education and products to empower people to lead financially healthy lives.
