    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former contractor for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency pleaded guilty on Friday for removing and retaining classified information from his government office and later lying about it to federal investigators, the Justice Department said.\nProsecutors for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of Virginia said that Reynaldo B. Regis, 53, of Fort Washington, Maryland, worked for the CIA from August 2006 through November 2016.\nThey alleged that Regis improperly searched classified databases and copied the information into personal notebooks, which he then took to his house.\nDuring a search of his home, FBI agents uncovered 60 notebooks, which prosecutors say contained “highly sensitive intelligence reports.”\nRegis’ attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment.\nIt was not immediately clear why Regis took the information, nor whether or not he intended to share it with anyone.\nWhen law enforcement agents interviewed Regis, he denied copying the information from the classified databases.\nHe will be sentenced on September 21.\nWhile he could face a maximum of five years, the sentences imposed under U.S. guidelines are typically less than the maximum.\nReporting by Sarah N. Lynch; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ",
