    "text": "Company Secures Several Contract Renewals\nOLATHE, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NIC Inc. (Nasdaq: EGOV), the dominant provider of digital government services, today announced net income of $15.5 million and earnings per share of 23 cents on total revenues of $86.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $14.0 million and earnings per share of 21 cents on total revenues of $83.2 million.\nQuarterly portal revenues were $80.8 million, a 5 percent increase over the first quarter of 2017. On a same-state basis, portal revenues increased 7 percent over the prior year quarter. Same-state, transaction-based revenues from Interactive Government Services (IGS) rose 10 percent over the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to higher volumes from a variety of services including income tax filings, driver’s license renewals, and business filings, among others. Same-state, transaction-based revenues from Driver History Records (DHR) were up 1 percent due mainly to higher transaction volumes in several states. Same-state portal software development revenues increased 27 percent, driven primarily by new time & materials projects deployed by the Company’s Indiana portal.\nSoftware & services revenues were $5.9 million in the current quarter, down 1 percent from the prior year quarter, driven by the previously announced loss of the City of Portland, Oregon, parking meter payment service beginning in the second quarter of 2017.\nQuarterly operating income decreased 2 percent to $20.6 million, and the Company’s operating income margin was 24 percent for the current quarter, down from 25 percent in the prior year quarter. This reflects ongoing investments in the Company’s citizen-centric Gov2Go ® national platform, and the enterprise licensing and permitting platform, in addition to the loss of revenue and profit contribution from the legacy Tennessee portal contract. As previously announced, the Company’s contract with the state of Tennessee expired March 31, 2017. First quarter 2017 revenues from the legacy Tennessee portal contract totaled $1.8 million.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate in the current quarter was 25 percent, down from 34 percent in the prior year quarter. The lower rate was attributable to favorable benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Results in the current quarter also include a tax deficit related to lower tax deductions from the vesting of restricted stock awards. This discrete tax item increased the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 1 percent, decreasing earnings per share for the current quarter by approximately 1 cent. Results in the prior year quarter reflect excess tax benefits from the vesting of restricted stock awards. This discrete tax item decreased the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 2 percent, increasing earnings per share for the prior year quarter by approximately 1 cent.\n“We kicked off the year with solid financial performance,” said Harry Herington, NIC Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “We launched several new services, and I would like to thank all of our government partners for working with us to advance digital government innovation.”\nOperational Highlights\nDuring the quarter, several NIC subsidiaries received contract extensions. The Company’s subsidiary, Kansas Information Consortium, LLC extended the base term of its contract with the state of Kansas through December 2022. The extension also includes two, two-year renewal options the state of Kansas may exercise to take the agreement through April 2026. In addition, Kentucky Interactive, LLC received a two-year contract extension from the Commonwealth of Kentucky taking its contract through August 2020. And, the Company’s subsidiary, Oklahoma Interactive, LLC received a one-year contract renewal from the state of Oklahoma extending its contract through March 2019.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast Details\nOn the April 30, 2018 call, the Company will discuss its 2018 first quarter financial and operational results, and answer questions from the investment community. The call may also include discussion of Company developments, and forward-looking and other material information about business and financial matters.\nDial-In Information\nMonday, April 30, 2018\n4:30 p.m. (EDT)\nCall bridge: 888-204-4610 (U.S. callers) or 719-325-2402 (international callers) Conference ID: 7713983 Call leaders: Harry Herington, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Steve Kovzan, Chief Financial Officer Robert Knapp, Chief Operating Officer Webcast Information\nTo sign in and listen: The Webcast system is available at https://www.egov.com/investor-relations .\nA replay of the Webcast will be available by visiting https://www.egov.com/investor-relations .\nAbout NIC\nNIC Inc.
