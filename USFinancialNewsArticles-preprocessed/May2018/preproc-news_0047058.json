    "text": "NEW YORK, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HoldCo Asset Management and its managed funds (collectively, \"HoldCo\") own 677,769 shares of common stock of Universal Corporation (\"Universal\", \"UVV\"), approximately 2.7% of its outstanding shares. On May 23, 2018, Universal announced, in part, that it was increasing its dividend by 36% and that it remained committed to its historical strategy of increasing the dividend every year (as has been the case for an impressive 47 consecutive years), that it had repurchased a significant amount of common stock during its fourth fiscal quarter, and that it expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders through future share repurchases (collectively, the \"Announcements\").\nHoldCo applauds these recent actions taken by UVV which satisfactorily address the most significant concerns raised by HoldCo in a draft presentation provided to senior management three months ago and a final version of the presentation (the \"Presentation\") provided to the board of directors two months ago. The Presentation, sent to the board of directors on March 29, 2018, conveyed HoldCo's view that the market price for UVV's common stock reflected an extreme undervaluation driven by four fixable problems, including those related to capital allocation, investor engagement, management and board incentives, and board oversight. In this same presentation, HoldCo proposed numerous actions to address these problems (the most important of which was a commitment by Universal to return all free cash flow to shareholders), stated its desire to reach a mutually agreeable resolution with the board, and stated that absent such a resolution HoldCo intended to nominate three directors to Universal's board at the 2018 annual meeting. A copy of the Presentation, parts of which have been redacted in the spirit of sensitivity and goodwill towards management and the board of Universal, and which has not been updated to account for recent developments, can be found at the following link:\nhttp://www.holdcoam.com/wp-content/uploads/UVV_Presentation_March_29_2018.pdf\n\"Universal's recent announcements demonstrate that management and the board are willing to listen to its shareholders and do the right thing, and it is no surprise to us that these announcements have already been embraced by the marketplace. While management still has more levers to pull as detailed in our presentation, this is a big step in the right direction,\" said Misha Zaitzeff, a member of HoldCo's general partner. Added Vik Ghei, also a member of HoldCo's general partner, \"In light of these positive announcements, HoldCo has determined that it will not launch a proxy contest at Universal's 2018 annual shareholder meeting.\"\nA simplified timeline of relevant events detailing HoldCo's involvement with Universal is provided below:\nBeginning in late 2017, HoldCo's flagship fund began purchasing shares of Universal's common stock. Following its purchase, HoldCo had multiple phone calls (and written exchanges) with Universal. On March 1, 2018, four HoldCo representatives met with certain members of Universal's senior management team in Virginia and walked Universal through a draft presentation detailing its concerns and suggestions regarding Universal. On March 29, 2018, HoldCo sent the Presentation to Universal's board of directors. On May 16, 2018, four HoldCo representatives met with two members of the board of directors in JP Morgan's offices in New York. On May 17, 2018, HoldCo was contacted by JP Morgan's Head of Shareholder Activism Defense, who had been retained by Universal. On May 23, 2018, Universal made the Announcements (as described above). On May 28, 2018, HoldCo notified Universal that, in light of Universal's Announcements, it had determined not to nominate directors to Universal's board at the 2018 annual meeting.\nAbout HoldCo Asset Management\nHoldCo Asset Management is an investment adviser located in New York City.
