    "text": "Mark Reynolds hit a tie-breaking, solo homer in the top of the ninth as the Washington Nationals rallied to defeat the Miami Marlins 4-1 on Saturday afternoon at Marlins Park.\nIt was the fifth homer of the season for Reynolds, who also cut down a would-be, go-ahead run in the eighth with a quick throw to the plate. The score was tied 1-1 at the time.\nMarlins closer Brad Ziegler (0-4) gave up the Reynolds homer and took the loss.\nThe Nationals have beaten the Marlins 10 straight times, tying a franchise record for consecutive wins against one opponent, a mark originally set against the San Diego Padres in 1994.\nNeither starting pitcher earned a decision.\nWei-Yin Chen allowed three hits, two walks and one run in 7 1/3 innings. It was the longest start by a Marlins pitcher this year.\nChen struck out six, including whiffing Nationals star Bryce Harper three times. Dating to last year, Chen has struck out Harper in five consecutive at-bats.\nA solo home run by Wilmer Difo in the eighth spoiled Chen’s bid for a shutout, tying the score 1-1.\nWashington’s Tanner Roark allowed just four hits, two walks and one run in seven innings.\nRoark fanned five batters, striking out the side in the fifth, and he threw 111 pitches in his fifth consecutive quality start.\nReliever Justin Miller, a 30-year-old right-hander, struck out the only batter he faced to earn the win in his first major-league appearance since 2016.\nBefore the game, the Marlins placed third baseman Martin Prado on the disabled list due to a hamstring injury. Miami moved shortstop Miguel Rojas to third to replace Prado. In addition, Miami recalled JT Riddle from Triple-A New Orleans and gave him the start at shortstop, his first major-league game since July 19.\nMiami opened the scoring in the fourth. J.T. Realmuto led off with a double and scored on Brian Anderson’s one-out single to right. It was the first opposite-field hit allowed by Roark all season.\nThe rally ended when Rojas bounced into a double play, a close call that withstood a video replay. Had the replay gone Miami’s way, the Marlins would have scored a second run.\nAs it was, Washington tied the score 1-1 in the eighth. On a 2-2 pitch, Difo pulled an outside, 85-mph slider for his third homer of the year as the ball struck the left-field foul pole.\nMiami had runners on second and third with one out in the eighth. But Justin Bour grounded to Reynolds, who threw home to nail Cameron Maybin. Starlin Castro then struck out to end the threat.\nIn the ninth, Reynolds hit his 390-foot homer on a 3-1 pitch. The Nationals added on with RBI singles by Matt Adams and Trea Turner.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
