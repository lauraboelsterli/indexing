Tokyo’s overall stock market slid 0.2 percent on Wednesday.\nThe results were affected by large one-off losses booked in the January-March quarter, including a 29 billion yen impairment loss on its stake in C.P. Pokphand Co. Ltd, a Hong-Kong listed agri-food company which faced falling pork prices due to China’s decision to cut imports.\nFor the year until the end of March 2019, Itochu forecast a record net profit of 450 billion yen, beating a mean estimate of 431 billion yen among 9 analysts.\nIt also forecast a record annual dividend of 74 yen per share for this year, up from 70 yen for the year just ended.\n“We are aiming at third consecutive year of record profit through expanding and evolving existing businesses as well as aggressively promoting next-generation businesses,” CEO Masahiro Okafuji said, pointing to projects using new technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).\n$1 = 109.7400 yen Reporting by Yuka Obayashi Editing by Joseph Radford and Sunil Nair\n ",
