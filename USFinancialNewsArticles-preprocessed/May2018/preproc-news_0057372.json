FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura attends a news conference after a meeting of the management board of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia local organising committee in Moscow, Russia, July 5, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Picture Supplied by Action Images\nThe 55-year-old Senegalese was the first woman to hold a senior role at FIFA when she took over from Jerome Valcke, who was sacked in January 2016 as part of the fall-out from the corruption scandal that rocked the organisation.\nSamoura said she had “broken the glass ceiling” in a “male-dominated organisation”, adding “they are used to me now”.\n“There are people who don’t think that a black woman should be leading the administration of FIFA. It’s sometimes as simple as that,” Samoura told the BBC.\n“It is something we are fighting on a daily basis on the pitch - I don’t want any racist person around me.\n“Nobody asks a man when he takes a position if he’s competent to do the job. They just assume that he can do the job.\n“For a woman to make her way up to the top - you need to prove every single day that you are the best fit for that position.” Writing by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney, editing by Greg Stutchbury",
