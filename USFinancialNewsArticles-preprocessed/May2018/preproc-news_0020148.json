(NASDAQ: HCKT), a global intellectual property-based strategic consultancy and leading enterprise benchmarking and best practices digital transformation firm, today announced its financial results for the first quarter, which ended on March 30, 2018.\nQ1 2018 net revenue was $67.5 million, up 4% from prior year. Q1 2018 gross revenue was $72.7 million, up 2% from prior year. The actual Q1 2018 reimbursable expense ratio on net revenue was 7.8% versus 9.8% from the prior year. Reimbursable expenses are project travel-related expenses passed through to a client with no associated margin.\nQ1 2018 pro forma diluted earnings per share were $0.26, up 13%, when compared to $0.23 for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma information is provided to enhance the understanding of the Company’s financial performance and is reconciled to the Company’s GAAP information in the accompanying tables.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.23 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.24 for the same period in the prior year. Income tax expense in Q1 2018 had a $0.02 unfavorable impact in GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nIn its recent meeting, the Company’s semi-annual dividend of $0.17 per share for its shareholders of record on June 29, 2018, to be paid on July 11, 2018.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s cash balances were $23.7 million. During the first quarter the Company utilized cash to repurchase 228 thousand shares of the Company’s common stock at an average price per share of $17.42 for a total of $4.0 million. At the end of the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s remaining stock purchase program authorization was $2.2 million. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $5.0 million increase in the Company’s share repurchase program.\n“We reported solid quarterly results as we started to see the initial benefits of our cloud and digital transformation focus,” stated Ted A. Fernandez, Chairman & CEO of the Hackett Group. “Additionally, we are seeing favorable reaction to our recently introduced Quantum Leap, Digital Transformation Platform and RPA offerings which digitize and leverage our unique Hackett Intellectual Property and highly differentiate our capabilities.”\nBased on the current economic outlook, the Company estimates total net revenue for the second quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $69.0 million and $71.0 million or gross revenue (inclusive of reimbursable expenses) to be in the range of $74.0 million and $76.0 million.

At the high end of guidance, pro forma diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2018 would increase 12%, when compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOther Highlights\nBest Practices Conference – More than 300 attendees joined The Hackett Group for its 2018 North American Best Practices Conference, “Unlocking Digital Value,” in Atlanta, from April 30 to May 2. Highlights of the conference included presentations by senior leadership from more than a dozen of the largest and most successful U.S. companies, each spotlighting their digital transformation efforts in finance, procurement, HR, IT, and other business services areas. Presenters included executives from: Becton, Dickinson and Company; Cargill; General Motors; Halyard Health; IBM; Mary Kay; MGM Resorts International; NCR; Pfizer; Rogers Communications Canada; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Verizon Communications; and WestRock. More than 20 executives from The Hackett Group also presented on the company’s latest research, analysis, and insights.\nIT Key Issues Research – New research from The Hackett Group found that support for enterprise analytics and development of IT talent are two top priority areas for CIOs in 2018, as companies seek to unlock the value of digital business. However, companies’ efforts to deploy and derive value from digital tools are likely to be handicapped by low capability maturity in these two key areas and a lack of initiative to improve over the coming year. The research also found that IT budgets are expected to rise by 1.8% in 2018. The research is available for complimentary download here: http://go.poweredbyhackett.com/keyit1801sm .\nHR Key Issues Research – New research from The Hackett Group found that despite another year of flat to decreasing budgets and headcounts, HR organizations are focused on helping their companies unlock the value of digital transformation this year. But while most HR executives recognize the future potential of digital technology to transform the enterprise as well as HR roles and operating models, less than half feel their organizations have the resources and capabilities in place to execute and support their company’s digital transformation strategy. The research also found that urgent shortfalls exist in HR’s ability to support critical goals, including developing executives who can lead in volatile environments and enabling business strategy execution. In addition, there are significant internal gaps, with limited ability to address some of the most critical development areas. On the upside, HR organizations are now targeting many of these same areas for improvement initiatives in 2018. The research is available for complimentary download here: http://go.poweredbyhackett.com/keyhr1801sm .\nFinance Key Issues Research – New research from The Hackett Group found that faster adoption of digital tools is critical if finance is to deliver on its key mandates in 2018 -- to help companies drive growth while holding down cost. Finance also faces significant budget constraints of its own in 2018, which can also be addressed in part through digital transformation, the research found. Unlocking the value of digital transformation is emerging as a strategic imperative for the enterprise in 2018, and The Hackett Group’s research identified four “must dos” for finance: balance investments to improve performance; improve analytics to better support the enterprise; leverage digital strategy to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and agility; and reshape the service delivery model to improve customer service and reduce cost. The research is available for complimentary download here: http://go.poweredbyhackett.com/keyfin1801sm .\nOn Tuesday, May 8, 2018 senior management will discuss first quarter results in a conference call at 5:00 P.M.

These non-GAAP results are provided to enhance the overall users' understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. The Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors and by excluding certain expenses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between quarters. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods. In addition, since the Company has historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, it believes the continued inclusion of non-GAAP results provides consistency in its financial reporting. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Hackett Group, Inc.
