Specifically, our middle school program covering multiple subjects and providing knowledge enhancement training services has experienced strong enrollment growth, reflecting our superior course design quality and teaching effectiveness. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we have entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire 90% equity shares of a renowned early childhood education provider in Shanghai, to spearhead our efforts to penetrate into pre-school tutoring market. We also made encouraging progress in our learning center network expansion outside the Shanghai area, with newly registered learning centers in Fuzhou and Shenzhen, which extends our presence to more provinces in China.\n\"In addition, at the end of this February, the Ministry of Education released a new policy that aims to further alleviate the study burden on primary school students. After the policy announcement, we conducted a comprehensive review of our teaching materials to ensure that our class contents meet regulatory requirements. It is worth mentioning that our strong teaching capabilities enable us to always provide students with different approaches to solutions using the knowledge within their grade level, instead of using the knowledge that should be taught at higher levels. Although we expect the new policy will have a short-term impact on the after-school education industry, we believe it will help to generate a more regulated market environment in the long run, which will benefit institutions like us with a strong understanding of education and student intellectual development paths. In the meantime, we have been actively shifting our operations to cover wider age groups and more subjects, with a goal of keeping our position and competitive edge in the evolving market.\"\nMs. Yi (Joanne) Zuo, Director and Chief Financial Officer of Four Seasons Education, commented, \"During the fourth quarter, our top-line was impacted by the behind-schedule application of the law on promotion of non-public schools, which caused the delayed opening of our new learning centers and postponed their enrollment processes. In December, the release of the new policy that imposes limitations on certain types of after-school academic-related competitions also negatively affected our enrollment in January and February. In addition, in compliance with the new policy, some of our courses were restricted to open enrollment to our existing students only, which further impacted our revenue growth.\n\"On the operating front, we incurred a substantial increase in our sales and marketing expenses, primarily driven by our student promotion expenses outside of the Shanghai area as well as our proactive efforts to build a business development team for our nationwide expansion. Also, during the fourth quarter, we launched our math lab program in cooperation with East China Normal University to further enhance our brand awareness and penetration into schools. Despite the additional expenses for these initiatives during the quarter, we believe the upfront investments in our team-building and cooperative programs will better position us to capture the tremendous opportunity in the after-school education market in China,\" Ms. Zuo concluded.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue increased by 40.0% to RMB67.2 million (US$10.6 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB48.0 million in the same period of last year, primarily due to tuition increases in regular programs, increased revenue contribution from the Ivy Program, revenue contribution from the small-class for regular programs, development of the middle school and non-math programs as well as the expansion of physical learning center network.\nCost of revenue increased by 41.8% to RMB29.5 million (US$4.7 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB20.8 million in the same period of last year, primarily attributable to costs associated with the increase in staff count as well as learning centers' rental, utilities and depreciation costs.\nGross profit increased by 38.6% to RMB37.7 million (US$6.0 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB27.2 million in the same period of last year. Gross margin was 56.1% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared with 56.6% in the same period of last year. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the expansion of new centers and faculty, which incurred certain upfront costs, as well as the discounts granted to students to promote the middle school and non-math programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 60.5% to RMB24.4 million (US$3.9 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB15.2 million in the same period of last year, primarily attributable to share-based compensation expenses of RMB5.7 million and professional services expenses of RMB2.6 million, as well as an increase in rental costs associated with the relocation of the Company's headquarters.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 96.8% to RMB11.5 million (US$1.8 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB5.8 million in the same period of last year, primarily due to the increase in headcount for sales and marketing and business development teams from 15 as of February 28, 2017 to 57 members as of February 28, 2018, and the increase in expenses related to promotional activities and share-based compensation expenses for sales and marketing staff.\nOperating income decreased by 71.1% to RMB1.8 million (US$0.3 million) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 from RMB6.1 million in the same period of last year.

Adjusted net margin was 13.4%, compared with 9.1% in the same period of last year.\nBasic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB0.09 (US$0.01) and RMB0.08 (US$0.01), respectively, compared with RMB0.09 and RMB0.09, respectively, for the same period of last year. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB0.22 (US$0.03) and RMB0.20 (US$0.03), respectively, compared with RMB0.13 and RMB0.13, respectively, for the same period of last year.\nCash and cash equivalents. As of February 28, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB583.3 million (US$92.2 million), an increase of 152.6% compared with RMB231.0 million as of February 28, 2017, primarily due to net proceeds of RMB594.6 million (US$89.7 million) from the Company's initial public offering. The increase was partially offset by an RMB122.1 million (US$20.0 million) dividend distribution and an investment of RMB158.2 million (US$25.0 million) in funds for more efficient cash management.\nShares Outstanding\nAs of May 16, 2018, the Company had a total of 24,026,591 ordinary shares outstanding, or 48,053,182 ADSs.

To present each of these non-GAAP measures, the Company excludes (i) share-based compensation expenses, and (ii) fair value change of warrants. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based expenses and fair value change of warrants that may not be indicative of the Company's operating performance from a cash perspective. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance and liquidity. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in the Company's financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges and fair value change of warrants that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nExchange Rate Information\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
