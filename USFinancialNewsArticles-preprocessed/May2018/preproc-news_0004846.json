    "text": "SEATTLE, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CTI BioPharma Corp. (NASDAQ:CTIC) ended March 31, 2018.\nIn March 2018, results from the Phase 3 PERSIST-2 clinical trial of pacritinib were published online in JAMA Oncology. The randomized, international, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of pacritinib at two dose levels, compared with best available therapy, which included ruxolitinib (a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor), in patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet counts ≤100 x 109/L).\nUpcoming Milestones\nIn the second quarter of 2018, the interim analysis of the PAC203 study of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis will be conducted by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Full top-line data from the study is expected in the first quarter of 2019. The Company expects to submit responses to the Day 120 List of Questions to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2018. Top-line results of the PIX306 Phase 3 trial of PIXUVRI in patients with aggressive B-cell or grade 3 follicular Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma are event-driven and are expected in the third quarter of 2018.\n\"We look forward to several important milestones over the next months, as we continue to make progress in the clinical development of pacritinib and PIXUVRI,\" said Adam R. Craig, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of CTI BioPharma. \"We also significantly strengthened our cash position during the first quarter of 2018, which will carry us through key clinical and regulatory milestones into 2020.\"\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $10.5 million compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in total revenues was primarily due to recognition of $10.0 million in milestone revenue from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. related to the achievement of a milestone for FDA approval of TRISENOX for first line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. We had no net product revenues of PIXUVRI for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in net product sales for the period in 2018 compared to 2017, was primarily related to the April 2017 expansion of the PIXUVRI agreement with Servier under which they have rights in all markets except the United States.\nGAAP operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.3 million compared to $19.3 million for the same period in 2017. Non-GAAP operating loss, which excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, for the first quarter of 2018, was $3.0 million compared to $17.5 million for the same period in 2017. Non-cash share-based compensation expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to a $10.0 million milestone revenue from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. as well as a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses related to personnel costs and legal fees. For information on CTI BioPharma's use of non-GAAP operating loss and a reconciliation of such measure to GAAP operating loss, see the section below titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.1 million, or ($0.08) per share, compared to $19.8 million, or ($0.71) per share, for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $104.6 million, compared to $43.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Information\nCTI BioPharma management will host a conference call to review its first quarter 2018 financial results and provide an update on business activities.

CTI BioPharma has a late-stage development pipeline, including pacritinib for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. CTI BioPharma is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCTI BioPharma has provided in this press release the historical non-GAAP financial measure of operating loss, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Due to varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the different GAAP accounting treatment of different award types that companies can use under ASC Topic 718, CTI BioPharma's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense can enhance management's and investors' comparison of CTI BioPharma's operating results over different periods of time as compared to the operating results of other companies.\nCTI BioPharma's use of a non-GAAP financial measure has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. One limitation is that CTI BioPharma's reported non-GAAP operating loss in 2018 results in the exclusion of a recurring expense, since CTI BioPharma expects that share-based compensation will continue to be a significant recurring expense in CTI BioPharma's business. A second limitation is that CTI BioPharma's methodology for calculating non-GAAP operating loss, which only excludes the component of share-based compensation, may differ from the methodology CTI BioPharma's peer companies utilize to the extent they report non-GAAP operating income or similarly titled measures. Accordingly, CTI BioPharma's non-GAAP operating loss may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are urged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of CTI BioPharma's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Act of 1995.
