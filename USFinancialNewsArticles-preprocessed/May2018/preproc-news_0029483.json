Soccer Football - Premier League - Newcastle United vs Chelsea - St James' Park, Newcastle, Britain - May 13, 2018 Chelsea's Victor Moses in action with Newcastle United's Jacob Murphy REUTERS/Scott Heppell\nNewcastle deservedly ended a run of four successive defeats under former Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez to earn a top-10 finish.\nDwight Gayle scored the opening goal in the first half and Spanish striker Ayoze Perez added the second and third after the break. Soccer Football - Premier League - Newcastle United vs Chelsea - St James' Park, Newcastle, Britain - May 13, 2018 Chelsea manager Antonio Conte REUTERS/Scott Heppell\nConte agreed his team had looked “less determined” than Newcastle.\n“At the start we lost every single ball,” he said. “To finish this way is not good. But if we didn’t have this will and desire, I’m the first person to answer (for it).”\nThe Italian was defiant about reports that he will leave in the close season.\n“I have a contract and I’m committed for this club,” he insisted.\nBenitez was delighted to finish on a high for his club’s supporters and make the top half of the table 12 months after coming up from the Championship.\n“When you have the fans behind the team all season, this is the best way to finish,” he told Sky Sports.\n“With good spells and bad spells through the season we are happy to finish 10th.” Reporting by Steve Tongue; Editing by Ian Chadband",
