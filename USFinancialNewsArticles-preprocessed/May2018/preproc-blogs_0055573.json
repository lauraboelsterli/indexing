    "text": "Be prepared to pay more for gas this Memorial Day weekend A record number of Americans are planning to travel this Memorial weekend, despite high gas prices. Gas prices average $2.97 per gallon nationally as of Friday. There are certain days and times you may want to avoid the roads and airports in major U.S. cities. Getty Images A woman fuels her SUV at an Exxon Mobile gas station in Chicago.\nIf you plan to hit the roads this Memorial Day weekend, get ready to pay a lot more at the pump.\nGas prices are poised to be the highest since 2014, according to travel organization AAA. Those prices averaged $2.97 per gallon as of Friday.\n\"Prices are nearly 60 cents more expensive than last year and will likely jump a few more pennies heading into Memorial Day weekend,\" said AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano. \"As nearly 37 million Americans travel by car this weekend, motorists will find gas for $3 or more at 25 percent of all gas stations across the country.\"\nThose costs are not likely to deter many travelers, Casselano said, many of whom booked their trips months in advance.\nA record number of Americans — more than 41.5 million — are expected to take to the roads, tarmacs and water on the weekend that traditionally kicks off summer, according to research released by AAA earlier this month.\nThat's the highest number of travelers in more than 12 years and about a 5 percent increase from last year. show chapters 6:21 PM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 01:12\nThe good news for air travelers is that fares have fallen 7 percent from last Memorial Day to an average of $168 for a round-trip flight for popular domestic routes, AAA said.\nA daily car rental will average $59, about 11 percent cheaper than last year and the lowest rate in the past four years.\nThe busiest day for travel over the holiday weekend is expected to be Friday.\nHere are the worst days and times to travel, according to global analytics company Inrix, which partnered with AAA for the study.
