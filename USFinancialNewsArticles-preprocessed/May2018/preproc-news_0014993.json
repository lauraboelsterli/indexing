    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 4:06 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Golf: Weary Kiradech tempers expectations at Players Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Florida (Reuters) - Kiradech Aphibarnrat is dealing with a major dose of jetlag as he prepares for what he hopes is a top-10 finish at this week’s Players Championship, he said at TPC Sawgrass on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand hits off the fourth tee during first round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nKiradech arrived in Florida late on Monday after playing in the unofficial Golf Sixes in England at the weekend.\n“I think my body is a little bit tired,” the world number 32 told Reuters after a long session on the range trying to work on shaping his irons shots. “I’m not playing great at the moment.”\nKiradech finished equal 44th at the U.S. Masters last month before taking a couple of weeks off to spend with his family.\nHe missed the cut two years ago in his previous appearance at the Players but said he felt better about the course after playing the front nine on Tuesday.\n“Last time I didn’t strike ball well,” he said.\n“I know the course better than last time. I know where to miss, where to get the ball in play.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
