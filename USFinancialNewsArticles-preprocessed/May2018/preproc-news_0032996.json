    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- bioAffinity Technologies, a privately held biomedical company advancing breakthrough cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, is pleased to welcome Peter S. Knight, founding partner of Generation Investment Management, to its Board of Directors.\nKnight and his partners, former Vice President Al Gore and David Blood, founded Generation Investment Management, a leading global sustainable investing firm with assets under management exceeding $18 billion. Until his retirement in December 2017, Knight oversaw the firm’s US business and participated in its philanthropic work and advocacy for sustainable capitalism. Prior to founding Generation, Knight was a Managing Director of Met West Financial, a California-based asset management company.\n“Peter’s experience and expertise is a tremendous asset as we move to commercialize bioAffinity’s non-invasive test for the early detection of lung cancer and develop other life-saving diagnostics and therapeutics,” said bioAffinity President and Chief Executive Officer Maria Zannes.\nKnight was general counsel of Medicis Pharmaceutical before opening a law practice which included the International Olympic Committee, the US Olympic Committee and numerous Fortune 500 companies as clients. He started his career at the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice and later served as Chief of Staff to Al Gore in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Knight also served in senior positions on four presidential campaigns, including campaign manager for President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign.\n“As our scientific team continues to push our technology platform forward, the Board is well positioned to provide the strategic leadership and support that will help us get to market with products that save lives by diagnosing and treating cancer,” said Board Chairman Steve Girgenti. “We are delighted to welcome Peter to the bioAffinity Board.”\nKnight has extensive board experience including serving as a Director for Medicis, Par Pharmaceutical, Entremed (Casi), Healthworld, Whitman Education, Comsat and the Schroder Mutual Fund Board complex. He currently serves on the Fund Boards of Generation Investment Management and on the Board of Gratitude Railroad. His philanthropic efforts include serving as Chair of the Climate Museum and the Board of the Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters, which supports the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine. He received a BA from Cornell University and a JD from the Georgetown Law School.\nAbout bioAffinity Technologies, Inc.\nbioAffinity Technologies, Inc.
