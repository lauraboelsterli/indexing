    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 11:00 AM / Updated 21 minutes ago Rugby-Cipriani offered last stool in the corner of last-chance saloon Mitch Phillips 4 Min Read\nLONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - There is no “I” in team but there are three in Danny Cipriani and that has always been the issue for a player whose ability should have earned him a century of England caps but whose attitude has left him invariably on the outside looking in.\nAfter a decade of being the best player but the worst team mate in every club he was involved in, Cipriani has been thrown an international lifeline by Eddie Jones, 10 years after blasting on to the scene as the future of English rugby.\nOn Thursday he was named in the England squad to tour South Africa next month, and though he faces a tough battle to force himself into the team and secure a slot in the World Cup squad, it is an opportunity he undoubtedly has the talent to take.\nHis ability, however, has never been an issue. It is everything else that he brings that has meant he has managed only 14 caps and four starts since being first picked by Brian Ashton as a 20-year-old.\nThe first weeks of his international career proved something of a template for everything that was to follow.\nSelected for his debut against Scotland in 2008 he was dropped that week after being photographed outside a nightclub in the early hours. After two appearances off the bench he made his first start against Ireland and was sensational. INTERNATIONAL WILDERNESS\nAfter the ruthlessly efficient Jonny Wilkinson years, England finally appeared to have a flyhalf with a creative talent to match anyone in the world.\nHowever, an horrific ankle injury kept him out of action for months and he was off the pace in his England return under new coach Martin Johnson in the 2008 November internationals - the last time he made an England start.\nHis celebrity lifestyle — the antithesis of Johnson’s outlook — and his ability to fall out with team mates and routinely question his coaches meant that the next few years saw him drifting from Wasps to Sale with a stint in Melbourne. Despite often lighting up his matches, he remained in the international wilderness.\nStuart Lancaster brought him in from the cold, though his few appearances were all off the bench, and though he was inspired in his last showing in a defeat by France in a 2015 World Cup warm-up, he never looked likely to make the tournament squad under a coach who ranked teamship and culture so highly.\n“I got man of the match after playing 17 minutes. It was one of the most ‘in-the-moment’ experiences I ever felt,” Cipriani said recently of that cameo.\n“We were down but I was sent on and we came back and almost won. But I knew they weren’t going to pick me for the World Cup. I guess he (Lancaster) felt it was a risk.” LAST CHANCE\nHaving returned to Wasps in 2016, Cipriani has been central to turning them into the most exciting attacking team in England and they are deservedly through to this season’s Premiership semi-finals.\nDespite that, Wasps have been happy to release him from the end of the season and there has hardly been a queue of teams jostling for his signature.\nJones, having shown little interest in Cipriani since his arrival three years ago, has decided to give him one more crack.\n“I’ve watched him play closely, he’s done some things I’ve asked him to do in games and he deserves an opportunity,” the Australian said on Thursday.\nWith Jones seemingly still unsure of his 10-12 combination and with a potential vacancy at fullback as Mike Brown struggles in an attacking capacity, Cipriani might just have a chance - his last chance - to force his way into the 2019 World Cup reckoning. “He’s got to prove he’s the best 10 in the squad, or the best 15,” Jones said.\nThe more pertinent challenge though is whether, at the age of 30 and with so many “lessons learned” Cipriani can finally find a way to operate alongside such ego-free personalities as Owen Farrell and Chris Robshaw without destroying the spirit and his own future at the same time.
