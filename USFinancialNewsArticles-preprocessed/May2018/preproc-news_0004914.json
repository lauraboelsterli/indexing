    "text": "MIGDAL HAEMEK, Israel, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Camtek Ltd. (NASDAQ: CAMT; TASE: CAMT), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights of the first quarter 2018\nRevenues were $27.3 million, up 29% year-over-year, ahead of the upper end of the previously-issued guidance range and highest ever semiconductor revenue; GAAP operating income was $3.6 million*, representing a 13.0% operating margin; non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 million, representing a 15.4% operating margin; and GAAP net income was $3.5 million*; non-GAAP net income was $4.2 million; up 182% and 211% year-over-year, respectively;\n(*) At the end of the first quarter of 2018 the Company decided to cease its efforts to utilize the remaining inventory and equipment related to its development of the functional inkjet technology (FIT) and recorded a one-time write off in the amount of $0.5 million, which is included only in the GAAP results. This has completed the shift of Camtek's business focus purely to semiconductors.\nForward Looking Guidance\nSecond quarter 2018 revenues are expected to be between $29-30 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 30% at the mid-point. Management continues to expect double-digit growth in revenues in 2018, with overall improvement in profitability margins.\nDividend Announcement\nCamtek's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.14 per share representing an aggregate distribution of approximately $5.0 million. The dividend will be paid on May 29, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of the NASDAQ Global Select Market on May 16, 2018.\nManagement Comment\nRafi Amit Camtek's CEO commented , \"We are proud to present a very strong start to 2018, ending the quarter with record backlog. Our financials have improved across the board, and we demonstrated strong operating and net margins. Our focus on the fastest growing segments of the semiconductors industry is paying off. We are seeing strong order momentum, especially for our newest and latest generation systems. This high level of demand for our products is broad, spanning all the regions in which we operate.\"\nContinued Mr. Amit , \"Earlier in the year we announced an order for multiple systems for front-end 2D Macro Inspection from a major Chinese manufacturer. This is in line with our strategy to penetrate new market segments such as macro inspection and special 2D applications, providing us with additional growth drivers. All this underlies our expectations of a strong year of growth and improved profitability. Our cash generation and strong balance sheet position us very well, enabling us to share the rewards of our growth with our shareholders, as well as providing us with an ability to capitalize on internal potential growth opportunities.\"\nThe financial results and the comparison to 2017 in this press release include only those of the continuing operations.\nFirst quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $27.3 million.
