The terminal would be served by a Permian Basin pipeline.\nThe company is currently evaluating several co-investment proposals and potential off-take agreements, Jupiter executive John Calce said. The projects won’t be completed until 2020 at the earliest, Calce said.\nU.S. crude exports have surged since Washington lifted a decades-old ban in late 2015, hitting a record 2.6 million barrels per day last week.\nLouisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately-owned crude terminal in the United States, and Enterprise Products Partners LP have both been testing crude supertanker capabilities over the past two months. Last year, Occidental Petroleum Corp’s Ingleside terminal at Corpus Christi test-loaded a supertanker.\nThe port of Brownsville is close to Texas’s Permian Basin and serves as a gateway of sorts into the Mexican fuel market.\nProduction in the Permian, the largest U.S. oilfield, has been the biggest driver of U.S. shale output and is expected to rise to a record 3.28 million bpd in June.\nIn 2017, Mexico was the destination for more than 1 million bpd of petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel, worth over $23 billion compared with 880,000 bpd in 2016.
