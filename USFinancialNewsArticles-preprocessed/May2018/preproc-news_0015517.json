Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, attends a conference about trade and globalization at the central bank of Brazil headquarters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo “The U.S. economic outlook looks pretty good,” he said at an event “The Financial Tumult of Our Times” sponsored by Bloomberg News, even in the wake of a weaker-than-forecast data on U.S. job and wage growth in April released by the Labor Department earlier Friday.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
