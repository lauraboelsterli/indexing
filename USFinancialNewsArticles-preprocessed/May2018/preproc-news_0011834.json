In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2018 dividend of $0.28 per common share payable on July 17, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of June 29, 2018.\n“We are off to a strong start to 2018 with our highest level of first quarter earnings in the Company’s history. Our quarterly GAAP earnings grew by more than 40% compared to a year ago driven by an increase of approximately $300 million in our weighted average outstanding interest earning investment portfolio, lower funding costs on our liabilities and the benefits of increases in LIBOR on our primarily senior floating rate loan strategy,” said Jamie Henderson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACRE. “We have grown our portfolio while continuing to be highly selective with a strong focus on credit quality, relative value and rigorous underwriting. With $167 million of new loan commitments closed year-to-date, we have successfully matched new originations with loan maturities. In addition, the breadth of our pipeline indicates that we are well positioned to further match anticipated repayments with new investments for the first half of the year.”\n“Going forward, we expect our higher capital utilization will enable us to generate greater stability in our earnings,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of ACRE. “In addition, since 99% of our loans are floating rate, the increase of approximately 90 basis points in one-month LIBOR over the last twelve months alone resulted in a $0.03 per share increase in our earnings for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. We are well positioned to benefit from further increases in interest rates, making us a strong hedge against potential increases in inflation.”\n(1) Core Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Schedule I for further details. THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFinancial Results and Activities:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, GAAP net income was $9.3 million or $0.33 per diluted common share and Core Earnings (1) was $9.6 million or $0.33 per diluted common share. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, new originations were $94.5 million in commitments and $74.1 million in outstanding principal funded at the origination date and an additional $3.2 million of fundings on existing commitments. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company exited $146.1 million of loans held for investment as measured by outstanding principal.\nCapital Activities:\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company exercised a 12-month extension option on the $50.0 million secured revolving funding facility with City National Bank (the “CNB Facility”) to extend the initial maturity date to March 10, 2019. The Company has one additional 12-month extension option, which, if exercised, would extend the maturity date of the CNB Facility to March 10, 2020.\nPORTFOLIO DETAIL AS OF MARCH 31, 2018\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s portfolio totaled 42 loans held for investment, totaling approximately $1.9 billion in originated commitments at closing and $1.7 billion in outstanding principal.

(2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by the Company as of March 31, 2018 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan.

Core Earnings is an adjusted non-GAAP measure that helps the Company evaluate its financial performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that it believes are not necessarily indicative of its current loan origination portfolio and operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of the Company’s target investments are structured as debt and the Company forecloses on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between the Company’s external manager and the Company’s independent directors and after approval by a majority of the Company’s independent directors.\nReconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core Earnings is set forth in the table below for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018 ($ in thousands):\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nFor the twelve\nmonths ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Amount Amount Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 9,318 $ 33,272 Stock-based compensation 234 717 Incentive fees to affiliate — 113 Early extinguishment of debt costs (1) — 768 Core Earnings $ 9,552 $ 34,870",
