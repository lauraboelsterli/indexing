    "text": "OSLO, May 25 (Reuters) - The largest labour union representing workers on Norwegian offshore oil drilling rigs has agreed to a new wage deal, it said on Friday, averting the risk of a strike that could have hit exploration efforts later this year.\nIndustri Energi, which represents more than 4,000 drilling workers, said in a statement the deal would give members a “solid increase” in pay.\nIt was not immediately clear however if two smaller unions, Safe and DSO, had also agreed a deal with employers.\nCompanies drilling on behalf of oil firms in Norwegian waters include Transocean, Fred. Olsen Energy, Odfjell Drilling, Rowan Companies, Maersk Drilling and Seadrill.\nOil companies, including Equinor, Eni, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum rent rigs to search for hydrocarbon reserves off Norway.
