Chinnappa/File Photo\nBloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Flipkart’s board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion (11 billion pounds).\nWalmart is in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion, Reuters has previously reported.\nA third source told Reuters that while Flipkart’s board has “in-principle” approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved.\nSources have said that Amazon.com Inc has shown an interest in buying Flipkart, India’s top home-grown e-commerce firm, but a deal with Walmart is much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart’s biggest rival in India.\nThe first two sources said Alphabet Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan’s SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its stake as part of the deal if the price is right, another source said.\nFlipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.\nFlipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India’s online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester.\nBoth Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars to win shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion a year within a decade.\nEarlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer.
