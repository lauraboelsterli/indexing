    "text": "May 9 (Reuters) - MTN Group said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord may limit the South African telecoms firm’s ability to repatriate cash from MTN Irancell.\nTrump said on Tuesday he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the agreement he had harshly criticized.\nIn 2018, the company had repatriated about 88 million euros ($104.26 million) from MTN Irancell, including 61 million euros relating to the 2017 dividend due to MTN as well as a further 27 million euros of historic dividends.\nThe remaining balance due to MTN is about 200 million euros, MTN said, adding it was committed to its investment in Irancell and to repatriating the balance of legacy cash.\nThe company said it will continue to monitor the situation, including the response of the Iranian authorities and the other members of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
