    "text": "YEHUD, Israel, May 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Magal Security Systems, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAGS) today announced its financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Management will hold an investors' conference call later today (at 10am Eastern Time) to discuss the results.\nFirst Quarter Results Summary\nStrong growth in first quarter revenue to $17.3 million, up 20% year-over-year. Significant improvement in operating expenses: a 9% reduction year-over-year. Net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, an improvement compared with a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.16 per share last year. EBITDA of $0.5 million compared with negative EBITDA of $0.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Backlog at highest ever level as of end of the first quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $17.3 million, an increase of 20% compared with revenues of $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.6 million, or 43.8% of revenues, an increase of 2% compared with gross profit of $7.4 million or 51.7% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2017. The change in gross margin between the quarters was a function of the products and projects mix executed during the quarter.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $33 thousand, an improvement compared to an operating loss of $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA in the first quarter was $0.5 million, an improvement compared with negative EBITDA of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash, short term deposits and restricted deposits, net of bank debt, as of March 31, 2018, were $49.4 million, or $2.15 per share, compared with cash and short term deposits, net of bank debt, of $52.3 million, or $2.27 per share, at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash is primarily due to the investment in working capital for scaling up of various projects which are commencing.\nManagement Comment\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Yaniv Shachar, interim CEO of Magal , said, \"We are pleased with our return to growth and operating profitability, recovering from a weak 2017. The solid improvement in results, especially the lower level of expenses, follows important steps that we took last year to rationalize expenses and increase efficiencies. Looking ahead, the high level of new orders that Magal has won over the past few months has built a strong backlog, and as at the end of the first quarter, our backlog is the highest it has ever been in our history. This bodes very well for Magal in the coming year.\"\nContinued Mr. Shachar , \"In the coming weeks, Dror Sharon, a highly experienced homeland security industry veteran will be joining Magal as the new CEO. We thank Saar Koursh, our former CEO, for his key contributions to Magal throughout his tenure which culminated in the successful first quarter that we announced today. We wish him well in future.\"\nInvestors' Conference Call Information:\nThe Company will host a conference call later today, May 16, 2018, at 10am Eastern Time and 5pm Israel time.\nTo participate, please call one of the following teleconferencing numbers:\nUS: 1-888-281-1167; Israel: 03-918-0644; UK: 0-800-917-9141; Intl.: +972-3-918-0644\nIf you are unable to connect using the toll-free numbers, please try the international dial-in number.\nA replay of the call will be available on the Company's website for three months from the day after the call.
