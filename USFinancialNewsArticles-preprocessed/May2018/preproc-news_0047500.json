    "text": "TOKYO, May 23 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds rose on Wednesday after the Bank of Japanâ€™s buying operation produced strong results, highlighting limited availability of JGBs for investors.\nThe BOJ bought one- to five-year sector and the 10- to 40-year zone as previously announced, with the latter drawing smallest amount of selling since the end of last month.\nTen-year JGB futures rose 0.07 point to 150.85, with a trading volume of 18,900 lots by late afternoon trade.\nTrading in cash bonds was subdued, with the benchmark 10-year bonds untraded in the morning before trading flat at 0.045 percent. The current 20-year JGBs were still untraded. (Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)\n ",
