Net sales of $318.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 3.8% from net sales of $306.4 million for the prior quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased 61.0% compared to net sales of $197.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n“We finished the fiscal year strong in the March quarter with mix, shipments, and orders staying on pace, and even exceeding the prior quarter in all aspects. We continue to believe that this is a trend and not a bubble with the demand for our products remaining robust and our sales into the distribution channel balanced with distributor inventories,” stated Per Loof, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “Looking out to our next fiscal year that began April 1, we believe that we will see another strong year of market demand and performance by the Company with sales growing year over year as additional capacity comes on line over the course of the fiscal year,” continued Loof.\nU.S. GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $254.5 million, or $4.34 per diluted share compared to net income of $48.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. U.S. GAAP net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, which included a $6.3 million unfavorable purchase accounting adjustment related to the TOKIN acquisition, compared to net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $52.9 million or $0.93 per diluted share.\nFor fiscal year 2018, our results include our 34% share of TOKIN's financial results for the period from April 1, 2017 to April 19, 2017 and all of TOKIN's financial results from April 20, 2017 to March 31, 2018. For fiscal year 2017, our results only included our 34% equity investment in TOKIN.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted net income was $102.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share compared to non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted net income of $23.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $26.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to a non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted net income of $7.8 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet income (loss) for the fiscal quarters and years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 include various items affecting comparability as denoted in the U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP reconciliation tables included hereafter.\nAbout KEMET\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “KEM” (NYSE:KEM).

\"Adjusted operating income (loss)\", “Adjusted net income (loss)”, “Adjusted net income (loss) per share” and “Adjusted EBITDA”. Management believes that investors may find it useful to review the Company’s financial results as adjusted to exclude items as determined by management as further described below.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin represents net sales less cost of sales excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. Management uses Adjusted gross margin to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that Adjusted gross margin is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from U.S. GAAP gross margin to Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted gross margin (amounts in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarters Ended Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Net sales $ 318,047 $ 306,408 $ 197,519 $ 1,199,926 $ 757,791 Cost of sales (1) 229,628 213,947 147,338 859,533 570,864 Gross Margin (U.S. GAAP) (1) 88,419 92,461 50,181 340,393 186,927 Gross margin as a % of net sales 27.8 % 30.2 % 25.4 % 28.4 % 24.7 % Non-U.S. GAAP-adjustments: Plant start-up costs 929 — — 929 427 Stock-based compensation expense 465 402 391 1,519 1,384 Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) (1) $ 89,813 $ 92,863 $ 50,572 $ 342,841 $ 188,738 Adjusted gross margin as a % of net sales 28.2 % 30.3 % 25.6 % 28.6 % 24.9 %\n(1) Quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 adjusted due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) represents operating income (loss), excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. We use Adjusted operating income (loss) to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that Adjusted operating income (loss) is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. Adjusted operating income (loss) should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands):\nQuarters Ended Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 (Unaudited) Operating income (loss) (U.S. GAAP) (1) $ 21,799 $ 32,077 $ 8,942 $ 113,303 $ 35,796 Adjustments: ERP integration costs/IT transition costs 80 — 1,760 80 7,045 Stock-based compensation expense 2,820 2,206 1,249 7,657 4,720 Restructuring charges 8,307 3,530 1,087 14,843 5,404 Legal expenses/fines related to antitrust class actions 1,738 1,482 406 6,736 2,640 TOKIN investment-related expenses — — 497 — 1,101 Plant start-up costs 929 — — 929 427 (Gain) loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets (70 ) (902 ) 4,171 (992 ) 10,671 Adjusted operating income (loss) (non-GAAP) (1) $ 35,603 $ 38,393 $ 18,112 $ 142,556 $ 67,804\n(1) Quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 adjusted due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n“Adjusted net income (loss)” and “Adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share” represent net income (loss) and net income (loss) per basic and diluted share excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. The Company believes that these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. Management uses these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided earlier in this presentation which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table provides reconciliation from U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income (loss):\nU.S. GAAP to Non- U.S. GAAP Reconciliation\nQuarters Ended Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 (Unaudited, Amounts in thousands, except per share data) U.S. GAAP Net sales $ 318,047 $ 306,408 $ 197,519 $ 1,199,926 $ 757,791 Net income (loss) $ 2,433 $ 18,641 $ 52,914 $ 254,529 $ 47,989 Net income (loss) per basic share $ 0.04 $ 0.33 $ 1.13 $ 4.82 $ 1.03 Net income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.04 $ 0.32 $ 0.93 $ 4.34 $ 0.87 Non-U.S. GAAP Net income (loss) (U.S. GAAP) 2,433 18,641 52,914 254,529 47,989 Adjustments: Change in value of TOKIN options — — (14,200 ) — (10,700 ) Equity (income) loss from equity method investments (313 ) (238 ) (41,372 ) (76,192 ) (41,643 ) Acquisition (gain) loss 6,303 (310 ) — (130,880 ) — Restructuring charges 8,307 3,530 1,087 14,843 5,404 ERP integration costs/IT transition costs 80 — 1,760 80 7,045 Stock-based compensation 2,820 2,206 1,249 7,657 4,720 Legal expenses/fines related to antitrust class actions 1,095 4,073 406 16,636 2,640 Net foreign exchange (gain) loss 3,972 2,239 1,507 13,145 (3,758 ) TOKIN investment related expenses — — 497 — 1,101 Plant start-up costs 929 — — 929 427 Amortization included in interest expense 647 696 200 2,467 761 (Gain) loss on write down and disposals of long-lived assets (70 ) (902 ) 4,171 (992 ) 10,671 Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (1) 156 667 (374 ) (30 ) (741 ) (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt — — — 486 — Adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) $ 26,359 $ 30,602 $ 7,845 $ 102,678 $ 23,916 Adjusted net income (loss) per basic share (non-GAAP) $ 0.46 $ 0.54 $ 0.17 $ 1.94 $ 0.51 Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share (non-GAAP) $ 0.45 $ 0.52 $ 0.14 $ 1.75 $ 0.43 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 57,025 56,778 46,803 52,798 46,552 Diluted (2) 59,063 58,937 57,130 58,640 55,389",
