    "text": "0 COMMENTS With oil prices at their highest level in three years, it would seem a good time to cash out of energy investments purchased cheaply during the oil rout, but hedge-fund manager Fir Tree is finding it isn’t, writes Ryan Dezember.\nFir Tree was one of several Wall Street firms that saw an opportunity to profit from the pain inflicted on heavily indebted energy producers when oil prices plunged in late 2014 from more than $100 a barrel to as little as $26.\nPLANNING & INVESTING\nU.S. Government Bonds Pay More Than Debt From Other Developed Nations: Higher yields reflect investors’ struggle to reconcile expectations for faster U.S. growth with concerns about impact of deficits and inflation.\nMARKET TALK\nThe number of female billionaires rose by 18% to 321 in 2017, outpacing the growth of 14.5% in the male billionaire population (2433) and increasing the female share of the global billionaire population to 11.7%, according to the Wealth-X billionaire census. There remained a stark gender contrast in the proportion of self-made billionaires and those with inherited wealth, although the gap has narrowed slightly over the past decade. More than half of all female billionaires in 2017 had accrued their wealth primarily through multigenerational inheritance, compared with 8% of male billionaires. And, among the female billionaire population there’s been a steady rise in the share whose net worth can be attributed both to inheritance and to self-made wealth creation, implying a greater degree of risk-taking entrepreneurialism, the census says. (veronica.dagher@wsj.com; @VeronicaDagher)\nAs the Great Depression left deep scars on those who suffered through it, the more recent Great Recession has long been expected to have long-lasting effects. New research from the St. Louis Fed says those born in the 1980s are ground zero for negative impacts from the financial crisis. It says the median family headed by someone born in the 1980s had lost 34% of the income they should have had absent the downturn. “The typical 1980s family lost ground between 2010 and 2016, falling even further behind the typical wealth life cycle. This represents a missed opportunity because asset appreciation is unlikely to be as rapid in the near future as it was during the recent period,” the bank says.
