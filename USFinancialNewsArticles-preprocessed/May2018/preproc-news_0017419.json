REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\nSome media in Turkey reported in recent weeks that Erdogan will hold a rally in Sarajevo ahead of the elections.\nSome Western countries have banned Turkish politicians from campaigning on their soil. Erdogan has said his party would hold the first election rally in a European country and last weekend said it would be in Sarajevo.\nAmbassador Haldun Koc told local Fena news agency that Erdogan would come in a working visit first planned for June but then moved to May 20 because of the early election.\n“We see this visit as a working visit that should be focused on topics such as economy, trade, investment and further cooperation between the two countries,” Koc told Fena.\nErdogan called snap parliamentary and presidential elections so Turkey can switch quickly to an executive presidency narrowly approved by referendum last year.\nAhead of that vote, countries including the Netherlands and Germany, both of which have significant Turkish communities, prevented Turkish officials from campaigning there citing security concerns.\nAustria and Germany said last month they would ban foreign politicians from campaigning in their respective countries.\nKoc said Erdogan will attend the convention of the Union of European-Turkish Democrats (UETD), the non-government organization which invited Turkish officials to speak ahead of the referendum last year but was prevented by authorities there.\nThe event will be held in a reconstructed Olympic hall that can hold up to 20,000 people, the UETD said on its website. Bosnian officials said on Monday they were not aware of Erdogan’s visit. Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
