    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 10:58 PM / Updated 7 hours ago Golf-Wise shares lead with Leishman at Byron Nelson Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 19 (Reuters) – Young American Aaron Wise chased down Australian Marc Leishman on Saturday to grab the co-lead at the AT&T Byron Nelson and set up a two-man showdown heading into the final round.\nThe 21-year-old Wise, who was a shot behind the leader entering the third round, shot a three-under-par 68 to tie Leishman at 17 under.\nWise is hunting his first PGA Tour win after tying for second in the Wells Fargo Championship two weeks ago.\nHe birdied the 16th and 17th holes in Dallas to briefly take solo control before making a bogey on the par-four 18th to drop back.\nAustralian Matt Jones and American Kevin Na were four shots back at 13 under with Jimmy Walker and Brian Gay on 12 under.\nLeishman grabbed control of the tournament in the opening round with a 10-under-par 61 and has been steady since, making just two bogeys over his last two rounds at the links-style Trinity Forest, the tournament’s new home.\nLeishman, 34, won twice on the PGA Tour a year ago and will be looking for his first triumph of this season.\nHometown favorite and three-times major champion Jordan Spieth failed to push his way into contention, settling for a level-par 71 that left him well back at seven under.
