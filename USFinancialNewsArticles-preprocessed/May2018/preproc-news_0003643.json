    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:EXK) (TSX:EDR) released today its financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. The Company owns and operates three underground silver-gold mines in Mexico, the Guanaceví mine in Durango state, and the Bolañitos and El Cubo mines in Guanajuato state. Endeavour is also developing the El Compas mine project in Zacatecas state to production and advancing the Terronera mine project in Jalisco state to a development decision.\nThe Company’s net earnings in the First Quarter, 2018 were lower than in the First Quarter, 2017, primarily due to higher depreciation and depletion charges. Revenue was up 11% due to higher production, mine operating cash flow before taxes (1) increased 16% to $13.8 million, cash flow from operations before working capital charges increased 30% to $11.6 million and EBITDA rose 24% to $11.1 million.\nHighlights of First Quarter 2018 (Compared to First Quarter 2017)\nFinancial\nNet earnings decreased 61% to $2.3 million ($0.02 per share) EBITDA (1) increased 24% to $11.1 million Cash flow from operations before working capital changes increased 30% to $11.6 million Mine operating cash flow before taxes (1) increased 16% to $13.8 million Revenue increased 11% to $40.3 million Realized silver price decreased 6% to $16.70 per ounce (oz) sold Realized gold price increased 4% to $1,330 per oz sold Cash costs (1) fell 17% to $6.50 per oz silver payable (net of gold credits) All-in sustaining costs (1) fell 22% to $14.18 per oz silver payable (net of gold credits) Cash and cash equivalents dipped 7% to $36.6 million Working capital was flat at $66.6 million compared to $66.2 million at year end\nOperations\nSilver production increased 25% to 1,350,840 oz Gold production increased 13% to 13,208 oz Silver equivalent production was 2.3 million oz (at a 75:1 silver: gold ratio) Silver oz sold increased 14% to 1,406,143 oz Gold oz sold increased 12% to 12,674 oz Bullion inventory at quarter-end included 85,675 oz silver and 302 oz gold Concentrate inventory at quarter-end included 74,359 oz silver and 1,195 oz gold El Compas mine development on track for commercial production by July 31, 2018 Terronera engineering trade-off studies on track for optimized pre-feasibility study in Q2, 2018 Announced a Preliminary Mineral Resource for the Parral properties in northern Mexico EBITDA, mine operating cash flow, cash costs and all-in sustaining costs are non-IFRS measures. Please refer to the definitions in the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis.\nBradford Cooke, Endeavour CEO, commented, “Our First Quarter 2018 financial performance was better than last year, with revenue, cash flow and EBITDA all up year-on-year, but net earnings down due to higher depreciation and depletion. With our production rising and cash and all-in sustaining costs falling, the First Quarter was a good start on meeting our guidance for the year.\n“Guanacevi continues to be our highest cost mine but we saw incremental month-to-month improvement during the quarter as the productivity optimization program launched in January started to gain traction. El Cubo contributed lower costs thanks to higher production and grades and Bolanitos continues to be our lowest cost mine notwithstanding lower grades in Q1, 2018.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated revenue totaling $40.3 million (2017 - $36.4 million). During the quarter, the Company sold 1,406,143 silver ounces and 12,674 gold ounces at realized prices of $16.70 and $1,330 per ounce respectively, compared to sales of 1,235,594 silver ounces and 11,290 gold ounces at realized prices of $17.79 and $1,280 per ounce respectively in Q1 2017.\nAfter cost of sales of $37.0 million (2017 - $28.6 million), mine operating earnings amounted to $3.3 million (2017 - $7.8 million) from mining and milling operations in Mexico. The 29% increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion. Excluding depreciation and depletion of $9.8 million (2017 - $4.1 million), share-based payments of $37,000 and inventory write down of $0.8 million, mine operating cash flow before taxes was $13.8 million (2017 – $12.0 million) in Q1, 2018.\nNet earnings were $2.3 million (2017 –$6.0 million) after exploration, general and administrative, foreign exchange, other income and taxes.\nDirect production costs per tonne in Q1, 2018 increased 5% compared with Q1, 2017. The higher production costs per tonne were the result of Guanaceví’s lower mine output due to mine development falling behind schedule in 2017. A productivity optimization program designed and overseen by a third party launched in January at Guanacevi aims to review and improve every aspect of operations, from employee culture to people and equipment availability to planning, execution, supervision and reporting. This seven month program is intended to return Guanacevi to normal operations in Q3, 2018. The higher costs at Guanaceví were offset by lower costs at Bolañitos and increased proportion of production from the El Cubo operation.\nThe higher costs per tonne were offset by higher grades primarily at El Cubo. The improved grades resulted in 17% lower cash costs per oz, net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute). Similarly, all-in sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) which, compared to Q1, 2017, decreased 22% to $14.18 per oz in Q1, 2018. This decrease in all‑in sustaining costs was a result of the lower operating costs per oz and the lower capital expenditures in Q1, 2018 compared to Q1, 2017.\nThe Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion & Analysis can be viewed on the Company’s website at www.edrsilver.com , on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov .
