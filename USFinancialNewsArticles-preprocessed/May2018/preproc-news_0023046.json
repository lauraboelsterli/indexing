    "text": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC (\"SIRE\" or the \"Company\") announced its unaudited financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.\nResults for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 (Amounts in $ and 000's, except Book Value per Unit)\nThree Months\nEnded March\n31, 2018\nThree Months\nEnded March\n31, 2017\nSix Months\nEnded March\n31, 2018\nSix Months\nEnded March\n31, 2017\nRevenues\n53,551\n56,073\n104,097\n108,138\nNet Income (Loss)\n(835)\n2,065\n346\n7,697\nGross Margin\n356\n3,489\n3,064\n10,672\nModified EBITDA\n1,983\n5,410\n6,148\n13,606\nBalance at March 31,\n2018\nBalance at September 30,\n2017\nTotal Debt\n27,373\n19,766\nBook Value (Members' Equity)\n105,674\n111,991\nBook Value per basic unit\n7,929\n8,403\nSIRE reported net income of $0.3 million or $25.96 per basic unit for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $7.7 million or $577.55 per basic unit for the six months ended March 31, 2017. SIRE reported net loss of $(0.8) million, or $(62.65) per unit, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $2.1 million, or $154.95 per basic unit, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSIRE revenue from operations was $104.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $108.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. SIRE revenue from operations was $53.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $56.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nModified EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and unrealized hedging gains and losses was $6.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $13.6 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company's debt increased $7.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to September 30, 2017, as our continued paydown of term debt was offset by short term borrowing requirements of $10.9 million.\nSIRE's book value was lower at March 31, 2018 by $6.3 million compared to September 30, 2017, due primarily to the $6.7 million paid in member distributions in January 2018.\nSIRE had $1.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $21.0 million available under revolving loan agreements, for a total cash and available borrowings of $22.3 million at March 31, 2018. The cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.5 million compared to $7.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nBrian Cahill, SIRE's President and CEO stated, \"This first half of Fiscal 2018, we saw very tight margins, continuing the trends of the previous quarter. Corn prices have increased slightly per bushel as compared to Fiscal 2017. However, ethanol prices in the U.S. have been trending downwards over the past months, but we did see some price improvement in March of 2018. Demand for ethanol has been strong with the lower prices, both in the U.S. and abroad. The industry has continued to adjust and we expect margins to remain positive but are becoming more dependent on continued good export demand. Our distiller grains have also seen increased demand offset by reduced prices in the first half of Fiscal 2018 as compared to 2017, and a shift to a heavier weighting for wet distiller grains. We also have seen price improvement for distilled grains during the last quarter.\"\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, SIRE produced 31.9 million gallons of ethanol, compared to 31.1 million gallons during Fiscal 2017. For the first six months of Fiscal 2018, SIRE produced 63.6 million gallons of ethanol, compared to 61.0 million gallons in the first six months of Fiscal 2017. Cahill commented - \"We continue to evaluate and implement new production technology. We will continue to focus on running the plant efficiently, increasing our ethanol yield, with a balance of optimizing the yield and profit.\"\nAbout Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC:\nSIRE is located on 275 acres in Council Bluffs, Iowa, operating a 140 million gallon per year ethanol plant. SIRE began producing ethanol in February, 2009 and sells its ethanol, distillers grains, corn syrup, and corn oil in the continental United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"1995 Act\").

Management believes that Modified EBITDA provides useful information to investors as a measure of comparison with peer and other companies. Modified EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Modified EBITDA calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our computation of Modified EBITDA may not be comparable with a similarly-titled measure of another company.\nModified EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, unrealized hedging gains and losses, and other significant noncash expenses was $6.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the $13.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
