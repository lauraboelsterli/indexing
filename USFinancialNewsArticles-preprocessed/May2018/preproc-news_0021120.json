We believe our accomplishments over the years, throughout 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, reflect our goal of cultivating and building strong operating platforms within each vertical and at the parent company level,” commented Alan B. Levan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital.\n“As we have said in the past, BBX Capital’s goal is to build long-term shareholder value as opposed to focusing on quarterly or annual earnings, and our objective is to achieve long-term growth as measured by increases in book value and intrinsic value over time. Using that metric, BBX Capital’s fully diluted book value per share, as of December 31, 2017, had increased 30% to $5.63, up from $4.32 on December 31, 2016, and as of March 31, 2018, fully diluted book value per share increased 25% to $5.68 per share, up from $4.54 per share on March 31, 2017.\n“Additionally, our stock price, as of March 31, 2018, had increased approximately 16% to $9.21, up from $7.97 on December 31, 2017. We are pleased with our growth, progress and achievements and very much appreciate the continued support of our shareholders locally and globally,” Levan concluded.\nFor more complete and detailed information regarding BBX Capital and its financial results, business, operations, investments and risks, please see BBX Capital’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is available on the SEC's website, https://www.sec.gov , and on BBX Capital’s website, www.BBXCapital.com , and BBX Capital’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which will be available on the SEC's and BBX Capital’s websites upon filing with the SEC on or about May 8, 2018.\nThe following selected information relates to the operating activities of Bluegreen Vacations and BBX Capital’s Real Estate and Middle Market Divisions.\nBluegreen Vacations - Selected Financial Data\nSelected highlights of Bluegreen Vacations’ financial results include:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nSales of VOIs of $56.1 million vs. $54.2 million System-wide sales of VOIs of $132.8 million vs. $129.6 million (1) Other fee-based services revenue of $28.0 million vs. $26.1 million Income before income taxes of $30.8 million vs. $30.9 million Adjusted EBITDA of $33.3 million vs. $32.0 million (2) Free cash flow of $8.0 million vs. $4.1 million (3)\n(1) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of Bluegreen’s Sales of VOIs to System-wide sales of VOIs. (2) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of Bluegreen’s net income to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of Bluegreen’s cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow. In addition to BBX Capital’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, more complete and detailed information regarding Bluegreen Vacations and its financial results, business, operations and risks can be found in Bluegreen Vacations’ press release reporting its quarter ended March 31, 2018, and its filings with the SEC, which are available to view on the SEC's website, https://www.sec.gov , and on Bluegreen Vacations’ website, www.BluegreenVacations.com .\nBBX Capital Real Estate - Selected Financial Data\nSelected highlights of BBX Capital Real Estate’s financial results include:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nRevenues of $12.8 million vs. $1.5 million, an increase of 753% Recoveries from previously charged off loans of $4.8 million vs. $3.1 million Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures of $1.3 million vs. $3.2 million Income before income taxes of $12.1 million vs. $5.3 million\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, BBX Capital Real Estate continued its development of the Beacon Lakes Community in St. Johns County, Florida, with the closing of 83 developed lots to homebuilders resulting in $6.4 million in revenues and $2.2 million of pre-tax profits. In addition, BBX Capital Real Estate generated significant income from its legacy asset portfolio during the quarter as a result of the repayment or settlement of commercial loans and the sale of a student housing complex held by it.\nBBX Capital Middle Market - Selected Financial Data\nBBX Capital Middle Market: Renin Holdings, LLC\nSelected highlights of Renin Holdings, LLC’s (“Renin”) financial results include:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nTrade sales of $15.0 million vs. $17.2 million, a decrease of 12.8% Gross margin of $2.8 million vs. $3.4 million Gross margin percentage of 18.9% vs. 19.5% Loss before income taxes of $30,000 vs. income before taxes of $0.7 million Adjusted EBITDA of $0.6 million vs $0.9 million (1)\n(1) See the supplemental tables included in this release for a reconciliation of Renin’s net income to Adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Renin’s operating performance was primarily impacted by a decline in sales associated with the loss of certain customers in its commercial channel, a decline in sales in its direct installation channel as a result of an increase in pricing in an effort to improve the channel’s profitability, and promotional marketing by a customer in its retail channel during 2017 that was not repeated in 2018. Renin expects that increased sales in its retail channel, including e-commerce sales, during the remainder of 2018 will ultimately offset the impact of declining sales in its commercial and direct installation channels in 2018.\nBBX Capital Middle Market: BBX Sweet Holdings\nSelected highlights of BBX Sweet Holdings, LLC’s (“BBX Sweet Holdings”) financial results include:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nTrade sales of $21.9 million vs. $6.1 million, an increase of 259.0% Gross margin of $7.2 million vs. $0.4 million Gross margin percentage of 32.9% vs. 6.2% Loss before income taxes of $4.7 million vs. a loss of $3.1 million\nThe significant increase in BBX Sweet Holdings’ revenues and gross margins primarily resulted from its acquisition of IT’SUGAR, a specialty candy retailer with 95 locations in 26 states and Washington, DC, in June 2017. IT’SUGAR reported a loss before income taxes of $1.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which it believes was primarily due to the seasonal nature of its sales. In addition, BBX Sweet Holdings recognized $0.6 million in costs, including severance costs and impairments of property and equipment, in connection with the commencement of the exit of its manufacturing facility in Utah in 2018.\nBBX Capital Middle Market: MOD Pizza\nSelected highlights of BBX Capital’s MOD Pizza franchise operations include:\nOpened a restaurant location in Coral Springs, Florida, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and an additional location in Kendall, Florida, in early April 2018.

Sales of VOIs owned by third parties are transacted as sales of VOIs in Bluegreen’s Vacation Club through the same selling and marketing process it uses to sell its VOI inventory. Bluegreen considers system-wide sales of VOIs to be an important operating measure because it reflects all sales of VOIs by its sales and marketing operations without regard to whether Bluegreen or a third party owned such VOI inventory at the time of sale. System-wide sales of VOIs should not be considered as an alternative to sales of VOIs or any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP or to any other method of analyzing results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following supplemental table represents BBX Capital’s free cash flow (1) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow (unaudited) (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flow from operating activities $ (1,682 ) 2,787 Capital expenditures for property and equipment (8,075 ) (3,899 ) Free cash flow $ (9,757 ) (1,112 ) The following supplemental table represents Bluegreen’s free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as a reconciliation of Bluegreen’s cash flows from operating activities to its free cash flow (unaudited) (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flow from operating activities $ 13,463 7,172 Capital expenditures for property and equipment (5,462 ) (3,028 ) Free cash flow $ 8,001 4,144 (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment. The Company and Bluegreen focus on the generation of free cash flow. The Company considers free cash flow to be a useful supplemental measure of the Company’s and Bluegreen’s ability to generate cash flow from operations and is a supplemental measure of liquidity. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company's computation of free cash flow may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies. Investors are cautioned that the item excluded from free cash flow is a significant component in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance.\nThe following supplemental table presents Bluegreen’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (1) defined below, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as a reconciliation of Bluegreen’s net income to its EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 23,582 20,296 Provision for income taxes 7,201 10,611 Income before income taxes 30,783 30,907 Add/(Less): Interest income (other than interest earned on VOI notes receivable) (1,434 ) (2,104 ) Interest expense 3,056 3,338 Franchise taxes 81 27 Depreciation and amortization 2,927 2,356 Bluegreen EBITDA 35,413 34,524 EBITDA attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations (2,612 ) (2,560 ) (Gain) loss on assets held-for-sale (20 ) 22 Corporate realignment costs 476 - Bluegreen Adjusted EBITDA $ 33,257 31,986 (1) Bluegreen’s EBITDA is defined as earnings or net income, before taking into account interest income (excluding interest earned on VOI notes receivable), interest expense (excluding interest expense incurred on financings related to Bluegreen’s receivable-backed notes payable), income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization. For purposes of the EBITDA calculation, no adjustments were made for interest income earned on Bluegreen’s VOI notes receivable or the interest expense incurred on debt that is secured by such notes receivable because they are both considered to be part of the operations of Bluegreen’s business.\nBluegreen’s Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations (in which Bluegreen has a 51% equity interest) and items that the Company believes are not representative of ongoing operating results.\nThe Company considers Bluegreen’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of Bluegreen’s operating performance, and they are used to measure Bluegreen’s ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company’s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. Additionally, the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the related depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nThe Company considers Bluegreen’s Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure of Bluegreen’s operating performance that facilitates the comparability of historical financial periods.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Bluegreen's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company's computation of Bluegreen’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies. Investors are cautioned that items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing Bluegreen’s financial performance.\nThe following supplemental table presents Renin’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (1) defined below, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as a reconciliation of Renin’s net income to its EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income from Renin $ (30 ) 542 Provision from income taxes - 150 (Loss) income before income taxes (30 ) 692 Add/(Less): Interest expense 158 79 Depreciation and amortization 503 321 Renin EBITDA 631 1,092 Foreign exchange gain (52 ) (191 ) Renin Adjusted EBITDA $ 579 901 (1) Renin’s EBITDA is defined as its earnings, or net income, before taking into account interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, including the amortization of product displays provided to customers for marketing purposes that are presented as a reduction of trade sales under GAAP.\nRenin’s Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for foreign exchange gains and losses, as exchange rates may vary significantly among companies.\nThe Company considers Renin’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an indicator of Renin’s operating performance, and they are used to measure Renin’s ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is also used by companies, lenders, investors and others because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry.\nThe Company considers Renin’s Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure of Renin’s operating performance that facilitates the comparability of historical financial periods.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Renin’s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of its liquidity. The Company’s computation of Renin’s EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies, and investors are cautioned that items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing Renin’s financial performance.\nSource:BBX Capital Corporation",
