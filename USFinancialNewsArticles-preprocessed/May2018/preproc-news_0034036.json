    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday defended President Donald Trump’s description of some illegal immigrants who are members of the MS-13 gang and who commit brutal crimes as “animals.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump bids farewell to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev after their meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S. May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “Frankly, I think that the term animal doesn’t go far enough,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters a day after Trump drew criticism for his comments during a meeting with law enforcement officials. “I think that the president should continue to use his platform and anything he can do to stop these kinds of horrible, horrible, disgusting people.”\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Justin Mitchell; Editing by Eric Walsh\n ",
