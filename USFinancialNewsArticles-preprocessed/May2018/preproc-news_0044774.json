    "text": "Stephen Curry says he “blacked out” when he turned to the crowd after a layup, removed his mouthpiece and screamed “This is my (expletive) house” during the Golden State Warriors’ 126-85 blowout win over the Houston Rockets in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals Sunday in Oakland, Calif.\nMay 20, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) shoots the basketball against Houston Rockets guard Gerald Green (14) and guard Eric Gordon (10) during the first half in game three of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Oracle Arena. The Warriors defeated the Rockets 126-85. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports His mother, Sonya Curry, was alert, however, and she wasn’t happy with her son’s display on national television.\nShe was plenty happy to see him hit seven straight shots, including a pair of 3-pointers, in a third-quarter flurry that broke open a competitive game, but told her son to wash his mouth out with soap anyway.\n“She already sent me two home videos, showing me the clip and playing it back,” Curry said, per ESPN. “She was telling me how I need to wash my mouth out, saying to wash it out with soap. It’s a message I’ve heard before.”\nAnd a message he agrees with.\n“She’s right,” Curry continued. “I gotta do better. I can’t talk like that.”\nCurry, who had been held to a total of 34 points in the first two games of the series, exploded for 35 points in 34 minutes, propelling the Warriors into a 2-1 lead over the top-seeded Rockets in the best-of-seven series.\nGame 4 is Tuesday night in Oakland.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
