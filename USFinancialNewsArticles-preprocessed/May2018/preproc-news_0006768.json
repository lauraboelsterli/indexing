    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Summary\nNet income of $28.0 million, an increase of $11.8 million, or 73%, over the prior quarter Diluted earnings per share of $0.60 ROAA and ROATCE of 1.39% and 16.51%, respectively Efficiency ratio of 52% Net interest margin of 4.50% Announced acquisition of Grandpoint Capital, Inc. Non-maturity deposits at 82% of total deposits New loan commitments of $488 million\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pacific Premier Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: PPBI) (the “Company”), the holding company of Pacific Premier Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income for 2018 of $28.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with net income of $16.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $9.5 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for 2017. Financial results for 2018 include $936,000 of merger-related expense.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s return on average assets (\"ROAA\") was 1.39% and return on average tangible common equity (\"ROATCE\") was 16.51%. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company's ROAA was 0.87% and the ROATCE was 10.48%. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company's ROAA was 0.94% and its ROATCE was 11.03%. Total assets as of March 31, 2018 were $8.1 billion compared with $8.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $4.2 billion at March 31, 2017.\nSteven R. Gardner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented on the results, “We had a highly productive quarter – continuing the integration of Plaza Bancorp, reaching an agreement to acquire Grandpoint Capital, and generated increasing profitable growth as evidenced by our operating earnings per share of $0.62, which excludes merger-related costs, and our operating ROAA and ROATCE of 1.43% and 16.95%, respectively.\n“As expected, we saw a lower level of loan growth in the first quarter as demand was seasonally lighter and we reduced our new originations of loans in areas where increased competition has resulted in unattractive risk-adjusted yields. The majority of our new loan production in the first quarter came from commercial and industrial, construction and franchise loans where our expertise, relationships and outstanding service enable us to generate attractive risk-adjusted yields. Our emphasis on higher yielding assets is helping to mitigate the impact of increasing deposit costs on our net interest margin.\n“The acquisition of Grandpoint represents another significant step in the growth of our franchise. The Grandpoint acquisition will strengthen and build upon our presence in the Southern California market, while also enabling us to surpass the $10 billion asset threshold in a meaningful way and further increase our operating leverage. Our primary focus over the remainder of 2018 will be ensuring that we successfully integrate the Plaza and Grandpoint acquisitions, realizing the synergies that we project for both these transactions, prudently managing for the heightened regulatory requirements as we cross $10 billion in assets and continue to grow profitably. We believe that the foundation we put in place during 2018 will be instrumental in driving higher earnings and franchise value in the years ahead,” said Mr. Gardner.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Financial Highlights (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income $ 28,002 $ 16,171 $ 9,521 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.60 $ 0.36 $ 0.34 Return on average assets 1.39 % 0.87 % 0.94 % Return on average tangible common equity (1) 16.51 % 10.48 % 11.03 % Net interest margin 4.50 % 4.56 % 4.39 % Cost of deposits 0.39 % 0.32 % 0.27 % Efficiency ratio (2) 52.4 % 48.2 % 52.3 % Total assets $ 8,086,816 $ 8,024,501 $ 4,174,428 Total deposits $ 6,192,273 $ 6,085,868 $ 3,297,073 Core deposits to total deposits (3) 88 % 89 % 89 % Tangible book value per share (1) $ 15.63 $ 15.26 $ 12.88 Total capital ratio 12.65 % 12.46 % 12.40 % (1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of average tangible common equity and tangible book value per share to the GAAP measures of common stockholders' equity and book value are set forth at the end of this press release.

INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income totaled $81.3 million in 2018, an increase of $3.1 million, or 4.0%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the full quarter inclusion of Plaza Bancorp (\"Plaza\"), which was acquired on November 1, 2017, as well as higher average asset balances and yields on our loans and investments. These increases were partially offset by lower accretion income and prepayment fees, as well as higher deposit and borrowing costs, and two less days of interest in 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter was 4.50%, compared with 4.56% in the prior quarter. The decrease was principally driven by lower accretion income of $3.7 million, compared to $4.7 million of accretion income in the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as lower prepayment and other loan related fees of approximately $500,000. Excluding the impact of accretion, our core net interest margin was unchanged at 4.26%, compared to the prior quarter. Higher earning asset yields of 12 basis points were partially offset by higher deposit interest costs of 7 basis points and the impact of lower total fees of 5 basis points.\nNet interest income for 2018 increased $39.6 million, or 95%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily related to an increase in average interest-earning assets of $3.5 billion, which resulted primarily from our organic loan growth since the end of 2017 and our acquisition of Plaza in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the acquisition of Heritage Oaks Bancorp (\"Heritage Oaks\") during the second quarter of 2017.\nPACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC.

(2) Represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Provision for Loan Losses\nA provision for loan losses of $2.3 million was recorded for 2018, compared with a provision for loan losses of $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The slight increase in our provision for loan losses was primarily due to higher net charge-offs and, to a lesser extent, incremental changes in our new origination's composition.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for 2018 was $7.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 19%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to a $2.2 million decrease of recoveries from pre-acquisition charged-off loans in other income, and a $373,000 decrease in net gain from the sale of loans, partially offset by increases in loan servicing and deposit fees, driven primarily by the full quarter inclusion of Plaza.\nDuring the quarter, the Bank sold $35.7 million of Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") loans for a gain of $2.7 million, compared with $36.0 million of SBA loans sold and a gain of $2.8 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, the Bank sold one commercial real estate loan during the quarter for a gain of $230,000, compared with commercial loan sales of $48.4 million for a net gain of $577,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income for 2018 increased $3.0 million, or 64%, compared to 2017. The increase from 2017 was primarily related to a $969,000 increase in debit card interchange fees, an $886,000 increase in other income, and an $809,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 NONINTEREST INCOME (dollars in thousands) Loan servicing fees $ 345 $ 145 $ 221 Service charges on deposit accounts 1,150 1,121 341 Other service fee income 146 122 379 Debit card interchange fee income 1,036 1,050 67 Earnings on bank-owned life insurance 611 625 336 Net gain from sales of loans 2,958 3,331 2,811 Net gain/(loss) from sales of investment securities 6 (252 ) — Other income 1,414 3,309 528 Total noninterest income $ 7,666 $ 9,451 $ 4,683 Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $49.8 million for 2018, a decrease of $87,000, or 0.2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 million decrease in merger-related expense to $936,000 in 2018 compared with $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExcluding the merger-related expense, noninterest expense increased $4.4 million to $48.9 million, primarily due to compensation and benefits increasing $3.0 million. The increase in compensation and benefits was principally driven by the inclusion of Plaza for the full quarter, as well as an increase related to the new calendar year reset of payroll taxes and higher staffing levels.\nIn comparison to 2017, noninterest expense grew by $20.1 million, or 67.4%. The increase in such expense was primarily related to the additional costs from operations, personnel and branches retained from the acquisitions of Plaza and Heritage Oaks, combined with our continued investment in personnel to support our organic growth in loans and deposits.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 NONINTEREST EXPENSE (dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 28,873 $ 25,920 $ 14,887 Premises and occupancy 4,781 4,540 2,453 Data processing 2,702 2,498 1,187 Other real estate owned operations, net 1 13 12 FDIC insurance premiums 611 499 455 Legal, audit and professional expense 1,839 1,924 857 Marketing expense 1,530 1,364 818 Office, telecommunications and postage expense 1,080 927 433 Loan expense 591 746 468 Deposit expense 1,676 1,478 1,444 Merger-related expense 936 5,436 4,946 CDI amortization 2,274 2,111 511 Other expense 2,914 2,439 1,276 Total noninterest expense $ 49,808 $ 49,895 $ 29,747 Income Tax\nOn December 22, 2017, “H.R.1,” formerly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” was signed into law. Among other items, H.R.1 reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company concluded that this required the Company’s net deferred tax asset to be revalued at the new lower tax rate. The Company performed an analysis and determined to reduce the value of the net deferred tax asset by $5.6 million, which was included in the fourth quarter 2017 income tax provision.\nFor 2018, our effective tax rate was 24.1%, compared with 38.6%, excluding the net deferred tax asset adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 32.7% for 2017. Impacting the effective tax rate was the tax effect of exercised and vested share-based compensation awards, which are reported as discrete items in the period they occur, resulting in a $1.4 million tax benefit to the Company for 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS\nLoans\nLoans held for investment totaled $6.2 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $45.4 million, or 0.7%, from December 31, 2017, and an increase of $2.9 billion, or 84%, from March 31, 2017. The $45.4 million increase for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter was the result of real estate loans increasing $34.7 million and business loans increasing $18.1 million, partially offset by consumer loans decreasing $6.7 million. Business loans represented 54% of the total gross loans held for investment for the quarter compared with 54% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 49% in 2017. Loans held for sale increased $5.6 million from the prior quarter. The total end-of-period weighted average interest rate on loans at March 31, 2018 was 5.04%, compared to 4.95% at December 31, 2017 and 4.86% at March 31, 2017.\nLoan activity during 2018 included new organic loan commitments of $488 million, compared with $648 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $455 million in 2017.

PACIFIC PREMIER BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) For periods presented below, return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate these figures by excluding CDI amortization expense and exclude the average CDI and average goodwill from the average stockholders' equity during the period. Management believes that the exclusion of such items from these financial measures provides useful information to an understanding of the operating results of our core business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these adjusted measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled adjusted measures reported by other companies.

We calculate the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common stockholders' equity and dividing by tangible assets. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per share, which we calculate by dividing common stockholders' equity by shares outstanding. We believe that this information is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our capital position and ratios. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures.
