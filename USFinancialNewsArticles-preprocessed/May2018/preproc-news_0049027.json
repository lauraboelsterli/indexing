Aug 27, 2016; Chicago, IL, USA; Kansas City Chiefs tight end Demetrius Harris (right) picks up yardage after being tackled by Chicago Bears strong safety Harold Jones-Quartey (top) and cornerback Tracy Porter (left) during the first half at Soldier Field. Mandatory Credit: Patrick Gorski-USA TODAY Sports / Reuters Picture Supplied by Action Images\nHarris will miss the Sept. 9 contest against the Los Angeles Chargers. He can rejoin the Chiefs the following day.\n“We respect and support the league’s decision in this matter and will have no further comment on the situation,” the Chiefs said in a statement.\nHarris served two days in jail in March, stemming from a marijuana arrest in Bates County, Mo., 12 months earlier. He also received two years probation, was fined $500 and was ordered to complete 80 hours of community service and an NFL drug program.\nHarris, the No. 2 tight end behind star Travis Kelce, caught 18 passes for 224 yards and one touchdown last season.\nIn 56 career games (30 starts), Harris has 45 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns.\n—Field Level Media",
