    "text": "LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to Italian and Spanish sovereign debt rose to new multi-month highs on Wednesday amid mounting concerns over political risk emanating from Rome and broader pressure on markets.\nItaly’s 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) hit the highest in nearly 12 months at 152 basis points (bps), up 13 bps from Tuesday’s close, according to data from IHS Markit.\nMeanwhile Spain’s 5-year CDS rose to 61 bps, a six-month high and up 6 bps on the day.
