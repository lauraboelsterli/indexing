(OTC: SCNA) has announced that SAP Investments, Inc., its recently formed subsidiary, has now secured a second Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire a cannabis cultivation license and provide full cannabis cultivation services in Northern California.

While we're thrilled by the interest generated this fast, we're only moving forward with most qualified clients who prove they're capable of project completion.
