    "text": "NEW YORK, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hudson Global, Inc. (Nasdaq:HSON), a leading global talent solutions company, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Summary\nRevenue of $16.2 million increased 15.9 percent from the first quarter of 2017, or 10.7 percent in constant currency.\nGross margin of $10.2 million increased 1.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, but declined 2.5 percent in constant currency.\nNet income of $10.7 million, or $0.33 per basic and diluted share, including income from discontinued operations of $13.6 million related to the sale of its recruitment and talent management businesses, compared with net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA* loss of $2.2 million, including $1.8 million of severance expense relating to the resignation of the former chief executive officer, compared with adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Revenue growth in the first quarter was boosted by growth in Asia Pacific, while revenue was impacted by the loss of a global contract in 2017 in the Americas and Europe. We are pleased to have completed our recent divestitures and are focused squarely on the recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”) business,” said Jeff Eberwein, chief executive officer at Hudson Global. “After a busy first month in this new role, I look forward to continuing to work closely with our global leaders, developing strong client relationships, driving growth in our RPO business, improving our cost structure and delivering improved performance going forward.”\n* Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are defined in the segment tables at the end of this release.\nStrategic Update\nOn March 31, 2018, Hudson Global completed the sales of its recruitment and talent management operations in Europe and Asia Pacific to strategic buyers in three transactions. Hudson Global intends to focus on its growing, global RPO business going forward. Hudson Global received gross proceeds of $39.0 million in cash at closing, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The proceeds included $24.8 million for recruitment and talent management operations in Benelux, $7.7 million for the recruitment and talent management operations in the rest of Europe, and $6.4 million for the recruitment and talent management operations in Asia Pacific. All Hudson Global debt was transferred to the buyers with the divestitures.\nRegional Highlights\nThe divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations, therefore the discussion below is focused on the continuing operations of the RPO business for all periods presented. Prior period EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable due to regional support and infrastructure cost allocation treatment between continuing and discontinued operations following the divestitures.\nAmericas\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Hudson Global Americas' revenue of $3.7 million decreased 14 percent while gross margin of $3.1 million decreased 19 percent compared with the first quarter of 2017. Growth in financial service and life sciences was offset by lower volumes elsewhere including the conclusion of a large global contract in the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $0.3 million in the first quarter, unchanged from a year ago. The region delivered adjusted EBITDA of $0.4 million for the first quarter, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million a year ago.\nAsia Pacific\nHudson Global Asia Pacific's revenue of $8.8 million increased 35 percent while gross margin of $4.9 million increased 14 percent in constant currency in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017. Growth was driven by a new client win in the fourth quarter of 2017 and higher volumes at existing clients. EBITDA was $0.5 million in the first quarter, compared with EBITDA of $0.7 million a year ago. Asia Pacific delivered adjusted EBITDA of $0.6 million, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nEurope\nHudson Global Europe's revenue of $3.7 million decreased 2 percent while gross margin of $2.1 million decreased 6 percent in constant currency in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin growth in the U.K. of 21 percent was offset by declines in Continental Europe, due to a large global contract that ended in the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $0.0 million in the first quarter, compared with $0.2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.2 million a year ago.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe company ended the first quarter of 2018 with $42.9 million in cash. The company had no credit facilities in place at the end of the first quarter of 2018 following the sale of its recruitment and talent management businesses, but remains in discussions with various lenders about new credit facilities for the RPO business. The company used $14.7 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter, compared with $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The cash flow statements in the first quarter of 2017 and 2018 include the recruitment and talent management businesses sold on March 31, 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWhile the company’s share repurchase program remains in place, no purchases were made during the first quarter. The program has an authorization of up to $10 million of the company’s common stock. Since the inception of this program in the third quarter of 2015 through the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company has purchased 3,639,405 shares for $7.4 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe company expects RPO operations before corporate costs to deliver adjusted EBITDA of between $5.0 million to $6.0 million in 2018. We expect corporate costs of approximately $8.0 million to $8.5 million in 2018, which includes $1.8 million of severance for the former chief executive officer, recorded in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, the company expects adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.0 million to $3.5 million in 2018.\nConference Call/Webcast\nHudson Global will conduct a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss this announcement.

Furthermore, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nHUDSON GLOBAL, INC.\nRECONCILIATION FOR CONSTANT CURRENCY\n(in thousands) (unaudited)\nThe company operates on a global basis, with the majority of its gross margin generated outside of the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect its results of operations. Constant currency information compares financial results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The company currently defines the term “constant currency” to mean that financial data for a previously reported period are translated into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the current period. Changes in revenue, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), business reorganization expenses and other non-operating income (expense), operating income (loss) and EBITDA (loss) include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Variance analysis usually describes period-to-period variances that are calculated using constant currency as a percentage. The company’s management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currency and believes these results better represent the company’s underlying business trends. The company believes that these calculations are a useful measure, indicating the actual change in operations. There are no significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions between subsidiaries. Therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates generally impact only reported earnings.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 As As Currency Constant reported reported translation currency Revenue: Hudson Americas $ 3,700 $ 4,314 $ 10 $ 4,324 Hudson Asia Pacific 8,825 6,341 219 6,560 Hudson Europe 3,690 3,337 424 3,761 Total $ 16,215 $ 13,992 $ 653 $ 14,645 Gross margin: Hudson Americas $ 3,126 $ 3,836 $ 9 $ 3,845 Hudson Asia Pacific 4,923 4,184 146 4,330 Hudson Europe 2,105 1,982 256 2,238 Total $ 10,154 $ 10,002 $ 411 $ 10,413 SG&A (1): Hudson Americas $ 2,781 $ 3,531 $ 9 $ 3,540 Hudson Asia Pacific 4,303 3,351 124 3,475 Hudson Europe 2,056 1,745 225 1,970 Corporate 3,672 1,704 — 1,704 Total $ 12,812 $ 10,331 $ 358 $ 10,689 Operating income (loss): Hudson Americas $ 343 $ 392 $ (1 ) $ 391 Hudson Asia Pacific 620 834 22 856 Hudson Europe 52 240 33 273 Corporate (3,673 ) (1,763 ) — (1,763 ) Total $ (2,658 ) $ (297 ) $ 54 $ (243 ) EBITDA (loss): Hudson Americas $ 291 $ 335 $ (5 ) $ 330 Hudson Asia Pacific 544 742 20 762 Hudson Europe 11 179 29 208 Corporate (3,571 ) (1,508 ) — (1,508 ) Total $ (2,725 ) $ (252 ) $ 44 $ (208 ) Note: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSG&A is a measure that management uses to evaluate the segments’ expenses.\nContact: David F.
