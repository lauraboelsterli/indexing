Harris from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n“However, we would love to test whether the mechanism in this study could explain those anecdotal stories where people experience premature gray hair,” Harris said in an email. “Could the combination of a genetic predisposition and an everyday viral infection be just enough to negatively affect the melanocytes and melanocyte stem cells in humans, and cause early hair graying?”\nHair color depends on melanocyte stem cells that live at the base of hair follicles. As old hairs fall out and new hairs grow in, these cells develop into melanocytes - cells that produce the pigment that gives hair its color. When the stem cells are lost, new hair that grows turns out to be gray.\nHarris’s team earlier found that a protein called MITF, which controls a number of genetic pathways in these melanocyte stem cells, is involved in hair graying in certain mice.\nIn the current study, they found that MITF also limits the activity of certain genes that control the immune response to viruses.\nMice with mutations in the gene for MITF have an overactive response to viruses that results in the loss of melanocytes and melanocyte stem cells in the hair bulb, and this results in hair graying, the study team reports.\nAlthough it’s too early to know for sure, people with similar mutations in this gene could show a similar response, resulting in spontaneous hair graying after a viral infection, they write.\nBecause MITF turns out to be a “critical suppressor of innate immunity” and can cause loss of pigment producing cells, there may be implications for understanding vitiligo as well, the authors conclude.\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1BYqPuv PLoS Biology, online May 3, 2018.",
