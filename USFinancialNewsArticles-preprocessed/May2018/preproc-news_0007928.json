During the first quarter our performance reflected benefits of our market leadership, focus on underwriting discipline, strong culture of innovation, continuous improvement, and efficiency.\nIn the quarter we grew gross premiums written more than 6% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and we continued to improve the Insurance loss ratio excluding PYD and the impact of catastrophe losses. We did see a lower Reinsurance margin in the quarter, largely driven by our strategic initiatives including a shift in portfolio mix towards lower volatility and an increase in outward reinsurance protections. With respect to pricing, we are pleased to have achieved broad rate increases throughout our Insurance and Reinsurance portfolio, which will earn into our results over the rest of the year. Also during the quarter we had strong contributions from the investment portfolio, and we continued managing our expenses.\nAs we look forward to the next phase in XL's journey, with the proposed combination with AXA, we believe there is substantial opportunity to continue realizing the potential of what we have built.\"\nBook Value and Return on Common Shareholder's Equity\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nBook value per common share\n(Unaudited)\nFully diluted book value per common share\n$36.53\n$38.04\nFully diluted tangible book value per common share 2\n$28.06\n$29.44\nReturn on average common shareholder's equity (\"ROE\")\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nAnnualized Return on average common shareholder's equity (\"ROE\") 3\n6.3%\n5.6%\nAnnualized Operating ROE 1,3\n8.8%\n5.0%\nAnnualized Operating ROE ex-Accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") 1\n9.4%\n5.4%\nAnnualized Operating ROE ex-Catlin-related integration cost 1,4\n8.8%\n6.1%\nAnnualized Operating ROE ex-AOCI and ex-Catlin-related integration cost 1,4\n9.4%\n6.5%\nFirst Quarter Summary\n(U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(Unaudited)\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n$152,648\n$152,843\n$(195)\n(0.1)%\nPer average common share outstanding-basic\n$ 0.59\n$ 0.58\n$0.01\n1.7%\nPer average common share outstanding-fully diluted\n$ 0.58\n$ 0.57\n$0.01\n1.8%\nOperating net income (loss)\n$214,359\n$136,143\n$78,216\n57.5%\nPer average common share outstanding-fully diluted\n$0.82\n$0.50\n$0.32\n64.0%\nNet income attributable to common shareholders of $152.6 million was virtually unchanged compared with the prior year quarter income of $152.8 million.\nOperating net income of $214.4 million increased compared to $136.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved investment returns and lower financing costs associated with our preferred shares, partially offset by marginally lower overall underwriting profit.\nNet investment income for the current quarter was $218.5 million, compared to $200.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income for the current quarter, excluding the Life Funds Withheld Assets, was $188.1 million, compared to $167.2 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to active sector rotation and portfolio management activities, and an increase in new money rates, all of which resulted in an increase in investment yields.\nIncome from investment affiliates was $56.0 million for the current quarter, compared to $51.9 million in the prior year quarter. Hedge fund performance was strong in the current quarter, consistent with prior year quarter results. Results for private equity fund affiliates and investment manager affiliates improved in the current quarter, more than offsetting weaker results in other affiliates as compared to the prior year quarter.\nOperating expenses during the current quarter of $472.6 million were $4.5 million or 1.0% unfavorable compared to the prior year quarter. After excluding the $22.6 million of AXA-related transaction costs in the current quarter and $33.9 million of Catlin-related integration costs in the prior year quarter, expenses increased $15.7 million, or 3.6%, reflecting further investment in our business, predominately within the Insurance segment.\nIncome tax expense of $31.9 million is higher as compared to $13.1 million recognized during the prior year quarter. The increase in current quarter income tax expense is primarily attributable to the combination of the significant increase in operating income and a greater proportion of earnings in taxable jurisdictions in Q1 of 2018 as compared to the prior year quarter.\nFully diluted book value per common share decreased by $1.51 from the end of the prior quarter to $36.53, driven primarily by unrealized losses on mark to market investments, share-based compensation activity and the payment of dividends, partially offset by net income earned in the quarter. Fully diluted tangible book value per common share decreased by $1.38 from the end of the prior quarter to $28.06.\nThere were no share buybacks 5 during the current quarter. At March 31, 2018, $529.1 million of common shares remained available for purchase under the current share buyback authorization.\nP&C Operations\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nInsurance\nReinsurance\nTotal P&C\nGross premiums written\n$2,866,539\n$2,060,601\n$4,927,140\n$2,694,216\n$1,927,390\n$4,621,606\nNet premiums written\n$1,481,867\n$1,670,744\n$3,152,611\n$1,508,591\n$1,471,169\n$2,979,760\nNet premiums earned\n$1,665,789\n$931,392\n$2,597,181\n$1,635,315\n$884,166\n$2,519,481\nUnderwriting profit (loss)\n$62,455\n$59,985\n$122,440\n$78,740\n$65,237\n$143,977\nLoss ratio\n63.9%\n59.8%\n62.5%\n64.8%\n59.2%\n62.8%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n32.4%\n33.8%\n32.8%\n30.4%\n33.4%\n31.5%\nCombined ratio\n96.3%\n93.6%\n95.3%\n95.2%\n92.6%\n94.3%\nP&C gross premiums written (\"GPW\") in the first quarter increased 6.6% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, GPW increased by 3.8%.\nThe Insurance segment GPW increased 6.4% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by favorable rate changes across business groups as well as stronger renewals. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Insurance GPW increased 4.1%.\nThe Reinsurance segment GPW increased by 6.9% from the prior year quarter primarily due to rate improvements. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, GPW increased 3.5%. New business written in the quarter from our Bermuda and London businesses was largely offset by canceled business, a reflection of disciplined underwriting.\nThe P&C loss ratio excluding PYD and the impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was 60.0%, compared to 58.1% in the prior year quarter. On the same basis, the Insurance segment loss ratio in the current quarter improved to 60.4%, compared to 60.8% in the prior year quarter as underwriting actions improved the overall portfolio. The Reinsurance segment loss ratio was 59.2% in the current quarter compared to 53.0% in the prior year quarter, largely driven by strategic initiatives including a shift in portfolio mix towards lower volatility and an increase in outward reinsurance protection.\nThe P&C combined ratio excluding PYD and the impact of catastrophe losses in the current quarter was 92.8%, compared to 89.5% for the prior year quarter. On the same basis, the Insurance segment combined ratio in the current quarter was 92.8%, compared to 91.2% for the prior year quarter driven largely by investment in the business and certain one-time compensation related costs. The Reinsurance segment combined ratio on the same basis was 92.9% in the current quarter, compared to 86.5% for the prior year quarter, due in part to the strategic portfolio mix and retrocession items noted above, combined with increased outward profit commission on positive PYD.\nThe P&C net favorable PYD resulting from the current quarter was $9.1 million (0.3 points to the loss ratio), compared to net unfavorable development of $24.0 million, (0.9 points to the loss ratio) in the prior year quarter. This reflects favorable development of $5.3 million in the Insurance segment and $3.8 million in the Reinsurance segment. The first quarter of 2018 includes adverse development of $53.2 million, or 2.6% of 2017 catastrophe losses. The first quarter of 2017 included adverse development of $75.0 million from the UK Ogden rate 6 change.\nFurther details of the results for the current quarter may be found in the Company's Financial Supplement and Earnings Presentation, each of which is dated May 2, 2018 and is available on the Investor Relations section of XL's website at www.xlgroup.com .\nAbout XL Group Ltd\nXL Group Ltd (NYSE: XL), through its subsidiaries and under the \"XL Catlin\" brand, is a global insurance and reinsurance company providing property, casualty and specialty products to industrial, commercial and professional firms, insurance companies and other enterprises throughout the world.

This decrease of discount rate, which was effective on March 20, 2017, is referred to as the UK Ogden rate table change in this press release.\n7 On May 1, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd (\"XLIB\") (on June 9, 2016, XLIB and XL Re Ltd amalgamated to form XL Bermuda Ltd), entered into a sale and purchase agreement with GreyCastle Holdings Ltd.

During 2015, we entered into another reinsurance agreement (the \"U.S. Term Life Retro Arrangements\") ceding the vast majority of the remaining life reinsurance business.\nNote 3: Common shares outstanding include all common shares issued and outstanding (as disclosed on the face of the balance sheet).\nNote 4: Fully diluted tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 11 of this press release for a reconciliation of fully diluted tangible book value per common share to fully diluted book value per common share.\nXL Group Ltd\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following is a reconciliation of XL's net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to operating net income (loss) and also includes the calculation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders and annualized return on average common shareholders' equity including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of Catlin-related integration costs and based on operating net income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are reflected within \"Net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets\" in the reconciliation above.\nNote 3: Defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding: (1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments available for sale - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized and change in net unrealized (gains) losses on equity securities - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized (gains) losses on investments (including OTTI) and change in net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (6) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (7) our share of items (2) and (5) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (8) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (9) our expenses related to the pending acquisition by AXA SA, (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our net (gains) losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (12) our net (gains) losses from the repurchase of preference shares, (13) tax provision arising from our write-down of our deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and (14) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income. We believe that showing \"operating net income (loss)\", \"annualized operating return on average common shareholders' equity including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of Catlin-related integration costs\" enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how we analyze our performance. In this regard, we believe that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it more difficult for users of our financial information to evaluate our underlying business. We also believe that equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons, and they request that we provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis. A reconciliation of our net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to operating net income (loss) is provided above.\nNote 4: Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is used to calculate per share data except when it is anti-dilutive to earnings per share or when there is a net loss. When it is anti-dilutive or when a net loss occurs, basic weighted average common shares outstanding is utilized in the calculation of net loss per share and net operating loss per share.\nNote 5 : Catlin-related integration costs were completed in the second quarter of 2017.\nComment on Regulation G\nXL presents its operations in ways it believes will be most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use XL's financial information in evaluating XL's performance. This press release includes the presentation of (i) operating net income (loss) (\"Operating Net Income\"), which is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders excluding:(1) our net investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (2) our net realized (gains) losses on investments available for sale - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (3) our net realized and change in net unrealized (gains) losses on equity securities - excluding Life Funds Withheld Assets, (4) our net realized (gains) losses on investments (including OTTI) and change in net unrealized (gains) losses on investments, trading - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (5) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, (6) our net realized and unrealized (gains) losses on life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, (7) our share of items (2) and (5) for our insurance company affiliates for the periods presented, (8) our foreign exchange (gains) losses, (9) our expenses related to the pending acquisition by AXA SA, (10) our gain on the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary XL Life Insurance and Annuity Company and the partial sale of our holdings in New Ocean Capital Management, (11) our net (gains) losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (12) our net (gains) losses from the repurchase of preference shares, (13) tax provision arising from our write-down of our deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and (14) a provision (benefit) for income tax on items excluded from operating income; (ii) annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (\"ROE\") based on operating net income (loss) (\"Operating ROE\") including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of Catlin-related integration costs and (iii) Fully diluted tangible book value per common share (common shareholders' equity excluding goodwill and intangible assets divided by the number of shares outstanding at the period end date combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issues at any period end). These items are \"non-GAAP financial measures\" as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in accordance with Regulation G is included in this press release on pages 10 and 11.\nAlthough the investment of premiums to generate income (or loss) and realized capital gains (or losses) is an integral part of our operations, the determination to realize capital gains (or losses), as well as absorb the volatility associated with marking our portfolio of public equity securities to market, is independent of the underwriting process. In addition, losses as the result of other-than-temporary declines in value and goodwill impairment charges are recognized in net income without actual realization. In this regard, certain users of our financial information, including certain rating agencies, evaluate earnings before tax and realized capital gains to understand the profitability of the operational sources of income without the effects of these variables. Furthermore, these users believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of capital gains is largely a function of economic and interest rate conditions.\nNet realized and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives include all derivatives entered into by XL other than certain credit derivatives and the life retrocession embedded derivative. With respect to credit derivatives, because XL and its insurance company operating affiliates generally hold financial guaranty contracts written in credit default derivative form to maturity, the net effects of the changes in fair value of these credit derivatives are excluded (similar with other companies' treatment of such contracts), as the changes in fair value each quarter are not indicative of underlying business performance.\nNet investment income - Life Funds Withheld Assets, and net realized (gains) losses on the life retrocession embedded derivative and derivative instruments - Life Funds Withheld Assets, have been excluded because, as a result of the GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangement, XL no longer shares in the risks and rewards of the underlying performance of the Life Funds Withheld Assets that support these retrocession arrangements. The returns on the Life Funds Withheld Assets are passed directly to the reinsurer pursuant to a contractual arrangement that is accounted for as a derivative. Therefore, net investment income from the Life Funds Withheld Assets and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with these GreyCastle Life Retro Arrangements are not relevant to XL's underlying business performance.\nForeign exchange (gains) losses in the income statement are only one element of the overall impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on XL's financial position and are not representative of any economic gain or loss made by XL. Accordingly, it is not a relevant indicator of financial performance and it is excluded.\nIn summary, XL evaluates the performance of and manages its business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting net income (loss), XL believes that showing operating net income (loss) enables investors and other users of XL's financial information to analyze XL's performance in a manner similar to how management of XL analyzes performance. In this regard, XL believes that providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) would make it much more difficult for users of XL's financial information to evaluate XL's underlying business. Also, as stated above, XL believes that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow XL (and the insurance industry as a whole) exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons and they request that XL provide this non-GAAP financial information on a regular basis.\nOperating ROE is a widely used measure of any company's profitability that is calculated by dividing annualized operating net income for any period other than a fiscal year when actual operating income is used by the average of the opening and closing common shareholders' equity. XL establishes target Operating ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If XL's Operating ROE targets are not met with respect to any line of business over time, XL seeks to re-evaluate these lines. Operating ROE including and excluding average AOCI, both inclusive and exclusive of Catlin-related integration costs, are additional measures of Company profitability. The most significant component of this exclusion is the mark to market fluctuations on XL's investment portfolio that have not been realized through sales, and/or distortions to XL's performance from Catlin-related integration costs related to the acquisition of Catlin. By providing these additional measures, users of our financial statements have the ability to include or exclude these items when considering our performance either on a standalone basis or for purposes of peer performance comparison.\nFully diluted tangible book value per common share (\"Fully diluted TBVPS\") is a widely used non-GAAP financial measure that, much like BVPS, represents the value generated for our common shareholders excluding items such as goodwill and other intangible assets. The exclusion of these amounts allow for more meaningful comparisons between peers, specifically those that have been less acquisitive. Fully diluted TBVPS is calculated by dividing common shareholders' equity excluding intangible assets by the number of outstanding common shares at the applicable period end combined with the impact from dilution of share-based compensation and certain conversion features where dilutive.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xl-group-ltd-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300641329.html\nSOURCE XL Group Ltd",
