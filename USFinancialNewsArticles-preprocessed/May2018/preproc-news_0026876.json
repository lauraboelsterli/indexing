    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc. (OTCQB: BAYK), holding company of Virginia Commonwealth Bank and VCB Financial Group, Inc., reported financial results for 2018.\nThe company reported net income of $1.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for 2018 compared to a net loss of $177 thousand, or $0.04 per diluted share, for 2017, and a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRandal R. Greene, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"I am pleased with the strong performance delivered by our team in 2018, evidenced by strong first quarter earnings, particularly when excluding nonrecurring items, and strong loan growth. In the last twelve months, we have completed the merger with Virginia BanCorp, relocated our headquarters to the vibrant Richmond area market, strengthened our capital position through a successful share offering, converted core operating systems to a single platform, and added key leaders to our management team. Our management team and growing team of lenders have positioned Virginia Commonwealth Bank for growth, while we strengthen the infrastructure required for a larger organization.\"\nResults for 2017 include the operations of the company prior to its merger with Virginia BanCorp Inc., which was effective April 1, 2017, thus are not comparable to 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 compared to Fourth Quarter 2017\nOperating Results\nIncome before income taxes for 2018 was $1.4 million compared to a loss before income taxes of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $10.7 million, on average interest-earning assets of $905.0 million, compared to $10.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, on average interest-earning assets of $900.6 million. Interest income in 2018 included accretion of acquired loan discounts of $503 thousand, while interest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $1.0 million of accretion of acquired loan discounts. Interest expense was $2.0 million and $1.9 million for 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, and cost of funds was of 0.95% and 0.92% for the linked quarter periods. Net interest margin was 3.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.82% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net interest margin excluding accretion of acquired loan discounts and amortization of fair value marks on time deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 3.58% 1 compared to 3.31% 1 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Provision for loan losses was $320 thousand for 2018, while provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.1 million. The company recorded $2.2 million of provision expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 for a consumer loan pool. Non-interest income for 2018 was $1.2 million compared to $733 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-interest income in 2018 included a gain of $352 thousand on the discontinuance of the company's post-retirement benefit plan effective March 1, 2018. Non-interest expenses for 2018 and fourth quarter of 2017 were $8.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively. Merger related expenses, including system conversion costs, were $363 thousand and $850 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, costs associated with the succession of the company's CFO and costs related to fees incurred in 2018 in the completion of the company's year-end reporting totaled approximately $1.0 million.\nBalance Sheet\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses, were $783.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $758.7 million at December 31, 2017, an annualized growth rate of nearly 13%. Total assets were $994.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $970.6 million at December 31, 2017. Deposits were $797.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $761.8 million at December 31, 2017. Non-interest-bearing accounts comprised 15.6% of total deposits, an increase from 13.5% at December 31, 2017. Shareholders' equity was $114.9 million and $114.6 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Tangible book value, calculated as shareholders' equity less goodwill and core deposit intangible assets, net of the associated deferred tax liability, divided by common shares outstanding, was $7.90 1 and $7.88 1 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Capital ratios for Virginia Commonwealth Bank were above regulatory minimum guidelines for well-capitalized banks as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Return on average assets and return on average equity, both annualized, were 0.46% and 3.92%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, while these same measures were (0.99)% and (8.24)% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets were $9.5 million, or 0.95% of total assets, as of March 31, 2018 compared to $10.8 million, or 1.11% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs to average loans was 0.09% and 0.50% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans was 1.00% and 1.01% at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The company's allowance for loan losses does not include discounts recorded on acquired loans. The ratio of allowance for loan losses plus remaining discounts on acquired loans to total gross loans (adding the remaining discounts on acquired loans) was 1.65% 1 and 1.76% 1 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOutlook\nGreene concluded: \"I believe we are well positioned to capture an under-served segment in our target markets. Recent consolidations have left a void, particularly in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas. A community bank nearing the $1 billion asset mark should benefit from the recent bank mergers. I am excited to share that we will soon have a base in Virginia Beach and see great potential with our team on the ground to grow both loans and deposits. At the same time, on the back side of 2017, we are addressing infrastructure needs to support and mitigate the risks that come with growth. There is much opportunity, yet much to accomplish. Our team is coming together to meet the challenge.\"\nAbout Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc.\nBay Banks of Virginia, Inc. is the bank holding company for Virginia Commonwealth Bank and VCB Financial Group, Inc.

Set forth above are calculations of each of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the\nSupplemental Financial Data tables. NIM, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments, ALL plus discounts on acquired loans to gross loans, and tangible book value per\nshare are supplemental financial measures that are not required nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes ALL plus discounts on acquired loans as\na percentage of gross loans and tangible book value per share are meaningful because they are measures management uses to assess asset quality and capital levels,\nrespectively. Management believes that NIM, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments is meaningful because management uses it to assess the financial\nperformance of the company. Calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported\nby other companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bay-banks-of-virginia-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-300645913.html\nSOURCE Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc.",
