    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta , May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raise Production Inc. (TSX-V:RPC) (\"Raise\" or the \"Company\") has released its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPRESIDENT’S UPDATE\nThe Company is pleased to provide an update to its shareholders on recent activities related to its operations.\nThe Company is actively working on finalizing financing to provide working capital for the next 18-24 months. The working capital will be used to purchase inventory, continue to develop the USA markets, add international clients to the portfolio, hire critical staff for commercialization and add a small production manufacturing expansion for rapid response to our existing shop facilities.\nHART (Horizontal Artificial Recovery Technology)\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it has received the “DEVICE” patent from the Canadian Patent Office (CPO) for the HART. This is in addition to the method patent previously announced. This means that the Company not only owns the patent for the method of multiple pumps deployed in a horizontal wellbore, the additional award protects the unique pump and associated equipment design and function.\nThe Company is in the process of securing a partner for deployment of the HART in the USA who will provide a more productive wellbore with improved economic benefits. The Company believes that it will have a customer this year and all indicators are this will be in the USA. HART system deployment will commence at that time. A minor modification to the activation system is the only item to be resolved for the deeper, longer and more productive wellbores.\nHARP (High Angle Reciprocating Pump)\nThe HARP is now commercial in Canada and the Company is undergoing slight material modifications for the USA market to make it better suited to deeper, higher fluid load wells in the USA. Initial tests in the USA have proven the pump to be viable at high angles with significantly increased productivity . The Company has installs slated for May and June 2018 and it expects the USA market to be a significant contributor in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.\nThe Canadian market has slowed due to spring breakup; however, the Company has a number of installs to complete after this period. The Company is confident that it can achieve a higher level of customer engagement and continued increase in sales through technical forums to gain wider acceptance of this technology. Shareholders are encouraged to view the website to see results from recent installs comparative to conventional pumps.\nHALS (High Angle Lift Solution)\nAs stated previously in the Company’s press release dated April 10, 2018, the Company received a contract from a major Canadian producer to design and supply two HALS systems for use in a heavy oil application. Since that time, the Company has received more interest for this product here in Canada, USA and overseas. The majority of interest is for running the HALS in conjunction with an ESP (Electrical Submersible Pump). ESP’s currently make up the highest volume by revenue of all artificial lift solutions.\nUpcoming\nThe Company is excited for the coming 12-24 months and believes that with a new financial injection for working capital, more focus on commercialization of the HARP and HALS, and less cash allocated to research & development projects, it is going in the right direction to obtain market penetration and success. The Company would like to thank all shareholders for their continued support and encouragement.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss 2017 2016 Revenue $ 333,824 $ 220,835 Cost of sales 258,838 169,818 Gross margin 74,986 51,017 Other income 22,381 14,437 Expenses: General and administration 1,576,892 1,334,477 Stock-based compensation 330,786 84,390 Depreciation and amortization 100,703 140,788 Research expenses 98,790 94,555 Loss on derecognition of assets – 90,719 Finance costs 7,840 15,771 2,115,011 1,760,700 Net loss and comprehensive loss $ (2,017,644) $ (1,695,246) Net loss per share – basic and diluted $ (0.02) $ (0.02)\nAbout Raise Production Inc.\nThe Company is an innovative oilfield service company that focuses its efforts on the production service sector, utilizing its proprietary products to enhance and increase ultimate production in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells.\nFor further information please contact:\nEric Laing, President and Chief Executive Officer\nE-mail: elaing@raiseproduction.com\nSusan Scullion, Chief Financial Officer\nE-mail: sscullion@raiseproduction.com\nRaise Production Inc.\n2620-58 th Avenue S.E.\nCalgary, Alberta T2C 1G5\nTel: (403) 699-7675\nWeb site at: www.raiseproduction.com\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nCertain information included in this news release constitutes forward-looking statements under applicable securities legislation.
