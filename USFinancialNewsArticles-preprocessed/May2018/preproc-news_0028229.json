(NASDAQ:BDSI) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on recent business highlights.\n“BELBUCA® prescription growth this quarter was strong, showing an increase of 9% over the fourth quarter of last year and 55% year-over-year,” said Scott Plesha, President of BioDelivery Sciences. “Notably, we have reached an all-time high in monthly BELBUCA prescriptions in March and weekly prescription sales through the month of April continue to be strong. Driving strength this quarter was the recently completed sales force expansion, allowing us to increase both our number of target healthcare professionals and the reach and frequency.”\n“Another key driver of growth was improvements in our managed care contracting, where we continued to add new managed care contracts and improve on existing ones. We are seeing a meaningful benefit from our recently effective contracts with Humana, ProCareRx and CVS/Caremark,” continued Mr. Plesha. “On the legislative and regulatory front, we are seeing substantial activity around the current opioid epidemic and a recognition of the need for responsible opioid prescribing and for Schedule III opioid alternatives such as buprenorphine with less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids. We believe all of these factors: our focused sales efforts, improved managed care contracting, and an underlying need for alternatives in the marketplace, position us well for continued growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nIn the first quarter of 2018, BDSI recorded total net revenue of $11.3 million, a 19% increase year-over-year versus $9.5 million on a comparable basis. While reported revenue in 2017 was $29.5 million, it included the recognition of $20.0 million of deferred revenue associated with the termination of BDSI’s previous license agreement for BELBUCA with Endo.\nTotal net revenue for BELBUCA (buprenorphine) buccal film and BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film in the first quarter of 2018 was $8.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, versus $9.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $4.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $16.0 million, compared to $21.6 million and $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017, respectively.\nNet loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $10.6 million, or ($0.18) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $16.2 million, or ($0.29) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to net income of $48.3 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, BDSI had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.1 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $21.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nRECENT COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS\nAppointed Herm Cukier as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors effective May 8, 2018. Herm brings a strong background in commercial operations leadership to BDSI.\nAchieved strong BELBUCA growth in the first quarter, with total prescription sales increasing 9% over the prior quarter.\nBELBUCA total prescriptions reached their highest monthly total to date with over 10,000 prescriptions in March.\nCompleted expansion of sales force increasing the number of territory managers from 65 to 85 and regional sales managers from 5 to 9. This translates into coverage of an additional 3,500 plus healthcare providers and the reach and frequencies with high potential targets.\nEffective January 30, 2018, BELBUCA was commercially available in Canada via BDSI’s exclusive agreement with Purdue (Canada). BDSI has received upfront and milestone payments under this agreement and is eligible for additional milestones and royalties on net sales.\nConference Call & Webcast Thursday, May 10 @ 4:30pm Eastern Time Domestic: 800-289-0438 International: 323-794-2423 Passcode: 5157508 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129149 Replays available through May 24: Domestic: 844-512-2921 International: 412-317-6671 Conference ID: 5157508 About BioDelivery Sciences International\nBioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.
