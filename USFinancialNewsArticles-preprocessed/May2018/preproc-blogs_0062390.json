    "text": "Singapore Airlines to launch world's longest flight Share David Reid | @cnbcdavy Published 6 Hours Ago\nSingapore Airlines has announced it will launch the world's longest non-stop flight route in October, using an aircraft that offers no economy class.\nThe airline will begin a once-daily journey in both directions between Singapore's Changi Airport and Newark Liberty Airport, which serves New York City.\nThe first flight takes off on October 11 and will travel more than 10,000 miles to New York, according to the airline's press release . Singapore said the journey should take just shy of 19 hours.\nThe aircraft, an Airbus A350-900ULR, will feature 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats.\nSingapore Airlines said non-stop Singapore-Los Angeles flights are also planned, with details to be announced at a later date.\nWith long-haul planes getting ever more efficient, CNBC takes a look at the current routes guaranteed to wear out any hardened traveler. Dallas/Fort Worth — Sydney\nShortest total time: 16 hours, 50 minutes Length: 8,578 miles Yury Prokopenko | Getty Images\nOperated by Qantas, this flight was the first non-stop on the route, when the Australian airline started using an Airbus A380 in 2014. The return route from Sydney, however, was already non-stop, and began in 2011. Houston — Sydney\nShortest total time: 17 hours, 30 minutes Length: 8,596 miles Tim Leviston | EyeEm | Getty Images Houston, Texas\nUnited Airlines began UA101 in January this year, using Boeing's 787-9. Crossing the International Date Line across the Pacific Ocean, travelers arrive two days after departure. Los Angeles — Singapore\nShortest total time: 17 hours, 00 minutes Length: 8,770 miles Getty Images A Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by United Airlines takes off from Los Angeles International Airport.\nUnited first operated this service in October 2017. The flight holds the distance record for any current flight flying to or from the U.S. That should change when Qantas launches nonstop flights between Melbourne and San Francisco in September. Auckland — Dubai\nShortest total time: 17 hours, 05 minutes Length: 8,824 miles Airbus An Airbus A380 in Emirates livery.\nEmirates EK449 is a non-stop Airbus A380 route. After departing New Zealand it is almost four hours before you even reach the east coast of Australia. Anyone who stays awake should be able to see the south coast of India before the descent into the Middle East. Perth — London Heathrow\nShortest total time: 17 hours, 20 minutes Length: 9,010 miles Source: Qantas The newest Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner for Sydney, Australia-based Qantas features artwork honoring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.\nIn March, the Boeing 787-9, operated under Qantas ' QF9 code, became only one of two current routes to fly direct more than 9,000 miles. The Dreamliner sets off on its non-stop run to London at 6.50 p.m. AWST, reaching Heathrow at 5.10 a.m. London time the following day. Auckland — Doha\nShortest total time: 17 hours, 40 minutes Length: 9,032 miles Leslie Josephs | CNBC A Qatar Airways Boeing 777 In New York.\nThe longest current flight you can take flies you from New Zealand to the capital of Qatar. A Boeing 777-200LR performs the haul, which was first completed in February 2017. ",
