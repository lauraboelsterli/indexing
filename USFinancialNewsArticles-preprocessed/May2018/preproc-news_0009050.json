    "text": "WARSAW, April 30 (Reuters) - Labour unions at Poland’s national airline LOT will not start a strike on May 1 as planned, their representative said on Monday.\nAdam Rzeszot told a televised news conference the trade unions “have together taken a decision to suspend the strike”, citing their responsibilities to LOT’s employees and passengers.\nLabour unions demanding that LOT changes the way it compensates employees said last week they would begin a strike on Tuesday that could lead to delays at Warsaw Chopin airport.\nLOT’s management board said the strike would be illegal, an opinion that was upheld by a Warsaw court.\nGerman airline Lufthansa cancelled some of its flights this month after labour union Verdi said it would extend strikes to airports to apply more pressure in pay talks.
