    "text": "Company Bolsters Leadership Team to Support High Growth\nPALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bill.com , the leading U.S. business payments network, today announced the appointment of Yael Zheng as Chief Marketing Officer and Vinay Pai as Senior Vice President of Engineering, adding experienced leadership to the company’s existing, strong executive team. Both taking on newly created roles, Zheng will lead all marketing functions to drive awareness, demand and growth, while Pai will lead technology teams, building out and strengthening the Bill.com product portfolio.\n“The digitization of business payments is drastically simplifying how business gets done. By converting businesses from using paper checks to fast and sophisticated digital payments tightly integrated with accounting software, Bill.com is transforming how businesses pay and get paid. Both Vinay and Yael bring a track record of driving tremendous growth, and their leadership will enable us to continue to partner with top banks and leading accounting software providers and provide all businesses with our innovative payments solution,” said Bill.com CEO Renė Lacerte.\nOver the course of her 20-plus-year career, Zheng has led marketing teams at technology companies positioning them for rapid growth and achieving market-leading positions. As Vice President of Marketing on the executive team at VMware, she led the corporate and worldwide marketing teams and oversaw key initiatives that supported the company's hyper growth to a post-IPO, multi-billion-dollar company. Most recently, Zheng was the Chief Marketing Officer at Tintri, where she grew the marketing team and operation and was instrumental in its IPO.\n“As a leader, Bill.com has already experienced vast success, building a network with millions of members and fostering partnerships with some of the most trusted banks, technology partners and accounting firms. Still, there’s massive opportunity for growth as businesses continue to realize the efficiency of digital business payments,” said Zheng. “My experience working with high-growth companies will translate well in leading the marketing organization through this next phase of expansion.”\nPrior to joining Bill.com , Pai was SVP of Engineering at First Data, where he led engineering for a point of sale product line within the company. Prior, as VP for Intuit Developer Platform, Pai led the business segment responsible for the QuickBooks ecosystem of third-party applications and developers. As the company’s VP of Engineering, Pai was responsible for the development of QuickBooks Online from 300,000 to 1.5 million customers. Pai has also held engineering leadership roles at Cassatt, Sun Microsystems and Schlumberger.\n“Managing payments is essential to businesses, and an efficient payment platform requires advanced technology, scalability and operational rigor,” said Pai. “Bill.com has augmented its SaaS platform with the latest AI and machine learning technology to streamline payments, guard against fraud and reduce cumbersome data entry for many businesses. The highly scalable and flexible platform will continue to support and delight the rapidly growing customer base and ecosystem of partners.”\nAbout Bill.com\nBill.com is the leading business payments network with 3 million members processing over $52 billion per year in payment volume. Bill.com helps businesses connect and do business by saving them more than 50 percent of the time typically spent on financial back-office operations. Bill.com partners with four of the top 10 largest U.S. banks, more than half of the top 100 accounting firms, major accounting software providers including Intuit and Xero, and is the preferred provider of digital payments solutions for CPA.com , the technology arm of the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Recognized as one of San Francisco Business Times’ and Silicon Valley Business Journal’s “2018 Best Places to Work,” Bill.com is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. The company has $200M in funding with its most recent investors including Temasek and JP Morgan Chase.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006395/en/\nSutherlandGold Group for Bill.com\nSarah Shaev\nbill.com@sutherlandgold.com\nSource: Bill.com",
