Return on equity reached 7.2%.\nNet profit after elimination of non-recurring items was NIS 169 million, a growth of 22.5% over the corresponding quarter last year. Return on equity after elimination of the above-mentioned items reached 9% in comparison to 7.7% in the corresponding period last year.\nPayroll expenses of a nonrecurring nature were NIS 45 million due to a provision for an award claimed by employees of the Bank. The Bank appealed a Court decision in the matter and also obtained a stay of execution order. The effect of this provision on the return on equity amounted to a reduction of 1.5%.\nFurthermore, the Bank recognized a one-time expense of NIS 24 million in respect of a provision for efficiency measures taken at Otzar Hachayal. The effect of this provision on the return on equity amounted to a further reduction of 0.8% in the return on equity.\nThe combined effect of these two non-recurring items on the return on equity amounted to 2.3%. With the offset from a gain on the sale of the building of the Group's bank based in Switzerland, the net reduction effect of the nonrecurring items on the return on equity amounted to 1.8%.\nProfitability after elimination of items of a nonrecurring nature\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nIn NIS millions\nNet profit for the period\n137\n166\nNet after tax effect of:\nGains on sale of the building in Switzerland and of the sale last year\nof floor space in an office building in Tel Aviv\n13\n28\nProvision for an award claim by employees\n(29)\n-\nProvision for efficiency measures at Otzar Hachayal\n(16)\n-\nProfit after elimination on nonrecurring effects\n169\n138\n%\n%\nReturn on equity (net of nonrecurring effects)\n9.0\n7.7\nEfficiency ratio\n74.8\n68.8\nEfficiency ratio (Net of nonrecurring effects)\n69.2\n71.9\nGrowth\nFinancing profit from current operations increased by 9.6% (NIS 54 million), amounting to NIS 618 million.

Including the non-recurring expenses, the efficiency ratio amounted to 74.8%.\nAn agreement for the sale of the head office building of Otzar Hachayal was signed on May 23, 2018. The net gain on the sale of these rights amounted to NIS 37 million and is expected to be recognized in the second quarter upon conclusion of the transaction.\nFinancial Stability\nThe growth trend continued in the equity attributed to the shareholders , which grew by 4.2% to NIS 7,772 million.

At the same time, the Bank strictly maintains its financial stability and an appropriate risk level, alongside with the growth in income of the Bank.\n\"The results for the quarter include a provision for future efficiency measures that will be implemented at Otzar Hachayal, which will allow us to continue and improve the efficiency of the Group, improve stability and our ability to compete in the banking market, particularly in the household and small business segments.\"\nCONDENSED PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PRINCIPAL EXECUTION INDICES\nPrincipal financial ratios\nFor the three months\nended\nFor the\nyear\nended\n2018\n2017\n2017\nin %\nExecution indices\nReturn on equity(1)\n7.2%\n9.3%\n9.1%\nReturn on assets(1)\n0.4%\n0.5%\n0.5%\nRatio of equity capital tier 1\n10.07%\n10.12%\n10.38%\nLeverage ratio\n5.56%\n5.54%\n5.50%\nLiquidity coverage ratio\n120%\n128%\n123%\nEfficiency ratio\n74.8%\n68.8%\n69.5%\nEfficiency ratio excluding certain components\n69.2%\n71.9%\n70.0%\nCredit quality indices\nRatio of provision for credit losses to credit to the public\n1.02%\n1.05%\n1.03%\nRatio of impaired debts or in arrears of 90 days or more to credit to the public\n0.91%\n1.20%\n0.95%\nRatio of provision for credit losses to total impaired credit to the public\n162%\n111%\n155%\nRatio of net write-offs to average total credit to the public(1)\n0.08%\n0.30%\n0.18%\nRatio of expenses for credit losses to average total credit to the public(1)\n0.13%\n0.17%\n0.15%\nPrincipal data from the statement of income\nFor the three months\nended\n2018\n2017\nNIS million\nNet profit attributed to shareholders of the Bank\n137\n166\nInterest Income, net\n584\n562\nExpenses from credit losses\n27\n34\nTotal non Interest income\n401\n388\nOf which: Fees\n338\n334\nTotal operating and other expenses\n737\n654\nOf which: Salaries and related expenses\n*446\n403\nPrimary net profit per share of NIS 0.05 par value (NIS)\n1.37\n1.65\n* Including provision in respect of claims by the Bank employees for an award, following the implications of a court\nverdict regarding the claim by the representative committee of managers.\nPrincipal data from the balance sheet\nAs of\n31.3.18\n31.3.17\n31.12.17\nNIS million\nTotal assets\n132,636\n128,518\n135,717\nof which: Cash and deposits with banks\n34,481\n30,255\n39,186\nSecurities\n10,471\n14,675\n10,238\nCredit to the public, net\n81,904\n77,993\n80,378\nTotal liabilities\n124,566\n120,442\n127,333\nof which: Deposits from banks\n359\n716\n1,133\nDeposits from the public\n111,913\n106,198\n113,511\nBonds and subordinated capital notes\n4,980\n5,575\n5,249\nCapital attributed to the shareholders of the Bank\n7,772\n7,456\n7,756\nAdditional data\nAs of\n31.3.18\n31.3.17\n31.12.17\nShare price (0.01 NIS)\n7,390\n5,895\n7,202\nDividend per share (NIS)\n95\n70\n309\nRatio of fees to assets (in %)(1)\n1.0%\n1.0%\n1.0%\n(1) Annualized.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\n(NIS million)\nFor the three months\nended March 31\nFor the year\nEnded\nDecember 31\nNOTE\n2018\n2017\n2017\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nInterest Income\n2\n654\n640\n2,704\nInterest Expenses\n2\n70\n78\n402\nInterest Income, net\n584\n562\n2,302\nExpenses from credit losses\n6,12\n27\n34\n121\nNet Interest Income after expenses from credit losses\n557\n528\n2,181\nNon Interest Income\nNon Interest Financing income\n3\n40\n12\n83\nFees\n338\n334\n1,305\nOther income\n23\n42\n62\nTotal non Interest income\n401\n388\n1,450\nOperating and other expenses\nSalaries and related expenses\n446\n*403\n*1,579\nMaintenance and depreciation of premises and equipment\n96\n99\n380\nAmortizations and impairment of intangible assets\n23\n23\n94\nOther expenses\n172\n*129\n*554\nTotal operating and other expenses\n737\n654\n2,607\nProfit before taxes\n221\n262\n1,024\nProvision for taxes on profit\n82\n97\n358\nProfit after taxes\n139\n165\n666\nThe bank's share in profit of equity-basis investee, after taxes\n6\n10\n54\nNet profit:\nBefore attribution to noncontrolling interests\n145\n175\n720\nAttributed to noncontrolling interests\n(8)\n(9)\n(42)\nAttributed to shareholders of the Bank\n137\n166\n678\nNIS\nPrimary profit per share attributed to the shareholders of the Bank\nNet profit per share of NIS 0.05 par value\n1.37\n1.65\n6.76\n* Restated in view of the application of amendment No. 2017-07 of the Codification, regarding improvement of the\npresentation of pension and other post-retirement benefits.
