    "text": "Announces First Quarter 2018 Investment Activity of $107.8 Million\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nReported first quarter 2018 total revenue of $105.2 million, up 37% year-over-year. Generated first quarter net income per share and OP unit of $0.06 on a fully diluted basis, compared to net income per share and OP unit of $0.04 on a fully diluted basis in the same period last year. Generated first quarter normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $0.26 per share and OP unit on a fully diluted basis. Completed first quarter investments of approximately $107.8 million, which included the acquisition of 2 healthcare facilities, totaling 220,140 leasable square feet. Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share and OP unit for the first quarter 2018, paid April 18, 2018. Portfolio was 96.6% leased based on square footage as of March 31, 2018. Same-Store Cash Net Operating Income (NOI) growth was 2.6% year over year.\nSubsequent Events Highlights:\nClosed an additional $71.3 million investment subsequent to the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE: DOC) (the “Company,” the “Trust,” “we,” “our” and “us”), a self-managed healthcare real estate investment trust, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJohn T. Thomas, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Trust, commented, “Physicians Realty Trust delivered a very solid and steady performance during the first three months of 2018. Medical office is and remains the best long term performing health care real estate in this environment, and perhaps the best noncyclical real estate there is. As expected, the capital markets have transitioned away from public REIT equities, driven by material increases in the 10-year US Treasury interest rate. Nevertheless, the underlying performance of our medical office facilities was outstanding, as we delivered another strong quarter of same store NOI growth and excellent results from operations. We are very pleased with the three acquisitions completed, including one early this quarter, as well as the progress we are making on our asset disposition and recycling plans. We look forward to discussing our results with you during our earnings call on May 4th.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $105.2 million, an increase of 37% from the same period in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the portfolio was 96.6% leased, excluding assets classified as held for sale.\nTotal expenses for the first quarter 2018 were $94.0 million, an increase of 34% from the same period in 2017. The increase in expenses was primarily the result of a $10.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $8.4 million increase in operating expenses, and a $6.7 million increase in interest expense.\nNet income for the first quarter 2018 increased to $11.3 million, compared to net income of $6.7 million for the first quarter 2017, an increase of 69%.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter 2018 was $10.4 million. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2018 was $0.06 based on 187.3 million weighted average common shares and OP units outstanding.\nFunds from operations (FFO) for the first quarter 2018 consisted of net income, less $0.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for partially owned properties, less $0.5 million of preferred distributions, plus $38.5 million of depreciation and amortization, less $0.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense for partially owned properties, less $0.1 million of gain on sale of investment properties, resulting in $0.26 per diluted share. Normalized FFO, which adjusts for net changes in fair value, was $49.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share.\nNormalized funds available for distribution (FAD) for the first quarter 2018, which consists of normalized FFO adjusted for non-cash share compensation, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above-market and below-market leases, amortization of assumed debt, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of deferred financing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and seller master lease and rent abatement payments, was $43.0 million for the first quarter 2018.\nOur same-store portfolio, which includes 215 properties representing approximately 70% of our net leasable square footage, generated year-over-year Same-Store NOI growth of 2.6% for the first quarter 2018. Same-Store data for the first quarter 2018 excludes 23 assets slated for disposition and the Kennewick MOB.\nAssets Slated for Disposition\nWe consider 23 properties in six states, representing an aggregate of approximately 921,515 square feet of gross leasable area, to be slated for disposition as of March 31, 2018. These assets include 15 assets classified as held for sale, and eight additional properties which we believe no longer meet our core business strategy from a size, age, geography, or line of business perspective.\nOther Recent Events\nDividend Paid\nOn March 23, 2018, our Board of Trustees authorized and declared a cash distribution of $0.23 per common share for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2018. The distribution was paid on April 18, 2018 to common shareholders and OP Unit holders of record as of the close of business on April 3, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Investment Activity\nIn the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company completed acquisitions of two operating healthcare properties and one land parcel located in three states with approximately 220,140 net leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $99.4 million. In addition, the Company completed a noncontrolling interest buyout of $6.4 million and a $2.0 million loan investment, resulting in total investment activity for the quarter of approximately $107.8 million.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold two medical office buildings located in Michigan and Florida for approximately $2.5 million and recognized a net gain on the sale of both properties totaling approximately $0.1 million.\nRecent Investment Activity\nSince March 31, 2018, the Company acquired one medical office facility for a purchase price of approximately $71.3 million. The acquisition is described below.\nHMG Medical Plaza - On April 3, 2018, the Company closed the acquisition of a 231,486 square foot medical office facility in Kingsport, Tennessee, for a purchase price of approximately $71.3 million. This single-tenant facility opened in 2009 and is 100% leased. Services provided in this facility consist of clinical research, general surgery, orthopedics, primary care, urgent care, and laboratory, among others. The first year unlevered yield on this investment is expected to be approximately 6.0%.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial performance and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.

For purposes of the SEC’s Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the company, or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. As used in this press release, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that information regarding FFO is helpful to shareholders and potential investors because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP units, excluding preferred distributions, gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment write-downs on depreciable assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs). Our FFO computation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT definition or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. The GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, net income, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, impairments and noncontrolling interests. In computing FFO, we eliminate these items because, in our view, they are not indicative of the results from the operations of our properties. To facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as presented in our financial statements. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered to be an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nWe use Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, acquisition expenses, acceleration of deferred financing costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and other normalizing items. However, our use of the term Normalized FFO may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance or of cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), or as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nWe define Normalized FAD, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes from Normalized FFO non-cash share compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above- or below-market leases and assumed debt, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of deferred financing costs, and recurring capital expenditures related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and includes cash payments from seller master leases and rent abatement payments. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating Normalized FAD, and accordingly, our computation may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although our computation of Normalized FAD may not be comparable to that of other REITs, we believe Normalized FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance due to its frequency of use by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a REIT. Normalized FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to controlling interest (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an indicator of our financial performance. Normalized FAD should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss, computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from our total portfolio of properties before general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment losses. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above and below market leases, and other non-cash and normalizing items. Other non-cash and normalizing items include items such as the amortization of lease inducements, payments received from seller master leases and rent abatements, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. We believe that Cash NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because it excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. Our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as such other companies may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nWe define EBITDAre as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, loss (gain) on dispositions, and impairment loss on depreciated property. We define Adjusted EBITDAre as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, loss (gain) on dispositions, impairment loss on depreciated property, acquisition expenses, non-cash share compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value, and other normalizing items. We consider EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre important measures because they provide additional information to allow management, investors, and our current and potential creditors to evaluate and compare our core operating results and our ability to service debt.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005314/en/\nPhysicians Realty Trust\nJohn T.
