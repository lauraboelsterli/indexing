    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR) (“Matador”) announced today that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock. The total estimated gross proceeds of the offering, before estimated offering fees and expenses, are approximately $229.3 million. The offering is expected to close on May 17, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nMatador intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the acquisition of leasehold and mineral acres in the Delaware Basin, including additional drilling and completion expenditures directly attributable to increased working interests, to fund the capital expenditures related to a number of midstream initiatives in the Delaware Basin and for general corporate purposes. Pending such uses, Matador intends to repay all outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and invest the remaining funds in short-term marketable securities.\nRBC Capital Markets is acting as the sole underwriter for the offering. The underwriter may offer the shares of Matador’s common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.\nWhen available, copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement, prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained free of charge on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) website at www.sec.gov or by sending a request to:\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC\nAttn: Equity Syndicate\n200 Vesey Street, 8th Floor\nNew York, NY 10281-8098\nTelephone: (877) 822-4089\nE-mail: equityprospectus@rbccm.com\nThe shares of common stock will be offered and sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the SEC. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nAbout Matador Resources Company\nMatador is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with an emphasis on oil and natural gas shale and other unconventional plays.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and include any statement that does not directly relate to a current or historical fact. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “could,” “believe,” “would,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “continue,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “project,” “hypothetical,” “forecasted” and similar expressions that are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about guidance, projected or forecasted financial and operating results, results in certain basins, objectives, project timing, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements, and such forward-looking statements may not prove to be accurate. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following risks related to financial and operational performance: general economic conditions; Matador’s ability to execute its business plan, including whether its drilling program is successful; changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices and the demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; its ability to replace reserves and efficiently develop current reserves; costs of operations; delays and other difficulties related to producing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; its ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; its ability to integrate acquisitions; availability of sufficient capital to execute its business plan, including from future cash flows, increases in its borrowing base and otherwise; weather and environmental conditions; the operating results of Matador’s midstream joint venture’s expansion of the Black River cryogenic processing plant; the timing and operating results of the buildout by Matador’s midstream joint venture of oil, natural gas and water gathering and transportation systems and the drilling of any additional salt water disposal wells; and other important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. For further discussions of risks and uncertainties, you should refer to Matador’s filings with the SEC, including the “Risk Factors” section of Matador’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Matador undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release, except as required by law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515005942/en/\nMatador Resources Company\nMac Schmitz, 972-371-5225\nCapital Markets Coordinator\ninvestors@matadorresources.com\nSource: Matador Resources Company",
