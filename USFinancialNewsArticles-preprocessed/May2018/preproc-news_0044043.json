However, this is unlikely to be the end of tension between the two countries,” said Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist for Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ** “The good news is that markets should learn to live with it and consider its impact more rationally,” he added. ** Transport firms, in particular shipping companies, led the rally on the mainland, with Cosco Shipping Holdings up 8.9 percent. Analysts said the “ceasefire” of the trade war is positive for shipping demand and port throughput. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index rose 0.47 percent while Japan’s Nikkei index was up 0.45 percent. ** The yuan was Quote: d at 6.3809 per U.S. dollar, 0.07 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3767. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Inner Mongolia Lantai Industrial Co Ltd up 10.05 percent, followed by CSD Water Service Co Ltd gaining 10.01 percent and Shanghai Emperor of Cleaning Hi-Tech Co Ltd up by 10 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Shandong Tyan Home Co Ltd down 5.01 percent, followed by China Wafer Level CSP Co Ltd losing 3.61 percent and Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co Ltd down by 3.55 percent. ** The top gainers among H-shares were China Gas Holdings Ltd up 6.99 percent, followed by Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd gaining 3.23 percent and PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd up by 2.12 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were China Shenhua Energy Co Ltd which has fallen 2.05 percent, China Resources Land Ltd which has lost 1.8 percent and CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd down by 1.3 percent. ** As of 04:00 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 21.63 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.\nReporting by Luoyan Liu and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
