    "text": "FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Vodafone’s $21.8 billion deal to buy Liberty Global’s operations in continental Europe would distort competition in Germany, the CEO of Deutsche Telekom said on Wednesday.\nThe acquisition would create “a giant preening with its convergent technology”, Tim Hoettges said, reiterating his earlier opposition to a deal that he said would recreate a dominant cable TV operator.\nHoettges also said that, in light of the transaction, he would seek clarification on whether Deutsche Telekom should remain subject to market regulation in Germany that requires it to open its own network to third party players and imposes price controls.\n“I personally will fight for fair competition for our customers, to ensure that we do not face a disadvantage,” he said on a results conference call, in answer to a question on the Vodafone-Liberty merger.
