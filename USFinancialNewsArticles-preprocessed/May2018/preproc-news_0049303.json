    "text": "Above $85,000 $428.60\nFor people affected by the provision, the rule means they won't see their Social Security check get lowered in any given year if paying more for Part B would reduce it. (The premiums are typically deducted from Social Security checks.)\nWhen the premium jumped to $134 in 2017 from $121.80 the previous year, 70 percent of Medicare Part B enrollees instead paid an average of $109 due to already being held harmless in previous years with meager COLA increases.\nAnd although the Part B premium hasn't changed from last year's $134, the extra money generated from the 2 percent Social Security COLA for 2018 is going toward the difference between what most recipients were paying and the standard premium amount.\nEven for those whose checks are more than last year, just 7 percent said the boost is more than $25. show chapters 10:54 AM ET Wed, 2 May 2018 | 01:36\n\"Social Security increases, even when they come, are not huge and don't really make any meaningful difference in quality of life,\" said Kathryn Hauer, a certified financial planner with Wilson David Investment Advisors.\nThe survey also showed that 7 percent of respondents said their check is lower. Johnson, of the Senior Citizens League, said those people have uncommon circumstances that led to a lower check, none of which are related to the hold harmless provision. \"Social Security increases, even when they come, are not huge and don't really make any meaningful difference in quality of life.\" -Kathryn Hauer, certified financial planner with Wilson David Investment Advisors\nExactly whether retirees will be shelling out more from their Social Security checks next year for Part B depends both on whether those premiums rise and what the Social Security Administration determines the 2019 COLA will be.\nLast July the Medicare trustees report forecast that 2019 Part B monthly premiums will remain at about $134. After that, they are expected to rise about 5 percent each year through 2026. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid typically announces the next year's premium amount in November.\nThe 2019 Social Security COLA, meanwhile, is scheduled to be announced in October.
