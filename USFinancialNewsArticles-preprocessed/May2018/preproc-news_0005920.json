    "text": "BRASILIA, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. government called off negotiations with Brazil on tariffs over U.S. protectionist measures and reinstated tariffs and quotas on imports of Brazilian steel and aluminum, according to a statement by the Brazilian government on Wednesday.\nThe United States had announced on April 30 that it had reached a preliminary agreement with Brazil. But negotiators had broken off talks on April 26, giving the Brazilian industry the choice of picking between tariffs or quotas, the statement said.\nBrazilâ€™s aluminum industry opted for 10 percent import tariffs, while the steel industry opted for an imports quota system, according to the statement issued jointly by the Foreign and Trade Ministries.
