    "text": "Interim Analysis for Phase 3 HONOR study of Tonmya® in Military-Related PTSD\nExpected in Third Quarter of 2018\nNEW YORK, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq:TNXP) (Tonix), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing pharmaceutical products to treat serious neuropsychiatric conditions and biological products to improve biodefense, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“In April 2018, we announced enrollment of 50% of the planned total number of participants for the Phase 3 HONOR study, and we continue to expect an interim analysis on this first 50% of participants in the third quarter of 2018,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also recently announced receiving Investigational New Drug (IND) clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer’s disease (AAD). Leveraging the existing safety and tolerance data for TNX-102 SL and our understanding of its mechanism of action, this IND allows us to start a Phase 2, potentially pivotal efficacy study in AAD. It further supports the potential use of TNX-102 SL in multiple therapeutic areas.”\nUpcoming Milestones and Recent Program Highlights\nA pre-planned interim analysis based on the first 50% of randomized participants in the Phase 3 HONOR study of Tonmya* (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is anticipated in the third quarter of 2018 after the first 50% of patients have completed 12 weeks of treatment. Randomization of 50% of participants in the Phase 3 HONOR study was completed in April. Topline results from the full Phase 3 HONOR study of 550 participants (unless stopped for success at the interim analysis) anticipated in the first quarter of 2019. Received IND clearance by the FDA in May, supporting the initiation of a Phase 2 potential pivotal efficacy study of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease. Continued expansion of patent portfolio. U.S. Patent No. 9,918,948 issued, protecting the use of Tonmya for the treatment of PTSD. Upon approval, patent protection is expected until at least 2030. Japanese Patent No. 6,310,542 issued, protecting the eutectics and methods of manufacturing eutectic formulations. Upon approval, patent protection is expected until at least 2034.\n*Tonmya has been conditionally accepted by the FDA as the proposed trade name for TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for PTSD. TNX-102 SL is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAt March 31, 2018, Tonix had $19.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $25.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash used in operations was $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $5.2 million, compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was largely due to a multiple-dose, randomized, open-label, pharmacokinetic bridging study that was conducted primarily in the first quarter of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2017. This decrease is due primarily to a reduction in compensation-related expenses including decreases in cash and stock-based compensation.\nNet loss was $6.9 million, or $0.88 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net loss of $5.1 million, or $1.27 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, excluding non-cash expenditures of $0.4 million, was $6.5 million, as compared to a net loss, excluding non-cash expenditures of $0.6 million, of $4.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The higher net loss was primarily due to increased research and development expenses.\nAbout Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.\nTonix is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing pharmaceutical products to treat serious neuropsychiatric conditions and biological products to improve biodefense through potential medical counter-measures. Tonix’s lead product candidate, Tonmya, or TNX-102 SL, is in Phase 3 development as a bedtime treatment for PTSD. Tonix is also developing TNX-102 SL as a bedtime treatment for agitation in Alzheimer’s disease and has received Investigational New Drug (IND) clearance from the U.S. FDA to support the initiation of a Phase 2 efficacy study.
