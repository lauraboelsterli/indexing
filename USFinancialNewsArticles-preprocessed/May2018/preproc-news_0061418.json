    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 1:14 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago Japan suffer defeat with revamped formation under new coach Jack Tarrant 3 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - New Japan manager Akira Nishino deployed a new formation but endured a disappointing first match in charge with a 2-0 defeat by Ghana as his side prepared for the World Cup at a rain-drenched Yokohama Stadium on Wednesday. Soccer Football - International Friendly - Japan vs Ghana - Nissan Stadium, Yokohama, Japan - May 30, 2018 Japan coach Akira Nishino REUTERS/Toru Hanai\nGoals from Ghana captain Thomas Partey and debutant Emmanuel Boateng with a penalty ensured a miserable night for Nishino and means the ex-Japan midfielder has difficult decisions to make in the next 24 hours before naming his 23-man World Cup squad.\nNishino, who took over from Vahid Halilhodzic in April after the Bosnian had guided Japan to next month’s finals in Russia, switched the formation with three central defenders, two wing-backs and two inside forwards supporting a lone striker. Soccer Football - International Friendly - Japan vs Ghana - Nissan Stadium, Yokohama, Japan - May 30, 2018 Japan's Yoshinori Muto in action with Ghana’s Thomas Partey REUTERS/Toru Hanai\nDespite wing backs Yuto Nagamoto and Genki Haraguchi posing a threat going forward, there was confusion in defence with the back three often sitting too deep and Genki Haraguchi caught out of position at least three times in the first half. Slideshow (3 Images)\nPartey scored with a free-kick after eight minutes as Nishino’s new formation failed to function with brief moments of attacking menace tempered by vulnerability in defence.\nFive minutes after the break Japan’s back three dawdled and hesitant goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima gave away the spot kick that was coolly dispatched by Boateng for Ghana’s second.\nKeisuke Honda, who looked the most likely to score in the first half, twice tested goalkeeper Richard Ofori but the 31-year-old, now plying his trade in Mexico at Pachuca, notably tired in the second half before being substituted.\nShinji Kagawa also looked sharp after coming on at halftime. The Borussia Dortmund playmaker, who has been sidelined with a series of ankle injuries this year, immediately brought more dynamism and creativity to the Japanese attack.\nHowever, it was ultimately a poor night for Nishino, who must now decide on his squad on Thursday with few positives to reflect on from his sole game in charge.\nJapan’s first Group H match is against Colombia on June 19 before they face Senegal and Poland at the finals.
