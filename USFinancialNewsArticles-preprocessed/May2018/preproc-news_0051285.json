S&P 500 e-minis were down 16.5 points, or 0.61 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 64.5 points, or 0.93 percent.\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to eight-day lows as investors shunned risk. Twenty-eight of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components were trading premarket and all indicated a lower open.\nTarget sank 5.6 percent after the retailer’s quarterly profit rose less than expected as increasing investments dented margins.\nTiffany jumped 11.7 percent after the jeweler’s quarterly results blew past estimates and the company also raised its full-year profit forecast and announced a $1 billion share buyback program.\nOn the economic front, new home sales numbers for April are expected to fall to 679,000 units, from 694,000 units the month before. The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET. (Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n ",
