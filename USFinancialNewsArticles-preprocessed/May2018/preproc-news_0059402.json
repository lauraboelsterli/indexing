REUTERS/Chris Helgren\nEurobank, which is 2.4 percent owned by the country’s HFSF bank rescue fund, reported net earnings of 35 million euros (30.7 million pounds) from continued operations after profit of 43 million euros in the fourth quarter.\nAccounting for discontinued operations, the bank reported a net profit of 57 million euros after net earnings of 53 million in the fourth quarter.\nGreek lenders including Eurobank completed a health check by the European Central Bank earlier this month, with the stress test showing no potential shortage of capital before Greece leaves its 86 billion euro international bailout in August.\nBanks remain focused on reducing their bad debt portfolios and meeting targets agreed with regulators by 2019.\n“The management of non-performing exposures (NPEs) remains our main priority, ... we are certain that we will attain all our NPE reduction targets in 2018,” Chief Executive Fokion Karavias said in a statement.\nEurobank’s ratio of so-called non-performing exposures dropped to 41.8 percent of its loan book from 42.5 percent at the end of 2017. NPEs include non-performing loans (NPLs) - credit past due for more than 90 days - plus restructured loans likely to turn non-performing again.\nCredit-loss provisions fell to 167 million euros from 206 million in the fourth quarter. Non-performing exposures dropped to 41.8 percent of its book from 42.5 percent at the end of 2017.\nThe bank’s net interest income fell 4.8 percent quarter-on-quarter to 355 million euros, while commission and fee income dropped 8.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.\nInternational operations remained profitable with net profit before discontinued operations rising to 33 million euros from 27 million euros in the same quarter a year earlier.\nEurobank has said it will maintain its Balkan footprint in Bulgaria, Serbia and Cyprus after pulling out of Romania.
