    "text": "LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany, May 4 (Reuters) - BASFâ€™s quarterly operating profit edged 2 percent higher as gains in basic petrochemicals as well as in the oil and gas unit, which it aims to list separately, were tempered by a strong euro.\nFirst-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), adjusted for one-offs, came in at 2.51 billion euros ($3.01 billion), the German chemicals maker said on Friday. That was in line with the average analyst estimate in a Reuters poll.\nBASF said it was still aiming for an increase of up to 10 percent in group operating profit this year.\n$1 = 0.8343 euros Reporting by Ludwig Burger Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
