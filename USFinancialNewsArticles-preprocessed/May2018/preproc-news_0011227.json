    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Noble Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: NBLX) (Noble Midstream or the Partnership) today reported first quarter 2018 financial and operational results.\nThe Partnership’s results are consolidated to include the non-controlling interests in the Partnership’s development companies (DevCos) retained by Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble Energy); however, certain results are shown as “attributable to the Partnership,” which excludes the non-controlling interests in the DevCos retained by Noble Energy. Noble Midstream believes the results “attributable to the Partnership” provide the best representation of the ongoing operations from which the Partnership’s unitholders will benefit.\nVolumes from Black Diamond Gathering, LLC (Black Diamond Gathering) are included in the Partnership’s financial statements subsequent to the January 31, 2018 acquisition of Saddle Butte Rockies Midstream, LLC and certain affiliates (Saddle Butte). The Partnership’s 54.4% ownership of Black Diamond Gathering will be consolidated for accounting purposes and held through its wholly owned subsidiary, Laramie River DevCo. Greenfield Midstream, LLC owns 45.6% of Black Diamond Gathering, which is also included in non-controlling interests.\nFirst Quarter Highlights include:\nNet Income of $39 million attributable to the Partnership Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $46 million Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $58 million, or $54 million attributable to the Partnership, an increase over the prior quarter of 13% attributable to the Partnership Distribution per unit of $0.5110, a 4.7% increase from the fourth quarter 2017 distribution and 36% above the minimum quarterly cash distribution; this represents a 24% year-over-year increase Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) 1 attributable to the Partnership of $47 million, resulting in distribution coverage 1 of 2.3x Oil and gas gathering volumes of 162 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), up 33% versus fourth quarter 2017 volumes Record throughput on the Advantage Pipeline system of 88 MBbl/d, 47% above fourth quarter 2017 volumes With the startup of the Coronado and Billy Miner II central gathering facilities (CGF), current Delaware Basin oil and gas gathering capacity is 90 MBoe/d from four CGFs Commenced fresh water deliveries for Noble Energy’s Mustang development in the DJ Basin in March 2018, through Green River DevCo Extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility by 18 months to March 2023 and increased the facility size to $800 million, with an additional $350 million accordion\n“The Partnership is off to a strong start executing on our 2018 growth projects, further reinforcing confidence in business fundamentals and our recently enhanced outlook through 2022. We remain on track to increase oil and gas capacity in the Delaware Basin to 115 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, with five central gathering facilities expected to be online by mid-year. In the DJ Basin, construction progress on backbone infrastructure in the Green River DevCo is well underway while Black Diamond operatorship successfully transitioned to Noble Midstream during the quarter. I'm very pleased with the continued strength of our business, supporting organic 20% annual distribution growth while maintaining best in class coverage and leverage,” Terry R. Gerhart, Chief Executive Officer of Noble Midstream stated.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results and Recent Highlights\nGathering throughput as well as fresh water delivery volumes were consistent with or above guidance ranges for the first quarter.\nIn the gathering business, combined throughput for oil, gas and produced water was up 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Oil and gas gathering volumes grew across all DevCos, with the largest growth realized in the Blanco River and Laramie River DevCos. First quarter gathering volumes reflect two months of oil throughput on Black Diamond Gathering. Produced water gathering volumes were down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to timing of wells coming online.\nIn the Delaware Basin, construction of the Coronado CGF was completed on March 30, 2018, with throughput commencing in early April 2018. The Billy Miner II CGF began operations on April 20, 2018, and the Collier CGF remains on track for start-up in May 2018.\nIn addition, the company commenced compression services in the Delaware Basin for Noble Energy through the Trinity River DevCo, with new build installed horsepower anticipated to total 18,000 by mid-year.\nStrong customer demand continued at the Advantage Pipeline System in the first quarter, with quarterly volumes nearly tripling versus levels at the time of acquisition close. April 2018 nominations were 108 MBbl/d and May 2018 nominations grew to 120 MBbl/d.\nWith the Black Diamond Gathering connection to Tallgrass completed during the first quarter, the system currently connects to all four major oil takeaway outlets in the DJ Basin. In addition, during the quarter, the Partnership’s legacy third party gathering system in Laramie River was connected to Black Diamond Gathering at the Lucerne Terminal. May Black Diamond nominations are 58 MBbl/d, up over 5% from throughput at the end of January.\nAverage fresh water delivered in the first quarter was 12% above of the high end of guidance at 168 thousand barrels of water per day (MBw/d). The Partnership delivered water to 3 completion crews on dedicated acreage in the DJ Basin during the quarter, compared to approximately 2.5 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter investment income is primarily comprised of approximately $830 thousand from the Partnership’s minority ownership in White Cliffs Pipeline LLC and approximately $2 million from the Partnership’s 50% ownership in the Advantage Joint Venture.\nNet income attributable to the Partnership for the first quarter was $39 million, or $0.97 per limited partner unit. Net income was below guidance due to higher than expected depreciation and amortization; the increase was driven by the amortization of intangible assets, related to customer relationships and contracts that were acquired during our Saddle Butte acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $58 million in the first quarter, or 12% above the prior quarter, while Adjusted EBITDA 1 attributable to the Partnership grew 13% above the fourth quarter to $54 million, or $40 million excluding fresh water delivery. Quarterly adjustments include approximately $6 million in transaction expenses associated with the Saddle Butte acquisition.\nIn the first quarter, cash interest expense attributable to the Partnership was $2.4 million and maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership totaled $4.5 million, resulting in DCF 1 attributable to the Partnership of $47 million and a distribution coverage ratio 1 of 2.3x.\nCapital Expenditures\nOrganic capital expenditures in the first quarter totaled $249 million, or $128 million attributable the Partnership, primarily due to the following items:\nLaramie River DevCo - The Partnership connected 74 wells during the quarter. Laramie River capital now reflects capital associated with Black Diamond Gathering operations. Blanco River DevCo - Completion of the third CGF, Coronado, as well as construction capital for the Billy Miner II and Collier CGFs. Trinity River DevCo - Equipment procurement for expansion of the Advantage Pipeline nameplate capacity to 200 MBbl/d from 150 MBbl/d. Capital also reflects the initial funding of the compression segment in the Delaware Basin. Colorado River DevCo - 31 combined well connections in Noble Energy’s Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. Green River DevCo - Construction on fresh water delivery infrastructure expansion in Noble Energy’s Mustang area and procurement and construction on the oil, gas and produced water gathering systems. The gathering system is expected to be operational by mid-year 2018.\n1Q 2018 Capital Expenditures (in millions) NBLX DevCo Basin Ownership Gross Net Laramie River DJ 100% $ 41 $ 31 Blanco River Delaware 40% $ 154 $ 62 Trinity River Delaware 100% $ 27 $ 27 Colorado River DJ 100% $ 3 $ 3 Green River DJ 25% $ 24 $ 6 Total Organic Capital Expenditures\n$ 249 $ 128 Acquisition Capital Expenditures $ 206 $ 112 Total Capital Expenditures $ 455 $ 240 Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Partnership had $390 million of liquidity with $25 million in cash on hand and $365 million undrawn under its $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility.\nQuarterly Distribution\nOn April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Noble Midstream’s general partner, Noble Midstream GP LLC, declared a first quarter cash distribution of $0.5110 per unit, a 4.7% increase from the fourth quarter 2017.\nThe first quarter distribution is payable on May 14, 2018, to unitholders of record as of May 7, 2018.\nSecond Quarter 2018 and Full Year Guidance\nAhead of the startup of projects driving second half volume growth, gathering volumes in the second quarter are expected to grow from the first quarter driven primarily by throughput increases at Laramie River as well as growth projects in the Blanco River DevCo. As previously indicated, fresh water delivery volumes are anticipated to be down in the second quarter due to timing of customer completion activity and expected to rebound in the second half of the year. Second quarter net EBITDA will be impacted by a fresh water delivery mix shift as Noble Energy moves completion activity from Colorado River DevCo (100% owned) to Green River DevCo (25% owned).\nFull year 2018 gross oil and gas gathering volumes remain unchanged at 200 to 235 MBoe/d and the Partnership continues to expect volumes growth acceleration in the second half of the year, as customers increase activity and multiple new projects are expected to be placed in service.\nGiven strong demand at the Advantage Pipeline system, we now expect volumes to average at least 100 MBbl/d compared to prior guidance of 90 - 100 MBbl/d. These volumes are not included in our oil and gas gathering volume guidance given accounting treatment classification as equity from investment income.\nFull year net income is now anticipated to be between $175 million and $210 million. Full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA is unchanged at between $275 million and $315 million, or $215 million and $235 million attributable to the Partnership.\nNoble Midstream’s 2018 organic capital budget is $500 - $535 million, or $270 - $285 million attributable to the Partnership, primarily related to growth projects in the DJ Basin and the Delaware Basin.\nGuidance 1Q18 2Q18 FY 2018 Gross Volumes\nOil Gathered (MBbl/d) 130 160 - 175 165 - 190 Gas Gathered (MMcf/d) 191 195 - 215 215 - 265 Oil and Gas Gathered (MBoe/d) 162 190 - 210 200 - 235 Produced Water Gathered (MBw/d) 47 75 - 90 80 - 110 Fresh Water Delivered (MBw/d) 168 110 - 130 130 - 190 Financials ($MM)\nNet Income $39 $34 - $39 $175 - $210 Gross Adjusted EBITDA 1 $58 $58 - $63 $275 - $315 Net Adjusted EBITDA 1 $54 $46 - $51 $215 - $235 Distributable Cash Flow 1 $47 $37 - $42 $180 - $195 Distribution Coverage Ratio 1,2 2.3x 1.7x - 1.9x 1.9x - 2.1x Gross Capital, Excluding Acquisitions\n$249 $145 - $165 $500 - $535 Net Capital, Excluding Acquisitions $128 $60 - $70 $270 - $285 Further details with respect to the first quarter results and guidance can be found in the supplemental presentation on the Partnership's website, www.nblmidstream.com .\n1 Results “attributable to the Partnership” exclude the non-controlling interests in the DevCos retained by Noble Energy.

LP\nReconciliations of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release, the financial tables and other supplemental information include Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and Distribution Coverage Ratio, all of which are non-GAAP measures which may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial results with investors and analysts.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, transaction expenses and unit-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less estimated maintenance capital expenditures and cash interest expense. Distributable Cash Flow is used by management to evaluate our overall performance. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash on a quarterly basis, and Distributable Cash Flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our general partner to help determine the amount of available cash that is available to our unitholders for a given period. We define Distribution Coverage Ratio as Distributable Cash Flow divided by total distributions declared. The Distribution Coverage Ratio is used by management to illustrate our ability to make our distributions each quarter.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and Distribution Coverage Ratio provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio is net income. Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nNoble Midstream does not provide guidance on the reconciling items between forecasted Net Income, forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, forecasted Distributable Cash Flow and forecasted Distribution Coverage Ratio due to the uncertainty regarding timing and estimates of these items. Noble Midstream provides a range for the forecasts of Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Distribution Coverage Ratio to allow for the variability in timing and uncertainty of estimates of reconciling items between forecasted Net Income, forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, forecasted Distributable Cash Flow and forecasted Distribution Coverage Ratio. Therefore, the Partnership cannot reconcile forecasted Net Income to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA, forecasted Distributable Cash Flow or forecasted Distribution Coverage Ratio without unreasonable effort.\nIn addition to Net Income, the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Due to the forward-looking nature of net cash provided by operating activities, management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as future impairments and future changes in working capital. Accordingly, Noble Midstream is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of the aforementioned forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to net cash provided by operating activities. Amounts excluded from these non-GAAP measures in future periods could be significant.\nSchedule 4 (Continued) Noble Midstream Partners LP Reconciliations of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Reconciliation from Net Income (GAAP) Net Income and Comprehensive Income (GAAP) $ 39,136 $ 34,520 Add: Depreciation and Amortization 11,329 2,449 Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized 1,033 267 Income Tax Provision 74 — Transaction Expenses 5,969 — Unit-Based Compensation 321 127 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 57,862 37,363 Less: Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 3,585 10,862 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) 54,277 26,501 Less: Cash Interest Paid 2,407 175 Maintenance Capital Expenditures 4,540 2,101 Distributable Cash Flow of Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) $ 47,330 $ 24,225 Distributions (Declared) $ 21,048 $ 13,066 Distribution Coverage Ratio (Declared) 2.3x 1.9x Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) (in thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Reconciliation from Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 45,603 $ 32,225 Add: Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized 1,033 267 Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities 5,743 4,966 Transaction Expenses 5,969 — Change in Income Tax Payable 74 — Other Adjustments (560 ) (95 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 57,862 37,363 Less: Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 3,585 10,862 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) 54,277 26,501 Less: Cash Interest Paid 2,407 175 Maintenance Capital Expenditures 4,540 2,101 Distributable Cash Flow of Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) $ 47,330 $ 24,225 Distributions (Declared) $ 21,048 $ 13,066 Distribution Coverage Ratio (Declared) 2.3x 1.9x Schedule 4 (Continued) Noble Midstream Partners LP Reconciliations of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation of 2018 GAAP Guidance to 2018 Non-GAAP Guidance (in millions, unaudited) 2018 Guidance 2Q18 Full Year Reconciliation from Net Income (GAAP) to Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) Net Income and Comprehensive Income (GAAP) $34 - $39 $175 - $210 Add: Depreciation and Amortization 19 75 - 80 Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized 3 15 - 16 Unit-Based Compensation 0 2 Transaction Expenses 1.5 7.5 Income Tax Provision (Benefit) 0 0 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $58 - $63 $275 - $315 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 12 60 - 80 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to the Partnership $46 - $51 $215 - $235 Less: Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Cash Interest Paid 9 35 - 40 Distributable Cash Flow $37 - $42 $180 - $195 Distribution Coverage Ratio 1.7x - 1.9x 1.9x - 2.1x\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005614/en/\nNoble Midstream Partners LP\nMegan Repine\n(832) 639-7380\nmegan.repine@nblmidstream.com\nSource: Noble Midstream Partners LP",
