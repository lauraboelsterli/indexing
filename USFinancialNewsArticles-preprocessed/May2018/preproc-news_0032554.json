Diluted Earnings per Share 0.22 $ 0.19 $ 1.02 $ 1.20 The Company’s revenues are derived from Base Management Fees, calculated as a percentage of Assets Under Management (“AUM”), Performance Fees, which are earned when the Company exceeds pre-specified rates of return, and Other Income.\nDuring the quarter, AUM decreased by $29 million to $8.9 billion as at March 31, 2018, from $9.0 billion as at December 31, 2017, as net withdrawals of $48 million were partially offset by positive net investment performance of $19 million. The $48 million of net withdrawals over the quarter included a withdrawal of $135 million by one institutional client. Our private client business was strong during the quarter, adding a net $61 million. Year-over-year AUM increased by $76 million due to positive net investment performance of $401 million, partially offset by net withdrawals of $325 million. High net worth clients comprise 88% of AUM as at March 31, 2018.\nBase Management Fees 2018, increased year-over-year to $27.4 million from $26.1 million as the Average AUM for the quarter increased to $9.0 billion from $8.8 billion and average Base Management Fee Percentage increased to 1.23% from 1.21% for the same quarter last year. Total expenses decreased by $0.1 million from the year ago quarter.\nPerformance Fees 2018, were $0.6 million, compared to $0.5 million 2017.\nNet income was $6.9 million and represented earnings per share, basic and diluted, of $0.23 and $0.22, respectively 2018. Net income was $6.0 million and represented earnings per share, basic and diluted, of $0.20 and $0.19, respectively, 2017.\nBase EBITDA eliminates the effect of Performance Fees, Performance Fee related expenses, post-retirement obligations, stock option expense and amortization of RSU awards, and deducts the dollar value of the base bonus RSUs to be awarded in respect of the current period and special RSUs awarded in the period. Base EBITDA was $11.4 million 2018, compared with $10.8 million in the year ago quarter due primarily to higher Base Management Fees.\n“We are pleased that our clients’ capital was protected amid a period of heightened volatility and continue to believe we are well positioned for the environment that lies ahead,” commented Jeff Moody, President & Chief Executive Officer.\nGluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. is one of Canada’s pre-eminent wealth management firms, serving high net worth private clients, estates, trusts and institutional investors.
