    "text": "NEWARK, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ShotSpotter, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSTI), the leader in gunshot detection solutions that help law enforcement officials and security personnel identify, locate and deter gun violence, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nRecord quarterly revenues of $6.9 million up 51% from $4.6 million in the same period in 2017. Gross margins were 52%, up from 41% in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss of $1.2 million; adjusted EBITDA (1) of $26,000. Added 47 net new “go-live” square miles of coverage during the quarter, a 62% increase from the 29 added in Q1 2017. Hired a SVP of Marketing and Product Management to build out platform and sales pipeline for 2019 and beyond and a VP for International Sales to target the Latin American market. Increased 2018 revenue guidance to $33.0 million to $34.0 million, up from $31.0 million to $33.0 million.\n(1) See the section below entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about adjusted EBITDA. Management Commentary\n“We started the year with very strong performance, posting our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth exceeding 40% from the corresponding prior year period,” said Ralph Clark, CEO of ShotSpotter. “In the first quarter we went live with initial deployments in four new cities and expanded coverage in four others, turning on 47 net new go-live miles. We now have approximately 522 miles under coverage, which represents only a fraction of the cities in the U.S. that have a significant gun violence problem. We are excited to take a key step in addressing the same issue outside this country, adding a VP of international sales to target Latin America. The strong momentum and visibility has continued into Q2, allowing us to increase our revenue expectations for the full year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 51% to a record $6.9 million from $4.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was driven by new customer deployments, mileage expansions with existing customers and strong customer renewal rates.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.6 million, or 52% of revenue, a 91% increase from $1.9 million, or 41% of revenue, for the same period in 2017.\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased 57% to $4.8 million from $3.1 million in the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to company headcount growth and the cost of operating as a public company.\nNet loss totaled $1.2 million, or $0.12 per share (based on 10.1 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared with a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.93 per share (based on 1.7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $26,000.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $14.8 million compared to $19.6 million at the previous quarter end and remained debt free.\nCurrent Outlook\nFor the full year of 2018, the company is increasing its revenue outlook to $33.0 million to $34.0 million, up from $31.0 to $33.0 million.\nThe company’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below.\nConference Call\nShotSpotter will hold a conference call on May 8, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\nShotSpotter management will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time)\nU.S. dial-in: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational dial-in: 1-631-891-4304\nThe conference call will be broadcast simultaneously and available for replay via the investor section of the company’s website at www.shotspotter.com .\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.

ShotSpotter discloses the following non-GAAP financial measure in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: Adjusted EBITDA, which represents the company’s net loss before interest (expense) income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis.\nShotSpotter believes adjusted EBITDA also provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. For example, ShotSpotter adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense because that expense often varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by ShotSpotter to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the Company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of ShotSpotter’s financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; and (2) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our GAAP-based financial performance measures, in particular net loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP net loss $ (1,217 ) $ (1,561 ) Less: Interest (income) expense (27 ) 365 Income taxes 26 — Depreciation and amortization 817 679 Stock-based compensation expense 427 23 Adjusted EBITDA $ 26 $ (494 ) Safe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains \" \" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to statements regarding the company’s overall business, total addressable market, international expansion, expectations regarding future sales and expenses, and revenue expectations and guidance for 2018. Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these . Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond the company’s control. The company’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: the company’s ability to maintain and increase sales; the availability of funding for the company’s customers to purchase the company’s solutions; the complexity, expense and time associated with contracting with government entities; the company’s ability to maintain and expand coverage of existing public safety customer accounts and further penetrate the public safety market; the company’s ability to sell its solutions into new markets; the lengthy sales cycle for the company’s solutions; changes in federal funding available to support local law enforcement; the company’s ability to deploy and deliver its solutions; and the company’s ability to maintain and enhance its brand, as well as other risk factors included including the company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. These are made as of the date of this press release and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Except as required by law, the company undertakes no duty or obligation to update any contained in this release as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations.\nAbout ShotSpotter Inc.\nShotSpotter is the leader in gunshot detection solutions that help law enforcement officials and security personnel identify, locate and deter gun violence.
