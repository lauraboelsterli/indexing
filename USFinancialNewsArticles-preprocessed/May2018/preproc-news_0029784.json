    "text": "GERMANTOWN, Md., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neuralstem, Inc. (Nasdaq:CUR), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of nervous system therapies based on its neural stem cell technology, provides a business update and reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 .\n“We remain committed to the development of NSI-566, our lead stem cell therapy candidate, and were pleased to complete the first surgery in the second cohort of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with chronic spinal cord injury,” said Rich Daly, President & Chief Executive Officer. “We anticipate initiating a clinical trial for NSI-566 in chronic stroke in China and have targeted mid-2018 to begin dosing. We continue to pursue the development of NSI-189, our lead small molecule candidate for major depressive disorder (MDD) and look forward to meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2018 to formulate its clinical development path. We believe that NSI-189 may offer cognitive benefits in addition to antidepressant effects, which would distinguish it from other approved treatments for MDD.”\nClinical Highlights for Lead Clinical Programs\nNSI-566, is a spinal cord-derived neural stem cell line that is being evaluated to treat paralysis associated with stroke, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and chronic spinal cord injury (cSCI). NSI-566 is Neuralstem’s lead stem cell therapy candidate.\nNeuralstem announced the results from a study published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology in a manuscript entitled “Long-term Phase 1/2 Intraspinal Stem Cell Transplantation Outcomes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” that support the potential of transplanted human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells (HSSC) to stabilize functioning of ALS patients. The study evaluated the impact of HSSC transplantation on functional outcomes, as measured using the ALSFRS-R scale, and on a composite statistic that combined functional and survival outcomes. Results were evaluated against matched controls derived from two historical datasets and showed significantly better ALSFRS-R scores at 24 months, as well as the composite functional/survival score in subjects receiving HSSC. The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) is a validated questionnaire that measures physical function in performing activities of daily living (ADLs). The manuscript was published on May 3, 2018.\nOn March 28, Neuralstem completed the first surgery using NSI-566 spinal cord-derived neural stem cells in the second, cervical injury cohort of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (cSCI). The patients in this cohort include complete injury patients with no motor or sensory function below injury. The clinical trial is being conducted at the University of California San Diego, Division of Neurosurgery. The clinical trial was expanded to include a new cohort of four qualifying patients with AIS-A complete, quadriplegic, cervical injuries involving C5-C7 of their spinal cord, after promising results were observed with the first cohort. The clinical trial is evaluating the safety and feasibility of using NSI-566 spinal cord-derived neural stem cells to repair cSCI.\nNSI-189, a benzylpiperazine-aminopyridine, in clinical development for MDD and in preclinical development for Angelman syndrome, irradiation-induced cognitive impairment, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and stroke.\nIn the second half of 2018, Neuralstem intends to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss the clinical development path for NSI-189 in major depressive disorder.\nFinancial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nCash Position and Liquidity: Cash and investments was $9.7 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2017. The $2.0 million decrease reflects a $2.1 million loss for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items including $240,000 of share-based compensation, $190,000 gain related to the change in fair value of our liability classified warrants and $180,000 net cash inflows related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\nOperating Loss: Operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million for the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in operating loss for the year was primarily related to decreases in clinical trial and related costs due to the completion of the Company’s NSI-189 Phase 2 clinical trial coupled with decreases in personnel, facility and related expenses due to our ongoing corporate restructuring and cost reduction efforts.\nNet Loss: Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to a loss of $7.6 million, or $0.68 per share, for the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and the non-cash charges related to the change in the fair value of the liability classified warrants and warrant inducement expenses in the 2017 period along with a decrease in interest expense related to our long-term debt which matured in April 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses: The $1.2 million of research and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents a $1.7 million, or 60% decrease over the comparable period of 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.1 million decrease in clinical trial and related costs due to the completion of our NSI-189 Phase 2 clinical trial, a $200 thousand decrease in our personnel and facility expenses due to our ongoing corporate restructuring and cost reduction efforts and a $310 thousand decrease in our non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: The $1.2 million of general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents a $150 thousand, or 11% decrease over the comparable period of 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $140 thousand decrease in payroll and related expenses coupled with a $50 thousand decrease in consulting and professional service expenses due to our corporate restructuring and cost reduction efforts partially offset by a $20 thousand increase in non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nLiquidity: The Company expects its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund its operations based on our current operating plans, into the first quarter of 2019.\nNeuralstem, Inc.
