The U.S. State Department confirmed talks between American and North Korean officials to prepare for a summit. The meeting, it said, was in Panmunjom, the inter-Korean truce village where the leaders of the two Koreas have now met on Sunday.\nSeparately, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday that Kim had personally reaffirmed his commitment to “completely denuclearize the Korean Peninsula” when the two men met for a surprise inter-Korean summit on Saturday.
