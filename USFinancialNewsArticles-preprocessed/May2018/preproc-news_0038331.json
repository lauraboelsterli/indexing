    "text": "(Adds details from report)\nOTTAWA, May 18 (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales rose by the most in five months in March, driven by higher spending on vehicles and clothing, Statistics Canada reported on Friday.\nThe 0.6 percent increase, which topped economistsâ€™ forecasts of a 0.3 percent gain, was the biggest since October. February was upwardly revised to 0.5 percent from an initially reported 0.4 percent.\nStripping out the effects of prices changes, sales volume rose 0.8 percent.\nSales at motor vehicle and parts dealers rose 3 percent, lifted by demand for new cars. Excluding vehicles, retail sales dipped 0.2 percent.\nConsumers also spent more at clothing stores, with sales up 2.5 percent, while purchases at general merchandise stores were up 1 percent.\nThe gains were offset by a 1.2 percent drop in food sales and a 1.9 percent decline at gasoline stations as consumers faced higher prices at the pump.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ",
