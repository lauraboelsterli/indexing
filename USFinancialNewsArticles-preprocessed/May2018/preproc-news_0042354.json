Marvin joins Lowe's at a critical inflection point as we work to enhance our competitive position and capitalize on solid project demand in an evolving consumer environment. We look forward to shepherding an exciting new chapter for Lowe's under Marvin's leadership.\"\nEllison said, \"I am thrilled to take on the role as Lowe's next president and CEO. Working closely with Lowe's board, management team and the more than 310,000 talented employees, I believe we will not just compete, but win in today's complex retail environment. Together, we will leverage Lowe's omni-channel capabilities to deliver the most simple and seamless customer experiences as we execute with purpose and put the customer first in everything we do.\"\nLarsen added, \"On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Robert for his leadership and dedication to Lowe's over the last 25 years. Robert played a key role in driving our omni-channel strategy and positioning the company as a leader in home improvement. We wish him all the best in his retirement.\"\nNiblock said, \"It has been an honor to serve as Lowe's chairman, president and CEO. I am confident in the company's prospects for growth and value creation under Marvin's leadership. I know that Marvin's deep appreciation for Lowe's culture, people and customers make him the ideal choice to serve as this great company's next leader, and I look forward to a smooth transition.\"\nAbout Marvin R.
