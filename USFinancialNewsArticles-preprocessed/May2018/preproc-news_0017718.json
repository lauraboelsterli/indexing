    "text": "-- April 2018 estimated production averaged more than double the average production rate for 2017 --\n--- Reaffirms 2018 production growth guidance of ~125% ---\n--- Continued strong well results in Area 2 with longest lateral drilled to date ---\nHOUSTON, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Penn Virginia Corporation (“Penn Virginia” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PVAC) today announced its financial and operational results for the first quarter 2018.\nSignificant Operational and Financial Accomplishments\nProduced approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”), or 16,145 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) (78% oil), in the first quarter of 2018 – a 28% increase in total production and a 33% increase in oil production over the fourth quarter of 2017;\nPosted strong well results in Area 2 – the two-well Southern Hunter-Amber pad had a 30-day initial production (“IP”) rate of 4,028 BOEPD (90% oil) and a previously announced 24-hour IP rate of 5,092 BOEPD. In addition, the Company recently recorded three preliminary 24-hour IP rates:\n• McCreary-Technik three-well pad – 5,425 BOEPD (81% oil);\n• Medina three-well pad – 5,208 BOEPD (63% oil); and\n• Schacherl-Effenberger two-well pad – 3,073 BOEPD (88% oil).\nCompleted the longest lateral to date – the McCreary-Technik 2H well, with a lateral length of greater than 9,100 feet and continued to increase operational efficiencies with feet drilled per day up by more than 40% and frac stages rising by more than 45% per day since deploying new service equipment in late 2017;\nRecorded net income of $10.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income (1) was $22.3 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018;\nGenerated adjusted EBITDAX (2) of $50.5 million in the first quarter of 2018;\nRealized cash operating margin per barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) (3) of $39.94 for the first quarter of 2018 with an aggregate realized price of $52.99 per BOE and adjusted total direct operating expenses per BOE of $13.05 (4) . All of the Company’s Eagle Ford oil production was sold at the Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”) pricing point yielding a realized oil price $0.36 per barrel higher than the comparable West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) price; and\nClosed the previously announced acquisition of Eagle Ford assets located primarily in Gonzales and Lavaca Counties, Texas, from Hunt Oil Company on March 1, 2018.\n“We are extremely pleased with our results for the first quarter,” said John A. Brooks, President and Chief Executive Officer of Penn Virginia. “First quarter production exceeded the midpoint of guidance but more importantly, oil volumes increased by 33% over the fourth quarter of 2017 as our overall product mix is getting oilier. We completed and drilled our longest lateral to date, the McCreary-Technik 2H with a completed lateral length over 9,100 feet, as our operations team continued to improve operational efficiencies across both drilling and completions disciplines.”\nMr. Brooks added, “Recently, four pads in Area 2 were turned to sales which helped drive average estimated production for April to approximately 20,900 BOE per day, 30% higher than our first quarter production and more than double the average rate produced for 2017. Given the strong well results, the Company intends to evaluate allocating more capital to Area 2 relative to Area 1. With our success to date, we are confident in our ability to grow production by approximately 125% this year, spend within cash flow by the fourth quarter and reach our stated target leverage of 1.5x by year-end.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nTotal production in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 28% from the fourth quarter of 2017, to approximately 1.5 MMBOE, or 16,145 BOEPD (78% oil). Oil production grew 33% over fourth quarter of 2017 levels to 12,522 barrels of oil per day.\nPenn Virginia drilled and turned to sales 13 gross (10 net) wells during the first quarter of 2018, all in the Eagle Ford.\nThe Company has turned to sales four pads in Area 2 in 2018, descriptions of which are set forth in the table below.\nPad Name Working\nInterest Production Average Lateral Length - Feet Southern Hunter-Amber - 2 wells 98% 24-hour IP – 5,092 BOEPD\n30-day IP – 4,028 BOEPD 8,100 Schacherl-Effenberger - 2 wells 71% 24-hour IP – 3,073 BOEPD 6,050 McCreary-Technik - 3 wells 74% 24-hour IP – 5,425 BOEPD 8,080 Medina - 3 wells 100% 24-hour IP – 5,208 BOEPD 6,135 The table below shows the current status of Penn Virginia’s Eagle Ford pads that are either completing, waiting on completion, or drilling:\nPad Name Working\nInterest Status Area 1/2 Nitro B - 2 wells 100% Drilling 2 Gonzo North - 3 wells 80% Drilling 1 Hawn Holt - 2 wells 83% Drilling 1 Snipe Hunter - 3 wells 80% Completing 1 Elk Hunter - 3 wells 74% Completing 1 Lott - 3 wells 100% Waiting on Completion 2 Buffalo Hunter - 3 wells 80% Waiting on Completion 1 As of May 1, 2018, the Company had 98,400 gross (83,800 net) core acres. Approximately 93% of Penn Virginia’s core acreage is held by production.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal direct operating expenses, which consist of lease operating expense (“LOE”), gathering, processing and transportation (“GPT”) expense, production and ad valorem taxes, and cash general and administrative (“G&A”) expense, were $19.6 million, or $13.52 per BOE, in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $14.9 million, or $13.11 per BOE, in the fourth quarter of 2017. G&A expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.45 per BOE, which includes $1.6 million of non-cash share base compensation and $0.7 million associated with non-recurring items related to transaction costs for the Hunt acquisition and executive retirement costs. Adjusted G&A (5) which excludes those items was $2.90 per BOE. Adjusted total direct operating expenses per BOE (4) , excluding the aforementioned non-recurring G&A items was $13.05 for the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, LOE was $5.02 per BOE, down almost 9% from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $10.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $10.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income (1) was $22.3 million, or $1.48 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, versus $15.9 million, or $1.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDAX (2) was $50.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 and realized cash operating margin per BOE (3) for the first quarter of 2018 was $39.94 a 16% increase over fourth quarter 2017.\nHedging Update\nPenn Virginia enters into oil hedges on a portion of its production to help mitigate commodity price risk.\nThe table below sets forth Penn Virginia’s current oil hedge positions:\nWTI – Oil\nVolumes\n(Barrels Per Day) WTI - Average\nSwap Price\n($/barrel) LLS - Oil\nVolumes\n(Barrels Per Day) LLS - Average\nSwap Price\n($/barrel) Percent of\nOil Production\nHedged (6) Q2-Q4\n2018 7,803 $53.33 2,500 $55.18 41% 2019 5,415 $52.75 2,500 $51.30 - 2020 5,000 $53.21 - - - Balance Sheet and Liquidity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $84.2 million of capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions), of which 96% was associated with drilling and completion activities.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Penn Virginia had $195.0 million outstanding on its credit facility and liquidity of $152 million. As of May 4, 2018, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $219.5 million on its credit facility and liquidity of $124 million.\nThe Company is committed to maintaining financial discipline and a strong balance sheet with a targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio of 1.5x or below. Penn Virginia believes it will achieve its leverage target by the end of 2018 and spend within cash flow by the fourth quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s net debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio was approximately 2.4x, pro forma for acquisitions.\n2018 Capital Plans\nCapital expenditures for 2018 are expected to total between $320 and $360 million, with 95% of capital being directed to drilling and completions in the Eagle Ford. The capital plan provides for drilling a total of approximately 55 to 60 gross wells (45 to 50 net). Penn Virginia plans to drill 33 to 35 gross wells (26 to 28 net) in Area 1 and to drill between 22 to 25 gross wells (19 to 22 net) in Area 2. In 2018, the Company expects to drill 22 wells which are classified as XRL. In support of the Company’s XRL program, 13 XRL units have been formalized with 26 XRL units in process. Penn Virginia plans to fund its 2018 capital plans with cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit facility.\nGuidance\nThe table below sets forth the Company’s operational and financial guidance for 2018:\nPrevious Current Production (BOEPD) % oil % oil\nSecond Quarter 21,000 – 23,000 76% Full Year 74% 22,000 – 25,000 75% Realized Price Differentials Oil (off WTI, per barrel) $1.00 - $2.00 $0.00 - $1.00 Natural gas (off Henry Hub, per MMBtu) $0.10 - $0.20 Direct Operating Expenses Lease operating expense (per BOE) $4.75 - $5.25 $4.50 - $5.00 GPT expense (per BOE) $2.75 - $3.00 Ad valorem and production taxes (percent of product revenue) 5.5% - 6.0% Cash G&A expense (per BOE) $2.25 - $2.75 $2.00 - $2.50 Capital Expenditures (millions) $320 - $360 Revised guidance reflects higher anticipated realized oil price through lower oil price differentials, lower lease operating expenses per BOE and lower general and administrative expenses per BOE.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nA conference call and webcast discussing first quarter 2018 financial and operational results is scheduled for Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EDT.

They should be evaluated in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of GAAP \"Net income (loss)\" to Non-GAAP \"Adjusted net income\" Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the effects, net of income taxes, of non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives, net gains and losses on the sales of assets, acquisition transaction costs, executive retirement costs and restructuring expenses. We believe that Non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share amounts provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, the Company believes that our investors can benefit by evaluating both non-GAAP and GAAP results. Adjusted net income non-GAAP is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss).

We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts for the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within our industry. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Penn Virginia may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Penn Virginia's results as reported under GAAP.

We believe that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted G&A is useful to investors because it provides readers with a meaningful measure of our recurring G&A expense and provides for greater comparability period-over-period.
