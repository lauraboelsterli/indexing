(NYSE: WK), a leader in data collaboration, reporting and compliance solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We posted strong results in the first quarter of 2018, highlighted by an increase of 15.4% in total revenue over the same quarter last year, with subscription and support revenue up 17.5% and professional services revenue up 8.7%,” said Matt Rizai, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Workiva. “We outperformed our guidance for quarterly revenue, operating loss and loss per share.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue: Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 reached $59.9 million, an increase of 15.4% from $51.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Subscription and support revenue contributed $46.5 million, up 17.5% versus the first quarter of 2017. Professional services revenue was $13.4 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Adoption of ASC 606 caused recognition of professional services revenue to be $1.7 million less for the first quarter of 2018 than what would have been recognized under the legacy standard. Gross Profit: GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $43.4 million compared with $37.7 million in the same quarter of 2017. GAAP gross margin was 72.4% versus 72.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $43.7 million, an increase of 15.3% compared with the prior year's first quarter, and non-GAAP gross margin was 73.0% compared to 73.1% in the first quarter of 2017. Loss from Operations: GAAP loss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.5 million compared with a loss of $6.0 million in the prior year's first quarter. Non-GAAP loss from operations was $3.6 million, compared with non-GAAP loss from operations of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adoption of ASC 606 caused loss from operations to be $0.2 million less for the first quarter of 2018 than what would have been recognized under the legacy standard. Net Loss: GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.6 million compared with a net loss of $5.8 million for the prior year's first quarter. GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.22 compared with a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.14 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.7 million compared with a net loss of $1.7 million in the prior year's first quarter. Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.09 compared with a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2017.\nKey Metrics\nCustomers: Workiva had 3,119 customers as of March 31, 2018, a net increase of 294 customers from March 31, 2017. Revenue Retention Rate: As of March 31, 2018, Workiva's revenue retention rate (excluding add-on revenue) was 95.7%, and the revenue retention rate including add-on revenue was 105.3%. Add-on revenue includes the change in both seats purchased and seat pricing for existing customers. Revenue retention rates are calculated using the legacy accounting standard ASC 605. Revenue retention rates will be calculated using ASC 606 when comparable data becomes available. Large Contracts: As of March 31, 2018, Workiva had 335 customers with an annual contract value (ACV) of more than $100,000, up 34.0% from 250 customers at March 31, 2017.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP historical financial measures has been provided in Table I at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP guidance has been provided in Table II at the end of this press release.\nWorkiva believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share is helpful to its investors. These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense attributable to cost of revenues from gross profit. Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by revenues. Non-GAAP loss from operations is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense from loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, from net loss. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net loss by the weighted- average shares outstanding as presented in the calculation of GAAP net loss per share. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expenses, Workiva believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows for more meaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. Workiva’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as tools for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Workiva’s own operating results over different periods of time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in Workiva’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Workiva’s reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Workiva’s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Workiva’s business.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this press release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. These statements relate to future events or the Company’s future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In particular, statements about the Company’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or future performance contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “outlook,” “guidance” or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology.\nPlease see the Company’s documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s annual reports filed on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and any amendments thereto for a discussion of certain important risk factors that relate to forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. These and other important factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n###\nWORKIVA INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except share and per share
