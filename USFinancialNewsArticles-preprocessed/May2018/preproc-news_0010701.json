    "text": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ARC Document Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: ARC), a leading document solutions provider to design, engineering, construction, and facilities management professionals, today reported its financial results for\nFinancial Highlights:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(All dollar amounts in millions, except EPS)\n2018\n2017\nNet Sales\n$\n97.7\n$\n98.7\nGross Margin\n30.9%\n31.2%\nNet income attributable to ARC\n$\n0.6\n$\n1.8\nAdjusted net income attributable to ARC\n$\n0.5\n$\n1.9\nEarnings per share - Diluted\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.04\nAdjusted earnings per share - Diluted\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.04\nCash (used in) provided by operating activities\n$\n(2.0)\n$\n6.9\nEBITDA\n$\n10.2\n$\n12.8\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n10.9\n$\n13.6\nCapital Expenditures\n$\n2.9\n$\n2.0\nDebt & Capital Leases (including current), net of unamortized deferred financing fees\n$\n138.1\n$\n154.3\nManagement Commentary\n\"We are starting to see our sales declines moderating, while we experience a return to growth in our more traditional business lines. This is encouraging and clear evidence that we are making progress against our strategic objectives laid out last year,\" said K. \"Suri\" Suriyakumar, Chairman, President and CEO of ARC Document Solutions. \"Our renewed focus on ARC's print business gained considerable traction during the quarter with a 2.1% increase in CDIM.\"\n\"While our efforts to protect our print business and grow our tech business are starting to show results, recent experience shows that we must continue to make changes as we move forward and stay ahead of the curve in an ever-changing business environment,\" said Mr. Suriyakumar. \"We remain upbeat about the coming year and our strategic direction, and in pursuit of further progress, we will continue to support initiatives that are growing, but shrink costs associated with products and services that have not.\"\n\"Medical costs were exceptionally high during the period, having a 140 basis point impact on our operating margins and a two cent impact on earnings per share. Despite these costs, gross margin declined just 30 basis points,\" said Jorge Avalos, Chief Financial Officer. \"Negative cash flow from operations was due to changes in working capital, and more specifically the timing of payables. This is a trend that is likely to be familiar to our long-term investors, and as usual, we expect this trend to reverse by the second half of the year, and anticipate strong cash flows for the year as our forecast demonstrates.\"\n2018 First Quarter Supplemental Information:\nNet sales were $97.7 million, a 1.0% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nDays sales outstanding were 55 in Q1 2018 and 54 in Q1 2017.\nArchitectural, engineering, construction and building owner/operators (AEC/O) customers comprised approximately 79% of our total net sales, while customers outside of construction made up approximately 21% of our total net sales.\nTotal number of MPS locations at the end of the first quarter has grown to approximately 10,270, a net gain of approximately 590 locations over Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes loss on extinguishment and modification of debt and stock-based compensation expense.\nSales from Services and Product Lines as a Percentage of Net Sales\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nServices and Product Line\n2018\n2017\nCDIM\n53.5%\n51.9%\nMPS\n32.2%\n32.9%\nAIM\n3.0%\n3.3%\nEquipment and supplies sales\n11.3%\n11.9%\nOutlook\nThe outlook for ARC Document Solutions remains unchanged with 2018 fully-diluted annual adjusted earnings per share anticipated to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.16; 2018 annual cash provided by operating activities projected to be in the range of $44 to $50 million; and 2018 annual adjusted EBITDA forecast to be in the range of $48 to $54 million.\nTeleconference and Webcast\nARC Document Solutions will hold a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, May 1, 2018, at 2 P.M.

supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nWe have presented EBITDA and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity. We believe investors may also find these measures meaningful, given how our management makes use of them. The following is a discussion of our use of these measures.\nWe use EBITDA to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments. Our operating segments' financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for U.S. operating segments. We use EBITDA to compare the performance of our operating segments and to measure performance for determining consolidated-level compensation. In addition, we use EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures.\nEBITDA and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:\nThey do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments; They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; They do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and related ratios only as supplements.\nOur presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors. The unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances. Comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict GAAP presentation. Each non-GAAP presentation, however, is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above.\nSpecifically, we have presented adjusted net income attributable to ARC and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ARC shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment and modification of debt and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items. This presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nWe have presented adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to exclude loss on extinguishment and modification of debt and stock-based compensation expense. The adjustment of EBITDA for these items is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA in our credit agreement; therefore, we believe this information is useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arc-document-solutions-reports-results-for-first-quarter-2018-300640287.html\nSOURCE ARC Document Solutions, Inc.",
