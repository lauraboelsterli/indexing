Live Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Swings to a Rare Loss Last Updated May 5, 2018 at 10:34 am ET\nWarren Buffett and shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. are gathering this weekend at the company’s annual meeting, the \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" We are covering the event from the first sip of Cherry Coke to the last bite of See’s candy. SHARE\nKaty Perry Reveals a Secret\nWhat Buffett Thinks of Tax Cuts\n#metoo Twitter Buffett Explains Earnings\nWarren Buffett opens the meeting by talking about Berkshire's first-quarter results, which swung to a loss due to unrealized investment losses.\nA new accounting rule requires Berkshire to include its unrealized investment gains or losses in its net income.\n\"If you look at the figure of operating earnings, which is what we look at, we actually earned a record amount of any quarter we’ve ever had,\" Mr. Buffett said.\nThe recent tax changes also boosted Berkshire's businesses, he said. Nicole Friedman Twitter It Is On\nThe live event has begun. First order of business was Mr. Buffett making a See's Candies joke at Charlie Munger's expense. Now, they are introducing the board -- including Bill Gates.\nFrom here, we should have our first question coming shortly. Could be about Wells Fargo or Apple or who knows. Geoffrey Rogow Twitter Katy Perry Reveals a Secret Katy Perry performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl XLIX football game in Glendale, Ariz. in 2015. David J. Phillip/Associated Press\nKaty Perry made a cameo appearance in Berkshire Hathaway's comedy appearance to reveal a secret: the famous \"Left Shark\" during her 2015 Super Bowl performance was, in fact, Warren Buffett.\nOf the two backup dancers behind Ms. Perry, the left shark gained fame for dancing out of sync.\n\"Obviously, Right Shark did everything right, and didn’t get half the shine that Left Shark, aka Warren Buffett, got,\" Ms. Perry says in the video. \"Congratulations, you now know. Just don’t tell anyone.\"\n(Of course this isn't true: The actual Left Shark revealed himself earlier this year.)\nMs. Perry visited Mr. Buffett in his office in Omaha last year and they discussed cryptocurrency, according to a post on her Instagram. Nicole Friedman Twitter What Buffett Thinks of Tax Cuts\nMr. Buffett said the tax-code overhaul signed into law last year has done his firm a lot of good, though he repeated his long-held view that he is not personally in favor of these tax cuts.\n\"It is very helpful to Berkshire,\" he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that ran ahead of the website's live feed. \"It isn't that we weren't competitive before, but Berkshire shareholders are better off.\"\nHe drew a distinction between how it's playing out for his company what he personally viewed as the right move.\n\"As an individual I don't agree with it, but as a steward of Berkshire Hathaway, it's been good,\" he said. He said some of Berkshire's portfolio companies have increased salaries but the added money will mostly be used for investments. Ben Eisen Twitter #metoo\nMr. Buffett has a unique take on the #metoo movement: That it is a positive economic development.\nHe said that he's seen half of the United States talent pushed to the side. In the era he grew up in, women just simply weren't given opportunities.\n\"I have two sisters who are as smart as I am, who have better personalities,\" he says in the Yahoo interview.\nThat they are more likely to have those opportunities makes him optimistic, adding America will now have double the amount of talent. He says good managers are particularly scarce and you better use all of them you can find. Geoffrey Rogow Twitter On Trump\nIn an interview with Yahoo ahead of today's event, Mr. Buffett didn't take the bait when asked to rate President Trump.\n\"I'm not going to rate presidents,\" said Mr. Buffett.\nBut he was positive on the president's decision to use Twitter. Mr. Buffett said he understands the inspiration behind it.\nAs a CEO, \"I like to talk to our shareholders directly. If I were frustrated with my ability to talk to people, I'd do it directly. And obviously the president feels that way.\" Geoffrey Rogow Twitter What's it Like Inside CenturyLink?\nThe Journal's Nicole Friedman has been tweeting out shots of the scene inside the CenturyLink Center in Omaha. Check it out: Highlights Twitter The View From Omaha\nHello from Omaha's CenturylinkCenter, where thousands of shareholders and Berkshire fans are watching the movie. The annual meeting always starts with a comedic movie, which isn't live streamed, so only those who made the trek to Nebraska get to watch it. It usually features a lot of celebrity cameos. First so far is Jimmy Buffett, singing about \"Berkshire Hathaway-a-ville\" and introducing Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, his \"junior partners.\"\nI just got to the press booth from the exhibit hall, where Berkshire companies are selling everything from boats (Forest River) to desserts (Dairy Queen). Buffett's face or signature can be found on all sorts of items, including wine glasses, socks, cowboy boots and jewelry. Dairy Queen Blizzards at the Berkshire meeting Bloomberg News Nicole Friedman Twitter What it Was Like in Years Past\nWhile we're waiting for the festivities to get underway in Omaha, take a look at some of our past coverage of this annual event.\nAnd for Berkshire newbies, you can start at the beginning here: What is Berkshire Hathaway? Ben Eisen Let’s Not Be Too Negative\nWhile the bottom line loss was significant, Berkshire as a business was generally solid.\nNote that the huge conglomerate’s operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose to $5.29 billion from $3.56 billion a year earlier.\nIt appears that people are still eating Dairy Queen and See’s Candies while wearing Fruit of the Loom. Geoffrey Rogow Twitter So What Happens Now\nNow that the earnings (or losses) are in the rear-view mirror, it's show time for the annual meeting. The Journal's Nicole Friedman is at CenturyLink in Omaha, while many of us are watching from a Yahoo live stream of the event.\nPretty soon, those in attendance will be shown the movie. At around 9:45 a.m. ET Yahoo will kick off the stream. And from there, it will be one question after another for Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger.\nAnalysts, hand-selected reporters and just regular old shareholders are allowed to ask questions, so it's usually pretty free flowing. Expect the cash pile, the health-care plan and other business questions. But politics and life advice always come up, which is good. Who doesn't want a little life advice? Geoffrey Rogow Behind the Insurance Issue\nBerkshire's revenue fell to $58.47 billion, from $64.37 billion a year earlier.\nOne of the main drivers for that revenue decline was a drop in insurance premiums earned. Those of us who spend our lives geeking out on insurance will remember just a year ago, Berkshire's insurance premium was unusually high due to a large reinsurance deal the company struck with American International Group Inc.\nThe deal called for AIG to write Berkshire a big check out front to help insulate it down the road and take responsibility for some AIG insurance claims if they run unexpectedly high.\nAIG did it at the time because activists were beating down the gates for the company to streamline. Those activists, which included billionaire investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson, eventually got even more from AIG. Within a few months, AIG's Chief Executive Peter Hancock would be gone from the firm. Geoffrey Rogow Twitter Bitcoin Is 'Rat Poison Squared,' Buffett Says\nFor those wondering what Mr. Buffett thinks about bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, CNBC's Becky Quick has an answer for you: Ben Eisen Berkshire Swings to a Loss\nBerkshire Swings to 1Q Loss of $1.14 Billion From $4.06 Billion Profit a Year Ago\nBerkshire 1Q Insurance Revenue Falls to $46.3 billion from $53.1 billion a Year Ago\nBerkshire 1Q Rev $58.5 Billion vs. $64.47 Billion a Year Ago\nBerkshire Hurt By Decline in Insurance Premiums Revenue Highlights , Berkshire Hathaway: The First-Quarter Numbers\n*Berkshire Hathaway 1Q Loss $1.14B >BRKA\n*Berkshire Hathaway 1Q Loss/Shr $692.00 >BRKA\n*Berkshire Hathaway 1Q Investment, Derivative Loss $6.43B >BRKA\n*Berkshire Hathaway 1Q Derivative Loss $163M >BRKA Highlights Twitter Cash Pile\nPerhaps the most important question for Berkshire is how are they going to spend all that cash?\nBerkshire’s cash pile keeps growing and stood around $116 billion at year end. The number is expected to fall slightly, but stay relatively high, when Berkshire reports its first-quarter earnings shortly.\nMr. Buffett acknowledged in his annual letter earlier this year that the pressure is on for Berkshire to make a huge acquisition soon. Prices for businesses were too high for his taste in 2017, he said, but “our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire’s excess funds into more productive assets.”\nAs Berkshire’s subsidiaries continue to rake in cash, questions about returning cash to shareholders will continue to come up either for Mr. Buffett, or for his eventual successor.\nMr. Buffett has shot down the idea that Berkshire should pay a dividend nearly every year, saying that he can make better use of Berkshire’s cash by investing it. And shareholders voted down a proposal in 2014 asking the board of directors to consider paying one. But in recent years, he’s suggested that a time may come when Berkshire might run out of ways to profitably deploy its cash hoard.\nIf not a dividend, perhaps a more aggressive buyback strategy? Right now, Berkshire has an open-ended repurchase program where it says it will consider buying up its own shares if they trade below 120% of book value. Mr. Buffett said on CNBC in February that the threshold could rise in the future. Nicole Friedman",
