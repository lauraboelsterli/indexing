    "text": "Riverbed Xirrus recommended by IDC to all distributed organizations seeking a robust cloud-managed enterprise Wireless LAN solution\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Riverbed®, The Digital Performance Company™, today announced that IDC positioned Riverbed Xirrus as a Major Player in its “IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Enterprise WLAN 2018 Vendor Assessment.” Complimentary access to the report can be viewed here .\nLinkedIn: Riverbed Named a Major Player in IDC MarketScape Worldwide Enterprise WLAN 2018 Vendor Assessment: https://rvbd.ly/2rLOfRC\nIDC’s placement of Riverbed Xirrus as a major player is representative of the enhanced value combining the cloud networking solutions of the two companies following Riverbed’s acquisition of Xirrus in 2017. The IDC report indicates that distributed organizations, especially those at large or global scale, seeking a robust cloud-managed enterprise WLAN solution, should consider Riverbed Xirrus.\nThe report also notes Riverbed’s end-to-end cloud networking solution and digital performance strategy.\n“Riverbed and Xirrus have come together to create something much bigger – delivering a powerful cloud networking and digital experience management solution that provides more agility and better performance for today’s digital enterprise,” said Bruce Miller, Vice President of Product Marketing. “In addition to enterprise Wi-Fi, Riverbed Xirrus customers can leverage a broad cloud networking and digital experience management portfolio, including SD-WAN and SD-LAN connectivity, WAN optimization, network and application performance management (NPM/APM), and end-user experience management.”\nBlog: IDC MarketScape Recognizes Riverbed As a Major Player in WLAN\nIDC’s vendor assessment of Riverbed’s unified and integrated portfolio recommends organizations seeking full-stack cloud networking and converged campus and branch networking solutions should consider Riverbed Xirrus in the context of the broader Riverbed portfolio, showing its recognition of Riverbed’s integrated and unified digital performance platform.\nIn April 2017, Riverbed acquired Xirrus, which was part of a multi-year strategy from Riverbed to lead in the area of digital performance, which included several strategic acquisitions, organic development of digital performance and cloud-based features and functionality, and integration across multiple solutions.\nAt the time of the acquisition, Xirrus was the largest remaining independent privately-held enterprise WLAN infrastructure company. Xirrus is a performance-driven enterprise WLAN vendor, offering a broad range of standard and unique high density APs and a next generation multi-tenant cloud-managed platform, giving customers a powerful but easy to use WLAN solution. Xirrus’s industry-leading Wi-Fi solutions have further strengthened Riverbed’s digital performance solutions, including SteelConnect and SteelCentral. Since the acquisition, the integration of Riverbed and Xirrus products has created an end-to-end cloud networking offering with SD-WAN SteelConnect, SteelHead for WAN optimization and enterprise Wi-Fi, integrated with a holistic suite of digital experience management visibility solutions, resulting in a highly differentiated offer.\nResources\nReport: IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Enterprise WLAN 2018 Vendor Assessment, (Doc# US42018017), March 2018\nAbout IDC MarketScape: IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT (information and communications technology) suppliers in a given market.
