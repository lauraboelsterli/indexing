    "text": "May 27, 2018 / 10:34 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Golf-Japan's Akiyoshi qualifies for British Open with Mizuno win Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s Shota Akiyoshi fired a two-under-par 70 in the final round on Sunday to win the Mizuno Open title and book a place in this year’s British Open.\nAkiyoshi, who was one-under for the tournament, finished ahead of New Zealand’s Michael Hendry and the Japanese pair of Masahiro Kawamura and Masanori Kobayashi who were in a three-way tie for second place.\nThe second-placed trio, who finished one stroke behind Akiyoshi, also qualified for the 147th Open at Carnoustie in Scotland from July 19-22.\nAkiyoshi negotiated windy conditions to prevail at the Royal Golf Club in Ibaraki on Sunday.\nThe 27-year-old carded five birdies and three bogeys in the final round to secure his first title on the Japan Golf Tour.\nOvernight leader Hendry endured a rocky finish but did enough to ensure a top-four spot and make the grade for the Open for the second straight year via this tournament.
