    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading a trade delegation in Washington, has met U.S. President Donald Trump, state broadcaster China Central Television said on Friday.\nA second round of talks between senior Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts started at the U.S. Treasury on Thursday morning, focused on cutting China’s U.S. trade surplus and improving intellectual property protections.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders had earlier said Trump would meet Liu later on Thursday.\nTrump has threatened to impose tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion to combat what he says is Beijing’s misappropriation of U.S. technology through joint venture requirements and other policies.\nBeijing has threatened equal retaliation, including tariffs on some of its largest U.S. imports, including aircraft, soybeans and autos.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Paul Tait\n ",
