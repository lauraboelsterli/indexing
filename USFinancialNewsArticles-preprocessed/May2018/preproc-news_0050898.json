    "text": "LANCASTER, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fulton Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: FULT) today announced that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has approved the Corporation’s application to merge two of its subsidiary banks – FNB Bank, N.A., based in Danville, PA, and Swineford National Bank, based in Middleburg, PA – into its largest banking subsidiary, Fulton Bank, N.A. The consolidation of the three bank charters is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Customers of the banks should see minimal, if any, changes, other than the bank name, as a result of the merger.\nAs discussed in previous communications, it is Fulton Financial Corporation’s goal to eventually merge all of its subsidiary banks into Fulton Bank, N.A. so that it will operate one banking subsidiary in its five-state, mid-Atlantic footprint. The OCC’s approval of the merger of these three subsidiary banks is the first step toward accomplishing this goal.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to the Corporation’s financial condition, results of operations and business. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" “projects,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward looking statements may include projections of, or guidance on, the Corporation’s future financial performance, expected levels of future expenses, anticipated growth strategies, descriptions of new business initiatives and anticipated trends in the Corporation’s business or financial results.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts, nor assurance of future performance. Instead, they are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of the Corporation’s business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements related to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Corporation’s control, and actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement is based only on information currently available and speaks only as of the date when made. The Corporation undertakes no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nA discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting the Corporation, and some of the factors that could cause the Corporation's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, can be found in the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available in the Investor Relations section of the Corporation's website ( www.fult.com ) and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website ( www.sec.gov ).\nAdditional information about Fulton Financial Corporation is available at www.fult.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180522006351/en/\nFulton Financial Corporation\nLaura J.
