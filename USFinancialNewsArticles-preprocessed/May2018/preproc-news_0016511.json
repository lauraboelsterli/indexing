(\"Navios Containers \" or \"the Company\") (N-OTC:NMCI), a growth vehicle dedicated to the container sector of the maritime industry, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS -- RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nVessel Acquisitions\nIn April 2018, Navios Containers agreed to acquire from Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (“Navios Partners”) the YM Utmost and YM Unity, two 2006-built containerships each of 8,204 TEU for an aggregate purchase price of $67.0 million. These vessels are time chartered out at a net daily charter rate of $34,266 per vessel until August 2018 and October 2018, respectively. The acquisition of the YM Utmost and YM Unity was unanimously approved by a Special Committee of the independent members of the Board of Directors of Navios Containers. The acquisition of the vessels will be financed with a $36.0 million term loan facility and the balance with available cash. The term loan facility has an amortization profile of 7 years, matures in June 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 325 bps per annum.\nIn March 2018, the Company agreed to acquire one 2010-built 10,000 TEU containership from an unrelated third party for a purchase price of $50.25 million. This vessel is employed on time charter with a net daily charter rate of $26,663 until March 2019. The acquisition of the vessel will be financed with a $25.0 million term loan facility and the balance with available cash. The facility has an amortization profile of 9 years, matures in June 2023 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 300 bps per annum.\nThe Company expects to take delivery of all three vessels within the second quarter of 2018.\nAs previously announced, in March 2018 the Company took delivery of a 2010-built 4,250 TEU containership for a purchase price of $11.78 million. Navios Containers financed the acquisition of the vessel with cash on its balance sheet and $6.0 million of bank debt under one of its existing term loan facilities. The vessel has been chartered out at a daily net rate of $10,468 until May 2019.\nNew Sale and Leaseback Agreement - Refinancing Existing Credit Facilities – Extending Maturities to 2023\nIn March 2018 the Company executed a term sheet for an up to $119.0 million sale and leaseback agreement with a leading Chinese institution in order to refinance its credit facilities maturing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had an outstanding balance of $92.4 million as of March 31, 2018. The term sheet provides for 60 monthly payments of $1.4 million each. In the definitive agreements, Navios Containers will have an obligation to purchase the vessels at the end of fifth year for $59.5 million. The refinancing (if completed) is expected to release approximately $26.6 million of cash, before fees and expenses, and reduce the debt service cost for the remainder of 2018 by approximately $22.7 million, providing the Company with an aggregate $49.3 million of incremental cash during 2018. The transaction is expected to close within the second quarter of 2018. No assurances can be provided that the Company will successfully refinance these credit facilities or that the terms will be as described in this press release.\nFleet Development\nAssuming the closing of these vessel acquisitions, Navios Containers will own a fleet of 25 vessels totaling 119,538 TEU. The current average age of the fleet is 10.1 years (See Exhibit II). As of May 4, 2018 and assuming closing of these vessel acquisitions, Navios Containers has chartered-out 69.3% and 20.4% of available days for the remaining nine months of 2018 and for 2019, respectively, which are expected to generate $87.3 million and $45.8 million in revenue, respectively. The average expected daily charter-out rate for the fleet is $18,780 and $24,644 for the remaining nine months of 2018 and for 2019, respectively and the total expected available days for the remaining nine months of 2018 and for 2019, are 6,707 days and 9,125 days, respectively.\nPrivate Placement\nOn March 13, 2018, Navios Containers closed a private placement of 5,454,546 shares at a subscription price of $5.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $30.0 million. Navios Partners and Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. (“Navios Holdings”) invested $15.0 million at the subscription price and received 2,720,004 shares. Navios Partners and Navios Holdings also received warrants for 370,909 shares and 92,727 shares, respectively, with a five-year term.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Navios Partners and Navios Holdings hold 13,538,186 common shares representing 39.1% of the equity of Navios Containers. Both Navios Partners and Navios Holdings hold warrants for 2,353,011 shares and 588,253 shares with a five-year term, representing 6.8% and 1.7% of the total equity of Navios Containers, respectively.\nEarnings Highlights\nEBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as substitute for Navios Containers’ results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See Exhibit I under the heading, “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” for a discussion of EBITDA of Navios Containers and a reconciliation of this measure to the most comparable measures calculated under U.S. GAAP.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data and unless otherwise stated):\nThe first quarter 2018 information presented below was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective period.\nThree Month Period\nEnded March 31,\n2018 (unaudited) Revenue $ 29,917 Net Income $ 3,041 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,381 EBITDA $ 15,706 Basic Earnings per Share $ 0.10\nFleet Summary Data:\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators indicative of the performance of the Navios Containers' operations and its fleet performance for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 respectively.\nThree Month Period\nEnded March 31, 2018 Three Month\nPeriod Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 Available Days (1) 1,907 1,434 Operating Days (2) 1,877 1,352 Fleet Utilization (3) 98.4 % 94.3 % Vessels operating at period end 22 21 TCE (4) $ 15,259 $ 14,232\n(1 ) Available days for the fleet are total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Containers' possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (2 ) Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3 ) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Containers' vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels. (4 ) TCE is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a relevant period divided by the number of available days during the period.\nAbout Navios Maritime Containers Inc.\nNavios Maritime Containers Inc.

We use EBITDA as liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets, (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities, (iii) net interest cost, (iv) deferred finance charges and (v) payments for drydock and special survey costs. Navios Containers believes that EBITDA is a basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and represents useful information to investors regarding Navios Containers’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Containers also believes that EBITDA is used (i) by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nEBITDA is presented to provide additional information with respect to the ability of Navios Containers to satisfy its respective obligations, including debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and pay dividends. While EBITDA is frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements, the definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to those used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Containers’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) EBITDA does not reflect the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and other financing arrangements; and (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, among others, EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Containers’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nNavios Containers Reconciliation of EBITDA to Cash from Operations\nThree Month Period\nEnded March 31, 2018 (in thousands of U.S. dollars) (unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,381 Net increase in operating assets 8,934 Net increase in operating liabilities (2,209 ) Deferred finance charges (271 ) Net interest cost 1,871 EBITDA (1) $ 15,706\n(1) Three Month Period\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars) (unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,381 Net cash used in investing activities $ (12,788 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 24,197\nEXHIBIT II Owned Vessels Vessel Name TEU Year Built Navios Summer 3,450 2006 Navios Verano 3,450 2006 Navios Spring 3,450 2007 Navios Amaranth 4,250 2007 Navios Indigo 4,250 2007 Navios Vermilion 4,250 2007 Navios Verde 4,250 2007 Navios Amarillo 4,250 2007 Navios Azure 4,250 2007 Navios Domino (ex MOL Dominance) 4,250 2008 MOL Delight 4,250 2008 MOL Dedication 4,250 2008 MOL Devotion 4,250 2009 MOL Destiny 4,250 2009 Navios Lapis 4,250 2009 Navios Tempo 4,250 2009 Niledutch Okapi (ex Navios Dorado) 4,250 2010 Navios Felicitas 4,360 2010 APL Oakland 4,730 2008 APL Los Angeles 4,730 2008 APL Denver 4,730 2008 APL Atlanta 4,730 2008\nOwned Vessels to be delivered Vessel Name TEU Year Built Navios Unison 10,000 2010 YM Utmost 8,204 2006 YM Unity 8,204 2006\nSource:Navios Maritime Containers Inc.",
