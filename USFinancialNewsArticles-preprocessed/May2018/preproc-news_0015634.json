    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: SEAS), a leading theme park and entertainment company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenue increased by $30.8 million or 16.5% to $217.2 million from the first quarter of 2017. Attendance increased by 0.4 million or 14.9% to 3.2 million guests from the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $62.8 million, compared to a net loss of $61.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss includes approximately $21.5 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and a legal settlement accrual in the first quarter of 2018. The Company typically incurs a net loss in the first quarter because only five of its 12 parks are open for the full quarter. Adjusted EBITDA [1] was a loss of $0.1 million, an improvement of $30.2 million over the first quarter of 2017 and the highest first quarter Adjusted EBITDA the Company has reported since 2013. The first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA calculation does not reflect certain add-back adjustments due to limitations in the Company's credit agreement (see accompanying tables).\n\"We are happy about the progress we made in the first quarter and the continued positive results we are seeing year-to-date in April and are laser focused on continuing to execute as we enter the peak summer season,\" said John Reilly, Interim Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. \"Our first quarter results were mainly driven by our new marketing and communications initiatives, the anticipation and receptivity of our new rides, attractions and events and new promotional pricing strategies. Attendance also benefited from the earlier timing of the Easter holiday in 2018. Despite this strong start to the year, we know we have significant opportunity for further improvement. In addition to positive attendance trends, we also saw an over 10% increase in season pass sales revenue and an increase in total revenue per capita driven by a 6.4% increase in in-park per capita spending.\"\n\"As we think about 2018, we are encouraged by the positive year-to-date results through April for attendance, season pass sales and total revenue, despite unfavorable weather in some of our key markets that negatively impacted attendance and limited operating days in some of our parks,\" continued Reilly. \"We are driving additional attendance, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA through our enhanced communications activities, the anticipation and receptivity of our new rides, attractions and events, more focused operational execution, improved pricing strategies and a relentless focus on efficiencies. As a reminder, this year we have one of the most compelling line-ups we have ever had of new rides, attractions and events across our parks. We have Electric Eel in San Diego and Infinity Falls in Orlando still to be opened; we have our one-of-a-kind Sesame Parade in San Diego and still to launch in San Antonio; and this summer we have our award winning Electric Ocean event coming to each of our SeaWorld parks and our Summer Nights event coming to each of our Busch Gardens parks. As we stated in February, we expect to deliver the remainder of our previously announced $40.0 million in total net cost savings and the additional $25.0 million of cost savings we announced in late 2017 by the end of 2018. We believe we have significant scope to improve the financial performance of this Company and with our biggest quarters still ahead of us we believe we are well-positioned to make real progress towards that goal in 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company hosted approximately 3.2 million guests, generated total revenues of $217.2 million, and incurred a net loss of $62.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.1 million. Net loss includes approximately $21.5 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and a legal settlement accrual recorded in the first quarter of 2018. The Company believes the improved attendance results from a combination of factors including the Company's new marketing and communications initiatives, the anticipation and receptivity of new rides, attractions and events and new promotional pricing strategies. Attendance also benefited from a positive impact from the earlier timing of the Easter holiday in 2018, which impacted the timing of spring break for a number of schools from the Company's key markets. Revenue was positively impacted by the strong increases in attendance and in-park per capita spending (defined as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance) partially offset by lower admission per capita (defined as admissions revenue divided by total attendance). The decline in admission per capita primarily results from the park attendance mix, among other factors, partially offset by net price increases in admission products when compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by increases in attendance, total revenue per capita and the impact of an increased focus on cost efficiencies and the realization of cost savings initiatives. The first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA calculation does not reflect certain add-back adjustments due to limitations in the Company's credit agreement. There were no limitations in the first quarter of 2017.\n[1] This earnings release includes several metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). See \"Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section and the financial statement tables for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the reconciliation to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nChange\n2018\n2017\n%\n(Unaudited, in millions, except per share and per capita amounts)\nTotal revenues\n$\n217.2\n$\n186.4\n16.5%\nNet loss\n$\n(62.8)\n$\n(61.1)\n(2.8%)\nNet loss per share, diluted\n$\n(0.73)\n$\n(0.72)\n(1.8%)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(0.1)\n$\n(30.4)\nNM\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n20.3\n$\n5.7\nNM\nAttendance\n3.22\n2.81\n14.9%\nTotal revenue per capita\n$\n67.36\n$\n66.41\n1.4%\nAdmission per capita\n$\n40.32\n$\n41.01\n(1.7%)\nIn-Park per capita spending\n$\n27.04\n$\n25.40\n6.4%\nDebt and Liquidity\nNet debt as calculated under the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities was $1.55 billion as of March 31, 2018, which translates to a net leverage ratio of 4.70x Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results. The conference call will be broadcast live on the Internet and the release and conference call can be accessed via the Company's website at www. seaworldentertainment.com by clicking on the \"Investor Relations\" link located on the upper right corner of that page. For those unable to participate in the live call, a replay of the webcast will be available after 12 p.m. Eastern Time May 8, 2018 via the \"Investor Relations\" section of www.seaworldentertainment.com . A replay of the call can also be accessed telephonically from 12 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2018 through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 22, 2018 by dialing (877) 344-7529 from anywhere in the U.S., (855) 669-9658 from anywhere in Canada, or (412) 317-0088 from international locations, and entering conference code 10118971.\nStatement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release and accompanying financial statement tables include several supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate a company's financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation.\nManagement believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company's underlying operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of its executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA-related measures in the company's industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nAbout SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.\nSeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.

For the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflects business optimization and other strategic initiative costs primarily composed of $1.7 million of third party consulting costs and also includes a net $0.4 million of separation costs for certain positions eliminated not related to a formal restructuring program or cost saving initiative.\nDue to limitations under the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount which the Company is able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for certain adjusting items including business optimization and other strategic initiative costs and product and intellectual property development costs, is limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. The Company did not have any costs exceeding this limit in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\n(g) Reflects primarily product and intellectual property development costs incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\n(h) Reflects the impact of certain expenses incurred primarily related to legal matters during the three months ended March 31, 2018 which the Company is permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing its Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. The credit agreement allows these items to be excluded on an after-tax basis only; accordingly, these items are presented net of related taxes of approximately $2.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(i) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\n(j) The credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company's calculations of Adjusted EBITDA to reflect, subject to certain limitations, estimated savings resulting from certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. The credit agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any four consecutive fiscal quarters. As the Company added-back $10.0 million in estimated savings in its Adjusted EBITDA calculation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation presented above does not reflect approximately $3.7 million of net annualized estimated savings the Company expects to realize over the subsequent four quarters which were identified in 2018 related to savings initiatives resulting from certain specified actions taken in 2018. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period for estimated savings added back in prior periods. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only that does not impact the Company's reported GAAP net (loss) income. The Company has not prepared the calculation for the comparable periods presented.\n(k) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors, equity analysts and rating agencies as a liquidity measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate cash flow from business operations. Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements, which are significant. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow as defined above may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n(l) Calculated as total revenues divided by attendance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seaworld-entertainment-inc-reports-strong-first-quarter-2018-results-300643965.html\nSOURCE SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.",
