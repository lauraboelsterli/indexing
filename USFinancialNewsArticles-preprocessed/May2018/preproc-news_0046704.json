    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., May 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cyren (NASDAQ: CYRN) today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results for the period ending March 31, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter, Cyren grew its enterprise bookings at a rate of 260% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The growth was the result of continued traction with channel partners in Europe and the US, and the company added approximately 60 new enterprise customers and resellers during the period.\nThe success during the quarter culminated in the signing of the company's largest-ever contract, a three-year multi-million dollar agreement with Microsoft announced in April to extend Cyren's anti-phishing solution to millions of Office 365 enterprise users. Due to the timing of the contract, there was no revenue impact during the first quarter, but it is anticipated to have a material impact on revenue throughout the rest of 2018.\n\"Cyren had an excellent quarter in terms of new customer and partner acquisition,\" said Lior Samuelson, CEO and Chairman of the Board at Cyren. \"We added several new resellers into the Cyren Cloud Security ecosystem, and we're thrilled to have our anti-phishing technology selected by the world's largest and most well known provider of enterprise email solutions.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $7.6 million, compared to $8.0 million during the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.3 million, compared to a net loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP loss per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.10, compared to a loss of $0.06 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.9 million, compared to a Non-GAAP net loss of $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP loss per basic and diluted share was $0.09 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a Non-GAAP loss of $0.06 per share in first quarter of 2017. Operating cash usage during the first quarter was $4.6 million, compared to operating cash usage of $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cash usage, excluding financing activities, during the first quarter of 2018 was $6.0 million, compared to cash usage, excluding financing activities, of $3.4 million during the first quarter of 2017. Cash balance as of March 31, 2018 was $17.9 million, compared to $13.5 million as of March 31, 2017 and $24.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nFor information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Selected GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.\"\nRecent Highlights:\nIn January, Cyren announced an agreement with CARVIR, a global cyber security distributor.

The purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of the company's performance exclusive of non-cash charges and other items that are considered by management to be outside of the company's core operating results. The company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCompany management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business and make operating decisions.\nThese non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. The company believes this adjustment is useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of the business. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide consistent and comparable measures to help investors understand the company's current and future operating cash flow performance. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in a table immediately following the Consolidated Statements of Income. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when evaluating the business internally and therefore felt it important to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including projections about the company's business, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For example, statements in the future tense, and statements including words such as \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" or \"believe\" are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information available at the time of the press release and the company assumes no obligation to update any of them. The statements in this press release are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from current expectations as a result of numerous factors, including business conditions and growth or deterioration in the internet security market, technological developments, products offered by competitors, availability of qualified staff, and technological difficulties and resource constraints encountered in developing new products, as well as those risks described in the company's Annual Reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K, which are available through
