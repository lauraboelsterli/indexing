    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (“Cheniere Partners Holdings” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: CQH) announced today that its quarterly cash dividend of $0.56 per common share representing limited liability company interest in the Company. The dividend will be payable on May 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business May 21, 2018.\nCheniere Partners Holdings’ only business consists of owning common units and subordinated units of Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE American: CQP), along with other cash or property received as distributions in respect of such units.\nCheniere Partners Holdings’ quarterly dividend is expected to be the amount of distributions received related to its interest in Cheniere Partners, less reserves for general and administrative and tax expenses. Based on Cheniere Partners Holdings’ deemed federal net operating loss carryforward, current tax rates and market assumptions, Cheniere Partners Holdings is expected to begin making tax payments under a tax sharing agreement with Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE American: LNG) in the early 2020s.\nAbout Cheniere Partners Holdings\nCheniere Partners Holdings owns an approximately 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners as of March 31, 2018. Cheniere Partners Holdings’ only business consists of owning Cheniere Partners units and, accordingly, its results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners. Cheniere Partners is constructing and operating natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. Cheniere Partners plans to construct up to six natural gas liquefaction trains (“Trains”), which are in various stages of development, construction, and operations. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place. Each liquefaction train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Cheniere Partners also owns and operates regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines.\nFor additional information, please refer to the Cheniere Partners Holdings website at www.cheniere.com and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain statements that may include “forward-looking statements.” All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts or conditions, included herein are “forward-looking statements.” Included among “forward-looking statements” are, among other things, (i) statements regarding Cheniere Partners’ and Cheniere Partners Holdings’ business strategy, plans and objectives, including the development, construction and operation of liquefaction facilities, (ii) statements regarding expectations regarding regulatory authorizations and approvals, (iii) statements expressing beliefs and expectations regarding the development of Cheniere Partners’ LNG terminal and liquefaction business, (iv) statements regarding the business operations and prospects of third parties, (v) statements regarding potential financing arrangements, and (vi) statements regarding future discussions and entry into contracts.
