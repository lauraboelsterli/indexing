    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 4:15 AM / Updated an hour ago Chinese fighter jets complete night landings on carrier, live-fire drills Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese fighter pilots have carried out night landings on the country’s first aircraft carrier, the official China Daily reported on Saturday, the latest demonstration of military muscle as Beijing’s pushes to modernise its armed forces.\nPilots flying J-15 jets landed at night on the Liaoning, the official paper said, citing a video posted by China’s navy. It said this was a complex manoeuvre that marked a “huge leap towards gaining full combat capability”.\nChina has ambitious plans to overhaul its armed forces as it ramps up its presence in the disputed South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan, an island China considers its own.\nThe official newspaper of the People’s Liberation army also said on Saturday that Chinese fighter jets had recently carried out live-fire drills in the South China Sea.\nChina has been ramping up naval military exercises amid growing tensions with Taiwan. Last month, President Xi Jinping presided over the navy’s largest-ever military display, with 76 fighter jets and a flotilla of 48 warships and submarines.\nChina’s first domestically developed aircraft carrier set off on sea trials earlier this month. The older Liaoning, which is expected to serve more as a training vessel, was bought second-hand from Ukraine in 1998.\nIts navy has also been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with the Liaoning sailing around Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places.\nState media has quoted experts as saying China needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more.\nMany experts agree that developing such a force would be a decades-long endeavour but that the drive to bolster its forces at sea will be crucial in the longer term as China looks to erode U.S. military prominence in the region.
