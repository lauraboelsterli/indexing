The crown has benefited from rising oil prices this year.\nCommodity-linked currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars gained sharply, with the latter rising 0.4 percent to $0.7523 cents after data showing a better-than-expected jump in the country’s trade surplus for March.\nThe Aussie dropped to as week as $0.7473 earlier this week to hit its lowest since mid-2017.
