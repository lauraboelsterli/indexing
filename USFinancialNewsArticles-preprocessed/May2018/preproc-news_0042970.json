    "text": "WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (the \"Fund\") (NYSE: FEI) has declared the Fund’s regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution in the amount of $0.1183 per share payable on June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2018. The ex-dividend date is expected to be June 1, 2018. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.\nFirst Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (FEI):\nDistribution per share: $0.1183 Distribution Rate based on the May 18, 2018 NAV of $12.93: 10.98% Distribution Rate based on the May 18, 2018 closing market price of $13.16: 10.79% It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") in which the Fund invests, a portion of the distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2018 will be made after the end of 2018 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.\nThe Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to common shareholders. The Fund seeks to provide its common shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly-traded MLPs and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities industries. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 85% of its managed assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities companies. To generate additional income, the Fund expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its managed assets. The Fund is treated as a regular corporation, or a \"C\" corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes and, as a result, is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income.\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P. (\"FTA\"), a federally registered investment advisor, and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA is the investment advisor to exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds, separate managed accounts and provides supervisory services to FTP sponsored unit investment trusts. FTA's assets under management were approximately $122 billion as of April 30, 2018. This includes the supervisory services FTA provides to FTP sponsored unit investment trusts, which are unmanaged. FTP is a sponsor of unit investment trusts and distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\nEnergy Income Partners, LLC (\"EIP\") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of April 30, 2018, EIP managed or supervised approximately $6.0 billion in client assets.\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\nPrincipal Risk Factors: The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.\nThe Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.\nBecause the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by MLPs, MLP-related entities, and other energy and utilities companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors.\nThe Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.\nUse of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.\nThe information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person.
