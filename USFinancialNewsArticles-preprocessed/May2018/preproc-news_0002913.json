(NYSE:BXC), a leading distributor of building and industrial products in the United States, today reported financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our first quarter was perhaps the most productive in the history of BlueLinx. We entered into $110 million of sale leaseback transactions that allowed us to deleverage the balance sheet and enter into an agreement to acquire Cedar Creek,” said Mitch Lewis, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We completed our acquisition of Cedar Creek on April 13th, which positions us as one of the largest wholesale distributors in the building products industry. With more than 50,000 branded and private-label SKUs, a broad distribution footprint servicing 40 states, and approximately 700 sales associates calling on customers every day, we are confident that we are well-positioned to continue our growth and drive enhanced value for our shareholders.”\nSusan O’Farrell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer added, “The first quarter of 2018 was an exciting time for BlueLinx. We successfully completed four sale leaseback transactions and eliminated our CMBS mortgage debt of $98 million during the quarter. Our continued focus on deleveraging the business improved our financial performance and significantly reduced our debt during the quarter.”\nFirst Quarter Results Compared to Prior Year Period\nBlueLinx generated net sales of $437.5 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2018, up $8.9 million or 2.1% from the prior fiscal year first quarter. The Company recorded gross profit of $55.3 million during the fiscal first quarter, up $0.9 million or 1.6% from the prior fiscal year first quarter, with a gross margin of 12.7%.\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $13.4 million for the fiscal first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to net income of $0.6 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. As a result of the Company’s real estate monetization efforts and announcement of the Cedar Creek acquisition, the market reacted favorably, increasing our stock price during the fiscal first quarter. As a result, the Company incurred charges associated with the compensation expense from Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) of $8.9 million, which the Company expects to pay out in 2018 and 2019. Additionally, the Company incurred one-time charges during the fiscal first quarter for legal, consulting, and professional fees of $3.6 million related to the Cedar Creek acquisition and interest charges of $2.2 million in debt modification fees under the CMBS mortgage payoff in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $8.1 million for the fiscal first quarter, up $0.7 million or 10.2% from this period a year ago.\nWorking Capital and Liquidity\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the Company paid off the remaining mortgage principal balance of approximately $98.0 million. The payment was funded through long-term sale leaseback transactions on four properties owned by the Company, which provided $110.0 million in aggregate gross sale proceeds. With the working capital efficiencies the Company achieved, operating working capital decreased by $2.4 million from the fiscal first quarter 2017.\nSubsequent to the fiscal first quarter, BlueLinx used net proceeds from debt issuance under its amended $750 million ABL revolving credit facility (inclusive of a $150 million uncommitted accordion) and a new $180 million term loan to fund the purchase price for the Cedar Creek acquisition, repay debt, and to pay certain related transaction fees and expenses. Excess availability under the amended ABL and cash on hand as of April 13, 2018 was approximately $157 million.\nConference Call\nBlueLinx will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, accompanied by a supporting slide presentation. Participants can access the live conference call via telephone at (877) 873-5864, using Conference ID # 5957632 . Investors can also listen to the live audio of the conference call and view the accompanying slide presentation by visiting the BlueLinx website, www.BlueLinxCo.com , and selecting the conference link on the Investor Relations page. After the conference call has concluded, an archived recording will be available on the BlueLinx website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures and Supplementary Information\nBlueLinx reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company also believes that presentation of certain non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors. Any non-GAAP measures used herein are reconciled in the financial tables accompanying this news release. The Company cautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported GAAP results.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as an amount equal to net income plus interest expense and all interest expense related items, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, and other adjustments to Consolidated Net Income, including compensation expense from SARs, and one-time charges associated with the legal, consulting, and professional fees related to the Cedar Creek acquisition, and interest charges in debt modification fees under the CMBS mortgage payoff in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a primary measure used by management to evaluate operating performance and, we believe, helps to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance and cash flows of our business. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and is not intended to present a superior measure of the financial condition from those determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, as used herein, is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting operating trends. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an Adjusted EBITDA measure when reporting their results. We compensate for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than using GAAP results alone.\nAdditionally, we believe supplementary GAAP-based information such as operating working capital and debt principal are helpful to investors in explaining the impacts of our operating efficiencies. Operating working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities plus the current portion of long-term debt. Operating working capital is an important measure we use to determine the efficiencies of our operations and our ability to readily convert assets into cash. Debt principal is defined as the principal amount of debt payable at the stated period-end date and is used by management to monitor our progress in meeting our goals to reduce the debt on our balance sheet.\nAbout BlueLinx Holdings Inc.\nBlueLinx (NYSE:BXC) is a leading wholesale distributor of building and industrial products in the United States with over 50,000 branded and private-label SKUs, and a broad distribution footprint servicing 40 states.
