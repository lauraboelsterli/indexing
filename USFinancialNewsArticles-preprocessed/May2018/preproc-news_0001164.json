    "text": "STATE COLLEGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Eclipse Resources Corporation (NYSE:ECR) (the “Company” or “Eclipse Resources”) today announced its first quarter 2018 financial and operational results, along with updated guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018. In conjunction with this release, the Company has posted an updated investor presentation to its website at www.eclipseresources.com .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nAverage net daily production was 315.2 MMcfe per day, consisting of 72% natural gas and 28% liquids. Realized an average natural gas price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives and firm transportation expenses, of $2.87 per Mcf, a $0.13 per Mcf discount to the average monthly NYMEX settled natural gas price during the quarter. Realized an average oil price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $56.52 per barrel, a $6.39 per barrel discount to the average daily NYMEX WTI oil price during the quarter. Realized an average natural gas liquids (“NGL”) price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $25.55 per barrel, or approximately 41% of the average daily NYMEX WTI oil price during the quarter. Per unit cash production costs (including lease operating, transportation, gathering and compression, production and ad valorem taxes) were $1.39 per Mcfe, including $0.27 per Mcfe in firm transportation expenses. Net loss for 2018 was ($2.6) million; and Adjusted EBITDAX 1 for 2018 was $63.0 million. Established second quarter 2018 guidance and updated full year 2018 guidance including the reduction in the capital expenditure budget by approximately $60 million to now reflect approximately $250 million in estimated capital expenditures for the full year 2018.\n1\nNon-GAAP measure. See reconciliation for details\nBenjamin W. Hulburt, Chairman, President and CEO, commented on the Company’s first quarter 2018 results, “This was another solid quarter for the Company and the execution of our 2018 plan is off to a strong start as we exceeded our production and cash flow expectations while expanding our margins by keeping our operating expenses and our general and administrative expenses low.\nAs was detailed during our analyst day presentation, we continue to focus on liquids development during 2018, with all 5 gross (3.7 net) wells that were turned to sales during the first quarter 2018 generating a significant liquids production. These wells included our first two operated Marcellus wells and three Utica Condensate wells. Our production on a per Mcfe basis was 28% liquids for the first quarter 2018, and given the current commodity pricing environment, this liquids production aided in an increase in our year over year liquids revenue of approximately 36% and equating to approximately 47% of our total unhedged revenue.\nWe have recently completed drilling our first Utica Shale well in Pennsylvania in our “Flat Castle” project area. This well was drilled to 25,017 feet of total measured depth with a horizontal lateral of 13,857 feet. Additionally, during 2018, we brought on our second completions crew to accelerate completions on our backlog of wells created by our two rig drilling program. The completions team has had a highly productive quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day with minimal downtime despite the harsh winter environment.\nAs we continue to analyze our capital plan for the full year 2018, the Company intends on taking a disciplined and financially prudent approach designed to preserve our financial strength. As part of this effort, and in light of current outlook for natural gas prices, we are lowering our capital expenditure forecast for 2018 by approximately 20% reflecting our plan to reduce our net capital expenditures in the second half of the year. This plan will be executed through one of two approaches currently under consideration. As we near completion of our first two drilling programs in our Utica Shale drilling joint venture with Sequel Energy Group, LLC we are actively discussing the optional third program with our partner. As an alternative to continuing the drilling joint venture, we are also reviewing the merits of releasing one of our rigs in the third quarter. With either of these options the Company will continue to fund a one net rig program as we are today. As such, we are revising our guidance on our full year 2018 capital expenditures plan to approximately $250 million, materially below the Company’s initial 2018 guidance of $300-$320 million.\nAs we look forward to 2019, at current forward natural gas prices, we would expect to maintain our current activity and spending levels, which is significantly lower than what is reflected in analyst consensus estimates. While these changes are expected to result in slightly reduced production in 2018, and a projected year-over-year growth rate of approximately 10-15% in 2019, we forecast a significantly reduced outspend given current commodity prices. We are confident that this level of spending can be internally funded while maintaining prudent management of our balance sheet. Additionally, as we continue to look for ways to expand margins and improve full cycle returns, we are revising our cash general and administrative expense guidance downward by approximately 8% to between $35 and $37 million for the full year 2018.\nOur strategic and financial review process continues as we evaluate a full range of potential opportunities to maximize long-term shareholder value. As we have previously discussed, there is no timetable for the completion of the strategic review process nor any assurance that the review process will result in a transaction or other strategic alternative and the Company will provide further comment when disclosure is required.”\nOperational Discussion\nThe Company’s production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is set forth in the following table:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production: Natural gas (MMcf) 20,343.3 19,381.6 NGLs (Mbbls) 772.7 665.0 Oil (Mbbls) 565.4 454.1 Total (MMcfe) 28,371.9 26,096.2 Average daily production volume: Natural gas (Mcf/d) 226,037 215,351 NGLs (Bbls/d) 8,586 7,389 Oil (Bbls/d) 6,282 5,046 Total (MMcfe/d) 315.2 290.0 Market Conditions\nPrices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices for commodities, such as hydrocarbons, are inherently volatile. The following table lists average daily, high, low and average monthly settled NYMEX Henry Hub prices for natural gas and average daily, high and low NYMEX WTI prices for oil for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 NYMEX Henry Hub High ($/MMBtu) $ 6.24 $ 3.71 NYMEX Henry Hub Low ($/MMBtu) 2.49 2.44 Average Daily NYMEX Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) 3.08 3.02 Average Monthly Settled NYMEX Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) 3.00 3.32 NYMEX WTI High ($/Bbl) $ 66.27 $ 54.48 NYMEX WTI Low ($/Bbl) 59.20 47.00 Average Daily NYMEX WTI ($/Bbl) 62.91 51.62 Financial Discussion\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $110.2 million, compared to $101.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted Revenue 2 , which includes the impact of cash settled derivatives and excludes brokered natural gas and marketing revenue, totaled $110.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $95.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net Loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was ($2.6) million, or ($0.01) per share, compared to Net Income of $26.8 million, or $0.10 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted Net Income 2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $10.2 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to an Adjusted Net Income $4.8 million, or $0.02 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDAX 2 was $63.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $50.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n2\nAdjusted Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP financial measures. Tables reconciling Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDAX to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found at the end of the financial statements included in this press release.\nAverage realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are set forth in the table below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Average realized price (excluding cash settled derivatives and firm transportation)\nNatural gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.87 $ 3.17 NGLs ($/Bbl) 25.55 25.66 Oil ($/Bbl) 56.52 46.13 Total average prices ($/Mcfe) 3.88 3.81 Average realized price (including cash settled derivatives, excluding firm transportation)\nNatural gas ($/Mcf) $ 3.05 $ 3.01 NGLs ($/Bbl) 24.33 24.07 Oil ($/Bbl) 52.30 46.28 Total average prices ($/Mcfe) 3.89 3.66 Average realized price (including firm transportation, excluding cash settled derivatives)\nNatural gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.49 $ 2.60 NGLs ($/Bbl) 25.55 25.66 Oil ($/Bbl) 56.52 46.13 Total average prices ($/Mcfe) 3.61 3.39 Average realized price (including cash settled derivatives and firm transportation)\nNatural gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.67 $ 2.44 NGLs ($/Bbl) 24.33 24.07 Oil ($/Bbl) 52.30 46.28 Total average prices ($/Mcfe) 3.62 3.23 Per unit cash production costs, which include $0.27 per Mcfe of firm transportation expense, were $1.39 per Mcfe for 2018 and decreased by 3% compared to 2017. The Company’s cash production costs (includes lease operating, transportation, gathering and compression, production and ad valorem taxes) are shown in the table below.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and is shown in the table below. General and administrative expense per Mcfe was $0.34 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.39 in the three months ended March 31, 2017. General and administrative expense includes $2.0 million and $2.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating expenses (in thousands): Lease operating $ 9,390 $ 2,343 Transportation, gathering and compression 27,689 32,877 Production and ad valorem taxes 2,445 1,931 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 31,156 26,189 General and administrative 9,757 10,132 Operating expenses per Mcfe: Lease operating $ 0.33 $ 0.09 Transportation, gathering and compression 0.97 1.27 Production and ad valorem taxes 0.09 0.07 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1.10 1.00 General and administrative 0.34 0.39 Capital Expenditures\nFirst quarter 2018 capital expenditures were $71.7 million, including $59.9 million for drilling and completions, $5.7 million for midstream expenditures, $5.8 million for land-related expenditures, and $0.3 million for corporate-related expenditures.\nDuring 2018, the Company commenced drilling 8 gross (3.7 net) operated Utica Shale wells, commenced completions of 8 gross (5.8 net) operated wells and turned to sales 5 gross (3.7 net) operated wells.\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity was $148.2 million, consisting of $21.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $126.4 million in available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility (after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit issued by the Company of $33.6 million and $65 million in outstanding borrowings).\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company completed its semi-annual borrowing base redetermination of its revolving credit facility, which resulted in its borrowing base remaining unchanged at $225 million. The Company has made a subsequent repayment of $20 million to the revolving credit facility, with the current amount drawn on this facility of $45 million. The next redetermination of the borrowing base under the Company’s revolving credit facility is scheduled for October of 2018.\nMatthew R. DeNezza, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are thrilled by the record level of EBITDAX generated in the first quarter and continue to anticipate strong cash flow growth in the full year 2018. We believe the Company’s liquidity position in combination with our reduction in capital spending and our drilling joint venture gives us the flexibility to navigate the currently challenging natural gas market, while continuing to focus on keeping our leverage ratios low. As a means of providing additional certainty of cash flows the majority of our 2018 natural gas production is hedged with an average floor price of $2.93 per MMbtu. Additionally, we continue to actively hedge 2019 production.”\nCommodity Derivatives\nThe Company engages in a number of different commodity trading program strategies as a risk management tool to attempt to mitigate the potential negative impact on cash flows caused by price fluctuations in natural gas, NGL and oil prices.

When used in this press release, the words “plan,” “endeavor,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on Eclipse Resources’ current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading “Risk Factors” in Eclipse Resources’ Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2018 (the “2017 Annual Report”), and in “Item 1A.
