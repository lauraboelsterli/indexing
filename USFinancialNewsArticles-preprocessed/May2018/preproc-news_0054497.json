    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A detained British-Iranian aid worker sentenced to five years in jail in Iran is to face a second trial on new security charges, the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Saturday Quote: d Tehran Revolutionary Court’s head Musa Ghazanfarabadi as saying.\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she was heading back to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.\nShe was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson discussed Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case with Iranian officials after flying to Tehran in December to try to seek her release.\n“Ghazanfarabadi said the charge against Zaghari in the new case is security-related but did not say whether it was espionage or another charge,” Tasnim reported.\n“Zaghari is to present an attorney and then the court will convene,” Ghazanfarabadi said.\nReuters was unable to determine the identity of the lawyer.\nAsked for comment by Reuters, Britain’s Foreign Office said on Saturday that it would not provide a commentary on “every twist and turn”.\nHer husband Richard Ratcliffe said it was not clear what the latest charges involved.\n“To go back a week, she had met with the judge ... who said there would be a charge of spreading propaganda against the regime, that’s a very mild form of security charge so hopefully it’s just that,” he told BBC TV.\nIn a statement on Monday, the Thomson Reuters Foundation said it totally rejected “the renewed accusations that Nazanin is guilty of spreading propaganda” and said it continued to assert her full innocence.\nIn response to an urgent question in parliament on Tuesday about her situation, British Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said Prime Minister Theresa May had raised all consular cases with President Hassan Rouhani in a call earlier this month. He did not provide further details.\nHe also said the British ambassador in Tehran had spoken to Zaghari-Ratcliffe last Sunday.\n“We remain of the assessment that a private, rather than public approach is most likely to result in progress in Nazanin’s case and ultimately, her release, which is all any of us want,” he said.\nIran does not recognize dual citizenship, which limits the access foreign embassies have to their dual citizens held there.\nIran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals during the past two years, mostly on spying charges, according to lawyers, diplomats and relatives, Reuters reported in November.\nAccording to former prisoners, families of current ones and diplomats, in some cases the detainees are kept to be used for a prisoner exchange with Western countries. Iran denies the accusation.\nFILE PHOTO: Stones and placards with messages are placed on the pavement outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office during a demonstration to demand the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who is imprisoned in Iran, in London, Britain, March 10, 2018.
