    "text": "Payments processing company Square said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter.\nHowever, the company spent $33.9 million to buy bitcoin to allow people to trade it through its Cash mobile payments app. As a result, adjusted revenue from bitcoin was just $200,000.\nSquare, headed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , launched trading in the cryptocurrency through the Cash app in January.\nOn Wednesday, the company reported total net revenue of $669 million for the first quarter, a 45 percent increase from the prior year, and earnings per share of 6 cents that met expectations. However, shares tumbled 6 percent in extended trading on disappointing earnings guidance.\nBitcoin tumbled 50 percent in the first quarter to $6,926, according to CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had recovered to near $9,100 Wednesday.\nWATCH: Andrew Left on Square's bitcoin foray Citron's Andrew Left calls Square's bitcoin foray a distraction for investors",
