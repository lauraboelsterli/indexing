    "text": "(TSX: AAV, NYSE: AAV)\nCALGARY, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. (\" Advantage \") is pleased to announce that it has extended the expiry of its previously disclosed odd-lot share repurchase program (the \" Odd Lot Program \") by six weeks to June 19, 2018. Pursuant to the Odd Lot Program, Advantage has offered to buy back common shares from registered and beneficial shareholders of Advantage who own 99 or fewer common shares (\" Odd Lot Holders \"). The Odd Lot Program affords Odd Lot Holders the opportunity to sell all, but not less than all, of their common shares or to continue to maintain their current holdings. Advantage will purchase up to a maximum of Cdn. $4 million of its common shares under the Odd Lot Program (the \" Maximum \"). The Odd Lot Program is open to Odd Lot Holders of record as of March 20, 2018 and began on March 27, 2018. The Odd Lot Program will now expire once the Maximum is met or at the close of business on June 19, 2018, whichever comes earlier.\nOdd Lot Holders may participate in the Odd Lot Program using the participation documents that were previously mailed to them. Questions regarding the Odd Lot Program should be directed to Computershare Investor Services Inc. toll free at 1-800-564-6253.\nAdvisory\nThe information in this press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
