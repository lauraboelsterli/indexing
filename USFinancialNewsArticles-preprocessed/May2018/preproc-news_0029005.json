    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 11:08 AM / Updated 8 hours ago TPG puts British discount retailer Poundworld up for sale Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Private equity group TPG has put British discount chain Poundworld up for sale after receiving expressions of interest for the struggling retailer, a person familiar with the matter said on Saturday.\nPoundworld had been due to launch a Company Voluntary Agreement which would allow it to restructure and close some stores as it battles a tough retail environment. The source, who declined to be named, said the CVA process had now been postponed while TPG explores a sale.\nThe possible sale was first reported by Sky News. The source said information on Poundworld had been sent to a variety of potential buyers and there were early signs of interest.\nNo one at TPG was immediately available for comment.
