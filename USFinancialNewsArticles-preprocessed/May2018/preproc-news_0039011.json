    "text": "OSLO, May 15 (Reuters) - British utility National Grid has developed a tool that can forecast the carbon intensity of electricity generation by region for up to 48 hours ahead of the power production, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.\nIn the previous version of its tool, National grid was able to calculate only the overall carbon emissions in Britain.\nThe new tool, developed in a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund Europe and WWF, will help consumers understand when and where the power is “greener” in order pick the right moment of the day to consume cleaner energy, said the firm.\n“This tailored information can tell people in advance when’s best to turn on the washing machine, load the dishwasher or charge the car, helping everyone to use power when it’s cleanest and most likely more cost efficient,” said Duncan Burt, director of the system operator at National Grid.\nOn Tuesday, the new forecasting tool predicted that over the next 24 hours North East England and South Scotland will be providing the greenest electricity.\nBritain recently clocked up over 72 consecutive hours without the need for coal-fired power, National Grid said, adding that solar energy provided more power than gas did in a day for the first time.
