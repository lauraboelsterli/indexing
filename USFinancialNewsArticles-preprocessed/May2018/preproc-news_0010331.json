    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 3:49 PM / a few seconds ago Wilbur Ross says U.S. economy strong despite trade issues Lawrence Delevingne 1 Min Read\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the American economy is strong despite a range of uncertainties over global trade. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attends a news conference at the Americas Business Summit in Lima, Peru April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\nThere are “lots of clear signs” that the U.S. economy is doing “very, very well,” Ross said on stage Tuesday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.\nRoss cited such factors as the “reshoring” of jobs to America, deregulation, and tax cuts benefiting companies and individuals.\nRoss also noted that steel tariffs negotiations with Canada, Mexico and the European Union were making enough progress to delay imposition another 30 days.\nHe added that separate negotiations with the E.U. over potential tariffs on U.S. goods were “a work in progress,” with no solution yet.
