    "text": "0 COMMENTS The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly a year as a political crisis in Italy sparked worries over the future of the eurozone.\nThe single currency was recently down 0.6% at $1.1552, its lowest level since July 2017.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella on Sunday blocked the formation of a euroskeptic government, reviving longstanding European fears that Italy, with €2.3 trillion in debt and a perennially sick economy, could trigger a new existential crisis in the eurozone.\nMany fear that the events over the weekend will play into the popularity of the League and Five Star parties heading into the late summer election, which could ultimately be seen as a referendum on the euro, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, in a note to clients.\nThe euro’s weakness weighed on a broad range of European currencies. The dollar was recently up 1.1% against the Norwegian krone and gained 1.5% against the Swedish krona. It rose 1.1% against the Polish zloty, while also notching gains against the Hungarian forint and Czech koruna.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently up 0.2% to 87.54.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
