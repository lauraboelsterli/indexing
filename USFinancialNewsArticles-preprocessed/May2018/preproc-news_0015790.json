    "text": "Levinson joins world-class support team for Canadian self-driving vehicle manufacturer\nKITCHENER, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clearpath Robotics today announced the addition of veteran business leader Linda Fayne Levinson to the company’s board of directors as its first independent member.\n“Linda is a perfect fit at this pivotal time in Clearpath’s journey because as we mature as a company and grow internationally, her vast experience is exactly what we need,” said Matt Rendall, CEO and co-founder of Clearpath. “The addition of Linda immediately gives us a world-class veteran perspective that will help us achieve our long-term goals and objectives.”\nLevinson has a vast array of industrial and consumer business experience in both large public companies and private startups. She currently serves as independent lead director at Jacobs Engineering Group and is a director at NCR where she chairs the compensation committee. Previously, she served as chair of the board of Hertz and a director of Ingram Micro and Western Union. Levinson has also served on multiple private tech company boards during her career as a venture investor and presently is a director of Kount, a private fintech company. She is on the advisory board of CVC Capital Partners, a member of the McKinsey New Ventures Advisory Council and a senior advisor to RRE Ventures.\nLevinson also has an extensive background as a company executive and an investor, having served as a partner at GRP Partners (now UpFront Partners), an executive at Creative Artists Agency, a partner of merchant bank Wings Partner, and a senior vice president of American Express Travel Related Services Co. She became the first female partner of McKinsey & Company in 1978.\n“I am excited to use the experience I have gathered throughout my career and apply it to Clearpath and the autonomous vehicle industry,” said Levinson. “I admire the foundation that has been laid and am confident that together we are going to build a truly remarkable, global business. I look forward to joining the other board members and the Clearpath executive team in pushing this company to the top of the industry.”\nLevinson officially joined the Clearpath board in October 2017. Her addition continues the recent trend of Clearpath strengthening its world-class support team. Earlier this year, Google and Uber mapping expert Brian McClendon joined Clearpath’s board of advisors. Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning joined the advisory board in 2016.\nAbout Clearpath\nClearpath Robotics Inc. provides industry-leading self-driving technology, products, and services to over 500 of the world’s most innovative brands.
