His ERA skyrocketed to 7.67. Nine of the 15 batters Lauer faced reached base.\nThe Marlins jumped on Lauer for four runs on five consecutive hits in the first.\nBrian Anderson started the assault with a one-out double and scored on a single by Starlin Castro, who moved to third on a double by Justin Bour. Former Padre Cameron Maybin singled home Castro. After Maybin stole second, Yadiel Rivera singled home Bour and Maybin.\nThe Marlins’ fifth run off Lauer came in the third. Castro opened the inning with a double and scored on the second of three singles by Maybin, who paced Miami’s 15-hit attack.\nMiami’s final runs came against Padres right-hander Bryan Mitchell in the ninth. Rivera opened the inning with his second single and scored on a two-out double by pinch hitter Derek Dietrich, who scored on Miguel Rojas’ second single.\nThe only run off Smith was Franmil Reyes’ 378-foot homer leading off the second. It was the second homer by the 6-foot-5, 275-pound Reyes since he was promoted from Triple-A El Paso on May 14.\nThe 26-year-old Smith equaled his longest start of the season, departing after pinch hitter Travis Jankowski opened the bottom of the eighth with a single. That snapped a string of 10 consecutive Padres retired since Freddy Galvis blooped a double into left.\nSmith threw 103 pitches, with 59 going for strikes.\nAfter Lauer departed, left-hander Robbie Erlin allowed no runs on four hits with no walks and three strikeouts over 5 2/3 innings for the Padres.\nSan Diego’s Christian Villanueva doubled in the ninth and scored on an infield single by Hunter Renfroe, who was activated from a rehab assignment with El Paso earlier in the day.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
