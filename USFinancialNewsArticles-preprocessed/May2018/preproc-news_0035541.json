    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Extended Stay America, Inc. (“ESA”) and its paired-share REIT, ESH Hospitality, Inc. (“ESH”), (collectively, the “Company”) (NYSE:STAY) today announced that Christopher N. Dekle has been appointed to serve as the next General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of both companies, effective June 1, 2018.\nMr. Dekle, 46, joined the Company in 2005 and has since served in positions of increasing responsibility including Corporate Counsel, Assistant General Counsel, General Counsel and Vice President, and most recently as Deputy General Counsel, Vice President and Assistant Secretary. From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Dekle was General Counsel for Employers Life Insurance Corporation. From 1997 to 2003, Mr. Dekle was in private practice.\nMr. Dekle succeeds John R. Dent, who has been commuting to Charlotte since his appointment in January 2015. Mr. Dent will return to private practice in the Washington D.C. area, where he will remain available to the Company and its Boards of Directors on an ongoing basis.\nJonathan Halkyard, President and Chief Executive Officer of ESA and ESH, said, “Few if any persons have the depth of institutional knowledge about Extended Stay America that Christopher Dekle has amassed over the past thirteen years, and no one is more qualified to take the helm as the Company’s chief legal officer. With Christopher’s appointment, we continue to fill our executive ranks with exceptionally talented individuals with deep understanding of our core business, serving the extended stay guest.”\nMr. Dekle said, “I’d like to thank Jonathan and the Boards of Directors for appointing me as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. I’m excited and honored to take the reins as our ESA 2.0 initiatives gain steam with asset sales, franchising, and new development. It is a transformative time for the Company as we continue seeking ways to maximize value for our shareholders.”\nForward Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
