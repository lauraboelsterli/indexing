    "text": "May 19, 2018 / 12:25 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Exclusive: Sanctions-hit Vekselberg repays 1 billion Swiss francs to Western banks - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nZURICH (Reuters) - Sanctions-hit Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg has repaid loans amounting to over one billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) to banks including Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) and UBS ( UBSG.S ), two sources told Reuters on Saturday. FILE PHOTO: Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renova Group, Viktor Vekselberg attends a session during the Week of Russian Business, held by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), in Moscow, Russia February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin\nVekselberg was placed under sanctions in a crackdown by the United States on President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle as retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The banks had until June 5 to resolve the issue, when U.S. sanctions come into effect.\n“The credit issue with the banks is finally resolved,” a source close to the matter said, adding certain finer details remained under discussion. “The banks have received the money.”\nThere had been worries over the possibility the loans, which were taken out using large stakes in Swiss industrial groups Schmolz + Bickenbach STLNS>, OC Oerlikon ( OERL.S ) and Sulzer ( SUN.S ) as collateral, could lead to a broad selloff of the shares if a solution wasn’t found by June 5.\n(This version of the story was refiled to reinstate name of UBS bank in first paragraph) Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Polina Ivanova, Editing by William Maclean",
