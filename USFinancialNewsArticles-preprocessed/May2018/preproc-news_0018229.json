These statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “continues,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “projects,” “forecasts,” and similar expressions. All forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs as of the date of this release and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, the risks identified and discussed from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") provided throughout this press release, Surgery Partners has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income, which exclude various items detailed in the attached \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that management believes may enhance the evaluation of the Company's ongoing operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s computation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from those used by other companies. These measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income or loss, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other measures of operating performance, liquidity or indebtedness derived in accordance with GAAP.\nIn connection with the Preferred Private Placement and the Private Sale, as previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 1, 2017, the Company elected to apply “pushdown” accounting with the change of control effective August 31, 2017, by applying the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Company for periods before and after August 31, 2017 will reflect different bases of accounting, and the financial positions and results of operations of those periods are not comparable. Throughout the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes therein to be filed on May 10, 2018, periods prior to the change of control are identified as \"Predecessor\" and periods after the change of control are identified as \"Successor.\"\nSURGERY PARTNERS, INC.\nSELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA\n(Amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 417,369 $ 286,183 Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 129,735 89,887 Supplies 114,430 71,160 Professional and medical fees 35,679 21,125 Lease expense 21,361 13,626 Other operating expenses 26,107 16,150 Cost of revenues 327,312 211,948 General and administrative expenses (1) 24,152 15,541 Depreciation and amortization 15,749 11,108 Provision for doubtful accounts 6,037 5,675 Income from equity investments (1,862 ) (1,200 ) Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net 47 1,196 Merger transaction and integration costs 5,033 337 Other income (262 ) (143 ) Total operating expenses 376,206 244,462 Operating income 41,163 41,721 Interest expense, net (34,276 ) (25,182 ) Income before income taxes 6,887 16,539 Income tax expense 1,762 2,117 Net income 5,125 14,422 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (22,646 ) (17,176 ) Net loss attributable to Surgery Partners, Inc.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources. Non-controlling interests represent the interests of third parties, such as physicians, and in some cases, healthcare systems that own an interest in surgical facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. We believe that it is helpful to investors to present Adjusted EBITDA as defined above because it excludes the portion of net income attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors our portion of Adjusted EBITDA generated by our surgical facilities and other operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believes such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n(6) This amount includes merger transaction and integration costs of $5.0 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and practice acquisition costs of $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(7) This amount represents adjustments to revenue in connection with applying consistent policies across the combined company as a result of the integration of Surgery Partners and NSH.\nSURGERY PARTNERS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs certain non-recurring gains or losses that are normally nonoperational in nature and that it does not consider relevant in assessing its ongoing operating performance. When significant, Surgery Partners’ management and Board of Directors typically exclude these gains or losses when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and in certain instances when evaluating performance for incentive compensation purposes. Additionally, the Company believes that certain investors and equity analysts exclude these or similar items when evaluating the Company’s current or future operating performance and in making informed investment decisions regarding the Company. Accordingly, the Company provides adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders as a supplement to its comparable GAAP measure of net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders. Adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income per share attributable to common stockholders as presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table reconciles net income as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations to adjusted net (loss) income used to calculate adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Net Income $ 5,125 $ 14,422 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 22,646 17,176 Amounts attributable to participating securities (8) 7,772 — Plus: Non-cash stock compensation expense 1,997 634 Contingent acquisition compensation expense 503 2,033 Merger transaction, integration and practice acquisition costs 5,485 591 Reserve adjustments (7) 4,779 — Loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net 47 1,196 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (12,482 ) $ 1,700 Adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders Basic $ (0.26 ) $ 0.04 Diluted (9) $ (0.26 ) $ 0.04 Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic 48,006,870 48,019,652 Diluted (9) 48,006,870 48,152,988 (8) Includes dividends accrued during the three months ended March 31, 2018 for the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock does not participate in undistributed losses. There were no participating securities during the 2017 period.\n(9) The impact of potentially dilutive securities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was not considered because the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nContact\nThomas F.
