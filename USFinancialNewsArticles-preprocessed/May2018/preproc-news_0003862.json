    "text": "WOONSOCKET, R.I., May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter Year-over-Year Highlights:\nNet revenues increased 2.6% to $45.7 billion Retail/LTC same store prescription volume growth of 8.5% GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.98 Adjusted EPS of $1.48, which reflects an additional adjustment for net interest expense from the proposed Aetna acquisition\n2018 Full Year Guidance:\nGAAP operating profit growth of down 0.25% to up 2.75% Adjusted operating profit growth of down 1.5% to up 1.5% GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $5.11 to $5.32 Adjusted EPS of $6.87 to $7.08, which reflects an additional adjustment for net interest expense from the proposed Aetna acquisition\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo stated, \"We generated solid results in the quarter, benefiting from higher prescription volumes within our retail pharmacy business and a lower effective income tax rate. At the same time, we continue to focus on long-term growth initiatives and to invest in process improvements and technology enhancements that will position us well to expand our reach in providing access to high-quality and more affordable care.\n\"We continue to innovate in the health care market. Recently, we introduced \"Real-time Benefits,\" a process to share plan design in real-time at the point of prescribing with the physician. During the first quarter, we also launched an initiative, \"Rx Savings Finder,\" to combat rising drug prices. This initiative provides improved visibility into drug costs at the pharmacy counter. These initiatives have benefitted consumers by improving transparency and lowering costs.\nMr. Merlo added, \"Looking forward, the Aetna transaction will provide us the means to further lower health care costs for consumers and payors. In March, the transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies. We are moving forward on both the regulatory and integration planning fronts in support of a close in the second half of this year and a smooth, efficient integration of operations.\"\nRevenues\nNet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 2.6%, or $1.2 billion, to approximately $45.7 billion, up from $44.5 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nRevenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 3.2% to approximately $32.2 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by growth in pharmacy network and specialty claim volume as well as brand inflation, partially offset by continued price compression and increased generic dispensing. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 6.0%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, to 399.5 million, compared to 376.8 million in the prior year period. The increase in pharmacy network claim volume was primarily due to an increase in net new business. On a 30-day equivalent basis, mail choice claims processed during the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 8.9% to 69.3 million, compared to 63.7 million in the prior year. The increase in mail choice claim volume was driven by continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice ® offerings.\nRevenues in the Retail/LTC Segment increased 5.6% to approximately $20.4 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in same store prescription volume of 8.5%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, due to continued adoption of our Patient Care Programs, partnerships with PBM's and health plans, and our inclusion in a number of additional Medicare Part D networks this year, as well as brand inflation. This increase was partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\nSame store sales increased 5.8% and pharmacy same store sales increased 7.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in pharmacy same store sales was principally driven by the increase in pharmacy same store prescription volumes described above, partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 280 basis points due to recent generic introductions.\nFront store same store sales increased 1.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the prior year. The increase in front store same store sales was driven by a favorable impact of approximately 90 basis points as a result of the shift of sales associated with the Easter holiday to the first quarter of 2018 from the second quarter of 2017. The impact of seasonal cough and cold accounted for approximately 70 basis points of additional favorability as compared to the same quarter in the prior year. This favorability was partially offset by softer customer traffic.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 65 basis points to 87.6% in our Pharmacy Services Segment and increased approximately 60 basis points to 88.1% in our Retail/LTC Segment, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.\nOperating Profit\nConsolidated operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $153 million, or 8.5%, to $1.9 billion. The improvements in operating profit were driven by a $199 million decrease in store rationalization costs as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, offset by an $86 million loss on the divestiture of our RxCrossroads subsidiary, and a $28 million increase in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. The resulting increase in consolidated operating profit was principally driven by improvement in gross profit dollars in the Retail/LTC Segment, largely driven by improvements in pharmacy gross profit dollars. These improvements were partially offset by increases in operating expenses associated with growth in the business.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $45 million or 4.7%, to $998 million. The increase is primarily due to the $153 million increase in operating profit discussed above, less a $221 million increase in interest expense primarily due to the net interest expense on the financing associated with the proposed acquisition of Aetna Inc. (\"Aetna\"). The resulting decline in pre-tax income of $64 million was more than offset by a $100 million decrease in the income tax provision compared to the prior period. The effective income tax rate in 2018 was lower than in 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This was partially offset by the impact of the disposition of the Company's RxCrossroads subsidiary.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (\"GAAP diluted EPS\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0.98, compared to $0.92 in the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was $1.48 and $1.17, respectively. Adjusted EPS reflects an additional adjustment for net interest expense from the proposed Aetna acquisition. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted EPS reconciliation later in this release.\nGuidance\nThe Company expects full year GAAP operating profit growth of down 0.25% to up 2.75% and confirmed its previous adjusted consolidated operating profit growth guidance for the full year of down 1.5% to up 1.5%. The Company also expects to deliver GAAP diluted EPS of $5.11 to $5.32 and Adjusted EPS of $6.87 to $7.08 for the full year 2018.\nThe Company also provided guidance for the second quarter of 2018. The Company expects GAAP operating profit growth of 5.25% to 8.5% and adjusted consolidated operating profit growth of flat to up 3.25%. Additionally, the Company expects to deliver GAAP diluted EPS of $1.21 to $1.26 and Adjusted EPS of $1.59 to $1.64.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented in the tables at the end of this press release.\nAetna Transaction Progress\nThe previously announced acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health was approved by shareholders of both companies on March 13, 2018. The regulatory approval process is proceeding within a timeframe consistent with expectations. The companies received a second request for information from the U.S. Department of Justice on February 1, 2018 and are working cooperatively and productively with the Justice Department on the approval process. All of the required Form A filings were submitted to 28 state Departments of Insurance in January. In addition, states that require hearings are starting to schedule and hold those hearings. We are making good progress in the states and have also begun to receive approvals from states. The transaction is still expected to close during the second half of 2018.\nTo assure a smooth and successful integration, the companies are working together closely under an Integration Management Office (\"IMO\") led by senior executives of both companies. A steering committee comprised of the executive leadership from both CVS Health and Aetna has also been established to oversee the work of the IMO and provide guidance and strategic direction to integration leaders, while also participating in the decision-making processes.\nTeleconference and Webcast\nThe Company will be holding a conference call today for the investment community at 8:30 am (EDT) to discuss its quarterly results. An audio webcast of the call will be broadcast simultaneously for all interested parties through the Investor Relations section of the CVS Health website at http://investors.cvshealth.com . This webcast will be archived and available on the website for a one-year period following the conference call.\nAbout the Company\nCVS Health is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health. Through its more than 9,800 retail locations, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 94 million plan members, a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year, expanding specialty pharmacy services, and a leading stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, the Company enables people, businesses and communities to manage health in more affordable and effective ways.

These are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements.

The adoption of this standard resulted in a retrospective reclassification of a $17 million restricted cash outflow, which was previously reported in \"acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and other investments\" within cash flows from investing activities on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of cash flows to \"net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 8-K to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company is also providing reconciliations of certain non-GAAP information on a prospective basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted EPS,\" \"Free Cash Flow\" and \"Adjusted Operating Profit\" to assess and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP measures enhances investors' understanding of the Company's performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Operating Profit as operating profit excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, net interest expense on financing associated with proposed acquisitions, gains and losses on divestitures of subsidiaries, and charges in connection with store rationalization, and any other items specifically identified herein. Management believes that this measure enhances investors' ability to compare past financial performance with its current and expected performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Share, or Adjusted EPS, as income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, net interest expense on financing associated with proposed acquisitions, gains and losses on divestitures of subsidiaries, and charges in connection with store rationalization, and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company's weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Management believes that this measure enhances investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current performance.\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to property and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal comparisons and finds it useful in assessing year-over-year cash flow performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income before income tax provision as a measure of our performance. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted Operating Profit should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, operating profit.

The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities.\nIn conjunction with the Company's implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed the manner in which certain shared functional costs are allocated to its reportable segments. Segment financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2017, has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to the cost allocation methodology as shown below:\nPharmacy\nServices\nRetail/LTC\nCorporate\nIntersegment\nConsolidated\nIn millions\nSegment\nSegment\nSegment\nEliminations\nTotals\nCost of revenues, as previously reported\n$\n30,127\n$\n13,665\n$\n(5,858)\n$\n37,934\nAdjustments\n14\n(5)\n-\n9\nCost of revenues, as adjusted\n$\n30,141\n$\n13,660\n$\n(5,858)\n$\n37,943\nGross profit, as previously reported\n$\n1,096\n$\n5,676\n$\n(192)\n$\n6,580\nAdjustments\n(14)\n5\n-\n(9)\nGross profit, as adjusted\n$\n1,082\n$\n5,681\n$\n(192)\n$\n6,571\nOperating expenses, as previously reported\n$\n312\n$\n4,265\n$\n226\n$\n(16)\n$\n4,787\nAdjustments\n13\n(17)\n(5)\n-\n(9)\nOperating expenses, as adjusted\n$\n325\n$\n4,248\n$\n221\n$\n(16)\n$\n4,778\nOperating profit (loss), as previously reported\n$\n784\n$\n1,411\n$\n(226)\n$\n(176)\n$\n1,793\nAdjustments\n(27)\n22\n5\n-\n-\nOperating profit (loss), as adjusted\n$\n757\n$\n1,433\n$\n(221)\n$\n(176)\n$\n1,793\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Company's segments to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements:\nPharmacy\nServices\nRetail/LTC\nCorporate\nIntersegment\nConsolidated\nIn millions\nSegment (1)\nSegment\nSegment\nEliminations (2)\nTotals\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018:\nNet revenues\n$\n32,218\n$\n20,432\n$\n—\n$\n(6,957)\n$\n45,693\nGross profit\n1,138\n5,916\n—\n(195)\n6,859\nOperating profit (loss) (3)(4)\n761\n1,624\n(264)\n(175)\n1,946\nMarch 31, 2017:\nNet revenues\n31,223\n19,341\n—\n(6,050)\n44,514\nGross profit\n1,082\n5,681\n—\n(192)\n6,571\nOperating profit (loss) (5)\n757\n1,433\n(221)\n(176)\n1,793\n(1)\nNet revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion of retail co‑payments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(2)\nIntersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (\"members\") fill prescriptions at the Company's retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice ® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company's retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at the Company's long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.\n(3)\nThe Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes an $86 million loss on the divestiture of the RxCrossroads subsidiary and $3 million of acquisition-related integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare.\n(4)\nThe Corporate Segment operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes $40 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs related to the proposed Aetna acquisition.\n(5)\nThe Retail/LTC Segment operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes a $199 million charge associated with store closures and $15 million of acquisition-related integration costs related to the acquisition of Omnicare.\nSupplemental Information\n(Unaudited)\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services Segment's performance for the respective periods:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIn millions\n2018\n2017\nNet revenues\n$\n32,218\n$\n31,223\nGross profit\n1,138\n1,082\nGross profit % of net revenues\n3.5\n%\n3.5\n%\nOperating expenses\n377\n325\nOperating expenses % of net revenues\n1.2\n%\n1.0\n%\nOperating profit\n761\n757\nOperating profit % of net revenues\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\nNet revenues:\nMail choice (1)\n$\n11,208\n$\n10,848\nPharmacy network (2)(4)\n19,554\n18,987\nOther (4)\n1,456\n1,388\nPharmacy claims processed (90 Day = 3 prescriptions) (3):\nTotal\n468.8\n440.5\nMail choice (1)\n69.3\n63.7\nPharmacy network (2)\n399.5\n376.8\nGeneric dispensing rate (3):\nTotal\n87.6\n%\n87.0\n%\nMail choice (1)\n83.9\n%\n82.8\n%\nPharmacy network (2)\n88.3\n%\n87.7\n%\nMail choice penetration rate (3)\n14.8\n%\n14.5\n%\n(1)\nMail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect ® claims picked up at retail, as well as prescriptions filled at our retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice ® program.\n(2)\nPharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice activity, which is included within the mail choice category.
