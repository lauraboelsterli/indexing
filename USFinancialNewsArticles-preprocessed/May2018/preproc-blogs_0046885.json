Here’s essential reading on today’s developments.\nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY\nTwo top officials took markedly different positions over whether the US will move forward with tariffs on Chinese imports, punctuating several days of negotiations between the world’s two biggest economies with a question mark.\nThe UK finance industry has called for wide-ranging reforms of the British immigration system, in one of the City of London’s biggest interventions into the Brexit process to date.\nUS government bonds are paying more than debt from other developed countries for the first time in almost two decades. It’s a new sign of investors’ struggle to reconcile expectations for faster US growth with concerns about the impact of deficits and inflation.\nEurope, like the US, is getting higher bond yields – but for the wrong reason, writes Richard Barley for Heard on the Street. The re-emergence of political risk in Italy thanks to the formation of an anti-establishment government risks resurrecting bad memories of the eurozone crisis\nNicolás Maduro won re-election to a six-year term in a Venezuelan presidential election deemed illegitimate by the opposition and foreign governments, paving the way for heavier international sanctions amid widespread discontent over his management of an economy in free fall.\nIran vowed to uphold the pact curbing its nuclear activities if the European Union can offset renewed US sanctions, senior officials said, advocating an approach that would widen a deepening schism between Washington and Brussels.\nCopper is missing out on this year’s commodities rally, a sign that investors remain cautious about the health of the global economy despite the stock market’s recent recovery.\nIN THE PAPERS\nA powerful committee of MPs has warned that the government is putting national security at risk by allowing ‘kleptocrats and human rights abusers to use the City of London to launder their ill-gotten funds to circumvent sanctions.’ The Guardian\nRBS is considering restarting dividends on a scale that would make it one of the UK’s most generous payers to investors and would be likely to accelerate the government’s sale of its holding. The Times (£)\nNicola Sturgeon has said that Scotland will consider a fresh independence vote after Theresa May’s government offers greater clarity on Brexit. Politico\nThe Justice Department asked its internal watchdog to examine if there was any impropriety in the counterintelligence investigation of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, after the president demanded that the department investigate the motives behind the inquiry. WSJ\nRobert Mueller’s probe is looking more closely into Middle Eastern involvement during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as it is now exploring the role of an Israeli entrepreneur with ties to a Gulf monarchy, according to people familiar with the matter. WSJ\nRoman Abramovich has not had his visa renewed by the UK government after it expired last month. FT (£)\nMARKETS TODAY\nGlobal shares rose amid signs that China and the US were closer to bridging their rift over trade. European stocks picked up in the early minutes of trading and their Asian counterparts mainly rose overnight.\nRyanair was the worst performer on the Stoxx Europe 600, falling almost 3% after saying net profit rose in the 2018 fiscal year but that it expected earnings to fall in 2019.\nFutures pointed to gains for the S&P 500 when trading gets underway in the US. The index lost ground last week as the recent rally in large-cap stocks ran out of steam. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller firms achieved a series of record highs – another sign that the US economy is thought to be outperforming its rivals.\nThe dollar continued to charge higher and Brent rose back towards $80 per barrel. Some analysts said the Venezuelan election could give the oil recovery fresh vim.\nCOMING UP\nA relatively quiet day in prospect with no major data releases and both Germany and France shut for national holidays.\nShare this: Previous WSJ City: Italy's Upstarts Set Collision Course With Europe, Cryptocurrency Firms Explore Bank Licenses Next WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Argentina, Crypto, Summer Beer",
