    "text": " Apple's cash hoard,)\nON APPLE'S CASH HOARD\n\"It's extremely hard to find acquisitions that would be accretive to Apple (in) the $50-$100 billion range. As I look around the horizon, I don't see anything that would make sense for them, whereas I do see a business that they know everything about ... I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares ... Mentally, you can say we own 5 percent of it ... Over the passage of time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\"\nON BNSF RAILROAD\n\"We get a decent return on the capital-intensive businesses. We bought most at decent prices and they've been run very well.\"\nON NEWSPAPERS\nNo one except the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and (now) the Washington Post has come up with a digital product that will in a significant way replace the revenue being lost as print newspapers lose cir and advertising ... the Journal, the Times and probably the Post have an economically viable model in the digital world.\"\n PARTNERSHIP Hunnicutt ",
