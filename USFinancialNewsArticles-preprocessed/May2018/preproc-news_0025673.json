Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur v Newcastle United - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - May 9, 2018 Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Hugo Lloris celebrate after the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge\nWith fifth-placed Chelsea having been held to a 1-1 draw at home to Huddersfield Town, Tottenham’s hard-fought win took them up to third place on 74 points, four clear of their London rivals with one round of games remaining this season.\nKane, who had struggled to make an impact in the first half, struck five minutes into the second period with a precise finish from inside the area after being fed by Son Heung-min to relieve the tension inside Wembley Stadium. Related Coverage\nSpurs were scrappy in the first half and had a let-off after 14 minutes when Jonjo Shelvey’s free kick from the edge of the area clipped the post with Hugo Lloris at full stretch. Slideshow (7 Images)\nLloris was called into action again when the Frenchman dived to tip away a close-range header by Jamaal Lascelles after a Shelvey cross from the right.\nNewcastle continued to create the best chances but Dwight Gayle fluffed his lines in front of goal when he shot tamely at Lloris before Kane miskicked at the other end leading to murmurs of discontent around the stadium.\nThe breakthrough for Spurs came just after the break, though, when Kane scored with a sidefooted shot into the top corner for his 28th league goal of the season after fine build-up play involving Dele Alli and South Korean Son.\nThe win means Tottenham will be playing in Europe’s elite competition at their new stadium next season and helped to make up for the disappointment of losing in the FA Cup semi-finals to Manchester United which left them without a trophy.
