    "text": "NASHVILLE, TN, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LIG Assets, Inc. (OTC PINK: LIGA) (also known as the \"Leader in Green Assets\" or \"LIGA\") Announces that LIGA’s newly appointed President and BGTV Direct CEO and Co-Founder, Marvin Baker, through extensive due diligence and negotiations, has enabled LIG Assets’ subsidiary BGTV Direct to acquire controlling interest in the historic music venue Buck Lake Ranch. In 2017, Buck Lake Ranch was chosen as \"Camper's Choice Rover Pass as one of the 10 Best Medium-Sized Campgrounds in The United States\" https://www.roverpass.com/blog/best-medium-sized-campgrounds-us-2017/\nBGTV LIVE Events\nMarvin Baker states, \"The value of Buck Lake Ranch is the rich musical history of over 70 years that include performers like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton, Alabama, Chuck Berry, Louis Armstrong, Hank Williams Sr. & Hank Williams, Jr., to name just a few of the hundreds of performers over the past 7 decades to grace the various stages on the grounds of Buck Lake Ranch.\"\nLIGA is also pleased to announce that BGTV Direct has launched BGTV LIVE events and experiential agency whose primary focus will be on live events and experiential marketing for global brands. Baker continues, \"Our BGTV LIVE company's business will be built around consolidating key historic venues and live events, such as festivals, into a national company that focuses on what our global advertising brands want\".\nThe stages on the grounds of Buck Lake Ranch include the “Famous Legends Stage” that seats hundreds of people to the largest venue \"The Bowl\" which the legendary band Alabama performed to a crowd of 22,800 people. By helping global brands achieve their objectives through high profile immersive experiences with their audiences, BGTV LIVE will focus on building real value for LIGA shareholders and increasing our Corporate presence across several sectors.\nBGTV will be rebranding the image of Buck Lake Ranch and already has implemented a plan to restore Buck Lake Ranch to its former glory days. The 75-acre Buck Lake Ranch is perfectly located in America’s heartland just over 2 hours away from Chicago, Indianapolis, Toledo and Detroit making it a perfect venue for artists to play. BGTV is currently negotiating to launch several major music festivals. Revenue sources include Camping, Music Concerts, Conventions, Weddings, etc.\nFor additional information about Buck Lake’s rich musical history interested parties can purchase the following book that details Buck Lake’s significant contribution to the American music culture: https://www.amazon.com/Buck-Lake-Ranch-Nashville-North/dp/0615321763\nFor more information please visit: www.BuckLakeRanch.com\nMarvin Baker continues, “I really want investors and especially LIGA shareholders not to underestimate the importance of acquiring controlling interest in such a famous entertainment venue and in particular what this means for LIG Assets, our shareholders and the Company’s future as we secure our place as ‘The Leader in Green Assets’ – but soon an established force in the global music and entertainment industry as well.”\nBaker would also like to reiterate to LIGA shareholders that this most recent acquisition is only the next step in the Company’s master plan to continue acquiring and merging with public companies bringing them all under LIGA’s Corporate umbrella to provide our shareholders with a steady stream of profitable investments for years to come – all without any dilution of Company stock.
