    "text": "(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will urge U.S. President Donald Trump to avoid protesters in central London during his UK visit in July and instead meet her at her country residence, the Sun newspaper reported on Sunday.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo The details of the plan will be given to the White House by Kim Darroch, British ambassador to the United States, the report said.\nThere are two proposals that will be made to the White House by Darroch upon May’s approval - one for a Downing Street visit or one based at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London - the report said, citing a source, who added it would be made clear that May prefers the meeting take place at Chequers.\nTrump will also be asked to have tea with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle, a royal residence west of London and not at Buckingham Palace, according to the report.\nDarroch will suggest to the White House that Trump does not visit Britain’s houses of parliament, the Sun reported.\nMay’s office was not immediately available for comment.\nTrump will travel to Britain in July for a working visit with May, after months of back-and-forth over when the U.S. president would visit what traditionally has been the United States’ closest ally.\nMany Britons have vowed to stage protests if Trump visits, with several politicians having previously voiced their opposition to Trump being granted a state visit.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said earlier in the year Trump was not welcome in London because of what he called Trump’s “divisive agenda”.\nTrump cancelled a trip to London to open a new embassy earlier in the year. May was the first international leader to visit Trump in Washington after his inauguration last year.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
