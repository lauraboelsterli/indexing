    "text": "TEL AVIV, May 30 (Reuters) - Israel’s banking regulator is poised to publish a new policy that will allow the country’s banks to buy back their own shares in addition to making dividend payouts.\nHedva Ber, the supervisor of banks at the Bank of Israel, said the new policy should be in place around early July.\n“I believe that most banks with capital buffers will use the buyback option once we publish it,” Ber told reporters.\nLeumi, Israel’s second-largest bank, said last week that it would start a buyback programme after it received special regulatory permission.\nReporting by Steven Scheer Editing by David Goodman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
