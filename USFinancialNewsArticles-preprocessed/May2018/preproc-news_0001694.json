At the close of the meeting, Chairman and CEO Thierry Le Hénaff stated:\n“Arkema has made a very strong start to the year, with a 33% year on year increase in adjusted net income despite a high basis of comparison in first quarter 2017 and the very strong appreciation of the euro.\nThese excellent results are supported by the success of our innovation drive in advanced materials, the benefits of increased production capacities in specialty molecular sieves in France and PVDF in China last year, the integration of XL Brands in adhesives and the confirmation of the very good performance of our intermediate chemical businesses. It also reflects lower tax rate and cost of debt.\nThis start to the year gives us full confidence in our ability to achieve the objective we have announced for 2018.”\nKEY FIGURES FOR FIRST-QUARTER 2018\n(In millions of euros) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-on-year change Sales 2,172 2,152 +0.9% EBITDA 383 355 +7.9% EBITDA margin 17.6% 16.5% Recurring depreciation and amortization (106) (111) -4.5% Recurring operating income (REBIT) 277 244 +13.5% REBIT margin 12.8% 11.3% Depreciation and amortization related to purchase price allocation* (8) (10) N/A Other income and expenses* (4) (5) N/A Operating income 265 229 +15.7% Adjusted net income 195 147 +32.7% Net income – Group share 188 137 +37.2% Adjusted net income per share (in €) 2.57 1.94 +32.5% Weighted average number of ordinary shares 76,012,491 75,668,784 * In the consolidated income statement, \"Depreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of tangible and intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation process\" is now recognized in \"Operating expenses\". For 2017, other income and expenses were restated to reflect this reclassification.\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\nSales rose 0.9% year on year to €2,172 million . At constant exchange rates and business scope, sales were up 7.3%, driven by a 5.4% positive price effect that reflects the ongoing policy of raising prices in the specialty businesses and market conditions in the intermediate chemicals businesses. Up 1.9% year on year, volumes increased significantly in High Performance Materials notably on the back of a strong quarter for specialty molecular sieves. The currency effect was a negative 6.6%, primarily attributable to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar. The 0.3% positive scope effect reflects the integration of XL Brands and CMP, as well as the divestment of the oxo alcohols business.\nAt €383 million , EBITDA was up 7.9% on the high first-quarter 2017 performance, with a significantly stronger euro particularly compared to the US dollar, which resulted in a €26 million negative currency effect (on translation only). This increase was driven by the High Performance Materials and Industrial Specialties divisions.\nEBITDA margin increased year on year to 17.6% (16.5% in Q1 2017).\nRecurring operating income rose in line with the increase in EBITDA, to €277 million from €244 million in the first quarter of 2017. It includes €106 million in recurring depreciation and amortization, which was lower than in first-quarter 2017 (€111 million), mainly due to a favorable currency effect. REBIT margin , which corresponds to recurring operating income as a percentage of sales, rose to 12.8% in first-quarter 2018 compared to 11.3% in the corresponding prior-year period.\nOperating income amounted to €265 million compared to €229 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first­quarter 2018 figure included €4 million in net other expenses, mainly corresponding to restructuring expenses and €8 million in depreciation and amortization related to the revaluation of assets carried out as part of the Bostik and Den Braven purchase price allocation processes.\nFinancial result represented a net expense of €23 million , down €2 million on first-quarter 2017, following the refinancing of a bond issue at more favorable market conditions in 2017.\nIncome taxes for first-quarter 2018 represented a net expense of €52 million versus a net expense of €66 million for the same period of 2017. Excluding exceptional items, the tax rate corresponded to 21% of recurring operating income, down significantly on the 29% rate for first-quarter 2017, notably due to the positive impact of the US tax reform.\nAs a result, net income – Group share rose sharply to €188 million from €137 million in first-quarter 2017. Excluding the post-tax impact of non-recurring items, adjusted net income came to €195 million , representing €2.57 per share (€1.94 in Q1 2017).\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 PERFORMANCE BY DIVISION\nHIGH PERFORMANCE MATERIALS (46% OF TOTAL GROUP SALES)\n(In millions of euros) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-on-year change Sales 998 976 +2.3% EBITDA 176 166 +6.0% EBITDA margin 17.6% 17.0% Recurring operating income (REBIT) 138 127 +8.7% REBIT margin 13.8% 13.0% Sales generated by the High Performance Materials division came in at €998 million , up 2.3% year on year. At constant exchange rates and business scope, sales grew by 6.9%, thanks to a 7.3% increase in volumes, driven notably by the large number of projects carried out over the quarter in specialty molecular sieves and the ongoing benefits of the innovation drive. The price effect for the division was a negative 0.4% but is up around 2.5% excluding molecular sieves, reflecting the Group's policy to pass on the increase in raw materials costs in its sales prices. These actions will continue over the coming months. The currency effect was a negative 6.1%, primarily attributable to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar. The 1.5% positive scope effect reflects the integration of XL Brands and CMP.\nEBITDA was up 6% at €176 million in first-quarter 2018, despite the strong appreciation of the euro and higher raw materials costs than in the same prior-year period. This performance reflects the strong contribution of the specialty molecular sieves business, the benefits of the integration of XL Brands in adhesives, and the solid performance of the division’s other product lines led by innovation.\nThe second quarter will be impacted by strikes by France’s national railway workers (SNCF) which affect the transportation by train of certain products and raw materials, and thus operations at certain sites, mainly in advanced materials.\nAt 17.6% , EBITDA margin improved compared to first-quarter 2017 (17.0%).\nINDUSTRIAL SPECIALTIES (31% OF TOTAL GROUP SALES)\n(In millions of euros) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-on-year change Sales 661 644 +2.6% EBITDA 162 140 +15.7% EBITDA margin 24.5% 21.7% Recurring operating income (REBIT) 120 96 +25.0% REBIT margin 18.2% 14.9% Industrial Specialties sales were up 2.6% year on year to €661 million . At constant exchange rates and business scope, year-on-year sales growth came to 9.6%. The 13.6% positive price effect reflects ongoing high prices for fluorogases in Europe and Asia and tight market conditions in the MMA/PMMA chain. The 4% negative volume effect mainly results from the expected decline in sales quotas in Fluorogases, which was more than offset by the increase in HFC prices. The 7% negative currency effect was mostly attributable to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar.\nThe division’s EBITDA amounted to €162 million , up 15.7% year on year, with increases across all businesses, confirming the division’s excellent performances.\nEBITDA margin reached 24.5% (21.7% in the first quarter of 2017).\nCOATING SOLUTIONS (23% OF TOTAL GROUP SALES)\n(In millions of euros) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-on-year change Sales 507 525 -3.4% EBITDA 66 74 -10.8% EBITDA margin 13.0% 14.1% Recurring operating income (REBIT) 41 47 -12.8% REBIT margin 8.1% 9.0% Coating Solutions sales came in at €507 million , down 3.4% on first-quarter 2017. At constant exchange rates and business scope, year-on-year sales increased 5.2%, driven by a 6.0% positive price effect reflecting ongoing actions to raise selling prices along the entire acrylic chain. Down 0.8% on first-quarter 2017 when restocking took place, volumes were impacted by weather conditions in Europe and the United States. The currency effect was a negative 7.2%, primarily due to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar. The 1.5% negative scope effect corresponds to the divestment of the oxo alcohols business in March 2017.\nEBITDA for the Coating Solutions division amounted to €66 million , down 10.8% against a high basis of comparison (€74 million) for first-quarter 2017, particularly in China, where unit margins reached very high levels in early 2017. Over the rest of the year, unit margins are expected to improve overall compared to 2017.\nEBITDA margin resisted well at 13% against 14.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\nCASH FLOW AND NET DEBT AT 31 MARCH 2018\nArkema reported a free cash flow of - €25 million in the first quarter of 2018, up against the first quarter of 2017 (-€44 million), thanks to higher EBITDA and lower taxes. The €221 million rise in working capital reflects the traditional seasonality of the business and the increase in the cost of certain raw materials. The ratio of working capital over annualized sales for the quarter stood at 15.3% at end-March 2018 versus 15.6% at end-March 2017. Capital expenditure amounted to €63 million, including €58 million of recurring capital expenditure. Full-year 2018 capital expenditure is expected to amount to around €550 million, corresponding to recurring capital expenditure of around 5.5% of sales and exceptional investments for the specialty polyamides and thiochemicals projects in Asia.\nNet cash flow from portfolio management operations was a negative €165 million following the acquisition of XL Brands in early January.\nConsequently, net debt amounted to €1,227 million at 31 March 2018 versus €1,056 million at 31 December 2017, i.e., a gearing of 27% versus 24% at 31 December 2017.\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nAcquisitions\nIn line with its development strategy in adhesives, Bostik acquired on 2 January 2018 the assets of XL Brands, a leader in floor covering adhesives in the United States. This transaction, based on a US$ 205 million enterprise value, will enable Bostik to offer a full range of solutions for this growing high added-value market. The Group aims to reduce the EV/EBITDA multiple paid from 11 times to 7 times within four to five years and after implementing synergies.\nOrganic growth\nIn February 2018, Arkema announced a 25% increase in its global polyamide 12 production capacities. This new capacity will be added at Arkema's Changshu platform in China and is expected to come on stream by mid-2020. This investment of a few tens of millions of euros will support the strong demand in growing applications such as cable protection, lighter materials in automobiles, high performance sports shoes and consumer electronics.\nPartnership\nArkema and Hexcel have signed a strategic alliance to develop thermoplastic solutions for the aerospace sector, combining the expertise of Hexcel in carbon fibers and that of Arkema in PEKK. As part of this partnership, a joint research and development laboratory will be set up in France.\nPOST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nOrganic growth\nIn April 2018, Arkema brought on stream new Kynar ® PVDF capacities at its Calvert City plant in the United States. This 20% increase in US production capacities will enable Arkema to support its customers’ growth in the region in emerging applications such as water filtration and in traditional markets such as the chemical process industry and high performance cables (automobile, fiber optics, oil industry).\nCapital increase reserved for employees\nArkema carried out a capital increase reserved for employees in April 2018, with 610,405 shares subscribed for a total amount of €50 million. The newly issued shares will carry rights with effect from 1 January 2017 and will be eligible for the 2018 dividend payment.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018\nDemand in the three main geographic regions should remain well oriented and the environment characterized by a stronger euro 1 and higher raw materials costs than in 2017.\nThe Group will continue to benefit from its strong innovation drive in advanced materials, the integration of XL Brands within Bostik and a globally robust market environment for its intermediate chemical businesses. It will continue to implement its major manufacturing projects, as presented during its Capital Markets Day, for thiochemicals, specialty polyamides, fluoropolymers and Sartomer.\nLastly, the Group will continue its actions to pass on the rises in raw materials costs in its selling prices and the rollout of its operational excellence initiatives to partly offset inflation on its fixed costs.\nOn the back of a very good start to the year, Arkema confirms its objective to increase its EBITDA in 2018 compared to the excellent performance already achieved in 2017.\nThe first-quarter 2018 results and outlook are detailed in the \"First-quarter 2018 results\" presentation available on the Group’s website at: www.finance.arkema.com\nFINANCIAL CALENDAR\n18 May 2018 Annual General Meeting 25 May 2018 Shares trade ex-dividend 1 August 2018 Publication of 1(st) half 2018 results 6 November 2018 Publication of 3(rd) quarter 2018 results A designer of materials and innovative solutions, Arkema shapes materials and creates new uses that accelerate customer performance.
