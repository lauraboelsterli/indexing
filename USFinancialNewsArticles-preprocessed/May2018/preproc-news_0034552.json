    "text": "First quarter gross profit doubled as gross margin more than doubled to 27.8%\nContinued progress on Transformation and Value Creation Plan\nLaunch of Virgil’s Zero Sugar line underway, shipping to distributors and retailers\nLOS ANGELES, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reed’s Inc. (NYSE American:REED), owner of the nation’s leading portfolio of handcrafted, all-natural beverages, today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter 2018\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nNet Sales were $8.3 million, consistent with prior year period;\nGross profit doubled to $2.3 million from $1.1 million in the prior year period and the gross margin more than doubled to 27.8% from 12.7% in the prior year period or 1510 basis points and increased 650 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017;\nOperating loss narrowed to $1.1 million from $1.6 million in the prior year period;\nNet loss narrowed to $1.6 million or $0.06 per share compared to a net loss of $2.0 million or $0.14 per share in the prior year period;\nModified EBITDA loss narrowed to $0.7 million from $1.3 million in the prior year period.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are pleased with our ability to hold net revenue despite our SKU rationalization and reduced marketing and promotional support during the quarter. We also continue to make progress on our transformation and value creation plan,” stated Val Stalowir CEO of Reed’s, Inc. “The benefits of our plan were clearly evident in the significant gross margin expansion during the first quarter. Our new glass contract with Owen-Illinois drove a majority of the incremental 650 basis points of improvement in gross margin from the fourth quarter of 2017 and contributed to a more than doubling of gross margin year-over-year, delivering 1510 basis points of improvement. We continue to see opportunities to improve gross margin as our business model is further optimized and transitioned to an asset-light sales and marketing model. We are making good progress on the sale of our Los Angeles manufacturing facility and are in the late stages of finalizing a new credit agreement with much improved terms and lower interest rates.”\n“We have officially launched the Virgil’s Zero Sugar line and have started shipping product to distributors and retailers. We are very encouraged by the initial response from retailers and we are in the process of increasing our level of sales and promotional spend to support the launch. Phase 2 of our transformation plan will be investing in sales and marketing programs to drive revenue growth and brand value. We are well into the development phase of these initiatives and should start to see benefits from their implementation by the end of Q2. We will continue to execute against our transformation plan and are pleased with the results we are delivering,” Stalowir concluded.\nFinancial Overview for the First Quarter of 2018 Compared to the First Quarter of 2017\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, net sales of $8.3 million were consistent with the same period in 2017, as increased average selling prices as a result of a price increase in the third quarter of 2017 were offset by lower volumes that resulted from reductions in promotional spending versus the prior year.\nGross profit during the first quarter of 2018 more than doubled to $2.3 million compared to the same period in 2017. Gross margin was 27.8% of net sales during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 12.7% of net sales in the same period in 2017, and up from 21.3% the fourth quarter of 2017. The 650 basis point improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by the benefits of the new glass supplier contract with Owens-Illinois. On a year over year basis, lower glass costs contributed to roughly 900 basis points of the improvement in gross margin, with the remainder primarily reflecting the impact of higher average selling prices and SKU rationalization.\nDelivery and handling costs increased 28.7% to $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 driven by one-time transition charges to a new warehouse and logistics partner and a general increase in freight rates. Selling and marketing costs increased 28.6% to $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2018 due to investments related to the development of a marketing function with agency support resources. General and administrative expenses increased 31.3% to $1.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 from $1.1 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of non-cash equity compensation and shareholder related activities.\nOperating loss narrowed to $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 from $1.6 million in the prior year period, or a net $0.5 million improvement.\nInterest expense increased to $0.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 from $0.4 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss narrowed to $1.6 million, or $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2018, from a loss of $2.0 million, or $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nModified EBITDA loss narrowed to $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nDuring the first quarter, the Company used $4.6 million of cash in operating activities compared to $0.5 million of cash generated from operating activities in the prior year period. The cash outlay was primarily used to pay stretched payables and pay down the high interest rate working capital line as described in the rights offering that funded on December 28, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million and $4.4 million of undrawn availability on its working capital line of credit.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Call Details\nThe Company will conduct a conference call at 1:30 pm Pacific Time (4:30 pm Eastern Time) today, May 14, 2018 to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.
