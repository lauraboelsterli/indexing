(NYSE American: LEU) today reported a net loss of $25.0 million or $2.97 per common share (basic and diluted) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $7.6 million or $0.73 per common share (basic) and $0.72 per common share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2017, which included a non-recurring gain on early extinguishment of debt of $33.6 million. While revenue for the nuclear fuel segment increased compared to the first quarter of last year, the Company still anticipates generating more than half of its annual revenue in the fourth quarter.\n“We are focused on growing the company in a difficult market by expanding our core business, diversifying our business offerings, and mitigating risks,” said Daniel B. Poneman, president and chief executive officer. “We have made important progress over the last several months. The long-term supply contract with Orano that we announced last week supports our commitment to supply diversity and will support new sales opportunities through 2030. Our new contract with X-energy to develop the next generation of nuclear fuel reflects our support of advanced reactor technology. At the same time, we are beginning to see the benefits of our efforts to cut costs and reduce our debt. As the world's most diversified supplier of enriched uranium and an emerging provider of advanced engineering and manufacturing solutions, our team is working hard to support the contribution nuclear power makes to building a low-carbon future for all.\"\nRevenue and Cost of Sales\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $35.7 million, an increase of $28.5 million from the corresponding period in 2017. Revenue from the LEU Segment increased $20.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting the variability in timing of utility customer orders. Revenue from the Contract Services Segment increased $8.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, reflecting $9.5 million of revenue related to the January 2018 settlement with the United States government related to past work performed for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), partially offset by the reduced scope of contract work for American Centrifuge technology services in the current period.\nCost of sales for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $41.3 million, an increase of $31.2 million from the corresponding period in 2017. Cost of sales for the LEU Segment increased $32.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, due to increases in sales volumes. Cost of sales for the Contract Services Segment declined $0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017, due to the reduced scope of contract work.\nGross Loss\nCentrus realized a gross loss of $5.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the gross loss of $2.9 million in the corresponding period in 2017. The gross loss reflects a greater concentration of deliveries in the quarter under recent contracts that incorporate lower prices.\nAdvanced Technology License and Decommissioning Costs\nAdvanced technology license and decommissioning costs consist of American Centrifuge expenses that are outside of Centrus’ contracts with UT-Battelle, including ongoing costs for work at the Piketon, Ohio, demonstration facility. Costs were $7.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 26 percent, in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. In the current period, efforts at the Piketon facility were focused on U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license termination and DOE lease turnover activities and the related costs were charged to expense. In the prior period, efforts were primarily focused on decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of the Piketon facility and the related costs were recorded as a reduction of the D&D liability. In addition, a greater allocation of Piketon facility costs were charged to the license and lease termination effort in the current period following the relocation of certain corporate functions from the Piketon facility. The Piketon D&D effort was largely completed in 2017, with remaining estimated D&D costs of $1.0 million.\nSG&A and Special Charges\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $11.2 million for the first quarter 2018, a decline of $1.2 million, or 10 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Allocated overhead declined $0.7 million following the relocation of certain corporate functions from the Piketon facility. Consulting costs declined $0.4 million in the more recent three-month period.\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, special charges included estimated employee termination benefits of $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, net of non-cash settlements. In the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred advisory costs of $0.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to updating its information technology systems.\nCash Flow\nCentrus ended the first quarter of 2018 with a consolidated cash balance of $153.3 million. The net reduction of $55.9 million in the SWU purchase payables balance, due to the timing of purchase deliveries, was a significant use of cash in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The operating loss of $26.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, net of non-cash expenses, was a use of cash. Sources of cash included the net reduction in receivables from utility customers of $29.5 million.\nSettlement with U.S. Government\nOn January 11, 2018, Centrus entered into a settlement agreement with the United States government regarding breach of contract claims relating to work performed by the Company under contracts with DOE and subcontracts with DOE contractors. DOE agreed to settle all claims raised as part of and subsequent to the litigation for a total of $24.0 million and provide a complete close out of all such contracts and subcontracts settled under the settlement agreement without any further audit or review of the Company’s costs or incurred cost submissions, except with respect to certain claims for pension and postretirement benefits. Prior to the settlement, the Company had a receivables balance related to the claims being settled of $14.5 million. In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company received $4.7 million from the United States government, applied approximately $19.3 million of advance payments received from the United States government in prior years against the receivables balance, and recorded additional revenue of $9.5 million in the Contract Services Segment.\n2018 Outlook\nCentrus anticipates SWU and uranium revenue in 2018 in a range of $150 million to $175 million, reflecting a decline in average sales prices compared to 2017 as more sales are made under contracts that reflect more recent market conditions. The Company anticipates total revenue in a range of $175 million to $200 million. Consistent with prior years, revenue continues to be most heavily weighted to the fourth quarter; Centrus expects more than one-half of its 2018 revenue to be generated in the fourth quarter. The Company expects to end 2018 with a cash and cash equivalents balance in a range of $100 million to $125 million. The anticipated decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2018 is driven by the expected timing of purchases under supply agreements and an increase in required cash contributions to the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.\nCentrus’ financial guidance is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties that could affect results either positively or negatively. Variations from its expectations could cause differences between the guidance and the ultimate results. Among the factors that could affect the results are:\nAdditional short-term purchases or sales of SWU and uranium; Timing of customer orders, related deliveries, and purchases of LEU or components; The outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies; Potential use of cash for strategic initiatives; Actions taken by our customers, including actions that might affect our existing contracts, as a result of market and other conditions impacting our customers and the industry; and Additional costs for decontamination and decommissioning of the Company’s facility in Ohio.\nAbout Centrus Energy Corp.\nCentrus is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry.
