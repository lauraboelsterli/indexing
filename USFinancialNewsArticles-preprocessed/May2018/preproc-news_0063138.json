    "text": "SHANGHAI, China, May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GDS Holdings Limited (“GDS Holdings,” “GDS” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:GDS), a leading developer and operator of high-performance data centers in China, today announced the pricing of its previously announced offering of US$250 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “Notes”, the “Notes Offering”). The Company granted the initial purchasers in the Notes Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional US$50 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes solely to cover over-allotments, if any.\nThe Notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.00% per year, payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2018. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. The Notes will be convertible into American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) of the Company, at the option of the holders, based on an initial conversion rate of 19.3865 of the Company’s ADSs per US$1,000 principal amount of Notes (representing a conversion premium of approximately 32.5% above the Nasdaq closing price on May 30, 2018).\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering for the development and acquisition of new data centers, repayment of outstanding indebtedness, general corporate purposes and working capital needs.\nThe Notes, the ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes and the Class A ordinary shares represented thereby have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws. They may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and/or to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any of these securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nThis press release contains information about the pending offerings of the Notes, and there can be no assurance that any of the offerings will be completed.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
