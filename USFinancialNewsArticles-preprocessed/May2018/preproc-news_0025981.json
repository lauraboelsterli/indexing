FILE PHOTO: Traders prepare before the opening of the German stock exchange in front of the empty DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, June 24, 2016. REUTERS/Staff/Remote/File Photo\nGains in RBS ( RBS.L ) following a multi-billion deal to settle a U.S. investigation of the bank’s bond sales, and a solid update from Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) buoyed the banking sector, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 limit losses to 0.1 percent.\nBT ( BT.L ) shares fell 6.7 percent after saying it was cutting 13,000 jobs, the latest attempt by Britain’s biggest telecoms group to rebuild after an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading [nL8N1SH184].\nTraders said its latest results showed revenue and dividend short of expectations while its full-year guidance disappointed.\nRBS rallied 5.2 percent after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities [nL1N1SG2P0].\nIts gains helped the UK’s FTSE index edge ahead 0.1 percent, outperforming other European bourses ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting expected to keep interest rates on hold.\nAmong other country benchmarks, Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB fell 0.6 percent, as bond yields jumped to a seven-week high on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties will take power.
