    "text": "May 8 (Reuters) - Wendy’s Co reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales at its established outlets in North America as the burger chain struggled to attract enough diners in a fiercely competitive restaurant industry.\nThe company’s same-restaurant sales in North America rose 1.6 percent in the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting same-store sales to rise 1.8 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.\nRevenue rose to $380.56 million from $285.82 million, beating analysts’ average estimate of $379.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
