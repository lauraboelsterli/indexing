    "text": "BRUSSELS, May 1 (Reuters) - The European Commission called on Tuesday for a permanent exemption from U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs and said U.S. President Trump’s decision to extend its temporary exemption for a month prolonged business uncertainty.\nThe Commission said in a statement that it took note of the Trump’s decision to extend the exemption for the European Union to June 1.\n“The U.S. decision prolong market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions,” it said.\n“The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security,” it continued, adding that overcapacity in steel and aluminium was not from Europe.
