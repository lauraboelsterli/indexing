Photo: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal A decade after the financial crisis , The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight former policy makers Daniel Tarullo and Alistair Darling.\nAlistair Darling, the former U.K. Treasury chief who led his country’s response to the credit crisis, is one of the few public figures associated with the financial crisis to emerge with a burnished reputation.\nWhen British lender Northern Rock ran out of funds in 2007, Mr. Darling authorized Bank of England support and a state-backed guarantee to depositors, stemming Britain’s first bank run in 150 years. As the credit crisis raged, Mr. Darling’s Treasury department stepped in to bail out troubled lenders HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland .\nMr. Darling sitting next to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner for the family photo at the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting near Horsham, West Sussex, U.K., in March 2009. Photo: Simon Dawson/BLOOMBERG NEWS For his long service to the government, he was made Lord Darling of Roulanish.\nMr. Darling left the Treasury in 2010. But the Scotsman returned to public service in 2014 to lead the Labour Party’s campaign to keep Scotland in the U.K. during that year’s independence referendum. The Union survived, but Mr. Darling’s appetite for front-line politics didn’t.\n“It was such a divisive, unpleasant experience…If I had any doubts about [remaining in politics] I thought that was it,” he said in an interview. “It was time to go.”\nMr. Darling now serves on Morgan Stanley ’s board of directors, but it isn’t all about work these days. He spends more time on Scotland’s remote Isle of Lewis, fishing there four to five times a year.\nRelated Daniel Tarullo, the Regulator Banks Loved to Hate, Heads Back to Campus John Paulson, Architect of Greatest Trade Ever, Hit by Losses, Redemptions David Einhorn Finds Victories More Elusive Since Winning Lehman Bet Ben Bernanke Loosens Up During His Post-Crisis Years Ex-Iceland Leader Now Hosting Movie Nights as Ambassador to the U.S . Where Are They Now: The Biggest Figures From the Financial Crisis Nobody Thinks the Bailout Would Happen Again A Decade Later, Seeds of Instability Are Germinating How Bear Wrecked Something More Valuable than Money “I have been contemplating painting the garden shed,” he said of the one at his Edinburgh home. “But I look at it, and every day it needs painting more.”\nIn the late summer of 2008, Mr. Darling was at a family cottage on the isle when he told a reporter that economic conditions were arguably the worst in 60 years. He was widely criticized as overly pessimistic, but the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the worst global financial crisis would soon follow. Several months later, the U.K. Treasury had to rescue HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland.\n“The banking system came within three hours of collapsing,” he said.\nMr. Darling believes the legacy of the crisis lives on. RBS is still a state-owned bank, and he argues that the unpopular fiscal austerity that followed the financial crisis in Britain contributed to support for Brexit, encouraging people to vote against the status quo.\n“Nobody would have anticipated that 10 years on we would still be living the consequences,” he said.\nMr. Darling addressing a rally in Glasgow ahead of the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence Photo: LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com",
