    "text": "The U.S. dollar dropped from a yearly high on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced interest rates would remain unchanged, in a widely anticipated move.\nAt the conclusion of its two-day meeting the Fed announced rates would remain at 1.5 to 1.75 percent, but offered nothing to dispel market expectations that it would raise rates when it meets in June.\n\"Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the committee's symmetric 2% objective over the medium term,\" a statement from the Federal Reserve said.\nThis week's language indicated more progress towards the 2 percent inflation goal Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized is healthy for the economy.\n\"Raising rates too slowly would make it necessary for monetary policy to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech last month. \"But raising rates too quickly would increase the risk that inflation would remain persistently below our 2% objective.\"\nThe dollar index briefly went negative after the announcement, before paring losses. The greenback last exchanged hands up 0.03 percent at 92.48. Earlier in the session, it hit a yearly high at 92.718, its highest level since Dec. 28.\nAgainst the euro , the dollar was up 0.03 percent at 1.1989.\nGrowing doubts about when the European Central Bank will normalize its monetary policy has hurt the euro against the dollar in recent weeks.\nGerman manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in nine months in April, a survey showed on Wednesday, as new-orders growth slowed for the fourth consecutive month.\nThe British pound gained after data showed that UK construction activity rebounded faster than expected last month after succumbing to snow in March, though the upturn did little to alter the view of investors that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged next week.\nSterling gained 0.10 percent against the dollar at 1.3624.\nInvestors are also focused on Friday's U.S. employment report for April for further indications of the strength of the economy and inflation pressures.\nU.S. private-sector employers hired 204,000 workers in April , the smallest monthly increase since November, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.\n--CNBC's Chloe Aiello contributed to this report.\nshow chapters The dollar just surged to a 4-month high.
