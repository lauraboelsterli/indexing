    "text": "RICHMOND, Calif., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EKSO), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today reported the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nRecent Highlights and Accomplishments\nShipped 24 EksoGT™ systems in the first quarter of 2018 including 11 rental units. In addition, converted four previously rented units into sold units. This brings total placements to over 300 units, of which 23 are rentals. First quarter shipments for 2018 represent a 165% increase over the same period in 2017. Shipped 75 EksoWorks systems, including both Mounts and Vests. This brings total placements to over 400 units. Achieved revenues of $2.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a 75% increase over the same quarter of 2017. Announced an educational partnership with the National Stroke Association dedicated to increasing awareness of and access to advance stroke rehabilitation exoskeleton technology that enables earlier mobility and restored independence for survivors of stroke. Signed a license and distribution agreement with Daydo Company for the manufacture and sale of EksoVests for the residential construction market in Japan.\n“The solid sales progress made in the first quarter of 2018 in both the rehabilitation and industrial markets reflects increasing demand for our products,” said Jack Peurach, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ekso Bionics. “We are focused on ensuring that our business model has the requisite efficiencies to support and expand the traction we are gaining with key customers. Toward that end, we are taking steps to enhance the major drivers in our U.S. business and establish processes that position us for success as a scalable and profitable business. In the coming quarter, we will implement similar additional operational improvements in our other geographies and for our EksoWorks business.”\n“This is also a bittersweet day for me as we announce that Max Scheder-Bieschin, our Chief Financial Officer, will step down later this year, moving with his wife to Montana,” added Jack. “Our company would not have its current momentum or opportunities for success without Max’s contributions over the past eight years. Max will stay on with us until his successor is in place and will continue to work with Ekso in some capacity until at least the end of the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue was $2.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, which includes approximately $2.1 million in medical device revenue, and $0.4 million in industrial sales. Revenue was $1.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which included approximately $0.9 million in medical device revenue, $0.5 million in industrial sales.\nGross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $3.9 million, compared to $3.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.8 million. This increase was due primarily to an increase in marketing efforts related to the commercialization of the Company’s medical devices for rehabilitation and exoskeleton offerings for industrial applications, and an increase in clinical research activity.\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $1.8 million, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.1 million. This decrease was primarily due to decreased employment costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $3.7 million, compared to $2.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.9 million. This increase was primarily due to severance expense related to the departure of our Chief Executive Officer and an increase in business development related activities in China.\nNet loss applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $7.9 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to $8.3 million, or $0.38 per basic share the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCash on hand at March 31, 2018 was $20.6 million, compared to $27.8 million at December 31, 2017. For the month ended March 31, 2018, the Company used $6.7 million of cash in operations, compared to $7.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nInvestors interested in listening to the conference call may do so by dialing (877) 407-3036 for domestic callers or (201) 378-4919 for international callers, using Conference ID: 13581989.
