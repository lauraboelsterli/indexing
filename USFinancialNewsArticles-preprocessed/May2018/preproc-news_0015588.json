    "text": "EditorsNote: Editors: Changes ‘Cardinals’ sixth pitcher’ to ‘Cubs’ sixth pitcher’ in third graf\nKolten Wong capped a comeback with a two-run, walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning Saturday afternoon, giving the St. Louis Cardinals an 8-6 win over the Chicago Cubs in St. Louis.\nComing off a 3-2 victory in the opener of a three-game series on Friday night, the Cardinals will go for a sweep in the nationally televised Sunday night finale.\nAfter the Cardinals had scored two in the last of the ninth to tie the game at 6-6, Paul DeJong led off the 10th by drawing a walk off the Cubs’ sixth pitcher, Luke Farrell (1-1).\nWong then followed with his two-run shot, his second homer of the season, to end it.\nTyler Lyons (1-0), who retired the only batter he faced in the top of the 10th, was credited with the win.\nDown by two runs and down to their final two outs, the Cardinals forced extra innings when Marcell Ozuna laced a two-run double off Cubs closer Brandon Morrow in the last of the ninth.\nThe hit scored Harrison Bader, who had walked, and Jose Martinez, who had singled.\nAfter the teams had exchanged four-run innings, the Cubs took a 6-4 lead on a pair of solo home runs when Javier Baez smacked his eighth of the season with one out in the sixth and Anthony Rizzo connected for his fourth with one out on the seventh.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision.\nThe Cardinals’ Luke Weaver was pulled for a pinch hitter in the bottom of the fourth inning, having allowed six hits and four runs in four innings. He walked one and struck out two.\nAll four runs off Weaver came in the second inning, when singles by Kyle Schwarber, Addison Russell and Jason Heyward set the stage for the scoring.\nBaez, Tyler Chatwood, Ben Zobrist and Rizzo drove in the runs, the latter two with RBI singles.\nThe Cubs’ Chatwood couldn’t hold the lead, giving up a four-run fourth that began with walks to Dexter Fowler and DeJong before he hit Wong with a pitch to load the bases.\nMatt Carpenter’s two-run double after a sacrifice fly by Greg Garcia and an infield out by Bader got the Cardinals even at 4-4.\nChatwood was pulled after the fourth, having allowed the four runs (three earned) and three hits. He walked five and struck out five.\nMartinez had two hits, while Bader, DeJong and Wong scored twice apiece for the Cardinals, who won their fourth straight to open a seven-game homestand.\nZobrist, Rizzo, Schwarber, Russell and Heyward had two hits each for the Cubs, who have lost four straight.\nThe Cubs out-hit the Cardinals 12-7.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
