    "text": "JERUSALEM, May 1 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed U.S. President Donald Trump about evidence of a past secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme at a meeting in Washington on March 5, a senior Israeli official said on Tuesday.\nTrump agreed that Israel would publish the information before May 12, the date by which he is due to decide whether to pull the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.\nIn a prime-time televised statement on Monday night Netanyahu presented what he said were Iranian documents obtained in a daring Israeli intelligence operation that purportedly prove Iran had been developing nuclear weapons before the 2015 deal that it signed with the U.S. and world powers.\nReporting by Dan Williams, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
