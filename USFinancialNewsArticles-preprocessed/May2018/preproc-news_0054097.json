    "text": "Warriors forward Andre Iguodala is out for Monday’s decisive Game 7 of the Western Conference finals due to a bone bruise in his left knee.\nMay 16, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala (9) moves the ball against Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul (3) during the first half in game two of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY Sports Iguodala hasn’t played since Game 3 of the best-of-seven matchup with the Houston Rockets. Golden State coach Steve Kerr said the injury came down to “the individual, just how he’s feeling.”\nIguodala’s status for any potential NBA Finals games against the Cleveland Cavaliers remains uncertain.\nThe club had termed Iguodala as questionable for Game 6 after the veteran had missed Games 4 and 5.\nThe Rockets are also expecting to be shorthanded without injured point guard Chris Paul, whose status for Game 7 is up in the air due to a hamstring strain suffered late in the Rockets’ Game 5 win Thursday.\nIguodala is averaging 7.9 points on 47.9-percent shooting to go with 4.9 rebounds per game this postseason. The Warriors have lost two of the three games he’s missed, starting Kevon Looney in his place.\nThe Warriors got Patrick McCaw back Saturday night. McCaw, who hadn’t seen action since suffering a serious spinal injury on March 31, scored two points in four minutes late in the fourth quarter. He was listed as out for the game by the Warriors on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\nCorrects headline to \"Rockets,\" not \"Cavaliers,\" due to an editing error\n ",
