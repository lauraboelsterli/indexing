German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz poses for a portrait before a Reuters interview in Berlin, Germany, May 30, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nU.S. President Donald Trump has granted the European Union a temporary exemption from hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports which will expire on Friday.\nAsked if there were signs of a de-escalation in the dispute, Scholz told Reuters: “No, there are no such signs.”\nEU member states have become more willing to underline their unity and sovereignty by acting in a determined way, Scholz said, adding: “Our response should be clear, strong and smart.” Reporting by Michael Nienaber and Gernot Heller; Editing by Madeline Chambers",
