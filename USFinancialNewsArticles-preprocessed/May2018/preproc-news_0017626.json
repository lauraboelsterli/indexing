We drove robust organic revenue growth of over 20% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 in a quarter that is typically our weakest, and we delivered the corresponding improvement to our bottom line,\" said Scott Graeff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Luna. \"The strong revenue performance, resulting largely from a nearly 70% increase in sales of our test and measurement products, along with prudent cost management, allowed us to realize positive net income from continuing operations for the fourth consecutive quarter, also a company record. Luna is positioned to continue to leverage the trends of growth in optical connectivity in high speed networks and data centers as well as the expanding use of composite materials and the need for improved means of testing their structural integrity. We expect those trends to drive top line growth into the future.\"\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Luna reported net income of $0.1 million compared to a net loss of $(1.4) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income from continuing operations improved by $1.0 million, to $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $(0.9) million, or $(0.03) per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a loss of $(0.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. A reconciliation of net income/(loss) to adjusted EBITDA can be found in the schedules included in this release.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $12.2 million compared to $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Technology development revenues increased 9% to $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Products and licensing revenues increased 29% to $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the products and licensing revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 was realized primarily in Luna's ODiSI, Optical Backscatter Reflectometer, and tunable laser products.\nGross profit was $5.0 million, or 41% of revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to gross profit of $3.9 million, or 38% of revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch, development and engineering expenses were $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to increased development costs associated with Luna's ODiSI and Terahertz instruments.\nNet income from continuing operations improved to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $(0.9) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net loss from discontinued operations was $(0.5) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.1 million, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(1.4) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $(0.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn evaluating the operating performance of its business, Luna’s management considers Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain charges and credits that are required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding the effect of certain non-cash expenses and items that Luna believes may not be indicative of its operating performance, because either they are unusual and Luna does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business or they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the table following the financial statements attached to this press release.\nConference Call Information\nAs previously announced, Luna will conduct an investor conference call at 5:00 pm (EDT) today to discuss its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and recent business developments.
