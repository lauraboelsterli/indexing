    "text": "HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADES) (the \"Company\" or \"ADES\") today filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, including information about its equity investments in Tinuum Group, LLC (\"Tinuum Group\") and Tinuum Services, LLC (\"Tinuum Services\") (collectively \"Tinuum\"), of which ADES owns 42.5% and 50%, respectively.\nTinuum & Refined Coal (“RC”) Highlights\nTinuum distributions to ADES were $13.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease from $14.7 million in same quarter of 2017, largely due to the commencement of a lease of an RC facility to a third-party in the prior year period that included an investor prepayment to Tinuum Group, which was subsequently distributed to Tinuum Group's equity members; Royalty earnings from Tinuum were $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an 84% increase from the same quarter in 2017; Tinuum invested tonnage was 13.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 9.8 million during the same quarter in 2017; Based on the 17 invested RC facilities as of March 31, 2018 and cash distributions occurring in the three months ending March 31, 2018, expected future net RC cash flows to ADES are between $250 million and $275 million through the end of 2021.\nADES Consolidated Highlights\nRecognized consolidated revenue of $3.9 million for the quarter, a decrease of 57% from the prior year's comparable quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from chemical sales and the recognition of all remaining equipment systems effective with the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard (\"ASC 606\") through an opening adjustment to equity on January 1, 2018. Offsetting these decreases were higher royalty earnings from Tinuum, which, for both 2018 and 2017, which are now reported as revenues under ASC 606; Reduced general and administrative operating costs (i.e., indirect operating costs) for the quarter by 3% to $5.0 million from $5.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2017; Achieved consolidated pre-tax and net income of $10.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the quarter; Recognized chemical revenue of $0.6 million during the quarter, a decrease of 73% from the comparable quarter in 2017, due to the loss of a previously existing customer in 2017; Increased cash and cash equivalents to $34.8 million as of March 31, 2018; an increase of $4.1 million since December 31, 2017, which is inclusive of cash usage for dividends and stock repurchase totaling $6.8 million for the quarter; Subsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company purchased an additional $4.3 million worth of its common stock under the stock repurchase program.\nL. Heath Sampson, President and CEO of ADES commented, “Strong distributions from Tinuum, as well as one of the highest quarters of royalty income, continue to bolster our cash position and grant us the flexibility to execute our shareholder capital return initiatives. With newly outlined 2018 priorities, we have remained committed to trimming our operating cost structure to better align resources with these priorities, including significant focus on supporting Tinuum and identify investors for remaining RC facilities.”\nSampson concluded, “Additionally, Tinuum has made the conscious decision to begin engineering and construction of two additional RC units. A strong industry backdrop and pipeline, which are conducive to future closures, have provided us with the conviction to build out these additional facilities at coal burning power plants in the near term. While this decision will require the use of cash, we believe it is prudent given the cadence of discussions with new and existing tax equity investors.”\nFirst quarter revenues and costs of revenues were $3.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, compared with $9.1 million and $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in chemical sales as well as the completion of all material equipment contracts impacting revenues as of December 31, 2017. Offsetting the decrease was first quarter royalty earnings from Tinuum of $3.2 million, an increase of 84% compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, due to increased RC facilities and earnings from the respective RC facilities.\nFirst quarter other operating expenses were $5.0 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was due to a reduction in research and development expense and lower depreciation and amortization.\nFirst quarter earnings from equity method investments were $12.3 million, compared to $13.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Tinuum distributions to ADES for 2017 were $13.5 million, down from $14.7 million for the comparable quarter in 2017. The decrease was driven by a lease of an RC facility to a third-party during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which included an investor prepayment to Tinuum Group, which was subsequently distributed to Tinuum Group's equity members. Excluding that prepayment, distributions would have been higher year-over-year.\nFirst quarter expenses related to the RC business were $0.8 million, an increase of 43% compared to 2017 primarily due to increased payroll and benefits attributed to the RC segment. RC segment operating income was $14.7 million, compared to $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter consolidated interest expense was $0.3 million, compared to $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter income tax expense was $2.6 million, compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017, which was due to a reduction in the federal tax rate as well as a reduction in pre-tax earnings quarter-over-quarter.\nConsolidated net income for the first quarter was $7.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted earnings per share, primarily driven by equity and royalties from the RC business and reduced operating expenses.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $34.8 million, an increase of 13% compared to $30.7 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to higher Tinuum royalties, which offset the stock repurchases and dividends of over $6.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nDividend\nToday, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on June 8, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to begin at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 10, 2018.
