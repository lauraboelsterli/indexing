    "text": "TULSA, Okla., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matrix Service Company (Nasdaq:MTRX), a leading contractor to the energy, power and industrial markets across North America, today reported financial results for its third quarter .\nKey highlights:\nReported a net loss of $0.19 per fully diluted share in the third quarter; earned $0.12 year-to-date Book-to-bill was 1.8 on awards of $434.8 million in the quarter and 1.3 year-to-date on awards of $1.030 billion, with significant project awards in the Storage Solutions and Industrial segments Backlog of $914.2 million is the highest since March 31, 2016 and 26.1% higher than December 31, 2017 Strength in project awards continues post-quarter Liquidity increased to $133.7 million, up 34.2% from December 31, 2017\n“As expected, our third quarter results were the lowest of the year, but the actual results, which were primarily impacted by lower revenue volumes, proved more disappointing relative to our earlier forecast,” said Matrix Service Company President and CEO John R. Hewitt. “Results were also impacted by non-routine tax adjustments and lower margin work bid in a highly competitive environment that allowed us to maintain market position and critical resources.”\nHewitt added, “The strong project awards in the quarter and year-to-date has pushed our backlog to its highest point since March 2016. This momentum has continued since the end of the third quarter and we expect a similar award performance in the fourth quarter. The improving size and quality of our backlog and the strength of our opportunity pipeline will begin to marginally improve revenue volume and earnings in the fourth quarter and point to a much stronger fiscal 2019. Therefore, we expect the fourth quarter to return to profitability, with full year earnings per share between $0.15 and $0.20 on revenue of $1.075 to $1.1 billion.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nConsolidated revenue was $245.6 million for the three months , compared to $251.2 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. Electrical Infrastructure segment revenue declined due to a reduction in revenue associated with the construction of a large power generating facility compared to the prior year and a reduction in high voltage revenue. Oil Gas & Chemical and Storage Solutions revenue was essentially flat. In Oil Gas & Chemical, lower volumes of capital work was offset with higher volumes of turnaround and maintenance work. In Storage Solutions, a higher volume of tank construction work was largely offset by lower volumes of terminal and balance of plant work. Revenue was higher in the Industrial segment due to increased volumes of work in the iron and steel industry.\nConsolidated gross profit was $14.9 million in the three months compared to a loss of $2.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The gross margin was 6.1% in the three months compared to (1.0)% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2018 gross margin was negatively impacted by revenue associated with low margin work bid in a highly competitive environment, increased levels of lower margin maintenance work, and lower than expected capital project volumes, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs. The fiscal 2017 gross margin was negatively affected by the financial impact of a large power generating facility charge in the Electrical Infrastructure segment, which decreased gross profit by $18.9 million, and lower than anticipated volumes, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $20.8 million in the three months compared to $18.6 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to higher current year project pursuit costs.\nFiscal 2018 income tax expense included charges totaling $1.1 million, or $0.04 per fully diluted share, primarily relating to a valuation allowance placed on a deferred tax asset.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, the Company reported a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.19 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $13.8 million, or $0.52 in the prior year.\nNine Month Fiscal 2018 Results\nConsolidated revenue was $798.5 million for the nine months , compared to $905.7 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. Storage Solutions revenue declined primarily as a result of delays in project awards which have prevented the Company from replacing higher revenue generated in the prior fiscal year in connection with work on the construction of a significant crude gathering terminals project. Electrical Infrastructure segment revenue declined due to a reduction in revenue associated with the construction of a large power generating facility compared to the prior year and a reduction in high voltage revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue for the Oil Gas & Chemical segment attributable to higher maintenance, turnaround and construction volumes, and the Industrial segment on higher volumes of work in the iron and steel industry.\nConsolidated gross profit was $70.5 million in the nine months compared to $57.9 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The gross margin was 8.8% in the nine months compared to 6.4% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2017 gross margin was impacted by an Electrical Infrastructure project which decreased gross profit by $13.7 million and under-recovery of overhead costs.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $63.9 million in the nine months compared to $56.5 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to the acquired overhead and amortization on intangible assets associated with a December 2016 acquisition that expanded the Company's engineering business as well as higher project pursuit costs across the business.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, the Company earned net income of $3.2 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share during the nine months compared to $0.8 million, or $0.03 in the prior year.\nBacklog\nBacklog at March 31, 2018 was $914.2 million compared to $725.0 million at December 31, 2017. The quarterly book-to-bill ratio was 1.8 on project awards of $434.8 million. In the quarter, the Company received project awards of $229.1 million in the Storage Solutions segment, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 3.0 and received project awards of $117.8 million in the Industrial segment, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 2.8. The nine month book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 on project awards of $1.030 billion. Backlog at the end of the quarter was at its highest level since March 31, 2016.\nFinancial Position\nThe cash balance combined with availability under the credit facility provides the Company with liquidity of $133.7 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $34.1 million since December 31, 2017. This increase in liquidity is primarily attributable to a reduction in the credit facility capacity constraint combined with positive cash flow from operations. During the quarter, the Company made net repayments on the credit facility of $41.3 million. At March 31, 2018, borrowings under the credit facility were $9.3 million. The Company's liquidity continues to support its long-term strategic growth plans.\nEarnings Guidance\nThe Company is revising fiscal 2018 earnings and revenue guidance. We now expect full year earnings to be between $0.15 and $0.20 per fully diluted share and full year revenue to be $1.075 to $1.1 billion. The Company had previously projected earnings to be between $0.55 and $0.75 per fully diluted share and revenue to be between $1.150 and $1.225 billion.\nConference Call / Webcast Details\nIn conjunction with the earnings release, Matrix Service Company will host a conference call / webcast with John R.

The following arrangements are considered firm:\nfixed-price awards; minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amounts.\nFor long-term maintenance contracts with no minimum commitments and other established customer arrangements, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize into revenue over the next 12 months. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenue recognized as of the reporting date.\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog for the three months :\nElectrical\nInfrastructure Oil Gas &\nChemical Storage\nSolutions Industrial Total (In thousands) Backlog as of December 31, 2017 $ 94,873 $ 238,681 $ 186,265 $ 205,215 $ 725,034 Project awards 44,652 43,347 229,060 117,761 434,820 Revenue recognized (58,378 ) (68,390 ) (76,901 ) (41,976 ) (245,645 ) Backlog as of March 31, 2018 $ 81,147 $ 213,638 $ 338,424 $ 281,000 $ 914,209 Book-to-bill ratio (1) 0.8 0.6 3.0 2.8 1.8 (1) Calculated by dividing project awards by revenue recognized during the period.
