Wolk, MD, MSPH, has joined the company’s Board of Directors.\nDr. Larry Wolk, Colorado's chief public health officer, has accepted an independent seat on the Corizon Health board of directors.\nDr. Wolk is Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the State of Colorado’s Chief Medical Officer. He also is the founder and a current board member and part-time pediatrician for the Rocky Mountain Youth Clinics, the first non-profit of its kind in the country to provide medical and nursing services to uninsured and at-risk children and teenagers throughout Colorado, which was honored by the American Hospital Association as one of four model programs in the country.\nDr. Wolk himself has been honored as a Colorado Pediatrician of the Year, a Volunteer of the Year, a Healthcare Executive of the Year, a “7 Everyday Hero” and he is a recipient of the University of Vermont’s Award for Service to Medicine and Community. Most recently, he received the Lifetime Healthcare Achievement Award from the Mile High Chapter of the American Red Cross. Dr. Wolk also served as an officer on the board of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and the Rocky Mountain Center for Health Promotion and Education.\nIn addition to his non-profit work, Dr. Wolk is an accomplished healthcare executive with correctional healthcare experience.
