(NYSE:ADT) today reported the results for its first quarter of 2018.\n“We continue to build momentum and are off to a strong start in our first quarter operating as a public company,” said Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer. “This quarter we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow. Operationally, we continued to execute on our commitment to enhance our customer service capabilities and implement operational improvements. As a result, we lowered attrition to a new all-time low of 13.6% and improved revenue payback. I am pleased with our first quarter results and our management team is excited to continue executing our strategy to drive free cash flow growth and create long-term shareholder value.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nThe Company reported total revenue of $1,116 million, a net loss of $157 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $620 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal revenue was $1,116 million, up 5% year-over-year. Monitoring and related services revenue (“M&S revenue”), which comprised $1,017 million of total revenue, was up 2% over the same period last year. The growth in M&S revenue was attributable to an increase in monthly recurring revenue, largely driven by higher average prices combined with improvements in gross customer revenue attrition. In addition to M&S revenue, total revenue was up by an additional $38 million from last year, primarily driven by commercial revenues as a result of the successful execution of our commercial growth strategy.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $620 million, up 7%, or $43 million from the same period last year. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA growth was a result of higher M&S revenue, which flows through at higher margin rates, combined with lower expensed SAC, and lower G&A expenses. The results include a net benefit of approximately $15 million, primarily attributable to a legal settlement.\nAdjusted Net Income (2) , which is a measurement of operating performance and is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash net interest expense, cash taxes, and net capitalized SAC, was $249 million versus $197 million last year, an increase of $52 million. The improvement in Adjusted Net Income is due to year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $43 million and lower cash interest. On a per share basis, Adjusted Net Income was $0.34, an increase of 10% from the same period last year.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $157 million, compared to prior year’s loss of $141 million. Excluding special items, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $(0.03) versus $(0.08) in the prior year.\nTrailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition reached an all-time low in the quarter, ending at 13.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year. The reduction is due to the Company’s focus on adding new high-quality customers and enhancing customer service levels in its field offices and call centers.\nTrailing twelve-month customer revenue payback improved to 2.5 years from 2.6 years in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was the result of more efficient sales and marketing spend as the Company identified opportunities to lower the cost per sale combined with reductions in net installation cost largely driven by variance performance management throughout its field offices.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was $505 million, up from $412 million in the same period last year, and free cash flow before special items grew to $187 million from $175 million. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow before special items was driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA and lower interest, slightly offset by the quarterly timing of working capital and other.\nSTRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS\nADT Go: Extending 24/7 Protection Beyond the Home - The Company announced the launch of ADT Go during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. ADT Go is an innovative and easy-to-use mobile app that transforms families’ smart phones into mobile personal security devices, giving users peace of mind in knowing loved ones are safe regardless of where life takes them. The application was created in partnership with trusted locator and communication tool Life360 and offers 24/7 emergency response from ADT’s live monitoring agents, backed by Life360’s proprietary location technology.\nExpansion of Commercial Capabilities - The Company continued to further strengthen its footprint in the Commercial security market as it closed the acquisitions of Aronson Security Group (“Aronson”) and Acme Security Systems (“Acme”). Headquartered in Renton, Washington, Aronson employs nearly 170 employees and has been in business over 55 years. Acme Security Systems was among the largest privately held security system integrators in the Bay Area, and is focused on electronic systems, access control, and video networks. Acme was founded in 1974 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The addition of two leading, strategic commercial security businesses to the ADT platform is an exciting step in ADT’s strategy to further drive commercial growth and expansion.\nAwards & Recognition - The Company was recognized for its progress in its Commercial and Multi-Site channels and was presented with both the “Installer of the Year” and “Integrated Installation of the Year” awards during the security industry’s annual SAMMY awards ceremony. Now in its 23rd year, the SAMMY Awards were created to recognize and honor best-in-class installing security dealers and integrators for their marketing, business, installation and overall excellence.\n“We continue to execute our strategy and make progress toward achieving our long-term goals. Expanding our Commercial and Multi-Site capabilities is a key part of our strategy, and I am proud of the progress we have made so far,” said Whall.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTS\nQuarterly Dividend - On May 9, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share to common stockholders of record as of June 25, 2018. This dividend will be paid on July 10, 2018.\nRedemption of Prime Notes - On February 21, 2018, the Company redeemed $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes using a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO, and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $62 million related to the payment of the call premium and the write-off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs.\nCapital Structure - The ratio of the Company’s net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA implied net leverage of 4.0x as of March 31, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 totaled $258 million. Additionally, the Company has set aside $750 million of restricted cash for the redemption of the principal balance of the Koch Preferred Securities. The Company will redeem the Preferred Securities in July of 2018.\n(1) All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Adjusted Net Income, net income or loss before special items, diluted earnings per share before special items, and net leverage ratio are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.\n(2) Adjusted Net Income was referred to as Cash Net Income in the prior quarter. There has been no change in the calculation of the measure.\nMedia Inquiries: Investor Relations: Jason Shockley Jason Smith - ADT tel : 561.322.7235 Sloan Bohlen - Solebury Communications jshockley@adt.com tel: 817.928.1646 investorrelations@adt.com Conference Call\nManagement will discuss the Company’s first quarter results during a conference call and webcast today beginning at 8:30 a.m. (ET).

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets, amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) loss on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.\nThere are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; capitalized costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network. In arriving at Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow is useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.\nFree Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.\nAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance. We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (2) cash taxes, and (3) cash interest paid, including interest on our preferred securities. Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance. There are material limitations to using Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nDiluted EPS before special items is a non-GAAP measure that may be used from time to time and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results. Diluted EPS before special items is defined as earnings per diluted share adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on the effective tax rate. The difference between net income or loss and diluted EPS before special items and net income or loss and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. The Company believes that diluted EPS before special items is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measure of diluted EPS before special items may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss and EPS. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measure in combination with the most comparable GAAP measure in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.\nThe leverage ratio may be presented as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total debt. The leverage ratio is a useful measure of the Company’s credit position and progress towards leverage targets. Refer to the discussion on Adjusted EBITDA for a description of the differences between the most comparable GAAP measure. The calculation is limited in that the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nThe Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial outlook, if presented herein, to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook, other than those described above, are difficult to predict and are primarily dependent on future uncertainties. The GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP financial outlook for which we do not prepare a reconcilable GAAP forecast include the factors described above, where applicable.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.
