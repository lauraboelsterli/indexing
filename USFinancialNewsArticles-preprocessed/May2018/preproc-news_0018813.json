    "text": "LINCOLNSHIRE, IL--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Camping World Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CWH) (“Camping World,” “CWH,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) today reported results for the first quarter\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nTotal revenue increased 20.4% to a first quarter record of $1.1 billion; Total number of recreational vehicles sold increased 21.0% to a first quarter record of 24,547 units; Total same store sales increased 3.9% to a first quarter record of $838.6 million; Finance & insurance revenue as a percentage of total vehicle revenue increased 205 basis points to an all-time high of 12.2%; Gross profit increased 21.0% to a first quarter record of $304.8 million and gross margin increased 13 basis points to a first quarter record of 28.7%; Income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share decreased to $49.8 million, $17.3 million, and $0.08, respectively, and reflected $19.7 million of pre-opening expenses related to the Gander Outdoors store openings; Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income (1) increased 16.5% to $36.9 million, and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share (1) increased 9.7% to $0.41 and Adjusted EBITDA (1) decreased 0.1% to $71.8 million.\n(1) Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income, Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section later in this press release. Marcus A. Lemonis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We had a very strong first quarter and are pleased with the continued performance of our business. For the quarter, total revenue increased 20.4% to a first quarter record $1.1 billion, total gross profit increased 21.0% to a first quarter record $304.8 million, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income increased 16.5% to $36.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $71.8 million was right in line with our expectation. While the unseasonably cold weather throughout a good portion of the country has likely impacted the early part of the peak selling season, we believe the backdrop across the RV industry remains strong and we continue to plan our business around a mid-single digit increase in same store sales in 2018.”\nMr. Lemonis continued, “We remain committed to profitable growth and have not seen any changes in the overall acquisition environment. In the first quarter, we announced five new acquisitions with six locations across five different states and plans to open eight new Supercenters late this year and early next year that we anticipate will begin to combine all of our brands in one location and serve a broad range of RV, outdoor and active lifestyle customers.”\nPresentation\nThis press release presents historical results, for the periods presented, of the Company and its subsidiaries, that are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), unless noted as a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) and related reorganization transactions (“Reorganization Transactions”) that occurred on October 6, 2016 resulted in the Company as the sole managing member of CWGS Enterprises, LLC (“CWGS, LLC”), with sole voting power in and control of the management of CWGS, LLC. Despite its position as sole managing member of CWGS, LLC, the Company has a minority economic interest in CWGS, LLC. As of March 31, 2018, the Company owned 41.7% of CWGS, LLC. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of CWGS, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest in its consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial comparisons in this press release compare our financial results from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Review\nUnits and Average Selling Prices\nThe total number of recreational vehicle units sold increased 21.0% to 24,547 units from 20,279 units and the average selling price of a unit sold decreased 4.3% to $30,619 from $32,010 in the first quarter of 2017. New vehicle units sold increased 18.4% to 16,296 units and the average selling price of a new vehicle decreased 2.8% to $35,561. Used vehicle units sold increased 26.6% to 8,251 units and the average selling price of a used vehicle decreased 6.8% to $20,857 per unit.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased 20.4% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 from $881.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Consumer Services and Plans revenue increased 7.1% to $53.8 million and Retail revenue increased 21.2% to $1.0 billion. In the Retail segment, new vehicle revenue increased 15.1% to $579.5 million, used vehicle revenue increased 18.0% to $172.1 million, parts, services and other revenue increased 41.4% to $164.3 million and finance and insurance revenue increased 39.1% to $91.8 million. Included in the parts, services and other revenue was $39.3 million in sales from the outdoor and active sports retail businesses, including Gander Outdoors, Overton’s, TheHouse.com , Uncle Dan’s, W82 and Erehwon Mountain Outfitters. Finance and insurance net revenue as a percentage of total new and used vehicle revenue increased 205 basis points to 12.2% for the first quarter of 2018 from 10.2% in the first quarter of 2017.\nSame store sales for the base of 120 retail locations that were open on March 31, 2018 and January 1, 2017 increased 3.9% to $838.6 million for the quarter The increase in same store sales was primarily driven by a 22.0% increase in finance and insurance same store sales, a 1.6% increase in new vehicle same store sales, a 5.4% increase in used vehicle same store sales, and a 1.0% increase in parts, services and other same store sales.\nThe Company operated a total of 141 Camping World retail locations, one Overton’s location, two TheHouse.com locations, 28 Gander Outdoors locations, two W82 locations, five Uncle Dan’s locations, and four Erehwon Mountain Outfitter locations as of March 31, 2018, compared to 126 Camping World retail locations at March 31, 2017.\nGross Profit\nTotal gross profit increased 21.0% to $304.8 million, or 28.7% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018, from $251.9 million, or 28.6% of total revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. On a segment basis, Consumer Services and Plans gross profit increased 6.8% to $31.1 million, or 57.8% of segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018, from $29.1 million, or 57.9% of segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Retail gross profit increased 22.8% to $273.7 million, or 27.2% of segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018, from $222.8 million, or 26.8% of segment revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in Retail gross margin was driven by an increase in the finance and insurance net revenue as a percentage of total new and used vehicle revenue to 12.2% in the first quarter of 2018 from 10.2% in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 40.1% to $255.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $182.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 39.7% to $245.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $175.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the additional expenses associated with the 21 additional RV retail locations, 28 Gander Outdoors locations which included $19.7 million of pre-opening costs associated with the store openings, one Overton’s location, two TheHouse.com locations, two W82 locations, five Uncle Dan’s locations and four Erehwon Mountain Outfitter locations operated during the first quarter of 2018. As a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses increased 1,077 basis points to 80.4% in the first quarter of 2018 from 69.7% in the first quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 37.2% to $9.4 million primarily due to the addition of acquired and greenfield locations, and the acquired businesses.\nFloor Plan Interest & Other Interest Expenses\nFloor plan interest expense increased to $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher inventory from new dealership locations and existing locations expecting higher unit sales, as well as a 100 basis point increase in the average floor plan borrowing rate. Other interest expense increased to $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding partially offset by an 8 basis point decrease in the average interest rate.\nNet Income, Net Income Margin, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income (1) , Diluted Earnings Per Share, and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share (1)\nNet income, net income margin and diluted earnings per share were $17.3 million, 1.6%, and $0.08, respectively, for the quarter Net income, net income margin and diluted earnings per share were $49.6 million, 5.6% and $0.38, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nAdjusted Pro Forma Net Income (1) increased 16.5% to $36.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.

We believe that these Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in these non-GAAP measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of those adjusted in this presentation. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we use are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income before other interest expense (excluding floor plan interest expense), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, loss and expense on debt restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs, and other unusual or one-time items. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same manner. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP Financial Measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\nThe following tables reconcile EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which are net income, net income and net income margin, respectively:\nThree Months Ended March 31, ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 Net income $ 17,276 $ 49,623 Other interest expense, net 12,839 9,404 Depreciation and amortization 9,400 6,853 Income tax expense 7,219 5,592 EBITDA 46,734 71,472 Loss and expense on debt restructure (a) 2,100 – Loss (gain) on sale of assets (b) 85 (318 ) Equity-based compensation (c) 3,218 719 Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (d) – (17 ) Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs (e) 19,651 – Adjusted EBITDA $ 71,788 $ 71,856 Three Months Ended March 31, (as percentage of total revenue) 2018 2017 EBITDA margin:\nNet income margin\n1.6\n%\n5.6\n%\nOther interest expense, net 1.2 % 1.1 % Depreciation and amortization 0.9 % 0.8 % Income tax expense 0.7 % 0.6 % Subtotal EBITDA margin 4.4 % 8.1 % Loss and expense on debt restructure (a) 0.2 % – Loss (gain) on sale of assets (b) 0.0 % (0.0 %) Equity-based compensation (c) 0.3 % 0.1 % Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (d) – (0.0 %) Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs (e) 1.9 % – Adjusted EBITDA margin 6.8 % 8.2 %\n(a) Represents the loss and expense incurred on debt restructure and financing expense incurred from the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement in 2018.

(e) Represents pre-opening store costs associated with opening Gander Outdoors retail stores. Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share\nWe define “Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income” as net income attributable to CWH adjusted for the reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock of CWH and further adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, loss and expense on debt restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets, equity-based compensation, Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment, Gander Outdoors pre-opening costs, other unusual or one-time items, and the income tax expense effect of these adjustments. We define “Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share” as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income divided by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock of CWH and the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, if any. We present Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. and weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding — diluted:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In thousands except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Numerator: Net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. $ 3,181 $ 7,522 Adjustments: Reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of common units in CWGS, LLC (a) 14,095 42,101 Loss and expense on debt restructure (b) 2,100 — Loss (gain) on sale of assets (c) 85 (318 ) Equity-based compensation (d) 3,218 719 Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (e) — (17 ) Gander Outdoor pre-opening costs (f) 19,651 — Income tax expense (g) (5,389 ) (18,292 ) Adjusted pro forma net income $ 36,941 $ 31,715 Denominator: Weighted-average Class A common shares outstanding - diluted 88,646 83,772 Adjustments: Dilutive options to purchase Class A common stock 315 146 Dilutive restricted stock units 189 58 Adjusted pro forma fully exchanged weighted average Class A common shares outstanding - diluted 89,150 83,976 Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share $ 0.41 $ 0.38",
