    "text": "Gold marked a new low for the year on Monday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared that a trade war between China and the United States was \"on hold,\" sparking a rally in stocks and the dollar.\nBuoyancy in U.S. Treasury yields also weighed on appetite for non-interest bearing assets such as bullion, analysts said.\nSpot gold fell to its lowest since late December at $1,281.76 an ounce, but by 1918 GMT it was up 0.1 percent at $1,292.71 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down 0.03 percent at $1,290.90.\n\"The dollar's riding high, and the 10-year yield has broken above 3.05 percent for the first time since 2011,\" Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said. \"This is taking place at a time when we're very close to all-time highs in the U.S. equity markets, and all of this positive news about jobs, about productivity, is feeding into a move towards risky assets.\"\nHe said gold could benefit from safe-haven buying in the long run if that exuberance loses steam and inflation pressures mount. But he added: \"It's possible that we might see a further correction in the very short term. That will of course depend on the newsflow, and whether the dollar can hold onto its gains.\"\nGold prices fell below the psychologically important level of $1,300 an ounce last week, and posted the first weekly close below their 200-day moving average since late December.\nA stronger dollar makes assets priced in the U.S. currency more expensive for holders of other currencies, while a bounce in yields had added to pressure on gold.\nThe metal is also being weighed down by expectations that U.S. Federal Reserve will lift U.S. interest rates again next month, further hurting demand for non-yielding assets.\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said investors were now looking ahead to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets rates. \"If the Fed doesn't tame its hawkish stance, we would expect more weakness in the gold price,\" he said.\nHedge funds and money managers cut their net long position in Comex gold contracts by 21,294 contracts to 31,327 in the week to May 15, data showed on Friday.",
