    "text": "OTTAWA, May 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian government is prepared to indemnify Kinder Morgan Canada Ltdâ€™s proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion against unnecessary delays that are politically motivated, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Wednesday.\nMorneau also told a news conference that if Kinder Morgan decided to walk away from the project, which the provincial government of British Columbia opposes, the indemnification would stay in place in case another company took over.
