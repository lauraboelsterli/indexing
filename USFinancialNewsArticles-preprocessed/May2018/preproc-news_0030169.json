MSCI will include about 230 Chinese companies into its emerging market benchmark on June 1 and a list of the new constituents will be announced soon.\n** The CSI300 index rose 1.1 percent to 3,916.07 at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 3,180.80.\n** The Hang Seng index added 1.3 percent to 31,521.82, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 1.5 percent to 12,524.95.\n** China’s CSI300 financial sector sub-index was higher by 1.27 percent, the consumer staples sector up 2.2 percent, the real estate index up 0.64 percent and the healthcare sub-index up 0.08 percent.\n** The smaller Shenzhen index was up 0.2 percent, while the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was unchanged. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was firmer by 0.54 percent while Japan’s Nikkei index was up 0.39 percent. ** The yuan was quoted at 6.3389 per U.S. dollar, 0.1 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.3323. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Henan Ancai Hi-tech Co Ltd up 10.04 percent, followed by Changzhou Shenli Electrical Machine Incorporated Co gaining 10.03 percent and Zhejiang Dibay Electric Co Ltd up by 10.02 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Qingdao Copton Technology Co Ltd down 10.02 percent, followed by HangZhou Nbond Nonwovens Co Ltd falling 10.01 percent and Shanghai Wondertek Software Co Ltd down by 10.01 percent. ** The top gainers among H-shares were CITIC Securities Co Ltd up 4.53 percent, followed by Air China Ltd gaining 4.35 percent and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd up by 4.08 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd which has fallen 0.34 percent, Sinopharm Group Co Ltd which has lost 0.1 percent and CGN Power Co Ltd down by 0.0 percent. ** About 7.38 billion shares have traded so far on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 49.8 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 14.81 billion shares. The volume traded was 13.07 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 04:11 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 21.65 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
