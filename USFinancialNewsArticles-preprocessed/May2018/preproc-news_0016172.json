    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 5:16 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Uber hires former NTSB chair to advise on safety culture after fatal crash Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said Monday it has hired a former National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman to advise the company on its safety culture after a fatal self-driving crash in Arizona. A man arrives at the Uber offices in Queens, New York, U.S. on February 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files\n“We have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, and we have brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture,” Uber said Monday. “Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.”\nA 49-year-old woman was killed in March after being hit by an Uber self-driving sports utility vehicle while walking across a street in Phoenix, leading the company to suspend testing of autonomous vehicles. Arizona’s governor also ordered a halt to Uber’s testing. Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis",
