    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords fourth and eighth grafs\nTyler Mahle gave up only an unearned run over five innings Thursday, and Scooter Gennett drove in three runs with three hits as the visiting Cincinnati Reds rallied for a 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nMahle, a Southern California native who was making his first start at Dodger Stadium, had to scramble early, leaving the bases loaded in the first two innings. He stranded eight runners over the first three innings.\nThe right-hander improved to 3-4 while giving up three hits with four walks and two strikeouts. He won on the road for the second consecutive time after earning the victory at Minnesota on April 29. Raisel Iglesias recorded the final four outs for his fifth save.\nThe Reds took the lead in the sixth inning against Dodgers starter Walker Buehler. With one out, Jesse Winker singled, and with two outs, Joey Votto delivered a single in a seven-pitch at-bat. Gennett followed with a two-run double for a 2-1 advantage.\nBuehler (2-1) cruised through his first five scoreless innings one start after he led off a combined no-hitter against the San Diego Padres at Monterrey, Mexico. However, he gave up three of his five hits in the sixth, and he wound up charged with two runs in six innings.\nBuehler struck out eight for the second consecutive outing and did not walk a batter for the first time in his fourth career start.\nThe Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Chase Utley’s RBI single. Yasiel Puig followed by lining out to right field to leave the bases loaded. With the bases again loaded in the second inning, Cody Bellinger flied out to left field against Mahle.\nThe Dodgers went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\nBilly Hamilton delivered an RBI triple in the seventh inning to increase the lead to 3-1, and Gennett added a home run in the eighth, his fifth of the season.\nThe Reds improved to 11-27, which is still the worst record in the National League. However, they won a series opener for the fourth time since Jim Riggleman took over as interim manager after Bryan Price was fired on April 19.\nCincinnati has won three consecutive games for the first time this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
