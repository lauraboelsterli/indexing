    "text": "U.S. government debt yields edged higher on Monday ahead of remarks by key Federal Reserve officials and after the Labor Department reported the latest employment data on Friday.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was higher at around 2.953 percent at 9:58 a.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was higher at 3.122 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- For Monday's session, speeches from U.S. central bank officials and news out of the auctions space is expected to be of key importance for investors.\nA number of members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are scheduled to speak at key engagements, with Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin expected to be present at George Mason University in Virginia.\nMeanwhile, a number of Fed officials are expected to attend the Atlanta Fed's 23rd Annual Financial Markets Conference with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker all scheduled to speak at the Florida-based event.\nOn Friday, the Labor Department reported that the economy added 164,000 jobs in the month of April, lower than the 195,000 expected by economists polled by Reuters. Average hourly earnings growth also missed, rising only 0.15 percent against expectations of a 0.2 percent gain.\n\"Perhaps it's just us, but the wage figures on Friday were disappointing from a broader perspective and it appears the market is content to ignore the implications,\" wrote Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist BMO Capital Markets.\n\"Given the number of times we've come across the word 'goldilocks' as it relates to the current state of market equilibrium, we find ourselves cautious of a potential breakout,\" he added.\nOn Monday, consumer credit data is due out at 3 p.m. ET.",
