LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading almost flat at 10,766.50 • The Indian rupee is expected to open little changed today as the dollar index halted its three-day gains, helping offset the impact from fresh three-year high crude oil prices. • Indian government bonds are likely to ease in early trade amid concerns that higher global crude oil prices may fan domestic inflation going ahead.
