    "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AGâ€™s relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents.\nFILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults.\nGilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said.\nIn a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.\nGilenya was first approved by the FDA to treat adults with relapsing MS.\nReporting by Mrinalini Krothapalli in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
