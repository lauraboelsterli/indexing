    "text": "May 15, 2018 / 11:27 PM / Updated 6 hours ago U.S. judges weigh fate of programme protecting young immigrants Mica Rosenberg , Lucy Nicholson 3 Min Read\nNEW YORK/PASADENA, California (Reuters) - A panel of three appeals court judges in California on Tuesday asked the federal government to defend its decision to end a program protecting from deportation some immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, who are often referred to as “Dreamers.” Protestors demonstrate against the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program outside the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, U.S. May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must rule on whether to uphold a lower court’s nationwide injunction ordering the government to keep the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme in place while litigation challenging its termination proceeds.\nThe administration of President Donald Trump announced in September it would scrap the 2012 programme launched by former President Barack Obama, and said it was up to Congress to find a legislative solution.\nSeveral plaintiffs, including the University of California, which enrols many DACA recipients, sued over the administration’s decision, and in January, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco issued the injunction. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, made a similar finding, and a judge in Washington, D.C., gave the government extra time to explain its reasoning. Protestors demonstrate against the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program outside the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, U.S. May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the programme was unlawful when he announced the end of DACA, a position the appeals court judges asked attorneys for the government to explain on Tuesday.\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan responded that it was within the government’s discretion to decide the fate of the programme.

The Supreme Court, which in February declined a request to weigh in before the appellate court, said at the time it assumed the appeals court would rule swiftly.
