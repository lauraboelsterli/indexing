MANDATORY CREDIT. Joshua Holt's Facebook Page/via REUTERS “We continue to have serious concerns about the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens who are being held there,” said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert. “The Venezuelan government is responsible for the safety of all detainees in its prison system, including U.S. citizens in detention.”\nShe said a senior State Department official had spoken to a top Venezuelan diplomat to seek the release of Holt on humanitarian grounds. Holt had posted information on Facebook about the riots.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton, writing by David Alexander; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
