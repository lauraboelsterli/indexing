Photo: Feld Entertainment; Nicole Saunders As an elephant handler for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Lauren Ramsay used to spend her time herding four-ton pachyderms.\nWhen this is your resume Now she serves the dinner crowd at a Chicago wine bar. The elephants were easier.\n“Elephants definitely listen better and aren’t as messy as people when they eat,” she says.\nLast May, the circus closed down after 146 years traveling the country and thrilling millions with “the Greatest Show on Earth.” In the year since, the contortionists, acrobats, stilt walkers and other performers have walked a tightrope trying to adapt to more-conventional jobs, while sometimes using their circus skills. It takes some professional clowns a while to find a second act: One is now running for Congress.\nFormer elephant handler Lauren Ramsay. Photo: Lauren Ramsay Former clown Sandor Eke, of Las Vegas, Nev., wanted to put his entertaining and juggling skills to work behind a bar after 20 years with the circus. But nobody would hire him without experience. He’s now picking up random clown jobs and painting houses. “I try to have fun with it, but it’s not exactly what I wanted with life. I mean, I used to be a clown!”\nIn April, Mr. Eke auditioned for a mascot job with the Oakland Raiders once they move to Las Vegas for the 2020 season. He tried on the “Rushing Raider” costume, and did what he called a “crowd-pleasing routine.” He’s waiting to hear back, but remains hopeful. “I got good vibes,” he says.\nClown Sandor Eke dusts his face with powder before performing in a show in 2017.

Now, he lives in Spring Hill, Fla., and works at the front desk of a hotel, where he sometimes does clown bits. During his circus years he would take a program and stick it to the forehead of an audience member to sign his autograph. Now, he has guests sign in like that.\nHe also does pratfalls. “They always get a laugh,” he says.\nAs the human cannonball, Nicole Sanders went by “Nitro Nicole.” Now, Ms. Sanders just goes by her real name when she works with customers at Lululemon in New Orleans, La. After almost two years of being fired out of a cannon 100 feet into the air before landing on an air bag, she says she can deal with most any workplace situation. “I used to put my life at risk twice a day,” she says. “I think I can handle it.” She says life now is much less stressful, but more boring. “It’s a perspective shift.”\nSandor Eke painting post-circus. Photo: Sandor Eke More than 450 employees lost their jobs after the circus closed, citing high operating costs and low ticket sales worsened following the removal of elephants from the show after prolonged criticism from animal-rights groups.\nKenneth Feld, chief executive of Feld Entertainment, which owned the circus, called it an “unsustainable business.” The company provided outplacement service for six months following the January 2017 announcement that the circus would close, a spokeswoman said.\nCircus workers lived in efficiency apartments on board a mile-long Ringling Bros. train that traveled across the country. It carried performers and their families, animals and their feed, and had a school, a day care and a 24-hour dining car.\n“I really miss the show, my friends, and my horse, Batir. And nothing compares to a Cossack train party,” says Ubay Begmuratov, a Cossack whose only job in the U.S. was working as a horse rider performing tricks, flips and jumps for the circus for 13 years.\nNowadays, his tricks are limited to jumping off the back of a flatbed truck after he loads it, straps everything down, and makes sure the truck is ready for the next city. Mr. Begmuratov, who is married to Ms. Ramsay, the former elephant handler, sometimes drives for Uber and is working to get licensed to drive long-haul trucks.\nRhett Coates, of Hayes, Va., worked for the circus on and off since 1985, as part of the train crew, and in wardrobe, props, and concessions. “Sawdust gets in your blood,” he says, using a common refrain. “Most of us are still completely stunned about it all. None of us ever thought the show would or could close down.”\nNow he’s thinking about a new kind of show, pitching producers his circus stories as a television series. It would be like the old “Love Boat” series, he says, with three narratives interwoven in an hour-long show. “I have enough stories to make a series last a long time,” he says.\nFormer clown Steve Lough, of Camden, S.C., who left the circus in 2004, later found employment working for McDonald’s at special events and volunteering for political campaigns.\nThis spring, Mr. Lough decided to run for office himself and is running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Congress in South Carolina. “I juggle at every campaign stop now,” he says.\nSteve Lough, clown on left, when he was with the circus. Photo: Bill Greene/The Boston Globe/Getty Images Former clown Steve Lough is running for U.S. Congress. Photo: Rie Sekine He did a pratfall at the South Carolina Democratic Convention in April that “got a big reaction and laugh.”\nDuring his years with the circus, Mr. Lough spent time with friends like Michu Meszaros, a 2-foot-9-inch-tall performer billed as “The World’s Smallest Man!,” and Russian acrobats who read Dostoevsky in their down time. The campaign trail is a different story. “Lots of stiffs,” he says. But Mr. Lough says the crowds love his clown skills.\nSince the circus closed, ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson moved to Orlando, Fla., and has been taking various jobs. He has played a Klingon in a Star Trek-themed opera and worked on starting an opera company. But he hasn’t found anything steady.\nTake a Look at Other Recent A-Heds\nThat Endless Series of Menu Options Is Paralyzing Diners Forget the Hackers, Watch Out for the Phone Snoopers Over Your Shoulder Worst Job in America: Responding to Irate Tweets From New York City Subway Riders “I’m a shiny thing,” Mr. Iverson says. “I am the last ringmaster. But it’s over.” He says he has to parlay his talent into something new. “It’s a matter of survival.”\nSometimes there are reminders of their past careers. Ms. Ramsay, who works at the wine bar, now herds lingering customers into leaving when it’s getting late. She’ll turn up the lights, switch off the music, and clear their table. “You definitely have to motivate some tables—it works,” she says.\nSome customers ignore the subtle clues to close up, she says, which reminds her of one particularly memorable elephant named Karen. “She was stubborn.”\nRingmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson opened the final show of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in May 2017.
