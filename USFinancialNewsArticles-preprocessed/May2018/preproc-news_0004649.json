    "text": "TULSA, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mid-Con Energy Partners, LP (NASDAQ:MCEP) (“Mid-Con Energy” or the “Partnership”) announces operating and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The first quarter was extremely important for the Partnership as we executed on a number of transactions, reduced debt by an additional $9.8 million and continued lowering our leverage ratio,” commented Jeff Olmstead, our President and CEO. He continued, “We raised an additional $15 million in convertible preferred equity, extended the maturity of our revolver to November 2020 and increased the borrowing base to $125 million, and acquired our first assets in our new Wyoming core area. The Wyoming assets are important to future growth for the Partnership as they contain an existing waterflood unit that we believe has optimization potential, and a new potential grassroots waterflood unit with significant future upside development. From a production standpoint, we were able to recover from downtime associated with winter weather in Texas and Oklahoma in the early part of the year. We exited the quarter with March averaging 2,884 Boe/d. This was up from the 4th quarter 2017 after adjusting for the sale of the Southern Oklahoma properties. While we still have some legacy properties that are on secondary decline now, we have several units in Texas that are seeing an active waterflood response. Combined with the potential for growth in our new assets in Wyoming, we are excited about the growth prospects for the remainder of the year.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 SUMMARY AND RECENT EVENTS\nCompleted $15.0 million private offering (the “Offering”) of Class B Convertible Preferred Units on January 31, 2018, to investors led by John Goff. The Partnership used a portion of the net proceeds from this Offering to acquire assets in the Powder River Basin (“PRB Acquisitions”) and used the remaining proceeds of approximately $7.2 million to pay down debt.\nClosed the PRB Acquisitions in January 2018 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.6 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The Partnership acquired approximately 2,974 MBoe in net proved reserves, with average daily production of 122 Boe/d as of the fourth quarter 2017.\nExtended the maturity on the Partnership’s credit agreement by 2 years to November 2020, and increased the borrowing base to $125 million in January 2018.\nAverage daily production of 2,800 Boe/d, a decrease of 16.6% sequentially and 22.7% year-over-year. Sequential and year-over-year variance were primarily due to the December 2017 sale of Southern Oklahoma properties, which had average production for November 2017 of 513 Boe/d, and winter weather downtime in January. We exited the first quarter of 2018 with March average production of 2,884 Boe/d.\nRealized prices per Boe, inclusive of cash settlements from matured derivatives and premiums paid, averaged $53.13/Boe, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 24.4% year-over-year.\nReduced lease operating expenses (“LOE”) to $4.8 million, 2.4% lower sequentially and 3.8% lower year-over-year.\nNet loss of $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net loss of $8.7 million sequentially and net income of $4.4 million year-over-year.\nResulting Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million, a 24.9% decrease sequentially and a 6.5% year-over-year.\nAs of March 31, we had $89.2 million in outstanding debt, a reduction of $9.8 million from the beginning of the year. Our Debt/EBITDA, as calculated by our credit agreement, was 3.34x. (1)\nAs of May 2, we had further reduced debt outstanding to $88.0 million.\nThe Partnership drilled one producing well, drilled one injection well, performed six recompletions and eight capital workovers, and converted two producing wells to injection.\n(1) Our Credit Agreement calls for us to calculate our Leverage Covenant for the period beginning October 1, 2017 on an annualized basis until we reach September 30, 2018. At that point in time the calculation will return to a trailing-twelve-month test.\nThe following table reflects selected unaudited operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017. Mid-Con Energy’s unaudited consolidated financial statements are included at the end of this press release.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, ($ in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 Average net daily production (Boe/d) (1) 2,800 3,359 3,622 Oil & natural gas sales plus cash settlements from matured derivatives,\ninclusive of premiums, net (2) $ 13,388 $ 14,697 $ 13,921 Net income (loss) $ (10,418 ) $ (8,655 ) $ 4,442 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 6,049 $ 8,055 $ 6,469 (1) Production volumes in Boe equivalents calculated at a Btu conversion rate of six Mcf per Bbl.\n(2) Net premiums include those incurred previously, or upon settlement, that are attributable to instruments that settled during the period.\n(3) Non-GAAP financial measure.

On a daily basis, this represented a 16.6% decrease sequentially and a 22.7% decrease year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were primarily due to the sale of Southern Oklahoma properties in December 2017 (November average production of 513 Boe/d), January 2018 winter weather downtime in certain Texas and Oklahoma properties, and steeper than expected declines in certain Texas properties, partially offset by the Wheatland and PRB Acquisitions and continued positive waterflood response from two Texas properties as a result of injection. We exited the first quarter of 2018 with March average production of 2,884 Boe/d.\nPrice Realizations - Oil and natural gas sales were $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, or $58.38/Boe. On a per Boe basis, this represented a 15.1% increase sequentially and a 24.0% increase year-over-year. Cash settlements paid for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, or $5.25/Boe. Cash settlements paid for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $3.15/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash settlements paid for matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums were $4.39/Boe in the first quarter of 2017. The resulting realized prices, after incorporating cash settlements from matured derivatives, inclusive of net premiums, were $53.13/Boe in the first quarter of 2018, $47.56/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $42.70/Boe in the first quarter of 2017.\nLease Operating Expenses - LOE was $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 2.4% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 3.8% from the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease in LOE is primarily due to the sale of Southern Oklahoma properties on December 22, 2017, partially offset by the acquisition of properties in Wyoming in January 2018. On a per Boe basis, LOE in the first quarter of 2018 of $19.05/Boe increased 19.7% sequentially and increased 24.4% year-over-year due to lower production from the sale of Southern Oklahoma properties in December 2017, partially offset by the acquisition of properties in Wyoming in January of 2018.\nProduction Taxes - Production taxes in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.9 million, or $3.46/Boe, reflecting an effective tax rate of 5.9%. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.0 million, or $3.09/Boe, for an effective tax rate of 6.1%. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2017 were $0.8 million, or $2.46/Boe, reflecting an effective tax rate of 5.2%. The increase in effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to the elimination of the Oklahoma Enhanced Oil Recovery tax credit in July 2017.\nImpairment Expense – For the first quarter of 2018, we recorded $8.8 million of non-cash impairment expense. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded $2.5 million of non-cash impairment expense. Impairment expense for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to persistent wellbore issues on Liberty properties in Texas. There was no impairment expense recorded for the first quarter 2017.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenses (“DD&A”) - DD&A for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.4 million, or $13.65/Boe. On a per Boe basis, DD&A increased 9.2% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and decreased 8.6% from the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in DD&A per Boe was largely due to increased reserves, reduced asset carrying values due to impairment in 2017 and decreased production volumes, partially offset by the net impact of the acquisitions and divestitures.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”) - G&A for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million, or $7.52/Boe, and included $0.2 million, or $0.95/Boe, of non-cash equity-based compensation expense related to the Partnership’s Long Term Incentive Program. G&A for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.2 million, or $3.99/Boe. G&A for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.8 million, or $5.60/Boe, and included $0.2 million, or $0.51/Boe, in non-cash equity-based compensation expense related to the Partnership’s Long Term Incentive Program. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher professional and public reporting expenses that historically occur during the first quarter, such as fees related to the year-end financial statements and reserves audits as well as expenses related to the Southern Oklahoma asset sale.\nNet Interest Expense - Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 million compared to $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Lower net interest expense, sequentially and year-over-year, is primarily due to lower debt outstanding, partially offset by increasing LIBOR and Prime borrowing rates. The average effective interest rate increased sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to an increase in the underlying market rate and an increase in the pricing grid on our line of credit.\nNet Loss- For the first quarter of 2018, Mid-Con Energy reported a net loss of $10.4 million. Net loss per limited partner unit was $0.37 (basic and diluted) based on the weighted average limited partner units outstanding during the period of 30.2 million (basic and diluted). Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.7 million, or $0.30 (basic and diluted) per limited partner unit, based on a weighted average of 30.1 million (basic and diluted) limited partner units outstanding during the period. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million, or per limited partner unit of $0.12 (basic) and $0.11 (diluted), based on a weighted average limited partner units of 29.9 million (basic) and 41.8 million (diluted). The negative sequential variance was primarily attributable to impairment. The negative variance year-over-year was primarily attributable to a greater loss on derivatives, lower production and higher impairment in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher WTI prices and decreased total operating costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the first quarter of 2018 was $6.0 million, or $23.81/Boe. Adjusted EBITDA was $26.07/Boe in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $19.84/Boe in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease in Adjusted EBITDA, in aggregate and per Boe, was primarily due to lower production, and higher cash settlements from matured derivatives, including net premiums paid. The year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA, on a per Boe basis, was primarily due to lower production from the sale of Southern Oklahoma properties in December 2017.\nPRB ACQUISITIONS\nIn January 2018, Mid-Con closed the PRB Acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.6 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The PRB Acquisitions were funded through cash on hand and the Offering. Certain highlights of the acquisitions are:\nMid-Con Energy acquired ~44% average working interest Properties include 50 producing wells, 27 injection wells, and ~31,400 HBP acres, all on a gross basis Net total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, were 2,974 MBoe (94% oil) Net proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2017, were 673 MBoe (75% oil) Average net daily production of 122 Boe/d (77% oil) calculated based on trailing three-month average ended December 31, 2017\nCLASS B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED UNITS\nIn conjunction with the PRB Acquisitions in January 2018, Mid-Con Energy closed its previously announced Offering of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of Class B Convertible Preferred Units (\"Preferred Units\") to investors led by John Goff. The Partnership used net proceeds from the Offering to fund its PRB Acquisitions, and excess net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including repayment of borrowings outstanding under Mid-Con Energy's revolving credit facility.\nThe Preferred Units were issued at a price of $1.53 per Preferred Unit (the \"Unit Purchase Price\"). The Partnership will pay holders of the Preferred Units (\"Holders\") a cumulative, quarterly distribution in cash at an annual rate of 8.00% or, under certain circumstances, in additional Preferred Units, at an annual rate of 10.00%. At any time after the six-month anniversary and prior to August 11, 2021, each Holder may elect to convert all or any portion of such Holder's Preferred Units into common units representing limited partner interests in Mid-Con Energy on a one-for-one basis. On August 11, 2021, each Holder may elect to cause the Partnership to redeem all or any portion of such Holder's Preferred Units for cash at the Unit Purchase Price, and any remaining Preferred Units will thereafter be converted to common units on a one-for-one basis.\n$125 MILLION BORROWING BASE AND EXTENSION OF CREDIT FACILITY\nOn January 31, 2018, the Partnership and its lenders executed Amendment 12 to the Partnership's credit agreement. The amendment increased the borrowing base of the Partnership's senior secured revolving facility to $125 million and extended the maturity to November 2020. Mid-Con Energy's next regularly scheduled bi-annual redetermination is expected to occur in or around May 2018.\nLIQUIDITY\nAt May 2, 2018, the Partnership’s total liquidity of $36.8 million, consisted of $0.8 million of cash and $36.0 million of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nHEDGING SUMMARY\nMid-Con Energy enters into various commodity derivative contracts intended to achieve more predictable cash flows by reducing the Partnership’s exposure to short-term fluctuations in oil prices. We believe this risk management strategy will serve to secure a portion of our revenues and, by retaining some opportunity to participate in upward price movements, may also enable us to realize higher revenues during periods when prices rise.\nAs of May 2, 2018, the following table reflects volumes of Mid-Con Energy’s production hedged by commodity derivative contracts, with the corresponding prices at which the production is hedged:\nOIL HEDGES 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 Collar Volume (Bbl/d) 1,484 1,141 1,141 — — — — — — — Call Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 57.91 $ 52.42 $ 53.13 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Put Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 45.00 $ 43.57 $ 43.57 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — WTI Swap Volume (Bbl/d) 564 510 467 1,938 1,798 1,720 1,664 1,646 1,607 1,554 Swap Price ($/Bbl) $ 51.60 $ 54.81 $ 54.19 $ 56.24 $ 56.15 $ 56.10 $ 56.05 $ 55.17 $ 55.17 $ 54.06 Put Volume (Bbl/d) (1) — 326 326 — — — — — — — Put Strike Price ($/Bbl) (1) $ — $ 45.00 $ 45.00 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — Total Hedged Volume (Bbl/d) 2,048 1,977 1,934 1,938 1,798 1,720 1,664 1,646 1,607 1,554 Floor Strike Price ($/Bbl) $ 46.82 $ 46.70 $ 46.38 $ 56.24 $ 56.15 $ 56.10 $ 56.05 $ 55.17 $ 55.17 $ 54.06 % Hedged (2) 73 % 70 % 69 % 69 % 64 % 61 % 59 % 58 % 57 % 55 % (1) Deferred premium puts include premiums that are to be paid monthly as the contracts settle (refer to our SEC filings for additional details).\n(2) Estimated percent hedged based on the mid-point of annual 2018 Boe production guidance, multiplied by an approximate 94% oil weighting based on first quarter 2018 reported production volumes.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nThe following outlook is subject to all the cautionary statements and limitations described under the “Forward-Looking Statements” caption at the end of this press release.
