REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco\nThere were no reports of violence, but the presidential palace complex was locked down, initially denying journalists’ access as protesters burned Duterte’s effigy with a sign “Liar King” several hundred meters outside.\nA pledge to act against employers who hire workers short-term and without adequate benefits helped Duterte, a former city mayor, win the presidency in May 2016.\nShortly after assuming power, Duterte warned that any company that failed to stop hiring short-term labor risked closure.\nBut trade unions say the practice has persisted, particularly in shopping malls and the fast-food industry.\nA leader of the left-wing Bayan (Nation) movement, Renato Reyes, said the president had done what other leaders had failed to do in 30 years - unite fragmented labor groups.\n“The historic unity of the working class is the direct result of the failure of the regime to bring an end to contractualization, a major campaign promise of the president,” Reyes said in a statement.\n“For two years, the executive dribbled the ball, only to pass it to Congress at the last minute.” Thousands of Philippine workers carry placards while marching towards the Malacanang Presidential Palace during a May Day rally at Espana, metro Manila, Philippines May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco\nAbout 8,000 police and soldiers kept watch at the march. Police estimated up to 10,000 people, waving flags and carrying banners, took part.\nIn central Cebu, Duterte asked Congress to pass a law amending the “outdated” Labour Code “to keep it attuned to the realities of our time”.\n“I remain firm in my commitment to put an end to ‘ENDO’ and illegal contractualization,” Duterte said, referring to commonly used term of “end of contract” among minimum wage earners.\n“A mere executive order is not enough. I cannot be a legislator. It is not allowed. But, I can only implement.”\nHe signed an executive order prohibiting illegal contracting or sub-contracting and asked the labor department to submit a list of companies “engaged in or suspected to be engaged in labor-only contraction.\nThere were also protests in other key cities outside the capital as workers’ groups demanded higher wages, improved working conditions, including for millions of migrant workers abroad. The Philippines is locked in a dispute with Kuwait over reports of abuse of Philippine domestic helpers there.\nLast month, the labor department ordered fast-food chain Jollibee Foods Corp to regularize more than 6,000 workers by making them permanent.
