    "text": "ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The New Home Company Inc. (NYSE:NWHM) (the “Company”) today announced that on May 10, 2018 its Board of Directors approved a $15 million stock repurchase program.\n“The Board’s authorization of a stock repurchase program reflects their confidence in our strategy and long-term outlook of the Company,” said New Home CEO Larry Webb. “Our strategy prioritizes deploying our capital to fund our growth and improve our returns. We believe we can capitalize on market conditions and repurchase our stock while continuing to make strategic land investments for our future. Overall, we believe this balanced approach is a great way to increase shareholder value.”\nUnder the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its common stock with an aggregate value of up to $15 million. The repurchases of the Company’s shares may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be determined by the Company’s management at its discretion and be based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company’s common stock, corporate and contractual requirements, prevailing market and economic conditions and legal requirements. The share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company intends to retire any shares repurchased.\nAbout The New Home Company\nTHE NEW HOME COMPANY is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NWHM.” It is a next generation homebuilder focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative and consumer-driven homes in major metropolitan areas within select growth markets in California and Arizona, including coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and Phoenix.
