    "text": "TSX Symbol: HNL\nCALGARY, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Horizon North Logistics Inc. (\"Horizon North\" or the \"Corporation\") reported its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nSubsequent to Q1 2018, Horizon North successfully completed the previously announced acquisition of Shelter Modular Inc., a 34,000 sq. ft. full service modular manufacturing company based in Aldergrove, British Columbia; Growth of the workforce in the Kamloops, British Columbia manufacturing facility lagged expectations and contributed to weaker than expected results for the quarter. The Aldergrove facility will add additional capacity to execute on the growing backlog in the Modular Solutions division; On May 7, 2018 Horizon North entered into a master teaming agreement with EllisDon Corporation (\"EllisDon\"). The teaming agreement will apply to projects such as hotels, commercial buildings and multi-family structures undertaken by Horizon North's Modular Solutions division. Horizon North and EllisDon will select, pursue, and execute such projects jointly, bringing the respective strengths of each organization to our customers; The Modular Solutions business gained significant momentum throughout Q1 2018, closing with a backlog of $62.5 million compared to $43.9 million at Q4 2017 with an additional $127.0 million of high-quality, high probability opportunities; Horizon North's joint venture partnership, Halfway River Horizon North, was conditionally awarded $63 million of turn-key camp services in the Montney region of northeast British Columbia. Pending regulatory and internal customer approvals, the contract is expected to start in Q3 2018 and run through Q4 2019; Horizon North continued its dividend policy and paid its 26 th consecutive quarterly dividend; and EBITDAS for Q1 2018 were below the comparable period of 2017, which included $1.0 million of insurance proceeds. The decrease was a result of lower large camp and mat sales volumes combined with a shifting contract mix in the Camps & Catering operations as part of a capital light strategy.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nThree months ended March 31\n(000's except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017 (2)\n%\nChange\nRevenue\n$\n82 ,575\n$\n70,488\n17\nEBITDAS (1)\n4,433\n8,254\n(46)\nEBITDAS as a % of revenue\n5%\n12%\nOperating (loss) earnings\n(7,044)\n8,153\n(186)\nOperating (loss) earnings as a % of revenue\n(9%)\n12%\nTotal (loss) profit\n(6,062)\n5,140\n(218)\nTotal comprehensive (loss) income\n(6,062)\n5,140\n(218)\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic\n$\n(0.04)\n$ 0.04\nDiluted\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n0.04\nTotal assets\n$\n482,753\n$\n485,961\n(1)\nTotal Long-term loans and borrowings\n85,550\n70,771\n21\nAdjusted fund flow\n4,672\n6,661\n(30)\nNet Capital spending\n16,339\n(9,612)\n(270)\nTotal debt to EBITDAS (1)\n3.26:1.00\n2.84:1.00\nDebt to total capitalization ratio (1)\n0.22:1.00\n0.18:1.00\nDividends declared\n$\n2,907\n$\n2,892\nDividends declared per share\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.02\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP measures definitions within the press release for details.\n(2)\nIncludes insurance settlement in Q1 2017 related to the Fort McMurray wild fires.\nFirst Quarter Operational Overview\nResults for the three months ended March 31, 2018, except for revenue, decreased across all measures compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in revenue for Q1 2018, was mainly driven by the Modular Solutions division as a result of greater project volumes compared to Q1 2017. Partially offsetting this increase were lower mat sales and large camp volumes from the Industrial Services division, compared to Q1 2017. Decreased EBITDAS was a result of lower volumes in Industrial Services combined with a different contract mix in the Camps & Catering operation. Additionally, the first quarter of 2017 included an insurance settlement related to the total loss of the Blacksand Executive Lodge during the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires. See \"Effect of Q1 insurance settlement\" on page 6 of this MD&A for a normalization of Q1 2017 results.\nIndustrial Services\nRevenues from Industrial Services for Q1 2018 decreased by 2% compared to Q1 2017. The decrease was mainly a result of lower mat sales along with the associated transport and installation activity. The decrease in mat sales was primarily a result of allocating the majority of Q1 2018 mat production to rental fleet to meet continued strong rental demand. The majority of the demand continues to be driven by high levels of activity in the W5/W6 area south of Grande Prairie, Alberta. Partially offsetting the lower mat sales revenue were increased revenues from Camps & Catering which experienced higher catering only activity as a result of recent Aboriginal partnerships in the Fort McMurray, Alberta area which were not in place in Q1 2017. In addition, used camp equipment sales were higher compared to Q1 2017.\nModular Solutions\nModular Solutions revenues for Q1 2018 were above Q1 2017 as a result of the increased number and scope of projects. The projects in Q1 2018 included several government sponsored affordable housing projects, a hotel project and several commercial condominium projects compared to a single government sponsored affordable housing project and one hotel project in Q1 2017.\nOther Financial Measures\nHorizon North's Q1 2018 EBITDAS decreased compared to Q1 2017, mainly as a result of the volume and contract mix discussed above. As well, Q1 2017 EBITDAS included $1.0 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta wildfires. Operating loss and loss per share for Q1 2018 was significantly lower compared to Q1 2017 due to lower EBITDAS and the Q1 2017 insurance settlement.\nHorizon North continued to maintain a strong focus on managing the Statement of Financial Position through minimizing working capital and a reduced capital program. Total loans and borrowings were $85.6 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $74.6 million at December 31, 2017. As a result of the increased debt, Total Debt to EBITDAS ratio was 3.26:1.00 compared to 2.48:1.00 at December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nHorizon North's focus in Q2 and the remainder of 2018 will continue to be on:\nMoving forward initiatives started in 2017 intended to strengthen and diversify the Industrial Services business; Ensuring Horizon North is positioned and prepared to take advantage of LNG opportunities; and Expand the Modular Solution backlog while honing execution.\nFor Industrial Services, Horizon North anticipates moderate strengthening of activity levels in the Camps & Catering operations compared to Q1 2018. The contract mix experienced in Q1 2018 is expected to shift in the second half of 2018 and include more large camp activity with the expectation of the $63 million conditional contract award becoming a firm contract. Horizon North does not expect any significant strengthening in pricing and will continue to focus on cost controls and operational discipline to improve EBITDAS levels.\nThe Industrial Services business will be focused on continuing to build-out and expand on the three phase strategy initiated in 2017:\nLeverage the Aboriginal relationships entered into in the second half of 2017 which cover regions north and south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. A significant project undertaken in the second half of 2017 has shown the potential of this region and Horizon North will continue to develop similar opportunities; Focus on the Duvernay and Montney regions through securing strategic land locations which position Horizon North to participate fully in the continued high activity levels expected in world class resource plays similar to the conventional W5/W6 market; and Grow Horizon North's presence in the mining sector, specifically on developing opportunities in northern Canada where Horizon North has a strong track record.\nWith the likelihood of one LNG project proceeding to final investment decision, Horizon North will continue to develop plans and work to ensure it is well positioned to take full advantage of opportunities as they arise by strengthening existing relationships with regional First Nations and the municipality as well as completing the development of its land asset in Kitimat, British Columbia.\nThe Modular Solutions business is expected to continue its growth based on Q1 2018 backlog and the high-quality opportunity pipeline underpinned largely by social infrastructure and affordable housing projects. Ramp up of the workforce in the Kamloops plant continues to lag expectations and the desired staffing levels will likely not be achieved until the second half of 2018. The integration of the Shelter Modular Inc. acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2018 adding to capacity growth in the second half of 2018. Horizon North anticipates that Modular Solutions will continue its trend of earnings improvement and contribute positive EBITDAS throughout 2018 as increased volumes drive improved economies of scale.\nThe recently announced teaming agreement with EllisDon will further strengthen Modular Solutions ability to grow. The agreement applies to specified projects such as hotels, commercial buildings, and multi-family structures undertaken by Horizon North's Modular Solutions division. Horizon North and EllisDon will select, pursue, and execute such projects jointly, bringing the respective strengths of each organization to customers.\nThe strength of the Statement of Financial Position is a key priority and Horizon North will continue to closely manage debt levels and working capital. Cost reduction measures across our operations and the continued centralization of certain general and administrative functions will drive improved cash flow through efficiencies. In addition to a limited and tightly managed capital program, Horizon North will continue to assess its portfolio of assets in 2018 to ensure a focus on core business lines.\nDividend payment\nHorizon North announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a dividend for the second quarter of 2018 at $0.02 per share. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 30, 2018 to be paid on July 13, 2018. The Board of Directors regularly monitors the strength of the Statement of Financial Position, cash from operations and capital requirements to ensure the overall sustainability of Horizon North is not compromised. The dividends will be eligible dividends for Canadian tax purposes.\nAdditional Information\nA copy of the Corporation's Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and related Management's Discussion and Analysis have been filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and www.horizonnorth.ca . Unless otherwise indicated, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the reporting currency is in Canadian dollars.\nNon-GAAP measures\nCertain measures in this MD&A do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and provide investors with an alternative method for assessing the Corporation's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Corporation's ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods. These measures should not be construed as alternatives to total profit and total comprehensive income determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Corporation's performance . The method of calculating these measures may differ from other entities and accordingly, may not be comparable to measures used by other entities. The following non-GAAP measures are used to monitor the Corporation's performance:\nEBITDAS: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment, gain/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and share based compensation (\"EBITDAS\"). Management believes that in addition to total profit and total comprehensive income, EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the Corporation's ability to generate cash flow in order to fund working capital, service debt, pay current income taxes and fund capital programs, and it is regularly provided to and reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.\nDebt to total capitalization: Calculated as the ratio of debt to total capitalization. Debt is defined as the sum of current and long-term portions of loans and borrowings. Total capitalization is calculated as the sum of debt and shareholders' equity.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information\nCertain statements contained in this MD&A constitute forward-looking statements or information (\"forward-looking statements\").
