FILE PHOTO - Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz is seen during a quadrilateral Ministerial Summit in Nicosia, Cyprus December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou\n“Israel has not gotten involved in the (Syrian) civil war so far,” Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz was quoted as telling the Israeli news site Ynet.\n“If Syrian President Bashar al-Assad continues allowing Iran to operate within Syrian territory, Israel will liquidate him and topple his regime,” he was quoted as saying.\n“If Assad lets Iran turn Syria into a military base against us, to attack us from Syrian territory, he should know that will be the end of him.” Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
