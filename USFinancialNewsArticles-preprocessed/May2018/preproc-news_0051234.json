    "text": "Pfizer has agreed to pay $23.9 million to resolve U.S. government charges that the drugmaker illegally used a purportedly independent charity to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients covering their out-of-pocket drug costs.\nThe settlement announced by the U.S. Department of Justice resolves allegations that Pfizer violated the federal False Claims Act between 2012 and 2016.\nIt resulted from an industry-wide probe into drug companies' support of patient assistance charities.\nPfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe government accused Pfizer of improperly using the Patient Access Network Foundation, which claimed non-profit status for tax purposes, as a conduit to cover the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients taking three Pfizer drugs.\nThese drugs included Sutent and Inlyta, which both treat renal cell carcinoma, and Tikosyn, which treats arrhythmia in patients with atrial fibrillation, the government said.\n\"Pfizer used a third party to saddle Medicare with extra costs,\" enabling the drugmaker to generate more revenue and mask price increases, Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney in Boston, said in a statement.",
