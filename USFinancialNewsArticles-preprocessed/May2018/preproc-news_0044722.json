    "text": "NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Scientists are hunting for the mysterious source of surging levels of a gas that is outlawed for depleting the planet’s protective ozone layer, United Nations officials said on Friday.\nProduction of the banned gas should be near zero but recent findings showed an increase in the atmosphere of 25 percent since 2012, according to a report published this week in the academic journal Nature.\nResearch points to it originating in East Asia, experts said.\nThe gas, trichlorofluoromethane, or CFC-11, was once commonly used in refrigerators and spray cans and has industrial uses.\nU.N. experts want to “tighten down” the source of the gas emissions by fall, said Paul Newman, co-chairman of a panel helping enforce the agency’s Montreal Protocol that bans ozone-depleting chemicals.\nThe planet’s ozone layer shields life from cancer-causing solar rays.\nCFC-11 is undetectable using common infrared techniques so scientists plan to utilize monitoring stations and aircraft observations, Newman said.\nBut pinpointing the exact location will be difficult, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“You really have to get nearby the production facilities themselves and find the stuff,” he said.\nNo country has been known to violate the Montreal Protocol in its 30 years of existence, said David Fahey, also a member of the treaty’s assessment panel.\n“There’s certainly somebody who is responsible in that part of the world, but it could be inadvertent,” he told the Foundation.\nIn addition to damaging to the ozone layer, CFC-11 is also a planet-warming greenhouse gas thousands of time more potent than carbon dioxide, scientists say.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
