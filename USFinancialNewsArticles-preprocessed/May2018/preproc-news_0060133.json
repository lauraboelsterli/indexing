    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Catholic hospital cannot dismiss an employee who divorced and remarried, as abiding by Catholic rules does not constitute an occupational requirement, an adviser to the EU’s top court said on Thursday.\nThe hospital in Duesseldorf, Germany dismissed the Catholic doctor, who had worked there for nine years, after it learned of his remarriage.\nIt said he had violated the moral obligations of his employment when he divorced and remarried without annulling the first marriage, as prescribed under Catholicism.\nBut European Court of Justice Advocate General Melchior Wathelet disagreed.\n“Such a profession of belief does not constitute, in this case, an occupational requirement, much less one that is genuine and justified,” he said in a statement.\nThe court, whose judgements cannot be appealed, is not obliged to follow the reasoning of its adviser, but usually does so.\nMembership of the Catholic Church is not a requirement to work at the hospital, and non-Catholics employed there are not expected to abide by Catholic tenets, the adviser said.\nReporting by Megan Dollar; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
