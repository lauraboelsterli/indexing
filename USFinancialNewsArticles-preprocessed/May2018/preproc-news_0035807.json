    "text": "New Executive Appointment to Drive SecOps Innovation for Industry-Leading Cloud Security Platform\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Threat Stack, the leading Cloud Security platform for security and operations teams, today announced the appointment of Pete Cheslock as Vice President of Technical Operations. In this role, Cheslock will drive Threat Stack’s commitment to delivering the highest levels of security and operational efficiency to its rapidly growing user base.\nModern infrastructure demands that security and operations work together, and achieving this has been central to Threat Stack’s mission from its inception. Understanding the critical value of security and drawing on extensive DevOps experience, Cheslock has played a pivotal role in developing initiatives that drive operations while simultaneously integrating best security practices. As such, he has helped Threat Stack meet all of its key milestones and, most recently, played a major role in developing the new Threat Stack Cloud SecOps Program SM , which enables companies to securely leverage modern infrastructure and DevOps at scale.\n“Threat Stack understands that cloud-enabled companies need assistance achieving security while maintaining peak operational efficiency,” said Brian M. Ahern, Threat Stack Chairman and CEO. “Cheslock’s understanding of modern-day cloud operations and cybersecurity requirements has made him a driving force since Threat Stack was founded and will ensure that our platform continues to evolve in a way that delivers the greatest value to companies operating in the cloud across all industry sectors.”\nCheslock joined Threat Stack during its launch in 2014 and served as Senior Director of Operations and Support. Before Threat Stack, he was Director of DevTools at Dyn and Director of Technical & Cloud Operations at Sonian, where he developed and managed automation and release engineering teams and projects. With over 20 years’ experience in Technical Operations, Cheslock has a deep understanding of the challenges and issues that security, development, and operations professionals face on a daily basis.\n“I was originally recruited for Threat Stack’s pre-launch team, so I’m delighted to have the opportunity of contributing to the company’s ongoing product innovation strategy,” said Cheslock. “At Threat Stack, we have positioned ourselves as a leader that helps businesses derive the full benefits of operating in the cloud at scale while limiting risk, and I’m looking forward to working with my team to extend our vision and deepen the commitment we have to our customers’ success.”\nAbout Threat Stack\nThreat Stack enables growth-driven companies to scale securely and meet complex cloud security needs by identifying and verifying insider threats, external attacks, and data loss in real time. Purpose-built for today’s infrastructure, Threat Stack’s comprehensive intrusion detection platform combines continuous security monitoring and risk assessment to empower security and operations to better manage risk and compliance across their entire infrastructure, including cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud.\nFor more information, or to start a free cloud security trial, visit threatstack.com .\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005075/en/\nfama PR for Threat Stack\nTim Morin, 617-986-5015\nthreatstack@famapr.com\nSource: Threat Stack",
