    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMRK), a full-service precious metals trading company and an official distributor for all the major sovereign mints, reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFiscal Q3 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 15% to $1.99 billion from $1.73 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and increased 19% from $1.68 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 1% to $7.4 million (0.37% of revenue) from $7.3 million (0.42% of revenue) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and decreased 17% from $8.9 million (0.53% of revenue) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $0.6 million or $(0.09) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and net loss of $0.2 million or $(0.03) per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Gold ounces sold in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 7% to 618,000 ounces from 579,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and increased 64% from 376,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 Silver ounces sold in the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 46% to 11.4 million ounces from 20.9 million ounces for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and decreased 5% from 12.0 million from the three months ended December 31, 2017 As of March 31, 2018, the number of secured loans increased 46% to 3,124 from 2,138 as of March 31, 2017 and increased 11% from 2,823 as of December 31, 2017\nFiscal Q3 2018 Financial R e sults\nRevenues increased 15% to $1.99 billion from $1.73 billion in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in gold ounces sold, gold prices and forward sales, offset by lower silver ounces sold and lower silver prices.\nGross profit increased 1% to $7.4 million (0.37% of revenue) from $7.3 million (0.42% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross profit was primarily related to gross profit from the company’s recently acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline) and increased trading profits offset by lower silver volume and margin resulting from continued subdued market conditions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 57% to $9.4 million from $6.0 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to the company’s Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline) of $3.6 million (including $0.6 million of severance expense), partially offset by a $0.1 million reduction to incentive compensation expense.\nInterest income increased 25% to $4.1 million from $3.3 million in same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates and the aggregate value of the company’s secured loan portfolio. The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 46% to 3,124 from 2,138 in 2017. Interest income from the company’s secured loan portfolio increased by $0.6 million or 29% in comparison to the same year-ago period.\nInterest expense increased 35% to $3.6 million from $2.7 million in same year-ago quarter. The increase was related primarily to a greater usage of the company’s lines of credit, the debt financing agreement associated with its acquisition of Goldline, amortization costs related to loan fees, and higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases. In comparison to the same year-ago period, interest expense increased by $0.5 million or 27% related to the company’s Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), increased by $0.2 million or 61% related to third-party loan processing fees from acquired secured loans, and $0.2 million related to its Goldline Credit Facility.\nNet loss totaled $0.6 million or $(0.09) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter. On a reportable segment basis, Goldline (“Direct Sales Segment”) had a $3.2 million pre-tax loss, while A-Mark (“Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services”) had a $1.7 million pre-tax profit.\nFiscal Nine Months 2018 Highlights\nRevenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 increased 3% to $5.84 billion from $5.66 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 Gross profit for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 6% to $23.6 million (0.41% of revenue) from $25.3 million (0.45% of revenue) for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 Net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $0.4 million or $(0.05) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $5.9 million or $0.82 per diluted share for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 Gold ounces sold in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 30% to 1.3 million ounces from 1.9 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 Silver ounces sold in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 42% to 37.9 million ounces from 65.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017\nFiscal Nine Months 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues increased 3% to $5.84 billion from $5.66 billion in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in forward sales and higher gold prices, offset by a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold.\nGross profit decreased 6% to $23.6 million (0.41% of revenue) from $25.3 million (0.45% of revenue) in the same year-ago period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to subdued market conditions (i.e., lower gold and silver sales volume and margins) compared to the prior fiscal year, offset by gross profit of the recently acquired Direct Sales segment (i.e., Goldline).\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 45% to $25.7 million from $17.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to new selling, general and administrative expense related to our newly acquired Direct Sales segment (e.g., Goldline) of $8.4 million (including $0.6 million of severance expense), $0.3 million of stock compensation expense, a $0.5 million non-recurring legal expense, $0.3 million of professional consulting fees, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction to incentive compensation expense.\nInterest income increased 16% to $10.5 million from $9.1 million in the same year-ago period. This increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates and aggregate value of the secured loan portfolio. The number of secured loans outstanding increased by 46% to 3,124 from 2,138 in 2017. Interest income from the secured loan portfolio increased by $1.4 million or by 25% in comparison to the same year-ago period.\nInterest expense increased 32% to $9.7 million from $7.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was related primarily to a significantly greater usage of lines of credit resulting from continued growth in the business, new related-party debt financing agreement associated with the acquisition of Goldline, higher average inventory levels primarily related to product financing arrangements, amortization costs related to loan fees related to third party financing fee arrangements, and higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases. In comparison to the same year-ago period, interest expense increased by $1.4 million or by 25% related to Trading Credit Facility (including debt amortization costs), by $0.5 million related to the Goldline Credit Facility, and by $0.3 million or 33% related to third-party loan processing fees related to acquired secured loans.\nNet loss totaled $0.4 million or $(0.05) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $5.9 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. On a reportable segment basis, Goldline (“Direct Sales Segment”) had a $4.8 million pre-tax loss while A-Mark (“Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services”) had a $4.4 million pre-tax profit.\nManagement Commentary\n“During the fiscal third quarter we continued to execute on our strategic plan to expand our platform and increase our market share,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “The precious metals market environment continues to experience historically low levels of demand for physical product. However, we are continuing to build out our finance portfolio, which grew by more than 11% from the prior quarter in terms of the total number of loans. Put together, our diversified platform and business model provide additional sources of income and predictability for our overall business, helping to mitigate the effects of the subdued market conditions.\n“While the integration and optimization of Goldline has been more challenging than originally anticipated, we are now implementing certain measures to optimize the subsidiary’s structure and expand its marketing programs. If you exclude our Direct Sales Segment from our third quarter results, A-Mark was profitable on a pre-tax basis. Additionally, we expect the benefits of our optimization measures to be in full effect starting in the new fiscal year. We continue to believe that Goldline presents a substantial opportunity through its marketing platform to both upsell and cross-sell our expanding suite of services to its 150,000 clients and prospective client leads.\n“At the same time, in the rest of our operations, we are continuing to plan and judiciously invest in strategic growth areas to further diversify our business and offerings. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that we are ready and in a strong position to capitalize on profitable opportunities when market conditions improve. To that end, during the third quarter we launched our new ‘24/5’ online trading platform, which is now providing A-Mark clients with extended access to our robust trading portal featuring real-time pricing, all in an effort to better serve their growing needs across any time zone. This quarter we also renewed our $260 million credit facility with our existing bank facility partners. While this facility meets our current liquidity requirements, we are also assessing other sources of cost-effective capital as we look to further expand our platform of products and services.\n“Looking ahead to our current quarter, we are continuing to experience a stagnant precious metals market, which has, unfortunately, characterized the entire fiscal year to this point. However, we are monitoring the uncertain geopolitical climate and remain cognizant of the fact that conditions can and do change quickly, which could have an immediate impact on the precious metals environment. During fiscal 2018, we have made meaningful progress on our strategic roadmap that has positioned us effectively for the longer term. We continue to believe A-Mark is in a strong position to grow, and we are focused on delivering this growth through the competitive advantages we’ve established over the last several years. Our platform, customer base, and capabilities have never been stronger. We are confident these factors will translate into more predictable growth and profitability in the quarters and years ahead.”\nQuarterly Dividend\nA-Mark board of directors has determined to suspend the company's quarterly dividend for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 to increase its financial flexibility and strengthen its balance sheet. The board will re-assess its capital resources for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and may or may not determine to reinstate the dividend based on that assessment.\nShare Repurchase Program\nA-Mark board of directors approved a share repurchase program that enables the company to purchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock from time-to-time in the open market or in block purchase transactions. The amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share purchases will be funded from cash from operations and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nConference Call\nA-Mark will hold a conference call today (May 8, 2018) to discuss these financial results.
