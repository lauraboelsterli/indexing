    "text": "Intermediate declaration by the Board of Directors\nTESSENDERLO, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nHighlights for Q1 2018:\nRevenue of USD 143.5 million, at the upper end of the USD 138-144 million guidance, down 3% year-on-year and down 7% quarter-on-quarter. Core business automotive, industrial, and medical revenue up 25% year-on-year. EBITDA of USD 20.2 million, down 20% year-on-year and down 35% quarter-on-quarter; EBITDA margin of 14%, at the upper end of 12-14% guidance. EBIT of USD 5.8 million, down 49% year-on-year and down 65% quarter-on-quarter. Net profit of USD 13.6 million, up 21% year-on-year and down 58% quarter-on-quarter. Earnings per share of USD 0.10\nOutlook:\nManagement expects Q2 2018 revenue of USD 154-159 million and EBITDA margin of 18-20%. Guidance for 2018 remains unchanged and is based on an average exchange rate of 1.23 USD/Euro .\nIn the first quarter, X-FAB’s core business, namely automotive, industrial, and medical, grew by 25% year-on-year with a particularly strong contribution from the industrial segment, which increased by 36%. The automotive segment grew by 23% whereas the medical segment increased by only 4% due to an inventory correction of a larger account. CCC business dropped by 22% compared to the same quarter last year still suffering from the capacity limitations X-FAB faced during the year 2017.\nThe RF-SOI mobile applications manufactured at X-FAB France displayed typical lower Q1 revenue cyclicality, dropping by about USD 6 million compared to previous quarter. However, this year, the RF-SOI ramp up did set in a month later than previous years resulting in an expected slightly lower revenue. RF-SOI consumer sales are expected to pick up again in the second quarter.\nRevenue Breakdown per Quarter\nin millions of USD Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Automotive 46.2 52.9 55.9 56.0 54.5 59.3 66.5 70.2 67.2 Industrial 11.8 11.3 14.9 12.7 15.2 16.5 16.7 18.5 20.7 Medical 2.7 2.6 4.1 3.5 4.6 4.5 6.6 6.9 4.8 Subtotal core business¹ 60.6 66.8 74.8 72.2 74.3 80.3 89.8 95.6 92.8 56.9% 56.4% 58.2% 45.3% 50.2% 57.6% 64.0% 62.0% 64.6% CCC²\n24.8 25.5 29.8 30.5 30.9 24.4 18.8 24.2 23.9 Others 0.7 0.7 0.3 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.8 0.9 0.4 Subtotal ¹\n86.1 93.0 105.0 103.4 106.0 105.2 109.4 120.7 117.1 80.8% 78.5% 81.6% 64.9% 71.6% 75.5% 78.0% 78.3% 81.6% X-FAB France³\n0.0 0.0 0.0 31.6 26.5 31.0 30.9 33.4 26.4 Subcontracted business 20.4 25.5 23.6 24.3 15.4 3.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total revenues 106.5 118.5 128.6 159.3 147.9 139.3 140.3 154.1 143.5 1 Without X-FAB France and Subcontracting Business\n2 Consumer, Communications & Computer\n3 X-FAB France business is predominantly CCC with a small amount of Automotive and Industrial business\nThe weaker US-Dollar versus the Euro has continued to create a headwind for profitability. The average exchange rate for the first quarter 2018 deteriorated by more than 5 cents compared to the previous quarter and by more than 16 cents compared to the same quarter last year.\nDespite a weaker average USD/Euro exchange rate of 1.23 in the first quarter compared to the expectation of 1.20, profitability is at the upper end of guidance due to a higher than expected increase of WIP (work in progress), which will be supporting the second quarter revenue increase.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the share of revenue that is incurred in Euro increased to 19% compared to 13% in the same quarter last year, whilst about 40% of expenses incurred were denominated in Euro. In the future, X-FAB aims at further increasing the Euro share of its revenue to provide a natural hedge.\nAt a constant USD/Euro exchange rate of 1.065 experienced in Q1 2017, the EBITDA margin in Q1 2018 would have been 18-19%. The actual exchange rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 1.23, and the corresponding EBITDA margin 14%.\nThe positive net financial result of USD 5.8 million is mainly due to the translation effect of the portion of Euro cash into US-Dollar.\nThe capacity expansion of the Malaysian fab has been completed as scheduled. The additional capacity of 4,000 wafer starts per month, currently being ramped up, will help to alleviate the tight spare capacity at X-FAB Sarawak and will also contribute to the expected sales increase in the second quarter. After this expansion, X-FAB’s total capacity is at 98,000 wafer starts per month (in 200mm equivalent wafers).\nThe transfer of X-FAB technologies to X-FAB France is progressing with high priority, and prototyping for new products is ongoing. As a result, the plan to start production of automotive products on X-FAB technologies in 2018 is on track. By comparison, in Q1 2018 about 10% of the output of X-FAB France was based on X-FAB technologies.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the silicon carbide activities at X-FAB Texas continued to show good progress, with the SiC business being mainly driven by automotive applications for electric vehicles. First production is mainly used in electric vehicles in China, the world’s largest market.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, prototyping revenues came in at USD 12.7 million, a decrease of 17% quarter-on-quarter and 4% year-on-year. This decline is due to a relatively higher base effect, first in Q4 2017 when main projects were kicked off, and for the whole of 2017 when the SiC business contributed strongly to prototyping revenues as all customers worked on preparing their production starts.\nCommenting on the development of X-FAB’s business, Rudi De Winter added: “We do see healthy demand in all markets that X-FAB is serving and expect increased volumes across all lines. With the progress made with the integration of X-FAB France as well as the additional capacity available at X-FAB Sarawak, we will be in a much better position to support the solid demand going forward. In all factories we are increasing output returning to strong revenue growth for the next quarter driven by the robust demand in our core markets as well as the prototyping pipeline gradually turning into volume production.”\nX-FAB Quarterly Conference Call\nX-FAB’s fourth quarter results will be discussed in a live conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 6.30 pm CEST.
