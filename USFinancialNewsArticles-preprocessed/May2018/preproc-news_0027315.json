    "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich., May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arotech Corporation (Nasdaq:ARTX) today announced quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary:\nU.S. $ in thousands, except per share data Three months ended March 31, Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2018 2017 GAAP Measures Revenue $ 27,249 $ 22,347 $ 28,996 Net income (loss) $ 596 $ (768 ) $ 4,409 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.02 $ (0.03 ) $ 0.17 Non-GAAP Measures (reconciliation to GAAP measures appears in the tables below) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,161 $ 998 $ 3,230 Adjusted EPS $ 0.05 $ 0.01 $ 0.08 First Quarter 2018 Business Highlights :\nTraining and Simulation Division\nContinued its fourth quarter momentum with higher first quarter revenues. In addition, it procured two new weapon simulation software awards worth $3.7 million.\nPower Systems Division\nOur Israeli operation secured an international award for innovative battery chargers worth approximately $3.0 million for the project’s initial phase. The U.S. operation received supplemental funding of $1.9 million to continue production of Communication Emitter Sensing and Attack Systems (CESAS) for the United States Marine Corps. It also passed an AS9100D audit and achieved a Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) level three appraisal for its product development processes.\n“Our first quarter results were much more robust than a year ago and reflect the continuation of the solid sales performance we reported in the second half of last year,” commented CEO Dean Krutty. “Our Training and Simulation Division is benefitting from strong commercial sales and consistent program execution for our MILO use of force products and our driving simulators and public safety products. At the same time, our steadily performing weapon simulation group is adding consistent system and software engineering based revenues that provide a growing foundation for this division.\n“Our Power Systems Division has been investing in new product developments and new sales channels that we believe will further diversify and grow our battery product portfolio. Recent awards validate our efforts to generate sales for these products beyond our base in Israel,” concluded Mr. Krutty.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $27.2 million, compared to $22.3 million for the corresponding period in 2017, an increase of 21.9%. The year-over-year increase was due to higher revenues in both our divisions.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.7 million, or 28.3% of revenues, compared to $6.5 million, or 29.0% of revenues, for the corresponding period in 2017.\nOperating expenses were $6.7 million, or 24.4% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating expenses of $6.7 million, or 30.0% of revenues, for the corresponding period in 2017. Operating income for the first quarter was $1.1 million compared to an operating loss of $(227,000) for the corresponding period in 2017.\nThe Company’s net income from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $596,000, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(768,000), or $(0.03) per basic and diluted share, for the corresponding period in 2017.\nAdjusted Earnings per Share (Adjusted EPS) for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.05, compared to $0.01 for the corresponding period in 2017.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 million, compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period of 2017.\nThe Company believes that information concerning Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS enhances overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance. The Company computes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as reflected in the tables below.\nBalance Sheet Metrics\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $8.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to December 31, 2017, when the Company had $5.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total debt of $16.5 million, consisting of $6.2 million in short-term bank debt under the Company’s credit facility and $10.3 million in long-term loans. This is in comparison to December 31, 2017, when the Company had total debt of $15.9 million, consisting of $5.1 million in short-term bank debt under its credit facility and $10.8 million in long-term loans.\nThe Company also had $7.6 million in available, unused bank lines of credit with its primary bank as of March 31, 2018, under a $15.0 million revolving credit facility.\nThe Company maintained its current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of 2.0 for the comparative periods.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $40.7 million, which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, expiring in 2021 through 2032. Utilization of U.S. net operating losses is subject to annual limitations due to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nArotech had a backlog as of March 31, 2018 of $54.0 million. This compares to a backlog of $52.2 for the same period last year and a backlog of $61.1 as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company’s 2018 guidance range continues to be: Total revenue of $100 million to $105 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 million to $8.0 million; and Adjusted EPS of $0.15 to $0.18.
