    "text": "CHICAGO, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nAs previously announced, U.S. Cellular will hold a teleconference May 1, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. CDT. Listen to the live call via the Events & Presentations page of investors.uscellular.com .\nUnited States Cellular Corporation (NYSE:USM) reported total operating revenues of $942 million for the first quarter of 2018, versus $936 million for the same period one year ago. Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $45 million and $0.52, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $26 million and $0.31, respectively, in the same period one year ago.\n\"U.S. Cellular had a strong start to 2018 with positive results in customer satisfaction, revenue trends, network performance, cost reductions and profitability,\" said Kenneth R. Meyers, U.S. Cellular president and CEO. \"Our postpaid handset gross additions were up modestly year over year, and postpaid churn remained very low. Our total customer base increased year over year which, together with increased revenues from device protection plans, helped to offset service plan pricing pressure. We achieved growth in total operating revenues due to increased sales of both higher-priced devices and accessories.\n\"Our disciplined approach to promotional activity and our diligent focus on cost management resulted in an increase in profitability this quarter. We continue to manage our investments in network capacity to ensure the quality of our network provides an unmatched wireless experience for our customers and remains a competitive advantage. For the fourth time in a row, U.S. Cellular was ranked 'Highest Network Quality Performance among Wireless Cell Phone Users in the North Central Region' in J.D. Power's Wireless Network Quality Performance Study.\"\n2018 Estimated Results\nU.S. Cellular's current estimates of full-year 2018 results are shown below. Such estimates represent management's view as of May 1, 2018. Such forward‑looking statements should not be assumed to be current as of any future date. U.S. Cellular undertakes no duty to update such information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. There can be no assurance that final results will not differ materially from such estimated results.\n2018 Estimated Results\nCurrent (1)\nPrevious\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal operating revenues\n$3,850-$4,050\nUnchanged\nAdjusted OIBDA (2)(3)\n$625-$775\nUnchanged\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$765-$915\nUnchanged\nCapital expenditures\n$500-$550\nUnchanged\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 estimated results, actual results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and actual results for the year ended December 31, 2017. In providing 2018 estimated results, U.S. Cellular has not completed the below reconciliation to Net income because it does not provide guidance for income taxes. Although potentially significant, U.S. Cellular believes that the impact of income taxes cannot be reasonably predicted; therefore, U.S. Cellular is unable to provide such guidance.\nActual Results\n2018 Estimated\nResults (1)\nThree Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018 (1)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income (GAAP)\nN/A\n$\n55\n$\n15\nAdd back or deduct:\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nN/A\n22\n(287)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (GAAP)\n$\n10-160\n$\n77\n$\n(272)\nAdd back:\nInterest expense\n110\n29\n113\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\n635\n159\n615\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP) (2)\n$\n755-905\n$\n265\n$\n456\nAdd back or deduct:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n370\n(Gain) loss on asset disposals, net\n20\n1\n17\n(Gain) loss on sale of business and other exit costs, net\n–\n–\n(1)\n(Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net\n(10)\n(7)\n(22)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (2)\n$\n765-915\n$\n259\n$\n820\nDeduct:\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\n130\n38\n137\nInterest and dividend income\n10\n4\n8\nOther, net\n–\n(1)\n–\nAdjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) (2)(3)\n$\n625-775\n$\n218\n$\n675\nNote: Totals may not foot due to rounding differences.\n(1)\nAs of January 1, 2018, U.S. Cellular adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, using a modified retrospective approach. Under this method, the new accounting standard is applied only to the most recent period presented. As a result, 2018 amounts include the impacts of ASC 606, but 2017 amounts remain as previously reported.\n(2)\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. U.S. Cellular does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation above are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to Net income are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of U.S. Cellular's operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of U.S. Cellular's financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, and gains and losses, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The table above reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measure, Net income or Income (loss) before income taxes.\n(3)\nA reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) to Operating income (GAAP) for March 31, 2018, actual results can be found on U.S. Cellular's website at investors.uscellular.com .\nConference Call Information\nU.S. Cellular will hold a conference call on May 1, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.\nAccess the live call on the Events & Presentations page of investors.uscellular.com or at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1145/25623 .

Under this method, the new accounting standard is applied only to the most recent period presented. As a result, 2018 amounts include the impacts of ASC 606, but 2017 amounts remain as previously reported.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-cellular-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300639994.html\nSOURCE United States Cellular Corporation",
