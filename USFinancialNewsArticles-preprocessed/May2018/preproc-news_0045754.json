    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 1:02 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Six years after teddy bear row, Belarus revives ties with Sweden Andrei Makhovsky 2 Min Read\nMINSK (Reuters) - Belarus appointed an ambassador to Stockholm on Tuesday, ending a six-year-old diplomatic spat over a pro-democracy stunt that saw hundreds of teddy bears airdropped by a Swedish public relations firm over the former Soviet republic.

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo\nIn 2012, Minsk recalled its envoy to Sweden and expelled Sweden’s ambassador after the toy bears were dropped over Belarussian territory, each carrying a message urging the authoritarian country to show greater respect for human rights.\nSince then, President Alexander Lukashenko has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency towards political opposition, seeking to improve ties with the European Union and lessen Belarus’s dependence on neighboring Russia.\n“We have an unjustifiably low level of relations with Scandinavian countries,” Lukashenko’s press service quoted him as saying as he appointed new ambassador Dmitry Mironchik.
