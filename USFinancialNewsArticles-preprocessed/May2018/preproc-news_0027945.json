Bureau Coordinating Producer Published 11:31 AM ET Tue, 1 May 2018 Updated 10:06 AM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 CNBC.com Adam Jeffery | CNBC\nKaren James Sloan is a Coordinating Producer for CNBC in the Washington D.C. Bureau. She currently works with correspondent Ylan Mui, covering tax reform, immigration and other business-related legislative policies on Capitol Hill. Working as a team, Karen and Ylan have brought up-to-the-minute details on Congress' challenge to reform the U.S. tax system, covered Congress' role in shaping President Trump's new immigration agenda and, most recently, did an extensive special report on how cryptocurrency is fueling the nation's devastating opioid epidemic. Karen has also contributed several articles to CNBC.com, ranging from flight restrictions over Mar-A-Lago to the crab pickers shortage in Maryland , tight labor market in Ohio because of the opioid crisis and the effects of immigration policy on a DACA recipient working at a publicly traded pharmaceutical company.\nKaren has also worked as a producer for John Harwood , who once held the title of CNBC's Chief Washington Correspondent. Together, they collaborated on several presidential campaigns and mid-term elections to help shape the network's coverage of the races. However, the most rewarding opportunity in Karen's career, so far, has been producing three network quality interviews with former President Barack Obama.\nBefore joining CNBC, Karen did a stint in local news, working at three local TV stations around the country. First, she worked in Orlando at WCPX-TV as a Satellite Coordinator and writer and then she worked in Chicago at NBC's WMAQ-TV as a Satellite Coordinating New Producer. Karen's last local news station was Baltimore's WBAL-TV, where she produced several news programs and also developed stories for their website.\nKaren began her career in New York City, where she produced promotions for the Fox affiliate TV show Good Day New York , then moved on to CBS This Morning , where she worked various shifts to support the production staff of the morning news program.\nKaren is a graduate of St. John's University and a member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Incorporated.\nFollow Karen James on Twitter @ Kj_Sloan and LinkedIn karenjamessloan .
