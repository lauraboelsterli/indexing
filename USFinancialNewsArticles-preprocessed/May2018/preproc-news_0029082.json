    "text": "12 COMMENTS Let me front-load the bad news: The United States, which invented the automobile, the personal computer and the Cronut, somehow failed to qualify for the World Cup soccer tournament for the first time since 1986. This ghastly misstep would be a national humiliation in most countries, but with everything else that is currently unspooling in the U.S., it will probably not be noticed by 80% of Americans until the day the tournament kicks off next month. Oh, and it will take place in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\nNone of that is a reason to skip this spectacle of 64 games in 31 days, which engulfs much of the planet like an extended eclipse. The multi-layered narrative of elite athletic achievement, fused with the foreign-affairs dimension of international rivals doing battle, creates an intoxicating soap opera that can unite the world in savoring every goal, tackle and ill-judged neck tattoo.\nHere are 8 things I cannot wait to witness:\n1. The Portuguese LeBron James vs. the Argentinian Stephen Curry\nFriends and rivals Lionel Messi of Argentina (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, seen in a rare 2014 matchup of their national teams, each seek a World Cup trophy to help lay claim to being the greatest player ever. Photo: ZUMA Press Soccer’s two greatest players present a clash of styles not unlike the biggest rivals in the NBA. Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal is a man most comfortable flexing after single-handedly smiting his foes, with jersey off and eight-pack out, in a celebration that is less a spontaneous outburst of joy than a validatory testament to his own magnificence. The 5’6’’ Lionel Messi of Argentina has the scruffy, unassuming demeanor of a video game store clerk, yet he is able to accelerate into slivers of space with such velocity that only pairs of smoking football boots are left where defenders once were. If either player leads his team to glory, it could settle the “greatest” debate once and for all.\n2. The most regal Egyptian since Ramses II\nThe game’s breakout star is the young Egyptian Mohamed Salah, a wing-footed goal-scorer for Liverpool’s Premier League team who combines the joyous countenance of a Care Bear with the clinical demeanor of a gunslinger from “Westworld.” His popularity has been supercharged by his public displays of Muslim faith on the field, transcending the sport and establishing him as an icon in the Middle East, as well as in Liverpool, where chanting fans have pledged to convert to Islam in return for goals.\n3. Spoiler alert: One of these three teams will probably win the whole thing.\nWhere there is a World Cup there is always Germany, Spain and Brazil. The Germans, forever determined, organized and prepared, are reigning champions—the Walmart of global football. As an Englishman, watching them buzzsaw their way deep into every tournament is akin to watching Darth Vader charge around the field in cleats.\n‘ Brazil always arrives at a World Cup with expectations based on an endless production line of mono-named heroes: Pelé! Socrates! Ronaldo! ’\nSpain will attempt to win in its singular style by preventing opponents from ever touching the ball. The team’s tiny midfielders, some of whom will be making their final World Cup appearances, compensate for their lack of stature with a whirling precision that means adversaries can only hope to chase shadows.\nBrazil always arrives at a World Cup with expectations based on an endless production line of mono-named heroes: Pelé! Socrates! Ronaldo! Now led by an attacking phenomenon who lives life like a manga cartoon action hero made real—Neymar!—they still carry a septic scar from a 7-1 beatdown by Germany at the last World Cup, a haunting memory that may now make them lethal.\n4. The 12th seed who will shock a fifth seed\nFans of Iceland channeled Viking origins during a World Cup qualifying match last September. Photo: JUSSI NUKARI/Getty Images Many national teams are flung together for the World Cup with little time to practice, and some of the biggest stars lack motivation—after all, there are only so many Lamborghini Veneno Roadsters they can buy. So smaller teams with true collective spirit and a game plan, such as Senegal or Korea, can go deep. Iceland, fresh off its Norse-mythology-worthy result at the last big competition, Euro 2016, is the smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup. Their coach until recently was a part-time dentist, but many of the players truly believe Viking blood runs through their veins, and they all think they can win.\n5. America’s Team?\nOne side effect of the U.S. team’s failure is that it has left the American market wide open to arch-rival Mexico—a phenomenon no wall could prevent. In the U.S., the Mexican squad draws larger television ratings and attracts more fans to live games. Analysts have had to confront how much U.S. soccer can learn from its NAFTA counterpart in terms of scouting and youth development, but the Mexicans still have to snap a curse of six consecutive exits in the Round of 16.\n6. “We used to have an Empire.”\nThe English invented the game and have often regarded victory as their right and destiny, a swagger bolstered by being home to the Premier League, where many of the world’s best players (few of whom are English) ply their trade. A jingoistic tabloid media fuels this sense of entitlement, whipping up overblown expectations among the fans, many of whom approach the World Cup with all the confidence of Charlie Brown running to kick the football in Lucy’s hold. A self-sabotaging doom is guaranteed.\nMore Essays\nMalaysia’s Big Win for Democracy May 11, 2018 Why You Should Watch the World Cup May 11, 2018 Soy, Almond, Pea or Oat? The Reinvention of Milk May 11, 2018 After 50 Years, a Pope’s Birth-Control Message Still Divides Catholics May 10, 2018 7. War and Peace\nThe fact that all of this is going to go down in rogue-state Russia promises to add a simmering menace to the proceedings. Vladimir Putin, known for his love of ice hockey, judo and shirtless horseback riding, may not be much of a soccer fan, but he is overseeing his nation’s frantic efforts to welcome the world, hoping the tournament is as great a propaganda boon for him as it was for Mussolini in 1934 and the Argentine military junta in 1978. Both England and Iceland have announced that their political leaders will not attend, and Sweden, Denmark, Australia and Japan are mulling things over. After pre-tournament crackdowns on dissidents across the country, Garry Kasparov tweeted a joke currently making the rounds in Russia about kids visiting the World Cup: “Tell them if they get lost just to shout ‘Putin dictator!’ and the police will find them immediately!”\n8. America can still triumph.\nI have no doubt that Americans will be tuning in en masse. Block out time in your daily planner now. Prepare to take off from work, form rowdy groups and head to the local bar. And never, ever give up on your dreams of ultimate American glory. After all, if Russia could influence the 2016 U.S. election, I have to believe the United States can still find a way to win the 2018 Russia World Cup.\n—Mr. Bennett’s new book, “Encyclopedia Blazertannica: A Suboptimal Guide to Soccer, America’s ‘Sport of the Future’ since 1972” (written with Michael Davies), will be published on May 15 by Knopf.",
