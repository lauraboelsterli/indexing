FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley v Brighton & Hove Albion - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - April 28, 2018 Burnley manager Sean Dyche REUTERS/Andrew Yates\nBurnley, seventh in the table on 54 points, are virtually assured of a Europa League spot place next season, as they are six points and 15 goals better off than eighth-placed Everton with two games to play.\nDyche’s team have managed to punch above their weight largely due to their manager’s practical approach, which relies on defensive solidity and teamwork rather than individual skill.\n“Stick to the basics of what we do whilst looking at the challenge that is likely to present itself... there are certain things... timings, planning of a different sort but we try not to go for radical change,” Dyche told reporters.\n“You have got to be careful I think to not change everything because it can be for the wrong reasons.”\nBurnley will embark on a European sojourn for the first time since their 1966-67 appearance in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but the manager is unlikely to spend big on players to help the team fight on an additional front.\nRather, Dyche is determined to continue building gradually, and the manager is already making his plans for next season.\n“We try look at how we are moving forward, how we are adapting, are we changing things for the right reasons,” he added. “We are still not there yet... we will see, but we have got some idea on where we are going.”\nBurnley travel to sixth-placed Arsenal in the league on Sunday but will be without defender Ben Mee who has returned to training after a shin injury but is not ready for action.
