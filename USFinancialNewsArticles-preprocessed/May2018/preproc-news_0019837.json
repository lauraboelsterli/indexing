    "text": "TULSA, Okla., May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Samson Resources II, LLC (\"Samson\") announced today that it has executed an agreement to divest a portion of its position in Converse County, WY to an undisclosed buyer in exchange for cash consideration of $44.4 million and the receipt by Samson of 15,000 net acres (all subject to customary adjustments). The acreage to be received by Samson under the transaction will include all depths below the Fort Union formation, is currently undedicated and will bolt-on to Samson's core acreage position in Johnson County, WY.\nIn exchange, Samson has agreed to sell approximately 7,000 net acres, Samson's interests in 17 wells and overriding royalty interests.

After closing, Samson will own rights to more than 152,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin.\nJoseph Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer of Samson, commented, \"This sale represents another important step in Samson's portfolio management strategy of divesting non-core assets and increasing focus on our core assets in the Powder River and Green River Basins of Wyoming. The proceeds of this sale will be used to partially fund our 2018 drilling program and allow us to further capitalize on our robust drilling opportunities.\" Mills further stated, \"Samson continues to execute on its plan to deliver shareholder value with a lower risk growth strategy while remaining focused on balance sheet strength.\"\nSamson is a privately held onshore exploration and production company headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn this press release, all statements that are not purely historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
