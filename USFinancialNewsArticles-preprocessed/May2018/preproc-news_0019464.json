    "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s High Court has ruled an 11th lawmaker must leave parliament after discovering she was a dual national, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Wednesday, the latest casualty in a widening citizenship crisis.\nThe court found that opposition Senator Katy Gallagher was a British citizen at the time of her election, despite her attempts to renounce it, and ineligible for office, the ABC said.\nDual citizens are ineligible for elected office under Australia’s 117-year-old constitution and the decision is likely to render three other lawmakers in similar predicaments ineligible as well.\nThe three are not members of Australia’s ruling centre-right coalition, keeping its slender majority safe, but the resulting by-elections would be a litmus test of the public’s mood and the government’s popularity ahead of an election due next year.\nAdherence to the dual-citizenship rule, in a country where more than half the population of 24 million were either themselves, or have a parent, born overseas, came under the spotlight last year, with the High Court adopting a strict interpretation of the law.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ",
