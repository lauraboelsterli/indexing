(Nasdaq:MELI) ( http://www.mercadolibre.com ), Latin America's leading e-commerce technology company, today reported first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nPedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, “We are as excited as we have ever been about growing our businesses. We will continue to drive the success of our company through building on our market position as a leading innovator in Latin America, and leveraging our regional breadth, trusted brand, and increasing installed base of engaged users. Going forward, executing on our business plan will continue to be our first order of priority. We will strive to maintain ourselves as a leading ecommerce and payments platforms in the region, while delivering a sustainable financial model that finds the right balance between earnings and investing in innovation to deliver benefits for our users. By following this path, we believe that we will deliver long-term shareholder value through an increasingly attractive business model.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Highlights\nGross merchandise volume surpassed the $3 billion mark, reaching $3,126.4 million, a 34.0% year-over-year increase in USD, and a 42.7% year-over-year increase on an FX neutral basis. Items sold increased for the second consecutive quarter to 80.1 million, a 50.6% year-over-year increase, delivering one of the fastest rates of unit volume growth in the last five years. Unique buyers increased 28.0% year-over-year, driven primarily by Brazil and Mexico. Colombia and Chile also delivered excellent performance, increasing unique buyers both sequentially and year-over-year. Live listings offered on Mercado Libre’s marketplace grew to 127.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 50% year-over-year increase, representing the third time the Company exceeded the 100 million mark. Mobile GMV penetration grew 13.0% year-over-year to 54%, representing the first time the Company has surpassed 50% growth in terms of representation of total GMV. Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos reached 52.5 million, a 92.4% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by investments in free shipping, our loyalty program, MercadoPuntos and customer acquisition. Mexico was one of the highlights of the quarter, with items shipped growing 183% year-over-year. Total payment volume through MercadoPago increased to $4,175.3 million, a year-over-year increase of 60.5% in USD and 81.7% on an FX neutral basis. Total payment transactions increased 68.5% year-over-year, ending the quarter with 74.3 million. Merchant services continues to represent one of the fastest growing non-marketplace business units. On a consolidated basis, off-platform total payment volume grew 127.1% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Mobile-point-of-sale devices sold in Brazil grew by a factor of 10 year-over-year, while mPos TPV already represented 52% of the off platform total payment volume.\nAdoption of ASC 606\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers related to revenue recognition (“ASC 606”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective transition method and has accordingly revised its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, and applicable interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2017, as if ASC 606 had been effective for those periods. Because the Company did not offer free shipping in 2016, net revenue for that year does not need to be recast. As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company must present net revenue net of amounts paid in connection with the Company’s free shipping initiative rather than including these amounts in the cost of net sales, as previously recorded. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 the Company incurred $112.5 million of shipping subsidies that have been netted from revenues. As a result of adopting ASC 606, our net revenues for the periods indicated below have been recast as presented below. Our adoption of 606 does not affect our operating or net income/loss.\nIn millions\nQ1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 As reported $ 273.9 $ 316.5 $ 370.7 $ 437.0 In millions\nQ1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Adjustments (Decrease) $ (4.3 ) $ (32.6 ) $ (65.7 ) $ (78.9 ) In millions\nAs\nreported\n(in\nmillions)\nQ1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 As recast $ 269.7 $ 283.9 $ 304.9 $ 358.1 $ 321.0 The tables below present our gross billing and amounts paid by us in connection with our free shipping service.\nGross billing (1) (in millions) Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Brazil $ 159.8 $ 180.0 $ 229.5 $ 262.1 $ 276.3 Argentina 71.4 88.0 91.3 108.7 106.1 Mexico 15.5 20.2 22.6 28.2 29.4 Venezuela 14.4 14.2 9.8 16.0 — Others 12.8 14.1 17.5 22.0 21.7 Total $ 273.9 $ 316.5 $ 370.7 $ 437.0 $ 433.5 Free shipping paid by Mercado Libre (2) (in millions) Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Brazil — $ (22.9 ) $ (52.9 ) $ (64.8 ) $ (92.1 ) Argentina — — — — (4.1 ) Mexico (4.2 ) (9.4 ) (11.1 ) (10.4 ) (12.3 ) Venezuela — — — — — Others (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (1.7 ) (3.7 ) (3.9 ) Total $ (4.3 ) $ (32.6 ) $ (65.7 ) $ (78.9 ) $ (112.5 ) Net revenues as recast (in millions) Net\nrevenues as\nreported (in\nmillions) Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Brazil $ 159.8 $ 157.2 $ 176.6 $ 197.3 $ 184.2 Argentina 71.4 88.0 91.3 108.7 101.9 Mexico 11.3 10.8 11.5 17.7 17.1 Venezuela 14.4 14.2 9.8 16.0 — Others 12.8 13.8 15.8 18.4 17.8 Total $ 269.7 $ 283.9 $ 304.9 $ 358.1 $ 321.0\nGross billing growth Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Brazil 106.1 % 75.0 % 75.2 % 82.5 % 72.9 % Argentina 48.1 % 30.0 % 30.5 % 42.3 % 48.6 % Mexico 39.8 % 76.3 % 91.4 % 135.5 % 89.2 % Venezuela 18.9 % 90.1 % 41.6 % 49.0 % — Others 47.8 % 39.1 % 56.9 % 61.9 % 69.6 % (1) Total accrued fees, commissions, interest, and other sales received from users\n(2) Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, this amount was presented as a component of cost of net revenues.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet revenues for the first quarter grew to $321.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.0% in USD and 30.1% on an FX neutral basis, after adoption of ASC 606. Enhanced marketplace revenues decreased 20.9% year-over-year in USD, and 18.6% on an FX neutral basis, while non-marketplace revenues increased 96.5% year-over-year in USD and 143.5% on an FX neutral basis. Gross profit was $162.8 million with a margin of 50.7%, compared to negative 3.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Most of the gross margin compression is attributed to an increase in free shipping subsidies. Total operating expenses were $192.2 million, up 82.1% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 59.9%, as compared to 39.1% during the first quarter of 2017. Loss from operations was $29.4 million, down 146.5% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenues, loss from operations was 9.2%, as compared to 23.5% during the first quarter of 2017. Interest income was $9.2 million, a 24.4% decrease year-over-year as a result of lower interest rates in Brazil as well as lower float and interest rates in Argentina. The company incurred $10.7 million in financial expenses in the first quarter of 2018. Net loss before taxes was $25.4 million, down 136.4% year-over-year. Income tax expense was $12.4 million during the first quarter, yielding a blended tax rate for the period of 49.1%.

in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures as non-GAAP measure.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables included in this quarterly report.\nThe Company believes that reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe this non-GAAP measure provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.\nThe FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2017 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2018, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, this measure does not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.\nThe following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018:\nThree-month Periods Ended\nMarch 31, (*) As reported FX Neutral Measures (In millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 Percentage\nChange 2018 2017 Percentage\nChange (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net revenues $ 321.0 $ 269.7 19.0 % $ 350.8 $ 269.7 30.1 % Cost of net revenues (158.2 ) (100.8 ) 56.9 % (170.2 ) (100.8 ) 68.8 % Gross profit 162.8 168.9 -3.6 % 180.6 168.9 6.9 % Operating expenses (192.2 ) (105.5 ) 82.1 % (212.7 ) (105.5 ) 101.5 % Loss / Income from operations (29.4 ) 63.3 -146.5 % (32.2 ) 63.3 -150.8 % (*) The table above may not total due to rounding.\nCONTACT: MercadoLibre, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\ninvestor@mercadolibre.com\nhttp://investor.mercadolibre.com\nSource:MercadoLibre, Inc.",
