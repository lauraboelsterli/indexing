FILE PHOTO: Britain Tennis - Great Britain v Argentina - Davis Cup Semi Final - Emirates Arena, Glasgow, Scotland - 15/9/16 Argentina's Juan Martin del Porto during a press conference Action Images via Reuters / Andrew Boyers Livepic EDITORIAL USE ONLY\nDel Porto was forced to pull out of the Italian Open in Rome on Thursday after feeling a pain in his left groin. At the time, the 2009 U.S. Open champion was 2-6 5-4 down in his last 16 encounter to Belgian David Goffin.\n“After the medical examinations today, it has been determined that I have suffered a groin strain (grade 1) in Rome,” the 29-year-old Del Potro said on his verified Twitter account.\n“I have started to do rehab and will evaluate the situation in the upcoming days to decide whether I can play the French Open.”\nThe injury comes at a bad time for Del Potro, who has started the season well with tournament wins in Acapulco and Indian Wells. The French Open starts on May 27 in Paris. Reporting by Ramiro Scandalo; Writing by Andrew Downie; Editing by John O'Brien",
