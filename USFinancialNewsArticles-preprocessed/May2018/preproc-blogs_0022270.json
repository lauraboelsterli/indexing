    "text": "By Ellen McGirt Updated: May 9, 2018 11:48 AM ET\nLast week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus visited Silicon Valley, their third such visit since the CBC Tech 2020 , a taskforce aiming to increase African American representation in tech, was launched in 2015.\nCBC members Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), visited Airbnb, Apple , Lyft, PayPal, Square, and Twitter, as well as some non-profit programs seeking to address the so-called “pipeline problem.”\nIn light of the sector’s ongoing problems with privacy and safety, the delegation seemed prepared to do business.\n“This time, we met with a lot of the workforce that works on diversity and inclusion and learned that the majority of them have been hired within just the last two years,” Lee told The Verge . “That tells me that they haven’t really thought about racial inclusion until we started really focusing on this.”\nWaters was her usual direct self. “Floored” to discover that many tech companies had barely 2% black employees, she threatened legislative action. “I’m talking about using the power that our voters have given us to produce legislation and to talk about regulation in these industries that have not been talked about before,” she said. “I’m not urging, I’m not encouraging. I’m about to hit some people across the head with a hammer,” she said at a panel discussion at Lyft .\nBärí A. Williams , a legal and operations executive and StubHub and Facebook alum, suggests that the CBC should look beyond the dismal representation numbers, and ask probing questions about how employees from underrepresented groups are faring in their careers in big tech. Here’s one clue: According to a 2017 report by Recode , black and Latino employees hold only somewhere between 4 percent and 10 percent of leadership roles at seven major tech firms.\nWith this in mind, when concerned lawmakers scrutinize diversity at tech companies, they should look beyond the raw numbers to ask questions like: Do minorities typically have to have more accomplishments than their peers to be promoted? Do the companies enforce consistent expectations for each role? Are metrics for success clear and communicated? Are all employees given equal opportunities to achieve the goals that are required for promotion to leadership roles? Is there a concrete plan to increase diversity in leadership? All of these things make it more likely that members of underrepresented groups will be treated and promoted fairly — and that they will also be in positions to help shape its culture and its priorities.\nThere are a couple of indications the CBC is up to the task, at least in terms of raising some key issues. (What can be accomplished in Congress these days is anybody’s guess).\nFirst, the delegation came with a new demand: Companies should help fund affordable housing to mitigate the damage that “gentrification” does to the under-resourced community members they’re trying to teach to code.\nAnd they’re clearly prepared.\nWhen given an opportunity to interview Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during his recent Congressional testimony on user data and privacy issues, Rep. Butterfield showed that he spoke D&I. He took his allotted time to ask about board diversity, and if the company would publish retention numbers disaggregated by race. He then took Zuckerberg to task for his all-white leadership team. Where are his trusted leaders of color?\n“Not only you and Sheryl [Sandburg], but David [Wehner], Mike [Schroepfer] and Chris [Cox],” he said, waving a printout of their bios. “This does not represent America,” he said. On Point Intel Capital exceeds its goal for investing in companies founded by underrepresented minorities Intel shared a lot of updates from their Intel Capital Global Summit yesterday, some of which will be welcome news to the raceAhead crowd. First, they announced that they were two and a half years ahead of their 2015 goal to invest $125 million in startups run by women, entrepreneurs with disabilities, people of color, LGBTQ and military veterans. These investments now make up more than 10% of their portfolio. Also check out the new “Champion of Change” strategy, an alliance to advance gender equality in tech. Yes, it’s an alliance about allies! Check out Male Champions of Change Institute , accelerateHER , and EQUALS for more. Intel The president of Nordstrom Rack flew to St. Louis to apologize to three black men falsely accused of theft Geevy Thomas, the chain’s president, met with the three men yesterday. Mekhi Lee, Dirone Taylor, and Eric Rogers II were shopping for prom clothes at the company’s Brentwood Square store when they were harassed by a customer , followed by employees, and then later detained by the police and accused of shoplifting. Twyla Lee, Mekhi’s mother, said the meeting went well. “We just listened to Nordstrom about what they said they were going to do about (training) in their store … and (Mekhi) told them how he felt from the encounter,” she said. The local NAACP leadership has asked Nordstrom Rack to support programs that help educators in the St. Louis area. Saint Louis Today Ford has created a smart window that lets blind passengers “feel” the landscape The “Feel the View” smart window uses a new “haptic visual language,” that captures surrounding images and translates them into vibrations on a display that a visually-impaired passenger can touch to better imagine the world outside. The display was created by Ford of Italy working collaboratively with creative agency GTB Roma and other local start-ups. The company hopes the technology will reach a wider audience. “An innovation that today is designed to use in a car, but that tomorrow could be implemented in schools and institutions for blind people as a tool that could be used in multiple ways,” says executive creative director of GTB Rome Federico Russo. Deezen Commentary: The transgender military ban is bad for national security This column, written by a pseudonymous active duty officer of the CIA, starts with language from a declassified CIA memo from 1980, saying that spotting “a homo” was as challenging and necessary as spotting Communists, and that they “accept [their] psychological deviation from the normal.” But when she came out as transgender in the 2000s, it seemed that the worst bigotry had passed. Now, given the Department of Defense’s recent defense of the transgender ban, the bad old days are back. She makes an exhaustive case for the contributions of LGBT military service members and the expense and folly of the transgender ban. “Discrimination is a reappearing luxury in our history,” she writes. “In times of crisis we enlisted women, African-Americans, and LGBT Americans only to excise them when the emergency passed.”",
