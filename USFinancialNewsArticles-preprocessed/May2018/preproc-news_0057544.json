Oman News Agency/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY Cyclone Mekunu hit southern Yemen and the coast of neighboring Oman over the weekend, leaving several dead and others missing.\nThe company said its preliminary assessment is that the impact is not expected to be material, however the “total impact of the cyclone on plant operations cannot yet be precisely assessed at this point in time.”\nSembcorp Salalah is 40 percent owned by a subsidiary of Sembcorp Industries ( SCIL.SI ) and 13 percent owned by Oman Investment Corp, according to its website.\nOther Muscat-listed companies such as Dhofar Poultry Co DPCI.OM have also announced some losses from the cyclone.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ",
