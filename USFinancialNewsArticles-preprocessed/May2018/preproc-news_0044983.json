    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italian President Sergio Mattarella has summoned the leaders of the lower and upper houses of parliament for a meeting on Tuesday, his office said in a brief statement on Monday.\nMattarella met earlier in the day with the leaders of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League, who are seeking to put together a coalition government and who proposed a little-known law professor, Giuseppe Conte, as prime minister.\nThe president appoints prime ministers in Italy and it was not clear if he would accept Conteâ€™s nomination. Some Italian newspapers have speculated that Mattarella wanted a more high-profile figure to lead the government.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer\n ",
