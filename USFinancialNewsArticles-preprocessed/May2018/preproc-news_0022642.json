The Company has provided a supplemental financial presentation summarizing the adoption of ASC 606 (and on an ASC 605 basis) located on its Investor Relations website at http://investors.cornerstoneondemand.com . All numbers below are presented on an ASC 606 basis unless otherwise stated. Note that the United States dollar (USD) strengthened against the British pound (GBP) and Euro (EUR) since the Company’s previous full year 2018 guidance was issued on February 13, 2018. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2018, the Company provides the following outlook:\nRevenue between $127.0 million and $129.0 million, representing year-over-year growth at the mid-point of 10% 3 , or 8% 4 on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth at the mid-point on an ASC 605 basis was 10% 3 , or 8% 4 on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue between $111.0 million and $113.0 million, representing year-over-year growth at the mid-point of 16% 3 , or 14% 4 on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue growth at the mid-point on an ASC 605 basis was 17% 3 , or 15% 4 on a constant currency basis.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company provides the following outlook:\nRevenue between $503.0 million and $511.0 million, representing year-over-year growth at the mid-point of 5% 5 , or 3% 6 on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth at the mid-point on an ASC 605 basis was 5% 5 , or 3% 6 on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue between $453.0 million and $461.0 million, representing year-over-year growth at the mid-point of 15% 5 , or 13% 6 on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue growth at the mid-point on an ASC 605 basis was 17% 5 , or 15% 6 on a constant currency basis. Annual recurring revenue as of December 31, 2018 between $477.0 million and $495.0 million. 5, 7 Non-GAAP operating income between $54.0 million and $62.0 million. Assuming the midpoint of the revenue range, this represents an operating margin of 11%. Unlevered free cash flow between $52.0 million and $60.0 million. Assuming the midpoint of the revenue range, this represents an unlevered free cash flow margin of 11%.\nThe Company has not reconciled the guidance for non-GAAP operating income or non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measures because it does not provide guidance for such GAAP measures and would not be able to present the reconciling items between such GAAP and non-GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. For non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, the Company excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is impacted by factors that are outside of the Company’s control and can be difficult to predict. The actual amount of stock-based compensation expense in the second quarter ending June 30, 2018 and the year ending December 31, 2018 will have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP operating margin.\n1\nFinancial measures presented on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted net income per share, unlevered free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the discussion in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliations at the end of this press release. 2\nIncludes contracted clients and active users of our enterprise human capital management platform and excludes clients and users of our Cornerstone for Salesforce and PiiQ, formerly known as Cornerstone Growth Edition, products.

These non-GAAP financial measures include (i) non-GAAP cost of revenue, which is defined as cost of revenue less amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, (ii) annual recurring revenue, which is defined as the annualized recurring value of all active contracts at the end of a reporting period, (iii) free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software costs, (iv) free cash flow margin, which is defined as free cash flow divided by revenue, (v) unlevered free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and capitalized software costs plus cash paid for interest, (vi) unlevered free cash flow margin, which is defined as unlevered free cash flow divided by revenue, (vii) non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, which exclude, for the periods in which they are presented, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, accretion of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs, unrealized fair value adjustment on strategic investment, and excludes the impacts of unamortized stock-based compensation expense in applying the treasury method for determining the non-GAAP weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding, (viii) non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin, which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets reflected in cost of revenue, (ix) non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income margin, which are defined as loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, (x) non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, and (xi) non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP general and administrative expense, each of which excludes stock-based compensation attributable to the corresponding GAAP financial measures. In addition, the Company provides investors with non-GAAP financial measures under ASC 605 to compare against the Company’s GAAP financial measures under ASC 606 and discloses revenue on a constant currency basis. To present amounts on a constant currency basis, current period results for entities reporting in functional currencies other than the United States dollar are translated into the United States dollar at the prior period exchange rates as opposed to the actual exchange rates in effect for the current period. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in the same industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand the operational performance of their businesses. In addition, the Company believes that the following non-GAAP adjustments are useful to management and investors for the following reasons:\nStock-based compensation. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature, and management believes that its exclusion provides additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and also provides a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and its peer companies. Additionally, determining the fair value of certain stock-based awards involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of such awards. Amortization of intangible assets. The Company excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because the expense is a non-cash item and management believes that its exclusion provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operational performance and allows for a useful comparison of its operating results to prior periods and its peer companies. Accretion of debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. Under GAAP, the Company is required to separately account for liability and equity components of the senior convertible notes that were issued in June 2013. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes, the Company is required to recognize the effective interest expense on its senior convertible notes and amortize the issuance costs over the term of the notes. The difference between the effective interest expense and the contractual interest expense, and the amortization expense of issuance costs are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that these non-cash expenses are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. In addition, the exclusion of these items provides a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and its peer companies. Fair value adjustment on strategic investments. The Company views the increase or decrease in fair value of its strategic investments as not indicative of operational performance during any particular period and believes that the exclusion of these gains or losses provides investors with a supplemental view of the Company’s operational performance. Restructuring. The Company excludes costs related to restructuring because the expense is not indicative of its continuing operations and believes that the exclusion of these costs provides investors with a supplemental view of the Company’s operational performance. Write-off of capitalized software. The Company views the write-off of capitalized software as not indicative of operational performance during any particular period and believes that the exclusion of this expense provides investors with a supplemental view of the Company’s operational performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. For prior periods, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the tables included as part of this press release.\nCornerstone OnDemand, Inc.
