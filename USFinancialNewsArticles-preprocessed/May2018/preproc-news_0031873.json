    "text": "EditorsNote: edit 1: Adds first reference to Benintendi\nSean Manaea didn’t have no-hit stuff this time around against the Boston Red Sox, but he pitched well enough to lead the Oakland Athletics to another victory Monday night.\nManaea gave up four runs (three earned) while striking out four over six innings to help visiting Oakland snap a two-game skid with a 6-5 win against Boston in the opener of a three-game series.\nManaea (5-4) pitched the first no-hitter against the Red Sox in 25 years in his last start against them at home on April 21, striking out 10 batters in a 3-0 victory. Oakland won two of three games in the series.\nMatt Joyce (2-for-4), Matt Olson (2-for-4) and Khris Davis (2-for-4) each slugged solo homers, Jonathan Lucroy drove in two runs and Dustin Fowler had an RBI. The Athletics had dropped five of their previous six games.\nHanley Ramirez had a pair of RBIs and both J.D. Martinez (2-for-4) and Rafael Devers added solo home runs for the Red Sox, who had their two-game winning streak snapped.\nBoston starter Rick Porcello (5-1) allowed five runs on nine hits and no walks over six innings. He struck out five.\nJoyce’s solo homer of approximately 416 feet to right field in the third inning put Oakland ahead 1-0.\nBoston answered with two runs in the bottom of the third. Andrew Benintendi’s infield single tied the game, and Ramirez followed with an RBI single.\nLucroy put the A’s back in control with his two-run single in the fourth. Fowler proceeded to knock a standup RBI triple to make it 4-2.\nRamirez made it a one-run game with an RBI on his fielder’s choice grounder in the fifth, but Olson clocked a solo blast an estimated 418 feet to right in the sixth to give Oakland a 5-3 advantage.\nDevers clubbed an estimated 373-foot solo blast over the Green Monster in left to bring Boston within a run in the seventh.\nDavis smacked his team-leading 12th homer in the eighth to make it 6-4.\nMartinez’s solo blast into the Red Sox’s bullpen in the bottom of the inning again made it a one-run game.\nOakland closer Blake Treinen pitched a perfect ninth for his seventh save.\nBefore the game, Boston added pitcher Steven Wright to the major league roster and placed pitcher Hector Velazquez (lower back strain) on the 10-day disabled list. Wright had been serving a 15-game suspension for violating MLB’s domestic-abuse policy.\nOakland right-hander Daniel Mengden (2-4, 4.06 ERA) opposes Boston lefty Eduardo Rodriguez (3-0, 4.58) on Tuesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
