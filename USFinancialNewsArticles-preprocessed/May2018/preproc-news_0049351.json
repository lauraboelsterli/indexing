    "text": "BRUSSELS, May 24 (Reuters) - The European Commission will assess the new Italian government, now being formed by Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte, on the basis of its actions rather than words, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said on Thursday.\n“We assess governments based on their actions, not on their words,” Schinas told a regular daily news briefing.\nEuro zone governments and financial markets have been alarmed at the impending arrival of a new coalition in Rome under Conte comprising two eurosceptic, anti-establishment parties, who won votes in a March election by calling for an easing of euro zone budget discipline and public debt rules.
