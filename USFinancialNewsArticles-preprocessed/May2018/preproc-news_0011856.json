GAAP Income/(loss) before taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $71.7 million compared to $18.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The results for the first quarter of 2018 reflect higher net interest income on our portfolio of loans and higher net rental income on our real estate investments, higher gains on sale of loans and real estate than in the prior year, and a favorable net result from derivative positions. Diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.53 compared to $0.18 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. After-tax GAAP return on average equity was 16.0% in the first quarter of 2018.\nCore Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $63.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $31.6 million earned in the first quarter of 2017. The results of the first quarter of 2018 reflect higher net interest income on our portfolio of loans and higher net rental income on our real estate investments, as well as higher gains on sale of loans and real estate than in the prior year. We believe core earnings, which adjusts GAAP income before taxes for certain non-cash expenses, unrecognized derivative results, and the economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized for GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred, is useful in evaluating our earnings from operations across reporting periods. Core EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $0.55 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.31 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe following table summarizes the book value of our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated below ($ in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Loans Balance sheet loans: Balance sheet first mortgage loans $ 3,370,086 54.1 % $ 3,123,268 51.9 % Other commercial real estate-related loans 158,099 2.5 % 159,194 2.6 % Provision for loan losses (7,000 ) (0.1 )% (4,000 ) (0.1 )% Total balance sheet loans 3,521,185 56.5 % 3,278,462 54.4 % Conduit first mortgage loans 273,636 4.4 % 230,180 3.8 % Total loans 3,794,821 60.9 % 3,508,642 58.2 % Securities CMBS investments 1,061,318 17.0 % 1,066,570 17.7 % U.S. Agency Securities investments 38,787 0.6 % 39,947 0.7 % Total securities 1,100,105 17.6 % 1,106,517 18.4 % Real Estate Real estate and related lease intangibles, net 980,859 15.7 % 1,032,041 17.1 % Total real estate 980,859 15.7 % 1,032,041 17.1 % Other Investments Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 34,564 0.6 % 35,441 0.6 % FHLB stock 77,915 1.3 % 77,915 1.3 % Total other investments 112,479 1.9 % 113,356 1.9 % Total investments 5,988,264 96.1 % 5,760,556 95.6 % Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 113,160 1.8 % 182,683 3.0 % Other assets 129,870 2.1 % 82,376 1.4 % Total assets $ 6,231,294 100.0 % $ 6,025,615 100.0 % Note: CMBS investments and U.S. Agency Securities are carried at fair value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our debt obligations as of the following dates ($ in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Committed loan repurchase facilities $ 550,523 $ 398,653 Committed securities repurchase facility 98,762 —\nUncommitted securities repurchase facilities 105,092 74,757 Total repurchase facilities 754,377 473,410 Revolving credit facility\n—\n—\nMortgage loan financing 683,487 692,696 CLO debt(1) 683,095 688,479 Participation financing - mortgage loan receivable 2,815 3,107 Borrowings from the FHLB 1,348,000 1,370,000 Senior unsecured notes(2) 1,152,834 1,152,134 Total debt obligations $ 4,624,608 $ 4,379,826 (1) Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.4 million and $6.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

We believe core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-cash expenses and unrecognized results from derivatives and agency interest-only securities, which we believe makes comparisons across reporting periods more relevant by eliminating timing differences related to changes in the values of assets and derivatives. In addition, we use core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE: (i) to evaluate our earnings from operations and (ii) because management believes that they may be useful performance measures for us. Core earnings is also used as a factor in determining the annual incentive compensation of our senior managers and other employees.\nWe consider the Class A common shareholders of the Company and limited partners of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP other than Ladder Capital Corp (“Continuing LCFH Limited Partners”) to have fundamentally equivalent interests in our pre-tax earnings and net income. Accordingly, for purposes of computing core earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE, we start with pre-tax earnings or net income and adjust for other noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures but we do not adjust for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners. Similarly, when calculating undepreciated book value per share we include total shareholders' equity and the noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners, but exclude noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures.\nCore earnings\nWe define core earnings as income before taxes adjusted for (i) real estate , (ii) the impact of derivative gains and losses related to the hedging of assets on our balance sheet as of the end of the specified accounting period, (iii) unrealized gains/(losses) related to our investments in agency interest-only securities, (iv) economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred during the period and the exclusion of resultant GAAP recognition of the related economics during the subsequent periods, (v) non-cash stock-based compensation and (vi) certain one-time transactional items.\nFor core earnings, we include adjustments for economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP accounting for which risk has substantially transferred during the period and exclusion of resultant GAAP recognition of the related economics during the subsequent periods. This adjustment is reflected in core earnings when there is a true risk transfer on the mortgage loan transfer and settlement. Historically, this has represented the impact of economic gains on (discounts) on intercompany loans secured by our own real estate which we had not previously recognized because such gains were eliminated in consolidation. Conversely, if the economic risk was not substantially transferred, no adjustments to net income would be made relating to those transactions for core earnings purposes. Management believes recognizing these amounts for core earnings purposes in the period of transfer of economic risk is a reasonable supplemental measure of our performance.\nWe do not designate derivatives as hedges to qualify for hedge accounting and therefore any net payments under, or fluctuations in the fair value of, our derivatives are recognized currently in our income statement. However, fluctuations in the fair value of the related assets are not included in our income statement. We consider the gain or loss on our hedging positions related to assets that we still own as of the reporting date to be “open hedging positions.” While recognized for GAAP purposes, we exclude the results on the hedges from core earnings until the related asset is sold and the hedge position is considered “closed,” whereupon they would then be included in core earnings in that period. These are reflected as “adjustments for unrecognized derivative results” for purposes of computing core earnings for the period. We believe that excluding these specifically identified gains and losses associated with the open hedging positions adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize changes in the fair values of our assets and changes in the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge such assets.\nOur investments in Agency interest-only securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. We believe that excluding these specifically identified gains and losses associated with the Agency interest-only securities adjusts for timing differences between when we recognize changes in the fair values of our assets.

For purposes of Core Earnings, our share of real estate is eliminated and, accordingly, the resultant gain/losses also must be adjusted. Following is a reconciliation of the related consolidated GAAP amounts to the amounts reflected in Core Earnings: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP realized gain on sale of real estate, net $ 31,010 $ 2,331 Adjusted gain/loss on sale of real estate for purposes of Core Earnings (27,004 ) (1,932 ) Our share of accumulated on real estate sold $ 4,006 $ 399 (3) The following is a reconciliation of GAAP net results from derivative transactions to our unrecognized derivative result presented in the computation of Core Earnings in the preceding table ($ in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net results from derivative transactions $ 14,959 $ (1,981 ) Hedging interest expense 2,889 3,728 Hedging realized result (9,738 ) 186 Adjustments for unrecognized derivative results $ 8,110 $ 1,933 (4) Core estimated corporate tax benefit (expense) based on effective tax rate applied to Core Earnings generated by the activity within our taxable REIT subsidiary. Core EPS\nCore EPS is defined as after-tax core earnings divided by the adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the period. The adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding is defined as the GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B shares, if excluded from the GAAP measure because they would have an anti-dilutive effect. The inclusion of shares issuable upon conversion of Class B shares is consistent with the inclusion of income attributable to noncontrolling interest in operating partnership in core earnings and after-tax core earnings.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding to adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 95,389 109,335 issuable to converted Class B shareholders 14,901 — Adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding 110,290 109,335\nSet forth below is an unaudited computation of core EPS ($ in thousands, except per share date):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 After-tax core earnings $ 60,354 $ 33,688\nAdjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding 110,290 109,335 Core EPS $ 0.55 $ 0.31 After-tax core ROAE\nAfter-tax core ROAE is presented on an annualized basis and is defined as after-tax core earnings divided by the average total shareholders' equity and noncontrolling interest in operating partnership during the period. The inclusion of noncontrolling interest in operating partnership is consistent with the inclusion of income attributable to noncontrolling interest in operating partnership in after-tax core earnings. Set forth below is an unaudited computation of after-tax core ROAE ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 After-tax core earnings $ 60,354 $ 33,688\nAverage shareholders' equity and NCI in operating partnership 1,484,734 1,490,355 After-tax core ROAE 16.3 % 9.0 % Income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging\nWe present income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of the performance of our loan securitization business. Since our loans sold into securitizations to date are comprised of long-term fixed-rate loans, the result of hedging those exposures prior to securitization represents a substantial portion of our securitization profitability. Therefore, we view these two components of our profitability together when assessing the performance of this business activity and find it a meaningful measure of our performance as a whole. When evaluating the performance of our sale of loans into securitization business, we generally consider the income from sales of securitized loans, net, in conjunction with other income statement items that are directly related to such securitization transactions, including portions of the realized net result from derivative transactions that are specifically related to hedges on the securitized or sold loans, which we reflect as hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the table below.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of income from sale of securitized loans, net to income from sale of loans, net as reported in our consolidated financial statements and an unaudited reconciliation of hedge gain/(loss) relating to loans securitized to net results from derivative transactions as reported in our consolidated financial statements ($ in thousands except for number of loans and securitizations):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017 Number of loans 28\n— Face amount of loans sold into securitizations $ 436,547 $ — Number of securitizations 2 — Income from sales of securitized loans, net (1) $ 5,351 $ — Hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized (2) 6,567 — Income from sales of securitized loans, net of hedging 11,918 — Adjustment for economic gain on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP\nfor which risk has been substantially transferred\n(38 ) — Core gain on sale of securitized loans $ 11,880 $ —\n(1) The following is a reconciliation of income (loss) from sale of loans, net, which is the closest GAAP measure, as reported in our consolidated financial statements included herein to the non-GAAP financial measure of income from sales of securitized loans, net ($ in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Income from sales of loans, net $ 4,888 $ (999 ) Unrealized losses on loans related to lower of cost or market adjustments 463 999 (Income) loss from sale of loans (non-securitized), net — — Income from sales of securitized loans, net $ 5,351 $ — (2) The following is a reconciliation of net results from derivative transactions, which is the closest GAAP measure, as reported in our consolidated financial statements included herein to the non-GAAP financial measure of hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized ($ in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net results from derivative transactions $ 14,959 $ (1,981 ) Hedge gain/(loss) related to lending and securities positions (8,392 ) 3,130 Hedge gain/(loss) related to loans (non-securitized) — (1,149 ) Hedge gain/(loss) related to loans securitized $ 6,567 $ — Undepreciated book value per share\nWe present undepreciated book value per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our financial condition. We believe undepreciated book value per share assists investors in comparing our financial condition across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding accumulated depreciation on real estate, which implicitly assumes that the value of our real estate diminishes in value predictably over time, whereas real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.\nWe consider the Class A common shareholders of the Company and Continuing LCFH Limited Partners to have fundamentally equivalent interests in our pre-tax earnings and net income. Accordingly, when calculating undepreciated book value per share we include total shareholders' equity and the noncontrolling interest held by Continuing LCFH Limited Partners but exclude noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures.\nWe define undepreciated book value per share as the sum of total shareholders' equity, noncontrolling interest in operating partnership, and our share of accumulated real estate , divided by the total Class A and Class B shares outstanding. Set forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to undepreciated book value, and an unaudited computation of undepreciated book value per share ($ in thousands except per share data):\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Total shareholders' equity $ 1,309,437 $ 1,234,968 Noncontrolling interest in operating partnership 184,201 240,861 Our share of accumulated real estate (1) 155,161 149,494 Undepreciated book value 1,648,799 1,625,323 Class A shares outstanding 97,956 93,641 Class B shares outstanding 13,317 17,667 Total shares outstanding 111,273 111,308 GAAP book value per share $ 13.37 $ 13.19 Undepreciated book value per share $ 14.82 $ 14.60 (1) The following is a reconciliation of GAAP accumulated real estate to our share of accumulated real estate presented in the computation of undepreciated book value per share in the preceding table ($ in thousands): March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 GAAP accumulated real estate $ 165,874 $ 161,063 Less: Noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures' share of\naccumulated real estate\n(10,713 ) (11,569 ) Our share of accumulated real estate $ 155,161 $ 149,494 Core gain on sale of loans\nWe present core gain on sale of loans, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define core gain on sale of loans as income from sales of loans, and the economic gains on the transfer of loans not considered sold for accounting purposes, net of the realized hedging result related to the hedging of loans sold or transferred. We believe core gain on sale of loans assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating timing differences related to changes in values of assets and derivatives.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of GAAP sale of loans, net to core gain on sale of loans ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP sale of loans, net $ 4,888 $ (999 ) Adjustment for economic gain on securitization transactions not recognized under GAAP\nfor which risk has been substantially transferred (1)\n(38 ) — Hedging gain/(loss) related to loans securitized and other loan activity 7,030 2,148 Core gain on sale of loans $ 11,880 $ 1,149 (1) For core gain on sale of loans, we include adjustments for economic gains on securitization transactions not recognized for GAAP accounting. Management believes recognizing these amounts for core purposes in the period of economic transfer of risk is a reasonable supplemental measure of our performance.\nCore gain on sale of securities\nWe present core gain on sale of securities, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define core gain on sale of loans as income from sales of securities net of the realized hedging result related to the hedging of securities sold. We believe core gain on sale of securities assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating timing differences related to changes in values of assets and derivatives.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of GAAP realized gain (loss) on securities to core gain on sale of securities ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP realized gain (loss) on securities $ (1,099 ) $ 5,361 Plus: Other than temporary impairment, net of hedging 134\n— Hedging realized result - security sales 2,708 (2,333 ) Core gain on sales of securities $ 1,743\n$ 3,028 Net rental income\nWe present net rental income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define net rental income as the total of operating lease income and tenant recoveries, less real estate operating expenses, all of which are disclosed on our consolidated statements of income. We present net rental income as a measure of the recurring income from our real estate investments before non-recurring items such as gains on sale or fee income, which we believe assists investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of operating lease income to net rental income ($ in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating lease income $ 24,560 $ 19,630 Plus: Tenant recoveries 3,577\n1,579 Less: Real estate operating expenses (8,817 ) (7,454 ) Net rental income $ 19,320\n$ 13,755 Adjusted leverage\nWe present adjusted leverage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define adjusted leverage as the ratio of debt obligations, net of deferred financing costs, adjusted for non-recourse debt obligations related to securitizations that are consolidated on our GAAP balance sheet. We believe adjusted leverage assists investors in comparing our leverage across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-recourse debt related to securitized loans.\nSet forth below is an unaudited computation of adjusted leverage ($ in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 GAAP debt obligations, net $ 4,624,608 $ 4,379,826 Less: CLO Debt(1) (683,095 ) (688,479 ) Adjusted debt obligations 3,941,513 3,691,347 GAAP total equity 1,503,292 1,488,146 Adjusted leverage 2.6 2.5 (1) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we contributed over $888.4 million of balance sheet loans into two CLO securitizations that remain on our balance sheet for accounting purposes, but should be excluded from debt obligations for adjusted leverage calculation purposes.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Limitations\nOur non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:\ncore earnings, core EPS and after-tax core ROAE do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations and are not necessarily indicative of cash necessary to fund cash needs; core EPS and after-tax core ROAE are based on a non-GAAP estimate of our effective tax rate, including the impact of Unincorporated Business Tax and the impact of our election to be taxed as a REIT effective January 1, 2015, assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock. Our actual tax rate may differ materially from this estimate; undepreciated book value per share excludes accumulated real estate and may not reflect an accurate measure of the value of our real estate; and other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to shareholders, earnings per share or book value per share, or any other performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity. Undepreciated book value per share should not be considered a measure of the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation of the our company.\nIn the future, we may incur gains and losses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nFor additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the disclosures available on our website or in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-­Q.\nAbout Ladder\nLadder is an internally-managed real estate investment trust that is a leader in commercial real estate finance.
