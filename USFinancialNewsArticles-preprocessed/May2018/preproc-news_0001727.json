Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted net income (loss), Consumer and Insurance adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share, Acquisitions and Servicing adjusted pretax income (loss), and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) are key performance measures used by management in evaluating the performance of our business. Consumer and Insurance adjusted pretax income (loss), Acquisitions and Servicing adjusted pretax income (loss), and Other adjusted pretax income (loss) represents income (loss) before income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain (loss) on sale of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt, debt refinance costs, net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary, and income attributable to non-controlling interests. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating performance and as a performance goal under the company’s executive compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call & Webcast Information\nOneMain management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss our first quarter 2018 results and other general matters at 8:00 am Eastern Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018.
