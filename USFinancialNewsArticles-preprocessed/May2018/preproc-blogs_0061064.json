    "text": "CNBC.com Leah Millis | Reuters President Donald Trump speaks prior to signing the \"Right to Try Act,\" which gives terminally ill patients the right to use experimental medications not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 30, 2018.\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday drugmakers are going to announce \"voluntary massive\" price cuts in two weeks.\nWhile signing \"right-to-try\" legislation into law, Trump touted his administration's moves to lower prescription drug prices. He and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar unveiled a blueprint earlier this month.\nTrump said Wednesday that Azar told him Tuesday they're already seeing \"tremendous improvement.\" He didn't specify what he was referring to, though.\n\"I think we're going to have some of the big drug companies in in two weeks, and they're going to announce because of what we did, they're going to announce voluntary massive drops in prices,\" Trump said. \"So that's great. That's going to be a fantastic thing.\"\nIt wasn't immediately clear which companies he was referring to and what the \"massive drops in prices\" would look like. Pharmaceutical stocks didn't move on the statement.\nCNBC reached out to the 10 largest drug companies in the U.S. about Trump's comments. So far, Gilead said no comment.\nInvestors previously sighed relief when the Trump administration's plan didn't appear as damaging as they feared, sending shares higher .\n-CNBC's Meg Tirrell contributed to this report Angelica LaVito News Associate for CNBC Related Securities",
