    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, May 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Impact Group , a leading sales and marketing agency that provides innovative services to more than 700 consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands, announced today that it has acquired three independent food brokerage companies in Minnesota and Wisconsin: Impact Sales & Associates, Ritt-Beyer & Weir (RBW), and WJ Pence. As well-respected food brokers, Impact Sales & Associates, RBW, and WJ Pence reinforce Impact Group's coverage in key markets, and in the Midwest, in particular. In addition to expanded coverage in conventional grocery and the natural channel, these additions increase Impact Group's Midwest exposure to both convenience and mass retail, including Target stores.\n\"For nearly 25 years, Impact Group has provided valuable retail relationships, strategic counsel, and industry know-how that has aided the promotion and distribution of thousands of CPG brands. Our latest acquisitions present the opportunity for us to accomplish this on a larger scale and with immediate impact,\" said Carl Pennington, President and Chief Executive Officer of Impact Group. \"In addition to their impressive track records in the grocery business, Impact Sales & Associates, RBW, and WJ Pence share our commitment to exceptional client service and results. We are proud to officially welcome these well-respected agencies to our network after multiple years of working with them in a licensed partnership. We look forward to achieving great success together.\"\n\"We are pleased to join Impact Group and to provide expanded geographic coverage and enhanced resources to our clients,\" said Frank Tuma, President of Impact Sales & Associates. Impact Sales & Associates is a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based full-service brokerage firm known for its wholesale business model and long-term industry relationships in the Midwestern region.\n\"We are looking forward to expanding our capabilities via scale and footprint,\" added Joel Beyer, President of Franklin, Wisconsin-based RBW. With a strong presence in Midwestern markets, including Illinois and Ohio, RBW specializes in multiple channels, including conventional, specialty, convenience, mass, and bulk. \"The acquisition by Impact Group also provides our associates with additional growth and leadership opportunities.\"\n\"As part of the Impact Group family, we will have access to best-in-class technological tools, valuable data and insights, category expertise, and much more,\" said Dale Kresse, President of Hartland, Wisconsin-based WJ Pence. With over 65 years of experience in retail sales, WJ Pence has established longstanding relationships with national and regional retailers. \"We are excited about the improved ability for our clients to compete in the CPG space that this partnership provides,\" added Kresse.\nImpact Group has previously worked closely with all three brokers being acquired. Two of the three – Impact Sales & Associates and RBW – worked in partnership with Mueller Yurgae Associates (MYA), a locally-focused Midwest agency that will remain an independent business from Impact Group. Impact Group and MYA are forming a closely-aligned strategic partnership to continue to serve clients and customers in the Midwest.\n\"We have established a terrific working relationship with Impact Group over the last fifteen plus years,\" said Jeff Yurgae, President of MYA. \"We look forward to continuing our partnership as we collectively move forward offering our clients and customers exceptional results.\"\nWith the acquisitions, Impact Group adds approximately 125 professionals from Impact Sales & Associates, RBW, and WJ Pence to its staff.\nABOUT IMPACT SALES & ASSOCIATES\nImpact Sales & Associates was created in 2009 from the merger of two local broker agencies.
