    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 4:47 PM / in 2 minutes Trump replaces White House lawyer on Russia probe Karen Freifeld , Steve Holland 4 Min Read\nNEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyer Emmet Flood, who advised President Bill Clinton in impeachment proceedings, will assist President Donald Trump with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election, replacing Ty Cobb, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday.\nThe latest lawyer shuffle comes as the question of whether Trump will agree to an interview with Mueller appears to be coming to a head. Washington lawyer John Dowd, who left Trump’s outside legal team over a month ago, said on Tuesday that in March, Mueller had threatened to subpoena Trump’s testimony if he did not talk to investigators.\nFlood will “represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt,” Sanders said. “Ty Cobb, a friend of the president, who has done a terrific job, will be retiring at the end of the month.”\nNeither Cobb nor Flood immediately responded to requests for comment.\nMueller is investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, an investigation that includes whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by Trump, among other things.Russia has denied interfering in the election, despite the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies, and Trump has denied there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow while repeatedly denouncing the investigation.\nLast year, Flood turned down a post on the White House team that ultimately went to Cobb, Reuters reported in July. He met with Trump in March about assisting the administration with the Russia probe, though the position was unclear, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.\nFlood advised Clinton in impeachment proceedings in the late 1990s brought by the U.S. House of Representatives and tried before the U.S. Senate, where Clinton was acquitted.\nFlood also spent two years in the White House counsel’s office, where he handled executive privilege-related disputes for President George W. Bush’s administration and congressional investigations and other inquiries. He was a clerk for Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nCobb joined the administration in July after resigning from the Washington law firm of Hogan Lovells. In an interview with Reuters in August, he predicted a quick end to the Mueller probe.\n“I’d be embarrassed if this is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving, and worse if it’s still haunting him by year end,” Cobb told Reuters at the time.\nHe also took a cooperative approach to Mueller’s requests.\nTrump has since appeared increasingly frustrated with the investigation. Last month, Trump brought former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani onto his outside legal team, and said the former federal prosecutor wanted to resolve the matter quickly.\nAccording to a Washington Post reporter’s Twitter Post on Wednesday, Giuliani said any interview of the president by Mueller would be maximum “two to three hours around a narrow set of questions.”\nSeparately, Giuliani told Bloomberg News that the legal team “would be inclined” to allow the interview, but said if Mueller already believed former FBI director James Comey’s version of events, then it would be leading Trump “into the lion’s den.” Special Counsel Robert Mueller departs after briefing members of the U.S. Senate on his investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\nJoshua Stueve, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on the reports.\nBesides Giuliani, former federal prosecutors Martin Raskin and Jane Serene Raskin also just joined Trump’s outside legal team, which has recently been led by lawyer Jay Sekulow.
