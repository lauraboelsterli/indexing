    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP (NYSE: KRP) (\"Kimbell Royalty Partners\" or \"Kimbell\"), a leading owner of oil and natural gas mineral and royalty interests across 20 states, today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nQ1 distribution of $0.42 per common unit, up $0.06 or 17% per unit from Q4 Average daily production up 4% from Q4, with total Q1 production of 328,530 Boe consisting of 109,886 Bbls of oil, 984,366 Mcf of natural gas and 54,583 Bbls of natural gas liquids Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $11.2 million, up 12% from Q4 Net loss of $52.8 million – due to previously disclosed full cost ceiling limitation impairment Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million, up 21% from Q4 Executed agreement to sell less than 0.06% of total net royalty acres (and less than 0.7% of total current production) for $9 million\n\"We delivered another record quarter across the board in Q1,\" said Robert Ravnaas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kimbell Royalty Partners' general partner.\n\"On a top-line basis, we benefitted from a significant improvement in oil, gas and NGLs pricing that could drive additional development activity across a portion of our royalty acreage in the coming quarters. A record 25 drilling rigs are currently drilling wells on our properties, with approximately 60% of those rigs at work in the Permian Basin in West Texas. Our average daily production increased by 4% versus Q4 even though we did not complete any additional acquisitions in the first quarter.\n\"Our unitholders benefitted from our continued strong financial performance through a 17% sequential increase in our first quarter distribution, or 6 cents per common unit.\n\"On May 4 th , we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell a small portion of our Delaware Basin acreage for $9 million. We believe that this transaction proves the significant intrinsic value of our West Texas acreage and represents less than 0.06% of our total net royalty acres. We will continue to evaluate incoming offers for our acreage and transact opportunistically to enhance unitholder value.\n\"We are continuing to work toward a drop-down of oil and gas assets from our sponsors that is targeted for later this year. Since our February 2017 IPO, we have completed approximately $30 million of accretive acquisitions, and our goal is to continue to grow production, reserves and distributable cash flow both through a potential dropdown and through additional acquisition opportunities that we are continuously evaluating,\" Mr. Ravnaas said.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Distribution\nOn April 27, 2018, the board of directors of Kimbell Royalty GP, LLC, the general partner of Kimbell Royalty Partners, declared a cash distribution of $0.42 per common unit for the first quarter of 2018. The distribution will be paid on May 14, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 7, 2018. This represented a 17% increase from the prior quarter's distribution.\nFinancial Highlights\nTotal revenue including the impact of an approximate $285,000 loss on our commodity derivative instruments was $10.9 million. First quarter net loss was $52.8 million, or a loss of $3.23 per common unit, which was the result of a $54.8 million full-cost ceiling test impairment.\nFirst quarter results benefitted primarily from a 12% increase in realized average commodity prices, combined with an increase of 4% in average daily production.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $7.6 million. (Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please see a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures at the end of this news release). Average realized price per barrel (Bbl) for oil was $60.97, natural gas per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) was $2.69 and natural gas liquids per Bbl was $26.69.\nProduction\nFirst quarter average daily production increased by 4% from the prior quarter to 3,650 Boe per day, for total production of 328,530 Boe. The increase was due to higher natural gas output, higher NGLs production from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, increased oil production from 14 new wells that came on line in Weld County, Colorado during the first quarter, and from the full impact of acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter revenues were derived 60% from oil, 24% from natural gas, 13% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from other sales. Production was composed of approximately 33% oil, 50% natural gas and 17% natural gas liquids.\nHedging Program\nAt March 31, 2018, fixed price swaps for the remainder of 2018 consisted of 32,450 Bbl of oil (fixed rate at $56.00 per Bbl) and 265,650 MMBtu of natural gas (fixed rate at $2.71 per MMBtu). These derivative instruments cover approximately 10% of our current oil and natural gas production.\nFixed price swaps for 2019 consisted of 43,070 Bbl of oil (fixed rate at $53.07 per Bbl) and 352,590 MMBtu of natural gas (fixed rate at $2.76 per MMBtu).\nOn March 29, 2018, we entered into additional fixed price swaps for the first quarter of 2020 consisting of 11,011 Bbl of oil (fixed rate at $56.03 per Bbl) and 96,915 MMBtu of natural gas (fixed rate at $2.94 per MMBtu).\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nOn May 4, 2018, the partnership executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell a small portion of its Delaware Basin acreage for $9 million. This sale represents approximately 24 Boe per day of production (less than 0.7% of total current production) and 41 net royalty acres (less than 0.06% of total net royalty acres). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. This sale is part of the partnership's strategy to continually optimize its portfolio of royalty assets to create maximum value for unitholders.\nLiquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, Kimbell had $30.8 million outstanding under its $50 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all related financial covenants. Based on the most recent redetermination under the partnership's revolving credit facility, the borrowing base is $100 million. We reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio from 1.2x at year-end 2017 to 1.0x at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nFull-Cost Ceiling Limitation Impairment\nThe partnership recognized a charge of $54.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 related to a full-cost ceiling limitation impairment. This previously disclosed impairment is a one-time, non-cash charge that is not expected to impact the cash flow available for distribution generated by the partnership, its liquidity or ability to make acquisitions in the future.\nConference Call\nKimbell Royalty Partners will host a conference call and webcast today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss first quarter results.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate cash flow available to pay distributions to our unitholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net of capitalized interest, non-cash unit-based compensation, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We expect that cash available for distribution for each quarter will generally equal our Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors may determine is appropriate.\nKimbell Royalty Partners, LP\nSupplemental Schedule\n(Unaudited, in thousands, except per unit data and unit count)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet loss\n$\n(52,825)\nDepreciation, depletion and accretion expenses\n4,456\nInterest expense\n350\nEBITDA\n$\n(48,019)\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n54,753\nUnit-based compensation\n669\nUnrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments\n212\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,615\nAdjustments to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to cash available\nfor distribution\nCash interest expense\n475\nCash available for distribution\n$\n7,140\nLimited partner units outstanding (1)\n16,834,984\nCash available for distribution per common unit outstanding\n$\n0.42\n(1)\nAs of first quarter 2018 distribution record date of May 7, 2018.\nKimbell Royalty Partners, LP\nSupplemental Schedule\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities\nto Adjusted EBITDA\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7,294\nInterest expense\n350\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n(54,753)\nAmortization of loan origination costs\n(16)\nUnit-based compensation\n(669)\nUnrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments\n(212)\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nOil, natural gas and NGL revenues receivable\n(233)\nOther receivables\n135\nAccounts payable\n(379)\nOther current liabilities\n464\nEBITDA\n$\n(48,019)\nAdd:\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n54,753\nUnit-based compensation\n669\nLoss on commodity derivative instruments\n212\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n7,615\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kimbell-royalty-partners-announces-record-first-quarter-2018-results-300646082.html\nSOURCE Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP",
