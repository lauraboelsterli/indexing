(NASDAQ:AMED), one of the nation’s leading home healthcare, hospice and personal care companies, announced today that its subsidiary, Associated Home Care, has closed on its acquisition of East Tennessee Personal Care Service (ETPCS), a personal care provider headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Associated Home Care acquired substantially all assets of ETPCS.\n“This transaction is exciting because it enlarges our personal care footprint outside of Massachusetts and Florida,” stated Amedisys President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Kusserow. “This allows us to continue to focus on our overall strategy of expanding our continuum of care into new markets.”\nFounded in 2003, East Tennessee Personal Care Service offers personal care, homemaker services, personal support and Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) to clients to encourage independent living 24 hours a day and seven days a week. ETPCS has a personal care office in Knoxville, Tennessee, and serves the Knoxville metro area, including Knox, Loudon, Blount, Roane, Anderson and Monroe counties.\nThe Amedisys Personal Care Division now serves more than 19,000 clients annually in Massachusetts, Florida and Tennessee.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nWhen included in this press release, words like “believes,” “belief,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “may,” “might,” “would,” “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
