Bernstein\nThe interviews were conducted between July 2017 and March 2018.\nGrassley had said in January he wanted to release the transcripts of the interviews. His committee is one of three congressional panels investigating the intelligence community’s finding that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election to boost Trump and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating.\nThe June 2016 Trump Tower meeting has been central to those probes.
