    "text": "7 COMMENTS Accenture Interactive is officially moving into ad-buying, a signal that the marketing services arm of professional-services giant is looking to grab a bigger slice of marketers’ advertising budgets away from traditional agencies.\nOn Wednesday, Accenture Interactive plans to announce the launch of its Programmatic Services practice. While Accenture Interactive had been working with clients for some time to help them move their programmatic, or automated, digital ad-buying more in-house, the new division will also incorporate the planning, buying and management of programmatic ad campaigns.\nConsulting firms have been busily acquiring advertising, marketing and design agencies in recent years as they look to extend their C-suite offerings to clients’ marketing departments. While their services to marketers primarily focus on major customer-experience projects, recently consulting firms have been more directly competing with traditional ad agencies for business. To counter that threat, many agencies have also opened up their own consulting divisions.\nAccenture’s move into media-buying further ratchets up the pressure on one of the most lucrative areas of the advertising-agency business. The “advertising and media-investment management” division at WPP, the world’s largest agency holding company, accounted for 47% of its revenue in 2017.\nThere had been some skepticism in the advertising community that consulting firms would enter the ad-buying space. On an earnings call earlier this month, for example, Dentsu Aegis Network Chief Executive Jerry Buhlmann said he didn’t see “materially at this stage” consulting firms moving into media planning. Mr. Buhlmann said the bigger impact has been from consulting firms advising clients on how to restructure their businesses in relation to marketing services.\nEven the CEO of Accenture, Pierre Nanterme, said on the company’s March earnings call that media-buying was one of the areas where it was not competing against agencies “at all.” He added that media-buying was a business that is “trending down significantly.”\nWhat’s changed, according to Scott Tieman, the global lead for the new Accenture Interactive unit, is a recent uptick in client demand for help with their programmatic ad-buying. Concerns about the ad-buying marketplace were stoked in 2016 after a report from the Association of National Advertisers alleged nontransparent practices such as rebates or charging hidden fees were “pervasive” in the U.S. Big agency groups denied any wrongdoing.\n“We are hearing from our clients regularly that they are just dismayed and they have very serious concerns about the adversarial, nontransparent and antiquated practices of their agencies,” said Mr. Tieman.\nYet there has been some concern in the agency community about a potential conflict of interest in consulting firms advising clients on their marketing services and agency partners, while also offering its own marketing solutions. Brian Whipple, CEO of Accenture Interactive, said his company is winning big pieces of business because it is offering to do something different with clients’ marketing budgets, rather than critiquing agency campaigns or promising to do similar work better or cheaper.\nThe Accenture Interactive Programmatic Services practice says it will look to win clients on a transparent pricing approach. The division will charge a full-time equivalent (FTE) fee, rather than taking a margin of clients’ media spend, according to Mr. Tieman. It also won’t adopt principal positions on media—buying inventory in advance, repackaging it and selling it back to clients.\nAccenture Interactive will be going up against established competitors like WPP and Omnicom which are responsible for buying billions of dollars worth of ad space each year. Mr. Tieman wouldn’t disclose any plans around potential acquisitions.\nAccenture Interactive has already been winning clients at agencies’ expense. Radisson Hotel Group issued a global request for proposal for its global digital marketing account at the end of 2017, seeking a partner to help manage its digital ad buying and assist in building its own tech platform to support it. Five companies competed for the account, including three ad agencies and two consulting firms, with Radisson eventually selecting Accenture Interactive as its digital agency of record earlier this year.\nWhile Accenture Interactive is edging its way into programmatic media-buying, Mr. Whipple says buying ads across traditional media such as television, radio or print is not an area of focus.\n“It’s a low-margin thing, it’s not something we’re interested in,” Mr. Whipple said. “If we needed [services like traditional media-buying and planning] for a particular experience, we would just partner with one of the many capable agencies out there.”\nAccenture Interactive’s revenue grew 35% to $6.5 billion last year. Ad Age listed Accenture Interactive as the largest digital network in its annual agency rankings report. The unit says it has 25,000 employees worldwide. The Programmatic Services division will have access to hundreds of media traders and hundreds of marketing experts globally, Mr. Tieman said.\nWrite to Lara O’Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com",
