Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (NASDAQ: JBSS) (hereinafter the “Company”) today announced operating results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $8.6 million, or $0.75 per share diluted, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.55 per share diluted, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 was $26.8 million, or $2.34 per share diluted, compared to net income of $29.4 million, or $2.58 per share diluted, for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.\nNet sales increased to $203.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $173.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was attributable to a 12.5% increase in sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers, and a 4.2% increase in the weighted average sales price per pound. The majority of the sales volume increase came from increased sales of peanuts, almonds and snack and trail mixes in the consumer distribution channel.\nSales volume from our branded products changed in the quarterly comparison as follows:\nFisher recipe nuts (4.6)% Orchard Valley Harvest produce products 126.1% Fisher snack nuts 29.8% The sales volume decline for Fisher recipe nuts primarily resulted from lost distribution of some items at a major customer due to the introduction of private brand recipe nuts by that customer. We anticipate that we should regain a portion of the lost distribution at this customer in the first half of fiscal 2019. The decline in sales volume from this lost distribution was offset in part by Fisher recipe nut distribution gains at new and other existing customers. The sales volume increase for our Orchard Valley Harvest brand was attributable to new item introductions and distribution gains with new and existing customers. The sales volume increase for Fisher snack nuts was due to increased promotional and merchandising activity at an existing customer. Sales volume increased in the commercial ingredients distribution channel due to some Squirrel Brand sales now being categorized in this distribution channel. We acquired the Squirrel Brand business in the second quarter of this fiscal year. This Squirrel Brand sales volume was included in the contract packaging distribution channel in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in sales volume in the contract packaging distribution channel was primarily attributable to that distribution channel reclassification.\nNet sales increased to $677.1 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 from $645.0 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to a 3.9% increase in sales volume. The sales volume increase resulted mainly from increased sales of peanuts, almonds and snack and trail mixes in the consumer distribution channel. The increase in sales volume in the consumer distribution channel primarily resulted from increased sales of private brand products and Orchard Valley Harvest produce products. Sales volume declined in the commercial ingredients distribution channel, and sales volume was relatively unchanged in the contract packaging distribution channel. The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients distribution channel resulted mainly from the loss of a bulk almond butter customer that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGross profit margin declined slightly to 16.3% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 16.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and gross profit increased by $4.8 million in the quarterly comparison. The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume discussed in the quarterly comparison for net sales.\nGross profit margin for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 decreased to 15.6% of net sales from 16.8% for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, and gross profit decreased by $2.4 million. The decreases in gross profit and gross profit margin were mainly due to increased commodity acquisition costs for walnuts and pecans. We could not increase prices in response to these cost increases due to holiday promotional pricing commitments that were in place for the first half of fiscal 2018 to support new Fisher recipe nut distribution gains.\nTotal operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 10.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily due to a higher net sales base.\nTotal operating expenses increased by $1.6 million in the quarterly comparison mainly from increased freight expense and amortization expense related to the acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business.\nTotal operating expenses for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 decreased to 8.9% of net sales from 9.3% of net sales for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017 due to a higher net sales base. Total operating expenses increased by $0.3 million in the year to date comparison primarily as a result of increased freight, personnel, acquisition, consulting and sales commission expenses that were largely offset by lower incentive compensation expense.\nInterest expense for the current third quarter increased to $1.0 million from $0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, interest expense increased to $2.6 million from $2.1 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. The increases in interest expense in both comparisons resulted from higher debt levels and higher average interest rates, both of which were mainly attributable to increased debt from the acquisition of the Squirrel Brand business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe value of total inventories on hand at the end of the current third quarter decreased by $16.5 million, or 8.2%, when compared to the value of total inventories on hand at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the value of total inventories was primarily due to lower quantities of walnuts and pecans on hand. Higher acquisition costs for walnuts, peanuts and cashews primarily led to a 1.6% increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand in the quarterly comparison.\n“We reported record earnings per share for a third quarter, which were mainly driven by a 25.0% increase in sales volume in our consumer distribution channel,” stated Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, Chief Executive Officer. “Continued growth in private brand products, primarily with existing customers, accounted for 65.2% of the sales volume growth in the consumer distribution channel. Increased sales for our Orchard Valley Harvest and Fisher snack nut brands also contributed significantly to the volume growth in the consumer distribution channel,” Mr. Sanfilippo added. “Our brands performed well at retail as well in the quarterly comparison according to IRi market data. Fisher recipe nut pound volume increased by 6% from distribution gains with new customers, while the total recipe nut category pound volume increased by 2%. Orchard Valley Harvest pound volume increased by 69% while the total produce category pound volume fell by 3%. Fisher snack nut pound volume increased by 3%, while pound volume for the total snack nut category increased by 2%,” Mr. Sanfilippo noted. “As we announced in the second quarter, we acquired the Squirrel Brand business at the end of November. The integration of the Squirrel Brand business was completed early in the current third quarter with the successful transition of all significant customers. With the integration now behind us, we can focus on growing the Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brands in our consumer and commercial ingredients distribution channels, as part of our strategy of growing our branded portfolio,” Mr. Sanfilippo concluded.\nThe Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern (9:00 a.m. Central) to discuss these results.
