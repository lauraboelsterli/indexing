    "text": "SARASOTA, Fla., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. (OTCQB:UNIR) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\n* Net Sales increase 2.6% to $26,429,687 versus the prior year quarter as a 10.3% growth in the Industrial sector offset a moderate decline in the automotive sector.\n* Gross Margins of 17.5% pressured by raw material price increases and operational start-up costs in the UK.\n* Earnings Per Common share was a loss of $0.02 for this quarter versus earnings of $0.03 in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOverview\nThe first quarter of this year was testimony to the diversification strategy of the Company as increases in Net Sales of the Industrial sector offset a moderate decline in sales of the Automotive sector resulting in an increase in overall Net Sales for the quarter of 2.6% versus the first quarter of last year. The Industrial sector grew more than 10% versus last year as sales to off-the-highway equipment manufacturers and a revitalization of the hospitality and physical fitness industries sparked the increases. The Automotive sector was tepid this quarter (-1.1%) as gains in our UK operations offset a decline in the domestic business.\nRaw material prices continue to be a challenge as increases put in place have been accepted for the most part by customers in the Industrial sector over the first quarter of this year. The automotive customers have contracts in place so price increases are not as easily accepted in this segment. We continue to work on operating efficiencies and expense reduction programs to offset raw material increases in general.\nOverall, we continue to deliver operational improvement at both of our major US and UK operational facilities and we continue to bid on major automotive platforms in segments more preferred by discriminating consumers (SUV’s and trucks). This will take time but we remain positive for better results particularly in the second half of this year.\nNet Sales\nNet Sales for the quarter increased 2.6% to $26,429,687 versus $25,758,429 in the first quarter of last year. The Automotive sector (65.2% of Net Sales) declined 1.1% for the quarter as growth in the European automotive market could not offset a decline in the US automotive market. European automotive sales represented approximately 72.5% of Net Sales in the Automotive sector this quarter. As previously mentioned, we are bidding on platforms of major automotive OEM’s to diversify our product offerings to the US industry which should rekindle growth.\nThe Industrial sector (34.8% of Net Sales) had a very strong quarter as sales increased 10.3% versus the quarter of the previous year. This was primarily due to sharp increases in sales to off-the-highway equipment manufacturers especially in the US. The seating marketplace was also good this quarter with increases to the physical fitness and hospitality industries.\nOperating Income\nOperating Income for the quarter was significantly below the prior year results (-48.3%) primarily as a result of Gross Profit Margins declining to 17.5% versus 20.9% in the quarter of the prior year. The delays in the timing of raw material price increases being accepted by customers, production inefficiencies as a result of new platform development and a change in the mix of high vs. lower margin sales lead to the margin erosion. This will improve as we move forward and the first quarter of this year should be the low point of the year barring any catastrophic occurrences.\nNet Loss/Income Available to Common Shareholders\nNet Loss for the quarter, after Preferred stock dividends, was $294,820 or a loss of $0.02 per common share versus Net Income of $470,776 or income of $0.03 per common share.\nFor further details, see the in the Company’s Form 10-Q filed on May 7, 2018.
