Huge hubs with more summer delays include airports in New York, Texas and Florida.\nAnd one month is especially treacherous: 76 percent of the airports analyzed had the most summer delays in June. (Using 2017 flight data , Expedia found that June is also a more expensive summer month for airfare, with the average ticket costing roughly $100 more than in August, the cheapest summer month for airfare.)\nThe MagnifyMoney study also revealed that delays are increasingly common, with 54 percent of airports logging worse summer arrival rates in 2017 than in 2016.\nSo, how does your local airport stack up?\nNewark Liberty International airport in Newark, New Jersey, is the worst airport for on-time summer travel, with only 67 percent of those arrivals clocking in on time, based on a 10-year average from 2008 to 2017. New York City's LaGuardia Airport comes in second, followed by San Francisco International Airport.\nAs for best on-time arrival rates, Honolulu, Hawaii, claimed the top spot, with 86.7 percent of airport arrivals being on-time in the summer, based on a 10-year average between 2008 and 2017. Salt Lake City, Utah, ranks second and Orange County, California, rounds out the top three.\nThe top 10 worst airports for on-time summer travel, according to MagnifyMoney:\n1. Newark, New Jersey: Newark Liberty International Airport (67 percent on-time)\n2. New York , New York: LaGuardia Airport (68 percent on-time)\n3.
