Navios Holdings directly controls 72 modern dry bulk vessels. Since the beginning of 2017, we have increased our fleet by 11%. Our dry bulk fleet, with an average age of 7.7 years, is 16% younger than the industry average age. We believe we are a premiere operator, generating significant operating leverage and enabling us to achieve substantial cost savings. By design, to take advantage of an improving market, we have maintained market exposure for almost 2/3 of available days for the remaining nine months of 2018.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS – RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nFleet Renewal and Expansion\nIn April 2018, Navios Holdings agreed to charter-in one Panamax vessel under a ten-year bareboat charter with purchase option.

In addition, the Company has sold three vessels during the same period having an average age of 16.8 years.

It does not include the fleet of Navios Logistics.\nEarnings Highlights\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as substitution for Navios Holdings’ results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSee Exhibit I under the heading, “Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” for a discussion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share of Navios Holdings (including Navios Logistics), and EBITDA of Navios Logistics (on a stand-alone basis), and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable measures calculated under U.S. GAAP.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and 2017 Results (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data and unless otherwise stated):\nThe first quarter 2018 and 2017 information presented below was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\nThree Month Period Ended Three Month\nPeriod Ended March 31, March 31, 201 8 201 7 (unaudited) (unaudited) Revenue $ 116,882 $ 95,346 Net Loss $ (40,857 ) $ (48,719 ) Adjusted Net Loss $ (34,142 ) (1 ) $ (39,621 ) (2 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,806 $ 25,685 EBITDA $ 21,383 $ 8,434 Adjusted EBITDA $ 28,098 (1 ) $ 17,532 (2 ) Basic Loss per Share $ (0.35 ) $ (0.45 ) Adjusted Basic Loss per Share $ (0.30 ) (1 ) $ (0.37 ) (2 )\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 exclude a $6.7 million impairment loss relating to the sale of Navios Herakles. (2) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 exclude a $9.1 million impairment loss relating to the sale of Navios Ionian. Revenue from dry bulk vessel operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $64.7 million as compared to $51.5 million for the same period during 2017. The increase in dry bulk revenue was mainly attributable to the increase in the time charter equivalent (“TCE”) per day by 39.8% to $10,983 per day in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $7,857 per day in the same period of 2017.\nRevenue from the logistics business was $52.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $43.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) a $8.8 million increase in revenue from the port terminal business mainly due to the commencement of operations at the new iron ore terminal, (ii) a $1.3 million increase in revenue from the cabotage business mainly due to an increase in operating days and (iii) a $0.4 million increase in sales of products mainly due to an increase in the Paraguayan liquid port's price of products sold. The overall increase was partially mitigated by a $2.1 million decrease in revenue from the barge business mainly related to liquid cargo transportation.\nNet Loss of Navios Holdings was $40.9 million and $48.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net Loss was affected by the items described in the notes to the table above. Excluding these items, Adjusted Net Loss of Navios Holdings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $34.1 million as compared to $39.6 million for the same period of 2017. The $5.5 million decrease in Adjusted Net Loss was mainly due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA by $10.6 million. This increase was partially mitigated by (i) an increase in interest expense and finance cost, net by $4.4 million; (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization by $0.5 million; (iii) an increase in amortization for deferred drydock and special survey costs of $0.1 million; and (iv) an increase in share-based compensation expense of $0.1 million.\nNet loss of Navios Logistics was $1.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA of Navios Holdings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $10.6 million to $28.1 million as compared to $17.5 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) a $21.6 million increase in revenue and (ii) a $5.4 million decrease in direct vessel expenses (excluding the amortization of deferred drydock and special survey costs). This overall increase of $27.0 million was partially mitigated by (i) a $11.6 million decrease in equity in net earnings from affiliated companies; (ii) a $3.4 million increase in other expense, net; (iii) a $0.7 million increase in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; (iii) a $0.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses (excluding share-based compensation expenses); and (iv) a $0.3 million increase in time charter, voyage and logistics business expenses.\nEBITDA of Navios Logistics was $16.8 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $10.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nFleet Summary Data:\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators indicative of the performance of Navios Holdings' dry bulk operations (excluding the Navios Logistics fleet) and its fleet performance for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThree Month Three Month Period Ended Period Ended March 31, March 31, 201 8 201 7 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Available Days (1) 5,554 5,803 Operating Days (2) 5,517 5,791 Fleet Utilization (3) 99.3 % 99.8 % Equivalent Vessels (4) 62 64 TCE (5) $ 10,983 $ 7,857\n(1) Available days for the fleet are total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Holdings' possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking or special surveys and ballast days relating to voyages. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (2) Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Holdings' vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels. (4) Equivalent Vessels is defined as the total available days during a relevant period divided by the number of days of this period. (5) TCE is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a relevant period divided by the number of available days during the period.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. Adjusted Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share represent Net Loss and Basic Loss per Share, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measures and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets, (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities, (iii) net interest cost, (iv) deferred finance charges and gains/(losses) on bond and debt extinguishment, (v) (provision)/recovery for losses on accounts receivable, (vi) equity in affiliates, net of dividends received, (vii) payments for drydock and special survey costs, (viii) noncontrolling interest, (ix) gain/ (loss) on sale of assets/ subsidiaries, (x) unrealized (loss)/gain on derivatives, and (xi) loss on sale and reclassification to earnings of available-for-sale securities and impairment charges. Navios Holdings believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are a basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and represents useful information to investors regarding Navios Holdings’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Holdings also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used (i) by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide additional information with respect to the ability of Navios Holdings to satisfy its respective obligations, including debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and pay dividends. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as measures of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements, the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used here may not be comparable to those used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Holdings’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and other financing arrangements; and (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, among others, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Holdings’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nNavios Logistics EBITDA is used to measure its operating performance.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of Navios Holdings (including Navios Logistics) and EBITDA of Navios Logistics on a
