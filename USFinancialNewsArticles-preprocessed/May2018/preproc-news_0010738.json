As of the previous close, the Hang Seng has stayed flat this month. ** The top gainers among H-shares were China Railway Group Ltd up 1.43 percent, followed by Huaneng Power International Inc gaining 0.96 percent and CNOOC Ltd up by 0.91 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were China Vanke Co Ltd which was down 3.67 percent, Sinopharm Group which fell 3.5 percent and People’s Insurance Group of China Co Ltd down by 2.7 percent. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 20.12 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng index was 12.5 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 3.2 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Hang Seng index has risen by 1.64 percent to HK$19.94 trillion.
