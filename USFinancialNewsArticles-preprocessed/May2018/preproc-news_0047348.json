Bay County Sheriff’s Office and Panama City Police Department responded to the scene, sheriff’s spokeswoman Ruth Corley said in a phone interview. Panama City Beach Police Department and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also responded, Lawrence said.\nLocal media footage showed several officers with weapons drawn taking cover behind cars. What sounded like gunshots could be heard as a local television reporter conducted a live interview with a witness who said he had heard gunfire.\nPanama City is located on Florida’s panhandle about 80 miles (129 km) west of Tallahassee.
