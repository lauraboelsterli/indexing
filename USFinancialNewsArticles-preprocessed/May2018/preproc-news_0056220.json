Cricket - England vs Pakistan - First Test - Lord's Cricket Ground, London, Britain - May 27, 2018 Pakistan's Imam ul-Haq (R) and Haris Sohail celebrate after winning the First Test Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley\nEngland’s last four wickets tumbled in 27 minutes and Pakistan knocked off the 64 runs they needed in less than an hour on the fourth day to put the touring side 1-0 up in the two-match series.\n“We were not good enough if I’m being brutally honest, we have been outplayed in all three departments,” England captain Joe Root said at the presentation ceremony.\n“Pakistan’s bowlers exploited the conditions well but we played some poor shots and you can’t afford to do that.”\nEngland resumed on 235 for six after Jos Buttler and debutant Dom Bess had shared an unbroken partnership of 125 in the final session on Saturday to save their team from a humiliating innings defeat.\nButtler fell in the second over, trapped lbw by man-of-the-match Mohammad Abbas for 67 and failing to get the decision overturned on review.
