    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has given $30 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund to shore up Republicans as they work towards retaining control of the House of Representatives in the November elections, Politico reported on Thursday.\nLas Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson greets guests before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada February 24, 2017. REUTERS/David Becker Two senior Republicans confirmed the donation to the news outlet. The leadership fund did not return a request for comment.\nThe contribution will become public in the organization’s campaign finance filing this month, Politico said.\nRepublicans secured the donation last week after they convinced Adelson how crucial it was to protect the Republican majority in the House, the report said.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan met with the billionaire at his Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, along with Adelson’s wife, Miriam and Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition, it said.\nCorry Bliss, who oversees the super PAC, and Ryan aide Jake Kastan, also attended, Politico said.\nReporting by Washington newsroom; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
