Each with nearly two decades of service at MVE + Partners, these veterans mark the new face of leadership at the firm.\nThe firm also promoted three senior associate partners – Senior Designer Pieter Berger, Senior Project Manager Luis Estrada, and Director of San Jose Studio Terrence Seah. Additionally, MVE elevated seven rising stars to the titles of associate partner and associate.\n“MVE is experiencing an exciting period of growth and we have great momentum within the organization,” said Matthew McLarand, AIA, president and director of design of MVE + Partners. “Luis, Mark and Sherwin are consummate architectural visionaries and strong, respected leaders within the industry. They’ll now bring these invaluable attributes to the executive team and will play a vital role in ushering in a new era for MVE.”\nLuis Arambula, AIA, NCARB brings to the executive team twenty-five years of experience in the management and delivery of complex commercial architecture. His projects include retail and entertainment, mixed-use, transit-oriented developments, mid-rise and high-rise multifamily residential, student housing, as well as K-12 educational projects. Mr. Arambula’s projects have spanned across northern and southern California, Arizona, Texas, and the Middle East. Luis is responsible for leading the technical studio within MVE that specializes in high-density, Type I mixed-use residential and urban infill projects. He currently splits his time between the company’s Irvine headquarters and its downtown Los Angeles office.\nMark S.

The opening of a San Jose studio will allow us to better serve our growing clientele and support our many projects in the Silicon Valley and Bay Area,” said McLarand.\nNamed senior associate partner, Pieter Berger has been with MVE for thirteen years. As a senior designer he will continue to lead the design vision of multifamily, mixed-use, retail and commercial projects in key domestic and international markets.
