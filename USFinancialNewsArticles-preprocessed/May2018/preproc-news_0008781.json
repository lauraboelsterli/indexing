    "text": "May 2 (Reuters) - Genetic testing specialist Qiagen NV beat expectations for quarterly sales and profit growth on Wednesday, buoyed by strong demand for its tuberculosis test and companion diagnostics, which match patients with the most effective drugs.\nThe company, which has its main operations in Germany but is headquartered in the Netherlands, said first-quarter sales rose 12 percent to $343.6 million, topping the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts for $341 million.\nAdjusted net income jumped 17 percent to $59.6 million, also beating the consensus forecast for $55.8 million.\nQiagen is benefiting from a shift in global healthcare towards personalized medicine where companion diagnostic tests are used to help identify cancer patients most likely to benefit from different treatments.\nSales in its molecular diagnostics business - which accounts for roughly half of sales - rose 9 percent, boosted by its test to detect latent tuberculosis and companion diagnostics.\nThe company is also banking on its automated platform for testing dozens of samples at the same time and its recent acquisition of STAT-Dx, which it hopes will help it capitalize on the shift to take tests out of the lab and onto the hospital floor.\nQiagen reaffirmed its 2018 guidance for net sales growth of 6-7 percent and adjusted diluted earnings per share of about $1.31-1.33, excluding the impact of currencies.
