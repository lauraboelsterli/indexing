    "text": "Adam Jones and Trey Mancini each went 3-for-5 with a homer and three runs to help the Baltimore Orioles roll to a 11-6 victory over the visiting Kansas City Royals on Thursday night at Camden Yards.\nManny Machado also homered as the Orioles racked up 14 hits while winning their second straight contest on the heels of a seven-game slide. Jones had a team-best three RBIs.\nChance Sisco recorded the go-ahead, two-run double in the fourth inning for Baltimore, which was 6-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\nRight-hander Miguel Castro (1-1) pitched 4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief for the Orioles. He allowed four hits and two walks and struck out one.\nSalvador Perez hit a grand slam for the Royals.\nKansas City right-hander Ian Kennedy (1-4) served up three homers while being shellacked for nine runs and eight hits over four innings. He struck out four and walked two.\nOrioles right-hander Chris Tillman lasted just 1 1/3 innings and gave up six runs (five earned) and four hits. He walked three and didn’t strike out a batter.\nBaltimore moved into the lead to stay with a four-run fourth inning.\nRunners were at the corners when Sisco sent a two-run double into the gap in right-center field to give the Orioles a 7-6 lead. Mancini followed by sending a 1-1 fastball over the fence in right to make it a three-run margin.\nAnthony Santander contributed a pinch-hit, run-scoring single in the fifth to make it 10-6. Jonathan Schoop added an RBI single in the sixth to make it a five-run advantage.\nKansas City struck first when it loaded the bases with no outs in the first before Perez sent an 0-2 fastball over the wall in right for a 4-0 lead.\nBaltimore got three runs back in the bottom of the inning when Jones delivered a run-scoring double and Machado followed by driving an 0-1 pitch over the fence in right-center field.\nSoler’s two-run single to center finished Tillman’s outing and gave the Royals a 6-3 lead in the second inning.\nThe Orioles moved back within one when Jones deposited a 2-0 pitch over the fence in left in the third.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
