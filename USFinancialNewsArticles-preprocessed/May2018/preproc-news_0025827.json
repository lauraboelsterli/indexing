    "text": "VANCOUVER, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Artizia Inc. (\"Aritzia\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: ATZ) today announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") has accepted its notice of intention to proceed with a normal course issuer bid.\nAritzia's Board of Directors believes that a normal course issuer bid represents an appropriate and desirable use of its available cash, after investments in stores and strategic infrastructure, to increase shareholder value and is in the best interest of Aritzia and its shareholders. As at February 25, 2018, the Company had approximately $112.5 million of cash on hand. Any purchases made under the normal course issuer bid will be made by Aritzia subject to favourable market conditions at the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition through the facilities of the TSX and/or alternative Canadian trading systems.\nPursuant to the notice, Aritzia may purchase up to 5,429,658 of its subordinate voting shares (\"Shares\"), representing approximately 10% of the public float of 54,296,588 Shares, during the twelve month period commencing May 15, 2018 and ending May 14, 2019. As at April 30, 2018 there were 56,402,240 Shares issued and outstanding. Under the normal course issuer bid, other than purchases made under block purchase exemptions, Aritzia may purchase up to 39,160 Shares on the TSX during any trading day, which represents approximately 25% of 156,642, which represents the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the most recently completed six calendar months prior to the TSX's acceptance of the notice of the NCIB. Any Shares purchased under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled.\nAlthough the Company intends to purchase Shares under its normal course issuer bid, there can be no assurances that any such purchases will be completed. Any purchases made under the normal course issuer bid will be made by Aritzia at the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition and through the facilities of the TSX. The Company may rely on an automatic purchase plan during the NCIB. The automatic purchase plan would allow for purchases by the Company of Shares during certain pre-determined blackout periods, subject to certain parameters and approval of the TSX.\nAbout Aritzia\nAritzia is a vertically integrated, innovative design house of fashion brands. The Company designs apparel and accessories for its collection of exclusive brands. The Company's expansive and diverse range of women's fashion apparel and accessories addresses a broad range of style preferences and lifestyle requirements.
