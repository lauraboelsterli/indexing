    "text": "Continued quarter-over-quarter annual revenue growth and rapid expansion into stress urinary incontinence market planned for Viveve® System\nENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viveve Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:VIVE), a medical technology company focused on women's intimate health, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“For the first quarter of 2018, Viveve recorded sales of $3.7 million demonstrating strong global demand and increasing enthusiasm from physicians for our innovative cryogen-cooled monopolar radiofrequency technology and its clinical applications. We also reached a number of significant milestones that support our global commercialization strategy and set the stage for continuing global adoption of the Viveve® System through the remainder of 2018,” said Scott Durbin, chief executive officer and director of Viveve.\nQ1 2018 Business Highlights\nReceived U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an Investigational Exemption Device (IDE) to conduct VIVEVE II, a multicenter randomized double blinded sham-controlled trial using the Viveve System for the improvement of sexual function; Announced expansion of its cryogen-cooled monopolar radiofrequency (CMRF) technology platform into the Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) market; Reported positive 12-month results from the SUI pilot study conducted by Dr. Bruce Allan in Calgary, Alberta; Announced plans to conduct clinical registration studies to further assess the safety and efficacy of the Viveve System in the treatment SUI; Received regulatory approvals in three Latin America countries; Secured financing of approximately $32.4 million in a February common stock offering.\nQ1 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $3,699,000 from the sale of 53 Viveve systems, 38 of which were sold in North America through direct sales, and approximately 5,400 disposable treatment tips making the company’s current global installed base as of March 31, 2018 – 497 systems, compared to revenue of $3,041,000 for the same period in 2017, a 22% year-over-year quarterly revenue growth.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $1,347,000, or 36% of revenue, compared to gross profit of $1,422,000 or 47% of revenue, for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the mix of products sold in the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $12,687,000, up from $7,838,000 in the same period in 2017, mainly a result of increased costs to support commercialization in North America markets, product development efforts, regulatory and clinical study activities, strategies to protect Viveve’s intellectual property and other general corporate expenses.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $12,669,000, or ($0.49) per share, compared to a net loss of $6,695,000, or ($0.57) per share, for the same period in 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents were $38,378,000 as of March 31, 2018, which includes the recent equity financing that concluded in February 2018.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nViveve continues to anticipate rapid commercial growth and reiterates its 2018 guidance for annual revenue of $22 million to $24 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe company will host a live conference call at 5:00 pm ET today.

The internationally patented Viveve® System, that delivers the Viveve treatment, incorporates clinically-proven cryogen-cooled, monopolar radiofrequency (CMRF) technology to uniformly deliver volumetric heating while gently cooling surface tissue to generate robust neocollagenesis in a single 30-minute in-office session.\nInternational regulatory approvals and clearances have been received for vaginal laxity and/or improvement in sexual function indications from over 55 countries. Viveve received approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March of 2018 to proceed with VIVEVE II, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to assess improvement of sexual function in women following childbirth. Initiation of the trial is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018 and if successful, could support a marketing application for a new U.S. commercial indication. Currently, , the Viveve System is cleared by the FDA for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis.\nViveve has submitted an Investigational Trial Application to the Canadian Ministry of Health and plans to submit an IDE to the FDA to conduct two independent multicenter randomized registration trials (LIBERATE-International and LIBERATE-U.S. respectively) for use of the CMRF device in stress urinary incontinence treatment.\nInControl Products by Viveve are FDA cleared medical devices that treat stress, urge, and mixed incontinence conditions and products to improve pelvic floor strength. Viveve exclusively distributes InControl Medical's products to healthcare providers .\nFor more information visit Viveve's website at www.viveve.com .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAll statements that are not based on historical fact are \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
