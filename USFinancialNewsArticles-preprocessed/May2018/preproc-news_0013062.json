(Nasdaq:ADMS) today reported financial results and pipeline updates for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with the first quarter of commercialization of GOCOVRI and we are very encouraged by the positive reception we have received from physicians, patients and care partners,” stated Gregory T. Went, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. “In addition, our development pipeline continues to advance with the enrollment of patients in our Phase 3 trial of ADS-5102 for multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment, and we received positive feedback from the FDA on our clinical development plans for ADS-4101, which will allow the program to advance directly into pivotal Phase 3 trials in epilepsy patients with partial onset seizures.”\nRecent Highlights\nFulfilled 1,608 paid prescriptions of GOCOVRI, the first and only FDA-approved medicine indicated for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, in the first quarter of 2018 Received GOCOVRI prescriptions from 550 distinct prescribers through March 31, 2018 Reported final data from EASE LID 2, the two-year Phase 3 open-label study of GOCOVRI for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy demonstrating durability of effect out to two years Presented GOCOVRI-related basic research and clinical data at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting Published a manuscript in CNS Drugs showing that 52 percent of GOCOVRI-treated patients in the pooled Phase 3 studies reported a complete resolution of their ON time with troublesome dyskinesia by Week 12 Initiated a Phase 3 study of ADS-5102 (amantadine) extended release capsules in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment Received positive feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the clinical development plans for ADS-4101 (lacosamide) modified release capsules in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAdamas recorded revenues from the sale of GOCOVRI of $2.6 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The full commercial launch of GOCOVRI occurred on January 8, 2018, so there were no similar product sales for the first quarter of 2017. The company recognizes revenue using the sell-in method, typically when products are delivered to the specialty pharmacy.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $7.2 million, including $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to $7.1 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, which included $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $26.4 million, including $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, compared to $9.1 million for the same quarter in the prior year, which included $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nAdamas reported a net loss of $35.0 million, or $1.35 per share, basic and diluted, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $16.0 million, or $0.72 per share, basic and diluted, for the first quarter of 2017. The net losses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 included $3.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nCash Position\nAdamas ended the quarter with $286.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities, compared to $176.4 million at December 31, 2017. This includes $134.3 million net proceeds the company received from a public offering in January 2018.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nAdamas will host a conference call and webcast today, May 3, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call may be accessed by dialing 844-215-3280 for participants in the U.S. or Canada and 484-747-6383 for international callers.

GOCOVRI is a high-dose 274 mg amantadine (340 mg amantadine hydrochloride) taken once-daily at bedtime, which delivers high levels of amantadine upon waking and throughout the day. Data from two pivotal, placebo-controlled clinical studies in approximately 200 patients demonstrated statistically significant reduction in dyskinesia, as well as a secondary benefit in OFF time in patients dosed with GOCOVRI. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with GOCOVRI were hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, fall and orthostatic hypotension. For more information about GOCOVRI, including complete safety information, please see the U.S. Prescribing Information at www.gocovri.com .\nAbout ADS-4101\nADS-4101 is an investigational drug in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Derived from Adamas’ validated time-dependent biology approach to drug development, ADS-4101 is a potential high-dose, once-daily at bedtime lacosamide therapy, with a drug profile that provides high concentrations of lacosamide during the day to match the time when seizures occur most often. Lacosamide is an anti-epilepsy active ingredient previously approved by the FDA and currently marketed as VIMPAT ® (lacosamide).\nAbout Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAdamas’ goal is to create and commercialize a new generation of medicines intended to lessen the burden of chronic neurologic diseases on patients, caregivers and society using its deep understanding of time-dependent biology. The company is focused on the commercial launch of GOCOVRI™ (amantadine) extended release capsules (previously ADS-5102), the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, and delivering on its pipeline of differentiated investigational programs. Those programs include: ADS-5102 in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis walking impairment; and ADS-4101, a high-dose, modified release lacosamide in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy.
