If you win in a pool, there's already potential leakers of your business from the get-go.\nTop 10 Powerball jackpots Amount Date won Where winning tickets were purchased $1.586 Billion Jan. 13, 2016 California, Florida, Tennessee $758.7 Million Aug. 23, 2017 Massachusetts $590.5 Million May 18, 2013 Florida $587.5 Million Nov. 28, 201 Arizona, Missouri $564.1 Million Feb. 11, 2015 North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Texas $559.7 Million Jan. 6, 2018 New Hampshire $487.0 Million July 30, 2016 New Hampshire $456.7 Million March 17, 2018 Pennsylvania $448.4 Million Aug. 7, 2013 Minnesota, New Jersey, New Jersey $447.8 Million June 10, 2017 California Past lottery winners have discovered the hard way that the more people who know they've won, the greater the chance they'll be approached for things like personal loans, handouts, investment opportunities and charitable donations.\nThere's also the challenge of figuring out exactly how to split the winnings. There are tax considerations, and some states have limits on how many checks they will cut. In that case, winners would end up turning to a more complex solution, such as forming a trust.\n\"Say there are 15 people who win a lot of money. Getting 15 people to agree on anything is difficult,\" Kurland said. \"And then if they each get their own attorney, you've got 15 attorneys who are supposed to agree.\"\nIf you've already gone in on tickets or want to despite the potential pitfalls, at least make sure the pool's coordinator documents the whole affair.\nshow chapters This is what you do if you win the lottery 3:18 PM ET Fri, 23 March 2018 | 01:18 \"The person should give a copy of the tickets and a list of [participants] to everyone who's in the pool,\" Kurland said.\nThis protects the people in the pool and the organizer.\nHow much home you can really buy with $300,000\nThe number of 401(k) plan millionaires hits new high\nSEC sets up bogus coin offering site to warn investors what scams look like\n\"That way, if the person who's in charge also bought a ticket on their own and it ends up winning, there's a way to prove it wasn't part of the pool,\" Kurland said.\nThe simpler thing is just to buy tickets on your own.\nThe odds of nabbing the jackpot is 1 in 292.2 million for a single ticket, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Buying more than one — whether through an office pool or on your own — doesn't increase your chances by much.\n\"You're still talking about huge odds,\" Kurland said.",
