    "text": "TORONTO, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (“Kirkland Lake Gold” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:KL) (NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a share purchase agreement with Artemis Resources Limited (“Artemis”) to acquire 4,000,000 common shares (the “Shares”) of Novo Resources Corp. (“Novo”) at a price of C$5.00 per Share for a total purchase price of C$20,000,000 (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition is scheduled to close on or before May 31, 2018.\nCurrently, the Company holds 25,830,268 Shares and 14,000,0000 Novo common share purchase warrants (the “Warrants”), representing an approximate 16.33% undiluted interest and an approximate 23.14% partially diluted interest in Novo, assuming the exercise of the Warrants. Upon closing of the Acquisition, assuming there is no change in the issued and outstanding share capital of Novo as of the date hereof, Kirkland Lake Gold will hold 29,830,268 Shares and 14,000,000 Warrants, representing approximately 18.86% of the outstanding common shares of Novo on an undiluted basis and approximately 25.46% of the outstanding shares on a partially diluted basis, assuming the exercise of the Warrants.\nPursuant to a prior agreement entered into between Artemis and Novo, the Shares are subject to a contractual restriction on resale until August 23, 2018. Accordingly, pursuant to the share purchase agreement closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including the written consent of Novo to the sale of the Shares and the Company has agreed to be bound to the resale restrictions in favour of Novo until August 23, 2018.\nThe Shares are being acquired for investment purposes. Kirkland Lake Gold has a long-term view of the investment and may acquire additional securities either on the open market or through private acquisitions, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory and/or shareholder approvals, as required, or sell the securities either on the open market or through private dispositions in the future depending on market conditions, reformulation of plans and/or other relevant factors. Kirkland Lake Gold is relying on the private agreement exemption in section 4.2 of National Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids , in connection with the Acquisition.\nThis press release is being issued in pursuant to National Instrument 62-103 – The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues , which also requires a report to be filed with the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which Novo is a reporting issuer containing information with respect to the foregoing matters (the “Early Warning Report”). A copy of the Early Warning Report will be filed on Novo’s profile on SEDAR and may also be obtained by contacting the Company at 416-840-7884 or by email at info@klgold.com .\nAbout Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.\nKirkland Lake Gold Ltd. is a mid-tier gold producer that in 2018 is targeting over 620,000 ounces of gold production from mines in Canada and Australia.
