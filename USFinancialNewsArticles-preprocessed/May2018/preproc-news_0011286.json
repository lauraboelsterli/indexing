View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006504/en/\nParlo’s unique algorithms make interacting with machines more conversational, which makes getting work done faster, easier and more enjoyable. ServiceNow will add the Parlo technology across its entire suite of services on the Now Platform TM . This acquisition signals the company’s continuing investment in the power of AI to free employees to do more meaningful and satisfying work and accelerate positive business outcomes.\nNLU addresses a challenging area for AI: understanding the nuances of human language. People effortlessly understand mispronunciations, swapped words, contractions and jargon, but everyday conversations can be challenging for machines. NLU helps overcome that hurdle, transforming machines into more productive, conversational co-workers. Just as AI and NLU are making our homes smarter and our personal lives easier, ServiceNow is committed to enabling the same conversational convenience at work.\n“We are rapidly moving away from structured data such as filling in forms and data fields, towards unstructured interactions with machines such as free-form text, voice and gestures. Our goal is to make every day work interactions simple, accessible and natural for everyone,” said Pat Casey, senior vice president of DevOps, ServiceNow.\n“Our technology helps machines make sense of human speech, allowing employees to use systems naturally and not forcing them to speak or think like a machine,” said Murali Subbarao, Parlo CEO. “This transaction allows our work to have a positive impact on hundreds of thousands of people by making their work experience easier, more efficient and more satisfying.”\nServiceNow’s intelligent automation capabilities help:\nImprove agent-employee and customer interactions with more human-like conversations Drive complex actions to resolution quickly thorough intelligent agents Automate filling out forms and prioritizing service tickets Make it faster and easier for partners and customers to develop intelligent apps using the Now Platform\nTweet this: #ServiceNow acquires Parlo, #AI workforce solution, frees employees to do more meaningful and satisfying work https://svc.work/2I5Yw5f\nFor more information on the Now Platform, please visit this site .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains about the expectations, beliefs, plans, intentions and strategies relating to ServiceNow’s acquisition of Parlo.
