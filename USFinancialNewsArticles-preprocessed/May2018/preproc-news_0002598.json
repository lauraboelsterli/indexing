    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders in Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) vote against ratifying the actions of the management and supervisory boards at the lender’s 2018 annual general meeting next month.\nFILE PHOTO: A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo German companies typically ask shareholders to approve the actions of their boards over the previous year at the annual shareholder meetings. Votes against the boards’ actions amount to a vote of no confidence but are largely symbolic.\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment.\n“There seems to be strong consensus that performance has fallen well short of expectations, that restructuring measures have taken too long to be implemented and have yet to yield any substantial results,” Glass Lewis wrote in a report.\nLast week Deutsche Bank, under new Chief Executive Christian Sewing, announced it was paring back its global investment bank after a sharp fall in quarterly earnings.\nDeutsche’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled to take place on May 24.\n(This story has been refiled to correct spelling in headline.)\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
