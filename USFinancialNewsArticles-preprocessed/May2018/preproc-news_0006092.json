    "text": "HOUSTON, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Era Group Inc. (NYSE:ERA) today reported a net loss attributable to the Company of $1.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (“current quarter”) on operating revenues of $57.3 million compared to net income attributable to the Company of $61.7 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (“preceding quarter”) on operating revenues of $57.5 million. The preceding quarter results included an income tax benefit of approximately $70 million due to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was $12.7 million in the current quarter compared to $2.0 million in the preceding quarter. EBITDA adjusted to exclude gains on asset dispositions and special items was $8.1 million in the current quarter compared to $4.7 million in the preceding quarter. Gains on asset dispositions were $4.4 million in the current quarter compared to losses of $0.5 million in the preceding quarter. Special items in the current quarter consisted of a $0.2 million gain on debt extinguishment on the early repayment of certain debt in Brazil. Special items in the preceding quarter consisted of $2.0 million in non-cash charges related to the Company's Brazil subsidiary entering the Tax Special Regularization Program (the \"PERT\" program) and $0.2 million of other non-cash items.\n“The positive momentum in offshore oil and gas customer activity, which began in mid-2017, further accelerated in the first quarter of 2018, with oil and gas revenues 2% higher on a sequential quarter basis and 10% higher on a year-over-year basis,” said Chris Bradshaw, President and Chief Executive Officer of Era Group Inc. “The improvements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico market were even more pronounced, up 4% on a sequential quarter basis and 21% higher on a year-over-year basis.”\n“Profitability in the first quarter was adversely impacted by $3.9 million of non-routine professional services fees. We continue to prioritize the protection of our strong balance sheet. We generated $19.5 million of cash from asset sales in the first quarter, and net debt was reduced by $14.0 million.”\nSequential Quarter Results\nOperating revenues in the current quarter were comparable to the preceding quarter, as higher oil and gas revenues were offset by lower dry-leasing revenues.\nOperating expenses were $6.7 million lower in the current quarter primarily due to decreased repairs and maintenance costs related to the timing of repairs and the recognition of power-by-the-hour (“PBH”) credits resulting from the removal of helicopters from PBH programs following their sale. In addition, the preceding quarter included the adverse accounting impact for the PERT program in Brazil.\nAdministrative and general expenses were $1.2 million higher in the current quarter primarily due to an increase in professional services fees.\nIn the current quarter, the Company sold its flightseeing assets in Alaska (which consisted of eight single engine helicopters, two operating facilities, and related property and equipment), two additional single engine helicopters, two light twin helicopters and other equipment for proceeds of $19.5 million, resulting in net gains of $4.4 million. In the preceding quarter, we sold or otherwise disposed of one helicopter and other equipment, resulting in a loss of $0.5 million.\nInterest expense was $0.6 million lower in the current quarter primarily due to accrued interest recognized in the preceding quarter resulting from the correction of immaterial accounting errors, partially offset by the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the amendment of the Company’s Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Facility”) in the current quarter.\nIncome tax benefit was $73.9 million lower primarily due to the impact of changes in U.S. tax legislation in the preceding quarter.\nCalendar Quarter Results\nOperating revenues in the current quarter were $2.8 million higher compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (“prior year quarter”) primarily due to higher utilization of medium and heavy helicopters servicing oil and gas activities. These increases were partially offset by lower emergency response and dry-leasing revenues due to the end of contracts.\nOperating expenses were comparable to the prior year quarter, as lower personnel and other operating expenses were offset by higher fuel and repairs and maintenance expenses.\nAdministrative and general expenses were $1.7 million higher in the current quarter primarily due to increased professional services fees, partially offset by lower compensation costs.\nDepreciation expense was $1.2 million lower in the current quarter primarily due to lower depreciation on the Company’s H225 helicopters following their impairment subsequent to the prior year quarter.\nInterest expense was $1.0 million higher in the current quarter primarily due to the capitalization of interest in the prior year quarter and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the amendment of the Facility in the current quarter.\nIncome tax benefit was $1.4 million lower in the current quarter primarily due to lower pre-tax loss and a lower effective tax rate following changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nNet loss attributable to the Company was $1.2 million in the current quarter compared to $5.6 million in the prior year quarter. EBITDA was $5.7 million higher in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. EBITDA adjusted to exclude gains on asset dispositions and special items was $1.2 million higher in the current quarter. Gains on asset dispositions were $4.4 million in the current quarter compared to $0.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nCapital Commitments\nThe Company had unfunded capital commitments of $87.1 million as of March 31, 2018. The Company may terminate all of its commitments without further liability other than aggregate liquidated damages of $2.2 million.\nIncluded in these capital commitments are agreements to purchase three AW189 heavy helicopters and five AW169 light twin helicopters. The AW189 helicopters are scheduled to be delivered in 2019. Delivery dates for the AW169 helicopters have yet to be determined. In addition, we had outstanding options to purchase up to ten additional AW189 helicopters. If these options are exercised, the helicopters would be scheduled for delivery in 2019 and 2020.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $16.6 million in cash balances and $96.7 million of remaining availability under the Facility for total liquidity of $113.2 million. As of March 31, 2018, our senior secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Facility, was 0.8x compared to the covenant requirement of not more than 3.25x, and our interest coverage ratio was 2.5x compared to the covenant requirement of not less than 1.75x.\nConference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call starting at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT) on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, to review the results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.

EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest (includes interest income and interest expense), Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for certain items noted in the reconciliation below that occur during the reported period. We include EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Accordingly, they should not be used as an indicator of, or an alternative to, net income as a measure of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements, such as debt service requirements. Because the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (or similar measures) may vary among companies and industries, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Each of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and therefore should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Net loss $ (1,357 ) $ 61,459 $ (81,215 ) $ (3,072 ) $ (5,787 ) Depreciation and amortization 10,354 10,101 12,103 11,978 11,554 Interest income (146 ) (119 ) (206 ) (185 ) (250 ) Interest expense 4,576 5,143 4,097 3,934 3,589 Income tax benefit (738 ) (74,599 ) (45,237 ) (726 ) (2,103 ) EBITDA $ 12,689 $ 1,985 $ (110,458 ) $ 11,929 $ 7,003 Special items (1) (175 ) 2,183 117,018 615 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,514 $ 4,168 $ 6,560 $ 12,544 $ 7,003 Gains on asset dispositions, net (“Gains”) (4,414 ) 541 122 (5,061 ) (109 ) Adjusted EBITDA excluding gains $ 8,100 $ 4,709 $ 6,682 $ 7,483 $ 6,894\nSpecial items include the following: In the three months ended March 31, 2018, a $0.2 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to a previously settled tax dispute in Brazil. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, $2.0 million in non-cash charges related to our Brazil subsidiary entering the PERT program and $0.2 million of other non-cash items. In the three months ended September 30, 2017, non-cash impairment charges of $117.0 million primarily related to the impairment of the Company’s H225 model helicopters; and In the three months ended June 30, 2017, $0.6 million of severance-related expenses due to changes in senior management.\nThe Facility requires that the Company maintain certain financial ratios on a rolling four-quarter basis. The interest coverage ratio is a trailing four-quarter quotient of (i) EBITDA (as defined in the Facility) less dividends and distributions divided by (ii) interest expense. The interest coverage ratio is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The senior secured leverage ratio is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of secured debt for borrowed money, capital lease obligations and guaranties of obligations of non-consolidated entities by (ii) EBITDA (as defined in the Facility). The senior secured leverage ratio is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. EBITDA is calculated differently under the Facility than as presented elsewhere in this release.\nERA GROUP INC.\nFLEET COUNTS (1)\n(unaudited) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sep 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Heavy: S92 4 3 3 3 2 H225 9 9 9 9 9 AW189 4 4 4 4 2 17 16 16 16 13 Medium: AW139 36 36 36 36 36 S76 C+/C++ 5 5 5 5 5 B212 6 6 6 6 7 47 47 47 47 48 Light—twin engine: A109 7 7 7 7 7 EC135 15 15 15 15 15 EC145 — 2 3 3 4 BK117 2 2 2 2 2 BO105 3 3 3 3 3 27 29 30 30 31 Light—single engine: A119 13 14 14 14 14 AS350 17 26 26 26 27 30 40 40 40 41 Total Helicopters 121 132 133 133 133",
