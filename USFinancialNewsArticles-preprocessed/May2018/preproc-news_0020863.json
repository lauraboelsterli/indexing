(“AC” or the “Company”) reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\n($000s except AUM and per share data)\nQ1 2018 2017 AUM - end of period (in millions) $ 1,560 $ 1,349 Revenues 4,703 4,987 Operating loss (4,250 ) (4,332 ) Investment and other non-operating income/(expense), net (a) (24,856 ) (17,109 ) Loss before income taxes (29,106 ) (21,441 ) Net loss (22,229 ) (13,078 ) Net loss per share - diluted $ (0.95 ) $ (0.55 ) Shares outstanding at March 31 (thousands) 23,133 24,248 (a) See below for a discussion of the adoption of new accounting guidance First Quarter Overview\nOur operating loss for the quarter was $4.3 million in line with the comparable year ago quarter. First quarter operating revenues were down $0.3 from the prior year quarter, but expenses, primarily compensation, decreased by $0.4 million.\nFirst quarter investment and other non-operating income/(expense), net was a loss of $24.9 million compared to $17.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2017 primarily reflecting mark-to-market losses on our investment portfolio partially offset by the absence of a $4.9 million shareholder-designated contribution in the year ago period. In comparing the current quarter’s results with those of the year ago period, it is important to note the impact of a change in the accounting treatment of available for sale (“AFS”) equity securities. In prior periods, the change in unrealized gains or losses attributable to AFS equity securities was reflected in equity and classified as other comprehensive income rather than net income. Beginning with this quarter, however, the mark-to-market adjustments for the entire portfolio flow through net income. On a comparable basis, the first quarter 2017 investment and other non-operating income/(expense), net would have been a loss of $0.6 million.\nDespite the higher pre-tax loss, the Company recorded a lower income tax benefit in the current quarter of $6.7 million compared to $8.4 million in the comparable quarter of 2017. This decreased tax benefit primarily resulted from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% under the recently-enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\nAs a result of the factors noted above, net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $22.2 million or $0.95 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $13.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. On a comparable basis of accounting for AFS securities, the year ago period would have reported a net loss of $2.5 million (i.e., the Company’s reported comprehensive income).\nFinancial Condition\nIn November 2015, GAMCO (“GBL”) issued a PIK note to AC with an initial face value of $250 million (the “GAMCO Note”) as part of AC’s spin-off. During the first quarter of 2018, GBL repaid $10 million of the GAMCO Note, reducing the outstanding principal to $40 million. Under GAAP, the balance of the GAMCO Note is treated as a reduction of equity.\nAt March 31, 2018, AC’s book value on a GAAP basis was $888 million, or $38.38 per share, compared to $918 million, or $38.84 per share, at December 31, 2017. The decline in GAAP book value per share primarily reflects our net loss partially offset by the $10 million repayment of the GAMCO Note.\nManagement believes that the analysis of adjusted economic book value (“AEBV”), defined as total GAAP equity plus the outstanding balance of the GAMCO Note, is useful in analyzing the Company’s financial condition. Please note that both of these are non-GAAP financial measures. AEBV per share was $40.11 at March 31, 2018 compared to $40.96 per share at prior year-end:\n($000s except per share data)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31 2017 Total Per Share Total Per Share Total equity as reported $ 887,794 $ 38.38 $ 918,147 $ 38.84 Add: GAMCO Note 40,000 1.73 50,000 2.12 Adjusted economic book value $ 927,794 $ 40.11 $ 968,147 $ 40.96 First Quarter Results of Operations\nAssets Under Management (AUM)\nMarch 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (in millions) Event Merger Arbitrage $ 1,407 $ 1,384 $ 1,144 Event-Driven Value 88 91 141 Other 65 66 64 Total AUM $ 1,560 $ 1,541 $ 1,349 Assets Under Management at March 31, 2018 were $1.6 billion, an increase of $211 million from $1.3 billion at March 31, 2017. This increase reflects $69 million of net appreciation and $142 million of net capital inflows. Year over year asset flows included Gabelli Merger Plus+ Trust PLC (GMP:LN), the Company’s first closed-end fund which launched in July 2017. GAMCO International SICAV – GAMCO Merger Arbitrage, our UCITS fund, also saw significant capital flows over the year as it gains traction on a number of platforms.\nRevenues\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4.7 million versus $5.0 million in the comparable prior year period:\nInvestment advisory fees increased to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $2.4 million in the comparable 2017 quarter, due to higher assets under management. Institutional research services revenue was $2.2 million in the first quarter 2017, down $0.4 million from the year ago quarter.\nIncentive fees are not recognized until the measurement period ends and the fee is crystalized, typically annually on December 31. If the measurement period had ended on March 31, we would have recognized an immaterial amount for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInvestment and other non-operating income/(expense), net\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, investment and other non-operating income/(expense), net was a loss of $24.9 million compared to $17.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. Investment losses were $27.5 million and $14.4 million in the 2018 and 2017 quarters, respectively, primarily a function of mark-to-market changes in the value of our investments.\nDividends on the GBL shares and interest income from the GAMCO Note were $0.6 million in the 2018 quarter versus $1.1 million in the comparable quarter in 2017 primarily due to the reduction in the balance of the GAMCO Note.\nBusiness and Investment Highlights\nEvent Driven Asset Management\nOur merger arbitrage fund launched in February 1985 was essentially unchanged for the quarter. This compares favorably to the overall equity markets which saw declines and highlights the uncorrelated nature of this investment style. Global M&A activity remained strong, and we expect that corporate confidence, strong balance sheets, accommodative credit markets and repatriation of overseas profits as a result of tax reform will continue to propel corporate merger activity. Merger arbitrage returns should also benefit from a rising interest rate environment and increasing deal spreads as a result of heightened market volatility.\nInstitutional Research\nDuring the past quarter, Gabelli & Company, our institutional research services business, sponsored three investment conferences:\nPump, Valve, & Water Systems – 28 th Annual\nWaste & Environmental Services – 4 th Annual\nSpecialty Chemicals – 9 th Annual\nWe also hosted several non-deal roadshows to connect institutional investors and senior executives of companies followed by our research analysts.\nOn Friday, May 4, 2018, Gabelli & Company hosted its 12 th Annual Omaha Research Trip which included local site tours, management meetings, and topical discussions followed by Columbia Business School’s annual Omaha dinner and noted investment panel underwritten by Gabelli.\nWe continue to increase the presence of our analysts on social media platforms. We invite you to follow us on the Gabelli TV channel on YouTube ( www.youtube.com ) or Facebook ( www.facebook.com/GabelliTV ) and receive frequent, real-time updates from our analysts.\nShareholder Compensation\nAt March 31, 2018, there were 3.9 million Class A and 19.2 million Class B shares outstanding.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company completed a tender offer for approximately 500,000 Class A shares in exchange for approximately 670,000 GBL shares. Following the exchange offer, we continue to hold 3.7 million shares of GBL valued at $92.5 million at the end of the quarter.\nIncluding the exchange offer, the Company repurchased shares at an average investment of $35.91 per share, for a total of $18.2 million. Since the spin-off of the Company from GAMCO, we have returned approximately $81 million to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 2.5 million shares.\nIn addition, the Board of Directors declared a $0.10 dividend per share payable on July 2, 2018 to its shareholders of record on June 18, 2018.\nOther\nThe Company expects to post future earnings announcements solely on its website, associated-capital-group.com , under “Investor Relations”.\nAbout Associated Capital Group, Inc.\nThe Company has been publicly traded since November 30, 2015 following its spin-off from GAMCO Investors, Inc.\nThe Company operates its investment management business via Gabelli & Company Investment Advisers, Inc.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThe financial results set forth in this press release are preliminary. Our disclosure and analysis in this press release, which do not present historical information, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, the economy and other conditions, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Therefore, you should proceed with caution in relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.\nForward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include a decline in the securities markets that adversely affect our assets under management, negative performance of our products, the failure to perform as required under our investment management agreements, and a general downturn in the economy that negatively impacts our operations. We also direct your attention to the more specific discussions of these and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors contained in our Form 10 and other public filings. Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006817/en/\nAssociated Capital Group, Inc.\nFrancis J.
