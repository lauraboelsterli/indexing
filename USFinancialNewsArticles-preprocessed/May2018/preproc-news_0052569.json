U.S. first lady Melania Trump hosts a roundtable discussion with tech leaders on the effects of the Internet on children, at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\nThe first lady, 48, had been recovering at Walter Reed medical center since Monday, when she underwent an embolization procedure to treat the kidney condition.\nSpokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that the first lady returned to the White House on Saturday morning.\n“She is resting comfortably and remains in high spirits,” Grisham said. “Our office has received thousands of calls and emails wishing Mrs. Trump well, and we thank everyone who has taken the time to reach out.”\nAn embolization is a minimally invasive procedure often used to block the flow of blood to a tumor or an abnormal area of tissue.
