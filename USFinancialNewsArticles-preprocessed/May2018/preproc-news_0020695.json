    "text": "MONTREAL, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PyroGenesis Canada Inc. ( http://pyrogenesis.com ) (TSX-V:PYR), a TSX Venture 50® high-tech company, (the \"Company\", the “Corporation” or \"PyroGenesis\") a Company that designs, develops and manufactures plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch systems, is pleased to announce today the appointment of Mr. Andrew Abdalla as an independent director and Chair of the Audit Committee.\nMr. Abdalla, CPA, CA, is a partner at MNP, a leading national accounting, tax and business consulting firm in Canada. Mr. Abdalla brings to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) more than 20 years of strategic planning, and tax advice, with a specific focus on sales and income tax, acquisitions and divestitures, business valuations, corporate reorganizations and spinoffs. Mr. Abdalla received his Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA, CA) designation in 1987. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce and a graduate diploma in public accounting from Concordia University in Montreal.\nMr. Abdalla was the Company’s auditor for the 15 years prior to KPMG taking on that role, and as such, has extensive valuable knowledge and background of the Company’s operations.\n“On behalf of the Board, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Andrew as its newest independent member and Audit Committee Chair,” said Mr. P. Peter Pascali, CEO and President of PyroGenesis. “Not only does Andrew bring to the Board an impressive set of financial and accounting skills, but he also brings a unique familiarity, not only of the Company, but of the specific requirements demanded of a Chair of an Audit Committee. Andrew’s extensive history of having to deal with Audit Chairs, as Audit partner, lends itself well to this position. We are looking forward to having him add his expertise, to that of the Board’s, during this exciting time in the Company's evolution.\nMr. Abdalla has been granted an option to acquire 250,000 common shares of the Corporation (the “Common Shares”). The stock options have an exercise price of $0.52 per Common Share and are exercisable over a period of five (5) years. The options are granted in accordance with the Corporation’s stock option plan. The appointment of Mr. Abdalla, and the grant of options, remain subject to regulatory and Exchange approval.\nAbout PyroGenesis Canada Inc.\nPyroGenesis Canada Inc., a TSX Venture 50 ® high-tech company, is the world leader in the design, development, manufacture and commercialization of advanced plasma processes.
