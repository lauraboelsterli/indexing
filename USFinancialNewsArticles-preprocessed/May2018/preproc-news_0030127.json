    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Police on Sunday scoured the background of a Chechnya-born Frenchman who killed a man in a knife attack in Paris, questioning the parents and a friend of the 21-year old, who had been flagged previously as a potential security risk.\nThe assailant had shouted “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as he began his stabbing rampage late on Saturday. He fatally knifed a 29-year-old man and wounded four others, among them a Chinese and a Luxembourg citizen, before police shot him dead.\nA judicial source named the attacker as Khamzat A, without giving his full name, which BFM TV and other French media said was Azimov.\nThe attack took place in the bustling Opera district, known for its many restaurants, cafes and the Palais Garnier opera.\nIt was the latest in a succession of attacks in France since January 2015 in which more than 240 people have died.\nThe attacker had since 2016 been on a counter-terrorism watchlist of suspected radicals who may be a threat to national security, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.\nThe stabbing again exposed the difficulty European intelligence services face keeping track of suspected extremists and countering the threat posed by homegrown militants and foreign jihadists.\nFrance has participated in a U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and it also intervened in Mali to push back an Islamist rebellion in the West African state.\nIts military interventions overseas have exposed it to attack by Islamist militants at home.\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack, but provided no proof. Griveaux said the claim had not yet been fully authenticated.\nIn a video which the SITE intelligence monitoring group said had been posted by Islamic State’s Amaq news agency, a young man described as the attacker pledges allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nSpeaking in French, his face largely obscured by a black hood and scarf, he said “infidels” fighting Islamic State were to blame. “You started it by killing Muslims,” he said.\nIt was not immediately possible to confirm the identity of the man in the video.\nThe assailant became French when his mother obtained citizenship in 2010, Griveaux said in a joint interview with broadcasters LCI and RTL and newspaper Le Figaro.\nHe rejected criticism from opponents of President Emmanuel Macron that the government was not doing enough to stem such attacks, saying: “Zero risk does not exist.”\nJudicial sources said the assailant’s parents as well as a friend of his were being held for questioning. The friend, arrested in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, was born in 1997, a source said.\nBFM TV said the attacker had long lived in Strasbourg before moving to Paris last year.\nA local elected official told Reuters that about 40 to 50 Chechen families lived in that area of Strasbourg, not mixing much with other people.\n“I’ve been sounding the alarm since 2008-2009. This is fertile ground for radicalization,” Eric Elkouby, a Socialist, said of the area, which he said was impoverished and had been neglected by authorities.\n“WE HID UNDER THE TABLE” Macron said France would “not yield an inch to the enemies of freedom,” and praised police for “neutralizing the terrorist”.\nPolice union representative Rocco Contento told Reuters the attacker had rushed at police on Saturday evening, shouting “I will kill you, I will kill you!” after stabbing bystanders.\nHe was then shot by the officers.\n“It was scary,” said Emma Klibbe, a 32-year old Australian who was waiting to get into a nearby restaurant and saw a man walk by who was injured in the attack.\n“We heard someone shout and then a woman screamed ‘run inside!’ We ran inside and hid under the table,” said Klibbe, who teaches English in Paris.\nThe four people wounded were out of danger, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters.\nA picture seen by Reuters showed a bare-chested and bearded young man dressed in black sweatpants lying on the ground and being helped by emergency services. A source said he was the attacker.\n“We heard gun fire, two gun shots,” said waitress Sarah Gousse. “The street was just filled with police and firemen and they tried to revive him (the attacker).”\nIn October, in an incident similar to Saturday’s, a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before he was shot dead by soldiers.\nThe deadliest of the attacks that have hit France over the past three years occurred in Paris in November 2015, when 130 people were killed.\nFrench police secure a street after a man killed a passer-by in a knife attack in the heart of Paris and injured four others before being shot dead by police, according to French authorities in Paris, France, May 12, 2018.
