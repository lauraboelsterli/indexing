tenant improvements of approximately $1,552, and $1,192 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Definitions\nAcquisition Capital Expenditures : We define Acquisition Capital Expenditures as Recurring and Non-Recurring Capital Expenditures identified at the time of acquisition. Acquisition Capital Expenditures also include new lease commissions and tenant improvements for space that was not occupied under the Company's ownership.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDAre), and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre : We define EBITDAre in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). EBITDAre represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on the sale of rental property, and loss on impairments. Adjusted EBITDAre further excludes property acquisition costs, termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, non-cash compensation, intangible amortization in rental income, gain or loss on involuntary conversion, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on incentive fee, and other non-recurring items.\nWe define Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as Adjusted EBITDAre multiplied by four. We define Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre as Adjusted EBITDAre plus incremental Adjusted EBITDAre adjusted for a full period of acquisitions and dispositions. Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre does not reflect the Company's historical results and does not predict future results, which may be substantially different.\nEBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre should be compared with our reported net income or net loss in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDAre are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they are direct measures of the actual operating results of our properties. We also use these measures in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers.\nCapitalization Rate : We define Capitalization Rate as the estimated weighted average cash Capitalization Rate, calculated by dividing (i) the Company's estimate of year one cash net operating income from the applicable property's operations stabilized for occupancy (post-lease-up for vacant properties), which does not include termination income, miscellaneous other income, capital expenditures, general and administrative costs, reserves, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, credit loss, or vacancy loss, by (ii) the GAAP purchase price plus estimated Acquisition Capital Expenditures. These Capitalization Rate estimates are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties, and factors that are beyond our control, including those risk factors contained in our for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash Rent Change : We define Cash Rent Change as the percentage change in the base rent of the lease executed during the period compared to the base rent of the Comparable Lease for assets included in the Operating Portfolio. The calculation compares the first base rent payment due after the lease commencement date compared to the base rent of the last monthly payment due prior to the termination of the lease, excluding holdover rent. Rent under gross or similar type leases are converted to a net rent based on an estimate of the applicable recoverable expenses.\nComparable Lease : We define a Comparable Lease as a lease in the same space with a similar lease structure as compared to the previous in-place lease, excluding new leases for space that was not occupied under our ownership.\nFunds from Operations (FFO), Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO (AFFO) : We define FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Core FFO and AFFO exclude property acquisition costs, intangible amortization in rental income, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, gain (loss) on swap ineffectiveness, loss on incentive fee, and non-recurring other expenses. AFFO also excludes non-rental property depreciation and amortization, straight-line rent adjustments, non-cash portion of interest expense, non-cash compensation expense and deducts Recurring Capital Expenditures and lease renewal commissions and tenant improvements.\nNone of FFO, Core FFO or AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, these measurements should be compared with our reported net income or net loss in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. We use FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs. FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. We and investors may use Core FFO and AFFO similarly as FFO.\nHowever, because FFO, Core FFO and AFFO exclude, among other items, depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our buildings that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our buildings, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of these measures as measures of our performance is limited. In addition, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Similarly, our calculations of Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other REITs.\nGAAP : U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nLiquidity : We define Liquidity as the amount of aggregate undrawn nominal commitments the Company could immediately borrow under the Company's unsecured debt instruments, consistent with the financial covenants, plus unrestricted cash balances.\nNet operating income (NOI), Cash NOI, and Run Rate Cash NOI : We define NOI as rental income, including reimbursements, less property expenses and real estate taxes, which excludes depreciation, amortization, loss on impairments, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, interest income, corporate sub-lease rental income, asset management fee income, property acquisition costs, gain or loss on involuntary conversion, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sales of rental property, loss on incentive fee, and other expenses.\nWe define Cash NOI as NOI less straight-line rent adjustments and less intangible amortization in rental income.\nWe define Run Rate Cash NOI as Cash NOI plus Cash NOI adjusted for a full period of acquisitions and dispositions, less cash termination income. Run Rate Cash NOI does not reflect the Company's historical results and does not predict future results, which may be substantially different.\nWe consider NOI, Cash NOI and Run Rate Cash NOI to be appropriate supplemental performance measures to net income because we believe they help us and investors understand the core operations of our buildings. None of these measures should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, these measurements should be compared with our reported net income or net loss in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Further, our calculations of NOI, Cash NOI and Run Rate NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other REITs.\nNon-Recurring Capital Expenditures : We define Non-Recurring Capital Expenditures as capital items for upgrades or items that previously did not exist at a building or capital items which have a longer useful life, such as roof replacements. Non-Recurring Capital Expenditures funded by parties other than the Company and Acquisition Capital Expenditures are excluded.\nOccupancy Rate : We define Occupancy Rate as the percentage of total leasable square footage for which either revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP or the lease term has commenced as of the close of the reporting period, whichever occurs earlier.\nOperating Portfolio : We define the Operating Portfolio as all warehouse and light manufacturing assets that were acquired stabilized or have achieved Stabilization. The Operating Portfolio excludes non-core flex/office assets and assets contained in the Value Add Portfolio.\nPipeline : We define Pipeline as a point in time measure that includes all of the transactions under consideration by the Company's acquisitions group that have passed the initial screening process. The pipeline also includes transactions under contract and transactions with non-binding LOIs.\nRecurring Capital Expenditures : We define Recurring Capital Expenditures as capital items required to sustain existing systems and capital items which generally have a shorter useful life. Recurring Capital Expenditures funded by parties other than the Company are excluded.\nRenewal Lease : We define a Renewal Lease as a lease signed by an existing tenant to extend the term for twelve months or more, including (i) a renewal of the same space as the current lease at lease expiration, (ii) a renewal of only a portion of the current space at lease expiration and (iii) an early renewal or workout, which ultimately does extend the original term for twelve months or more.\nRetention : We define Retention as the percentage determined by taking Renewal Lease square footage commencing in the period divided by square footage of leases expiring in the period for assets included in the Operating Portfolio.\nSame Store : We define Same Store properties as properties that were in the Operating Portfolio for the entirety of the comparative periods presented.\nStabilization : We define Stabilization for assets under redevelopment to occur upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or twelve months after completion. Stabilization for assets that were acquired and immediately added to the Value Add Portfolio occurs under the following:\nIf acquired with less than 75% occupancy as of the acquisition date, Stabilization will occur upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or twelve months from the acquisition date; If acquired and will be less than 75% occupied due to known move-outs within two years of the acquisition date, Stabilization will occur upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy after the known move-outs have occurred or twelve months after the known move-outs have occurred.\nStraight-line Rent Change (SL Rent Change) : We define SL Rent Change as the percentage change in the average monthly base rent over the term of the lease, calculated on a straight-line basis, of the lease executed during the period compared to the Comparable Lease for assets included in the Operating Portfolio. Rent under gross or similar type leases are converted to a net rent based on an estimate of the applicable recoverable expenses, and this calculation excludes the impact of any holdover rent.\nValue Add Portfolio : We define the Value Add Portfolio as properties that meet any of the following criteria:\nLess than 75% occupied as of the acquisition date; Will be less than 75% occupied due to known move-outs within two years of the acquisition date; Out of service with significant physical renovation of the asset\nWeighted Average Lease Term : We define Weighted Average Lease Term as the contractual lease term in years as of the lease start date weighted by square footage. Weighted Average Lease Term related to acquired assets reflects the remaining lease term in years as of the acquisition date weighted by square footage.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stag-industrial-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300640221.html\nSOURCE STAG Industrial, Inc.",
