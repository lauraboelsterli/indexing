(the “Company”) (TSX-V:OML) (OTCQX:OLNCF) reports revenue of US$1,341,690. In the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, adjusted EBITDA was US$187,156 and cash flow from operations was US$(118,268). Net income in the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year was US$(187,883), representing diluted EPS of US$(0.02).\nFor the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year, Omni-Lite’s reported revenue of US$1,341,690, a decrease of 22% from the prior period was mainly the result of the conclusion of a multi-year specialty automotive segment program. The Company's gross margin was 60% for the first quarter of 2018 fiscal year. Operating expenses for the fiscal period 2018 increased as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter.\nThe Aerospace segment represented the largest portion of revenues at 54% compared to 43% in the comparable year ago period. The Military segment contributed 27% of revenue, compared to 15% in the fiscal period 2017. The Specialty Automotive and Sports and Recreation segments contributed 23% of revenue, down from 42% in the prior 2017 fiscal period.\n\"The Company has accelerated its production to complete the new military and aerospace orders announced earlier in 2018, which points to improving revenue performance throughout the balance of 2018 fiscal year,” stated Joe Hachadoorian, V. P. Business Development and Sales.\"\nOmni-Lite also noted that it has received new contracts worth US$835,939 since our last press release on April 25, 2018. Of these orders, 37% are in the Aerospace segment, 49% in the Military segment, and 14% in the Specialty Automotive and Sports and Recreational segments. \"This brings the year-to-date value of the new orders announced to approximately US$2,583,700,” stated Allen W. Maxin, President. \"At today’s exchange rate this would be equivalent to approximately CDN$3,356,500.\"\nFurther, the Company is pleased to note that it has submitted a new patent application. “Our submittal for this new patent application will be key to manufacturing complex components for the specialty automotive green diesel programs,” stated Mike Walker, VP of Research & Development.\nSUMMARY OF THREE MONTH FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (US $)\nFor the period\nended\nMarch 31, 2018 For the period\nended\nMarch 31, 2017 Revenue $ 1,341,690 $ 1,724,239 EBITDA (2) 19,143 511,415 Adjusted EBITDA (2) 187,156 523,871 Cash Flow from Operations (118,268 ) 478,986 Free Cash Flow (2) (330,431 ) 146,625 Net (Loss) Income (187,883 ) 368,195 Diluted EPS (0.02 ) 0.04 (2) Please see fiscal period 2018 Management Discussion and Analysis for detailed notes and definitions\nOmni-Lite Industries Canada Inc. is a rapidly growing high technology company that develops and manufactures precision components utilized by Fortune 500 companies including Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Embraer, Alcoa, Ford, Borg Warner, Chrysler, the U.S. Military, Nike, and adidas.\nExcept for historical information contained herein this document contains forward-looking statements.
