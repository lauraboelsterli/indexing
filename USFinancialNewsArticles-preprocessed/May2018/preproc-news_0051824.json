I would like to highlight the continued growth in our core Payment Services segment that demonstrated 26% segment net revenue growth and 27% segment net profit growth in the first quarter 2018 driven by the development of our payment ecosystem, implementation of new projects and secular trends towards digitalization of payments in our focus market verticals,” said Sergey Solonin, QIWI’s chief executive officer. “We demonstrated strong financial results in our payment services business in the first quarter and thus were able to continue investing in our new business lines and projects. We continued to focus on the development and expansion of our Consumer Financial Services segment represented by the SOVEST project and our SME segment through Tochka multibank service.\nWe see many opportunities for growing our payment services business by focusing on building a wider digital infrastructure and enriching our product offering, expanding and penetrating further our focus markets and, thus generating substantial operating cash flows. At the same time we continue to see 2018 as a year of investments in our new projects and will continue to focus on executing our strategy and developing our new initiatives.”\nNew Segment Presentation of the Results of Operations\nOur payment services business historically has been and continues to be a major part of our operations and currently generates most of our revenues as well as significant free cash flows that we can invest in developing new businesses and projects. We are constantly striving to diversify our product offering and range of services with certain new projects contributing to our payment services business and others aiming to penetrate new areas of the financial services market. Following the development of SOVEST and certain other initiatives that we have undertaken throughout 2017, we revised our organizational structure to better reflect our operational and management strategy as well as the expansion of our business operations, including the broadening of our products and services, distinguishing three key operating segments as well as Corporate and Other category, as set below:\n• Payment Services (PS) operating segment , which encompasses our virtual distribution services, including QIWI Wallet and other QIWI applications, payment channels and methods; physical distribution, including our kiosks, terminals and other retail points of service, Contact Money Remittance System; and our merchant focused services;\n• Consumer Financial Services (CFS) operating segment , which encompasses our consumer lending business SOVEST;\n• Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) operating segment , which encompasses our Tochka project which is focused on offering a broad range of services for small and medium enterprises; and\n• Corporate and Other (CO) category , which encompasses expenses associated with the corporate operations of QIWI Group as well as our R&D, projects and emerging business models that we are testing.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenues: Total Adjusted Net Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was RUB 4,099 million ($71.6 million), an increase of 41% compared with RUB 2,905 million in the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by Payment Services and SME Segments Net Revenue growth.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was RUB 3,668 million ($64.1 million), an increase of 26% compared with RUB 2,908 million in the prior year.\nPS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue was RUB 3,223 million ($56.3 million), an increase of 36% compared with RUB 2,372 million in the prior year. PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue growth was predominantly driven by a volume growth in the E-commerce and Money Remittance market verticals as well as by an improvement in Payment average adjusted net revenue yield resulting from the shift in the product mix towards higher yielding merchants.\nPS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 1 , which is principally composed of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments, interest revenue, revenue from overdrafts provided to agents, rent of space for kiosks, cash and settlement services and advertising, was RUB 445 million ($7.8 million), a decrease of 17% compared with RUB 536 million in the prior year. PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue decrease in the first quarter was mostly due to the decrease in interest revenue, revenue from advertising as well as revenue from overdrafts provided to agents.\nFees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were RUB 303 million ($5.3 million) compared with RUB 318 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue excluding revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments decreased 35% compared with the same period in the prior year.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue excluding revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments increased 30% compared with the same period in the prior year.\nConsumer Financial Services Segment Net Revenue 2 that represents the results of operations of the SOVEST project for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was RUB 3 million ($0.1 million) compared with the Net Revenue Loss of RUB 10 million in the first quarter of the prior year as a result of the development of the SOVEST project.\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Segment Net Revenue which is composed of revenue from cash and settlement services (mostly associated with the information and technology service agreements with Otkritie Bank related to the operations of the Tochka project) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was RUB 420 million ($7.3 million) compared with nil in the first quarter of the prior year as a result of the launch of operations of the Tochka project and recognition of corresponding revenues from information and technology service agreements with Otkritie Bank for providing services to Tochka clients that have their accounts with Otkritie Bank.\nCorporate and Other Category Net Revenue, which is principally composed of interest revenue, was RUB 8 million ($0.1 million) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to RUB 7 million in the first quarter of the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA: For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was RUB 1,450 million ($25.3 million), a decrease of 5% compared with RUB 1,519 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA decrease was largely driven by growth of SG&A expense due to an increase in: (i) compensation to employees (excluding effect of share based payments) to RUB 675 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to RUB 437 million for same period in the prior year as a result of hiring of a significant number of employees in connection with the launch of the Tochka project as well as continues hiring for SOVEST; (ii) advertising, client acquisition and related expenses to RUB 456 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to RUB 214 million for same period in the prior year mostly related to the SOVEST project; credit loss expenses and other administrative expenses offset by an increase in Adjusted Net Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Total Adjusted Net Revenue) was 35.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with 52.3% for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments was RUB 1,147 million ($20.0 million), a decrease of 4% compared with RUB 1,201 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments was 30.2% compared with 46.4% in the prior year.\nAdjusted and Segment Net Profit: For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted Net Profit was RUB 1,081 million ($18.9 million), a decrease of 15% compared with RUB 1,266 million in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted Net Profit was primarily driven by the same factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA as well as increase in income tax expenses and decrease of foreign exchange gain 3 generated as compared to the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Net Profit excluding fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments (net of tax) decreased 17% compared with the prior year.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Payment Services Segment Net Profit was RUB 2,209 million ($38.6 million), an increase of 27% compared with RUB 1,737 million in the prior year driven mostly by Payment Services Segment Net Revenue growth. The Consumer Financial Services Segment Net Loss in the first quarter 2018 was RUB 679 million ($11.9 million) as compared to a Net Loss of RUB 316 million in the same period of prior year resulting from the expansion of operations of the SOVEST project and associated costs mostly related to consumer acquisition. The Small and Medium Enterprises Net Loss was RUB 153 million ($2.7 million) compared to nil in the prior year primarily driven by expenses incurred in connection with the development of the Tochka project. Corporate and Other Category Net Loss was RUB 296 million ($5.2 million), an increase of 90% compared with the net loss of RUB 155 million in the prior year primarily driven by expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of assets of Rocketbank from Otkritie Bank as well as several individually insignificant projects.\nPayment Services Other Operating Data: For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Payment Services Segment payment volume was RUB 249.2 billion ($4.4 billion), an increase of 20% compared with RUB 207.8 billion in the prior year. The increase in payment volume was driven by growth in Money Remittances and E-commerce market verticals resulting largely from secular trends towards the digitalization of payments as well as the development of several projects for merchants such as TSUPIS. Payment average adjusted net revenue yield was 1.29%, an increase of 15 bps compared with 1.14% in the prior year primarily due to the higher average net revenue yield in the E-commerce market vertical as well as shift of product mix towards higher yielding E-commerce volumes.\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue Yield was 1.47%, an increase of 7 bps as compared with 1.40% in the prior year. Payment Services Segment Net Revenue Yield excluding the effect of fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments was 1.35%, an increase of 10 bps as compared with the same period in the prior year.\nThe number of active kiosks and terminals was 149,430 including Contact and Rapida physical points of service, a decrease of 5% compared with the prior year.\nThe number of active Qiwi Wallet accounts was 20.3 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 2.3 million, or 13%, as compared with 18.0 million in the first quarter 2017. The increase was driven mainly by development of consumer and merchant use cases in the core market verticals, network effects as well as increasing convenience and usability of our services.\nConsumer Financial Services Other Operating Data : For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Consumer Financial Services Segment payment volume was RUB 2.3 billion ($40.4 million).\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Other Operating Data : For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the number of Tochka clients (active on the monthly basis) in Qiwi bank was 17.8 thousand with the corresponding balances of RUB 1.6 billion.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of assets of Tochka and Rocketbank: In August 2017, we have executed a series of transactions to acquire the brands, software and hardware of Tochka, a digital banking service focused on offering a broad range of services to small and medium businesses, and Rocketbank, a digital banking service offering debit cards and deposits to retail customers, from Otkritie Bank. We have also entered into certain operational agreements with Otkritie Bank in connection with these transactions.\nCurrently we continue our negotiations with the management of Otkritie Bank regarding our future cooperation and development of both businesses. We believe that our negotiations in respect of Tochka are currently in an advanced phase and we will be in a position to frame a mutually beneficial resolution that would establish the basis for our future joint activities.\nAs of March 31, 2018 we are operating Tochka project as a multi-banking service providing its customers the opportunity to open accounts with either Qiwi Bank or Otkritie Bank.\nDividend: Throughout 2017, we have been heavily investing in our new project SOVEST and we anticipate that we will continue to bear significant costs related to the SOVEST project and certain other projects that we are developing now or plan to develop in the future. Thus, starting from the third quarter 2017 our Board of Directors have taken a decision to refrain from paying dividends. While long-term we remain committed to distributing all excess cash to our shareholders, the commencement of dividend distribution within the period of twelve months since the decision has been taken is unlikely.\n2018 Guidance 4\nQIWI upgrades its Total Adjusted Net Revenue guidance in respect of 2018 outlook:\nTotal Adjusted Net Revenue is expected to increase by 15% to 20% over 2017;\nWhile guidance in respect to Payment Services Segment Net Revenue, Adjusted Net Profit and Payment Services Segment Net Profit remains unchanged:\nPayment Services Segment Net Revenue is expected to increase by 12% to 16% over 2017; Adjusted Net Profit is expected to decline by 10% to 0% over 2017; Payment Services Segment Net Profit is expected to increase by 10% to 15% over 2017.\nGiven substantial uncertainty in respect of the future arrangements regarding the development of the Tochka and Rocketbank projects and the outcome of our negotiations in respect thereon with Otkritie Bank, we believe that we are not in a position to provide any reliable estimates of revenues or expenses associated with Tochka and Rocketbank projects for 2018, we therefore only include in our guidance for 2018 actual revenues and expenses associated with the Tochka and Rocketbank projects for the first half of 2018. Actual results of these projects for 2018 may differ substantially from the data that we used in our guidance.\nEarnings Conference Call and Audio Webcast\nQIWI will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results today at 8:30 a.m. ET.

therefore, it has been allocated between PS Payment Revenue and PS Other Revenue in proportion to the relevant revenue amounts for the purposes of the reconciliation presented above.\n(5) PS Other Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments, interest revenue, revenue from overdrafts provided to agents, rent of space for kiosks, cash and settlement services and advertising.\n(6) Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) primarily consists of direct costs associated with other revenue and other costs, including but not limited to: compensation to employees and related taxes allocated to PS Other Revenue and costs of call-centers and advertising commissions.\n(7) Amortization of fair value adjustments primarily includes the effect of the acquisition of control in Contact and Rapida.\n(8) The Forex loss on SPO funds as presented in the reconciliation of Net Profit to Adjusted Net Profit differs from the Foreign exchange loss and Foreign exchange gain in the reconciliation of Net Profit to Adjusted EBITDA as the latter includes all the foreign exchange losses/(gains) for the period, while the former only include the foreign exchange loss/(gain) on the US dollar amount, which we received at SPO.\nQIWI plc.\nOther Operating Data Three Months ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 RUB RUB USD (1) Payment Services Segment key operating metrics Payment volume (billion) (2) 207.8 249.2 4.4 E-commerce 37.6 51.8 0.9 Financial services 59.1 56.7 1.0 Money remittances (3) 55.9 85.6 1.5 Telecom 41.3 41.5 0.7 Other 13.9 13.6 0.2 Payment adjusted net revenue (million) (4) 2,372.3 3,222.6 56.3 E-commerce 1,178.1 1,761.5 30.8 Financial services 306.0 289.7 5.1 Money remittances (3) 641.4 915.9 16.0 Telecom 183.9 179.2 3.1 Other 62.9 76.3 1.3 Payment average adjusted net revenue yield 1.14% 1.29% 1.29% E-commerce 3.13% 3.40% 3.40% Financial services 0.52% 0.51% 0.51% Money remittances (3) 1.15% 1.07% 1.07% Telecom 0.45% 0.43% 0.43% Other 0.45% 0.56% 0.56% Payment Services Segment Net Revenue Yield 1.40% 1.47% 1.47% Active kiosks and terminals (units) (5) 157,596 149,430 149,430 Active Qiwi Wallet accounts (million) (6) 18.0 20.3 20.3 Consumer Financial Services Segment key operating metrics Payment volume (million) (7) 192 2,311 40.4 CFS Segment Net Revenue Yield n/a 0.13% 0.13% (1) Calculated using a ruble to U.S. dollar exchange rate of RUB 57.2649 to U.S. $1.00, which was the official exchange rate Quote: d by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as of March 31, 2018.\n(2) Payment Services Segment payment volume by market verticals and consolidated payment volume consist of the amounts paid by our customers to merchants or other customers included in each of those market verticals less intra-group eliminations. The methodology of payment volumes allocation between different market verticals in Contact and Rapida may differ from the methodology used by QIWI. We therefore retain the right to restate the presented volumes, net revenues and net revenue yields data in case the methodology of Contact and Rapida will be brought in conformity with the methodology used by QIWI.\n(3) In 2016 we introduced consumer commissions for certain types of P2P (wallet to wallet) transactions including cross currency transactions and transactions above certain limits. Corresponding volumes and payment adjusted net revenues are accounted for in our Money Remittances market vertical.\n(4) PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue is calculated as the difference between PS Payment Revenue and PS Cost of Payment Revenue (excluding D&A) plus compensation to employees and related taxes allocated to PS Payment Revenue. PS Payment Revenue primarily consists of merchant and consumer fees. Cost of PS Payment Revenue primarily consists of commission to agents.\n(5) We measure the numbers of our kiosks and terminals on a daily basis, with only those kiosks and terminals being taken into calculation through which at least one payment has been processed during the day, which we refer to as active kiosks and terminals. The period end numbers of our kiosks and terminals are calculated as an average of the amount of active kiosks and terminals for the last 30 days of the respective reporting period.\n(6) Active Qiwi Wallet accounts calculated on a yearly basis, i.e. an active account is an account that had at least one transaction within the last 12 months from the reporting date.\n(7) Consumer Financial Services Segment payment volume (million) consist of the amounts paid by our customers using SOVEST card to our partner merchants.\nContact Varvara Kiseleva Investor Relations +357.25028091 ir@qiwi.com\nSource:QIWI plc",
