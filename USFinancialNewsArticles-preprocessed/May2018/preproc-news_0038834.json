We are increasingly investing in our next generation solutions, especially in asset-management, in order to address the increase in opportunities in our end markets, particularly targeting the market in North America. We continue to pursue our strategy of growing our business on an organic basis as well as looking to complement that growth with acquisitions.\"\nFinancial summary for the first quarter of 2018\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 10% to a record $20.9 million as compared to $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenues from products in the first quarter of 2018 increased 6% to $7.1 million (34% of revenues) compared to $6.7 million (35% of revenues) in the comparable period of 2017.\nRevenues from services in the first quarter of 2018 increased 12% to $13.8 million (66% of revenues) compared to $12.3 million (65% of revenues), in the comparable period of 2017. The growth in service revenue was primarily due to the growth in the subscriber base which grew by 34,000 subscribers since March 31, 2017.\nGross profit was $10.9 million (52.4% of revenues) compared to $9.4 million (49.3% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating income on a GAAP basis was $2.6 million (12.3% of revenues), an increase of 14%, compared with $2.3 million (11.9% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $3.1 million (14.8% of revenues), an increase of 19% compared to $2.6 million (13.7% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net income was $1.8 million (8.5% of revenues), compared to $1.6 million (8.2% of revenues) million reported in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $2.5 million (11.8% of revenues), an increase of 7%, compared with $2.3 million (12.0% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nFully diluted earnings per share based on a GAAP basis in the first quarter was $0.21 per share, compared to $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nFully diluted earnings per share based on a non GAAP basis in the first quarter was $0.30 per share, compared to $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA was $3.3 million (15.7% of revenues), an increase of 5% compared with $3.1 million (16.3% of revenues) in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was $2.3 million.\nConference Call Information\nPointer Telocation's management will host a conference call today, at 7:00am Pacific Time, 10:00 Eastern Time, 17:00 Israel time. On the call, management will review and discuss the results. To listen to the call, please dial in to one of the following teleconferencing numbers. Please begin placing your call a few minutes before the conference call commences.\nDial in numbers are as follows:\nFrom the USA +1-888-407-2553 ; From Israel 03-918-0610; From the UK 0-800-917-5108\nA replay will be available a few hours following the call on the company's website.\nReconciliation between results on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis\nReconciliation between results on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis is provided in a table immediately following the Condensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPointer uses EBITDA and Non-GAAP operating income and net income as Non-GAAP financial performance measurements.\nPointer calculates EBITDA by adding back to net income financial expenses, taxes and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.\nPointer calculates Non-GAAP operating income by adding back to operating income the effects of non-cash stock based compensation expenses, amortization of long lived assets, other expenses of retirement costs and losses and acquisition related one-time costs.\nPointer calculates Non-GAAP net income by adding back to net income the effects of non-cash stock based compensation expenses, amortization of long lived assets, non-cash tax expenses, other expenses of retirement costs, spin-off related expenses and losses and acquisition related one-time costs.\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of the Company's performance exclusive of Non-GAAP charges that are considered by management to be outside of the Company's core operating results.\nEBITDA and non-GAAP operating and net income are provided to investors to complement results provided in accordance with GAAP, as management believes the measure helps illustrate underlying operating trends in the Company's business and uses the measure to establish internal budgets and goals, manage the business and evaluate performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures help investors to understand the Company's current and future operating cash flow and performance, especially as the Company's acquisitions have resulted in amortization and non-cash items that have had a material impact on the Company's GAAP profits. EBITDA and non GAAP operating and net income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAbout Pointer Telocation\nFor over 20 years, Pointer has rewritten the rules for the Mobile Resource Management (MRM) market and is a pioneer in the Connected Car segment.
