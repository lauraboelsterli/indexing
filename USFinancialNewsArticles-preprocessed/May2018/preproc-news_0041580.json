    "text": "6 COMMENTS Companies are paying more for supply-chain skills in a hunt for buyers, planners and transportation managers who can help offset growing freight and raw materials costs.\nThe average salary for supply-chain professionals rose 4.1% in 2017, outpacing broader U.S. wage gains and those for professionals generally, according to the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. That is consistent with the sector’s pay growth in recent years.\nSalaries could rise even faster in the coming year as businesses grapple with inflation and the growing tensions between the U.S. and key trading partners such as China, said Paul Lee, ISM’s director of research and publications.\nMore in Logistics...\nPaying More to Save More: Companies Boosting Salaries for Supply-Chain Executives May 18, 2018 Maersk to Cut Services as It Battles Shipping Glut May 17, 2018 Exports from California Ports Surged in April on Trade Unease May 14, 2018 Target Tests Retail ‘Flow Center’ for Faster, Nimbler Distribution May 14, 2018 A growing set of companies, including retailers, food distributors and appliance makers, say rising increased fuel and transportation expenses have been carving into their profit margins. Passing the higher costs along to consumers has proven difficult .\nThat amplifies the role of supply-chain executives as the rising costs of getting goods produced and delivered gets the attention of senior corporate leaders. “The C-suite is becoming more and more concerned with not only getting costs right, but also that there are no disruptions in the supply chain,” Mr. Lee said.\nAverage hourly wages for U.S. workers were up 2.5% in December 2017 from the year before, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, and ISM said wages for professional positions increased 3% from 2016.\nHalf of supply-management professionals polled by ISM earned $100,000 or more last year, up from 47% in 2016. Average overall compensation, including bonuses, was $117,425.\n“Companies want professionals who know how to negotiate and get those bottom-line savings,” said Scott Luton, managing partner with TalentStream LLC, a recruitment firm that works with large and midsize manufacturers and logistics firms. “There is a huge emphasis being placed on finding talent that gets global trade and global enterprise.”\n‘ There is a huge emphasis being placed on finding talent that gets global trade and global enterprise. ’\n—Scott Luton, TalentStream Information technology skills have also become more important as businesses automate some supply-chain processes and test out artificial intelligence, blockchain and other new technologies. Engineering expertise is in especially high demand, Mr. Luton said, as companies experiment with drones and robotics.\n“Salaries are going to have to reflect the need for that combination of business experience and IT,” said Daniel Stanton, author of “Supply Chain Management for Dummies” and a former supply-chain executive at Caterpillar Inc.\nCompanies are snapping up recent supply-chain graduates, Mr. Stanton said, and demand for experienced candidates will sharpen as more baby boomers retire. Filling more specialized jobs, like the leader of a supply-chain analysis group, can also be a challenge, especially for companies that haven’t spent time to develop talent internally.\n“Bringing someone from outside is expensive, and it takes them 18 months to learn the business,” Mr. Stanton said. “What companies are dealing with is a lot of relocation costs and signing bonuses.”\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com",
