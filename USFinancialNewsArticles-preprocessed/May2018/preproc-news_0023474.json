    "text": "REITs This is the best day — and time — to list your home for sale Listing your home on a certain day — and even a certain time of day — may make it sell faster and for more money. Thursday is the most popular day for agents to debut new listings, and homes listed on that day apparently sell fastest, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. For the specific time of day, one broker puts her new listings online at 5 p.m. 1 Hour Ago | 04:06\nFor homesellers, even in a market with next to nothing for sale, timing is everything. Listing your home on a certain day — and even a certain time of day — may make it sell faster and for more money.\nThursday is the most popular day for agents to debut new listings, and homes listed on that day apparently sell fastest, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. Redfin analysts based their findings on a sample of 100,000 homes that sold in 2017. It used Sunday, the worst day to list, as a baseline and then calculated the relative advantages for every other day.\nHomes listed on Thursday sold an average of five days faster than homes listed on Sunday. Redfin also found homes listed Thursday were more likely to sell within 90 to 180 days.\n\"Our market is programmed to look at houses Thursday and to plan their weekends out,\" said Marshall Carey, a Redfin agent in Washington, D.C. \"You really want to have the most eyes on your property, and Thursday seems to be the day to do that.\"\nThe theory is that most people tour listings over the weekend, and they begin planning their weekends on Thursday. Redfin found that a home gets five times more views on the first day it is listed than on subsequent days. This is likely because most online real estate sites offer alerts of new listings to potential buyers. Before the internet, new listings were put in newspapers on Sundays, advertising open houses, and some even in late editions Saturday night, but the model has completely changed. Getty Images A home is offered for sale in Chicago, Ill.\n\"I normally aim for Thursday or Friday,\" said Peggy Ferris, an agent with Compass. \"I don't like to put it on too early because then agents want to show it and you lose the really good momentum for an open house on Sunday.\"\nSunday open houses are still popular but losing the momentum they used to have now that people can tour homes in pictures and video online. In today's incredibly competitive market, some sellers are getting offers without home tours or getting tour requests immediately. Offers are coming in even before the first open house.\n\"In this competitive market, most of the agents are sort of abiding by the Thursday, Friday and then taking offers on Tuesday,\" said Karen Kelly, also with Compass. \"I like to give everybody a shot and take a look at 10 offers instead of just one.\"\nWhile listing the home later in the weekend can create more urgency, listing it slightly early, on Wednesday, could actually get your more money. Homes listed on Wednesday had a $2,023 advantage in sale price over homes listed on Sunday, according to Redfin, although analysts there could find no clear reason as to why. Most agents I spoke with didn't buy that finding but were definitely interested to hear it.\n\"I think false,\" said Jennifer Myers, a real estate agent with Dwell in the D.C./Virginia area. \"It's not just what day you list but also your entire strategy.\"\nMyers agrees with the Thursday plan but adds a specific time of day. She puts her new listings online at 5 p.m.\n\"The afternoon is better because on Thursdays all of us are listing, and so if you list in the morning, you end up actually on Page 2 of the listing, you end up further down, and you want to be on the top,\" she said.
