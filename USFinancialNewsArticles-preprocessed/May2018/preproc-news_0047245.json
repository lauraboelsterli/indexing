Flowers and foliage surround the West Door and steps of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle. May 19, 2018. Danny Lawson/Pool via REUTERS\nLondon florist Philippa Craddock used roses, peonies and foxgloves, set against beech, birch and hornbeam branches, many of them gathered from the gardens and parkland of the Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park, the royal family’s press office said.\n“One of the things that has been very important in this brief to me is to make sure we’re sourcing locally and that the designs reflect the landscape that’s around Windsor Castle, that’s what we’re looking to do in the chapel,” Craddock said in a statement.

The palace’s website describes the garden’s white roses as “a favourite of the Princess”.\nMany of the wedding flowers will be replanted in Kensington Gardens after the wedding, royal officials said.
