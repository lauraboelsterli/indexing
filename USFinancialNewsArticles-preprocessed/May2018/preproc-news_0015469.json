    "text": "Starling Marte hit an inside-the-park home run, one of three Pittsburgh Pirates homers Friday in a 6-4 win over the host Milwaukee Brewers.\nCorey Dickerson hit an upper-deck shot and David Freese hit a homer in the ninth for the Pirates, who broke a four-game overall losing streak and an eight-game road losing streak.\nManny Pina and Domingo Santana homered for the Brewers.\nPittsburgh starter Nick Kingham (2-0), in his second career game, allowed four runs and four hits — two of them homers — in 5 1/3 innings, with one walk and seven strikeouts.\nThat fell short of Kingham’s major league debut Sunday, when he gave up one hit in seven scoreless innings, including 6 2/3 perfect innings, against St. Louis.\nFelipe Vasquez, the fifth Pirates pitcher, got the final five outs for his sixth save.\nMilwaukee starter Junior Guerra (2-2) gave up five runs and six hits in five innings, also serving up two homers, in five innings, with four walks and four strikeouts. He had not yielded more than one earned run in any of his first four starts.\nIn the first, Gregory Polanco walked, Marte singled and Dickerson walked, loading the bases. Guerra walked Francisco Cervelli to force in Polanco for a 1-0 Pirates lead.\nThe Brewers tied it in the second on Pina’s one-out homer to left-center.\nDickerson’s homer followed Josh Bell’s single in the third for a 3-1 Pittsburgh lead.\nIn the fifth, Polanco singled and Marte hit a ball that deflected at a sharp angle off the wall and away from center fielder Lorenzo Cain, allowing Marte to follow Polanco home for his fourth homer.\nMilwaukee drew to within a run in the sixth. Christian Yelich led off with a double and scored on Jesus Aguilar’s single to make it 5-2. One out later, Santana hit a two-run shot to left, his first of the season, to make it 5-4 and chase Kingham.\nFreese led off the ninth with a line drive over the wall in right off Taylor Williams to give Pittsburgh a 6-4 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
