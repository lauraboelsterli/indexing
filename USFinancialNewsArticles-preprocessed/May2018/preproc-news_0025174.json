    "text": "HAIFA, Israel, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, today reported financial results and corporate developments for its third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\n“The past few months brought several significant milestones which we believe are key to our continued development”, stated Pluristem Chairman and Co-CEO Zami Aberman. “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared our Investigational New Drug application (IND) for the use of PLX-R18 in treating victims who may have been acutely exposed to high dose radiation (ARS) due to nuclear attack or accident. Following this IND approval, and as an additional step to prepare for marketing, we will now start the necessary preparations in order to keep an emergency stock of PLX-R18 on hand for use in such events. We were also cleared by the FDA to start our Phase III study in PLX-PAD in the treatment of muscle injury following hip fracture surgery. This marks the second Phase III study in Pluristem’s clinical pipeline, and we intend to have an additional Phase III study in the treatment of ARS cleared by the FDA by the end of this year.”\n“Pluristem is well positioned to be a significant market leader in the cell therapy and regenerative medicine industries”, stated Pluristem President and Co-CEO Yaky Yanay. “We expect to publish top line data from our Phase II study in intermittent claudication (IC) in June, which will be the largest clinical data set we have published to date. With these data and the latest IND approvals, we are moving closer to market. In support of this process we have announced that we are forming a strategic advisory board, composed of highly accomplished executives, such as Roger Jeffs, former CEO of United Therapeutics and who led Amgen’s Neupogen clinical programs. We believe that this strategic board will bring tremendous expertise and vision to Pluristem, and support our strategic development, clinical progress and commercialization. The company is well financed and has multiple non-dilutive grants to supports its clinical development, including a $2.5 million grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a research project in ARS which should provide bridging data for the final pivotal study.”\nFinancial Update:\nAs of March 31, 2018, Pluristem had $34.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and short-term restricted deposits. The Company’s net cash used for operating activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $5.6 million.\nAbout Pluristem Therapeutics\nPluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products.
