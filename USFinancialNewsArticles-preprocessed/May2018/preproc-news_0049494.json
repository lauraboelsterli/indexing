FILE PHOTO: Former UEFA President Michel Platini speaks before the election of the new UEFA President in Athens, Greece September 14, 2016. REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\nThe Frenchman was banned from all soccer-related activities over a two million Swiss francs ($2.02 million) payment FIFA made to him in 2011, with former chief Sepp Blatter’s approval, for work done a decade earlier.\nFIFA’s ethics committee said the payment, made at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election, lacked transparency and presented conflicts of interest. Both men denied wrongdoing.\nA criminal investigation was opened against Platini, but the former France captain said on Saturday he had been told by the Swiss authorities that had now been closed.\n“After (three) years of investigation, the Public Ministry of the (Swiss) Confederation has just restored the truth by officially confirming that no charge has been at any time or will be in the future held against me in connection with my activities for FIFA,” Platini said in a statement.\n“This official information from an authority of justice attests definitely of my innocence.”\nPlatini was initially banned from all soccer-related activities for eight years. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reduced the suspension to four years.\nThe 62-year-old added he and his family had been living a nightmare for the last three years.\n“These years were difficult and painful,” Platini said.\n“My honour and integrity have been tarnished. I was robbed for three years of professional life.\n“I will come back: where, when, how? It is too early to tell. But I will come back to football.” Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
