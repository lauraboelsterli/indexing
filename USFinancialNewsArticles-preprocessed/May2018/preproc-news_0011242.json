    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Books for Swiss drugmaker Polyphorâ€™s ( POLN.S ) initial public offering are already covered less than half way through the subscription period, two people familiar with the transaction said.\nThe company aims to raise 100-150 million Swiss francs ($100-150 million) in an all-primary offering.\nIt was too early to say where the issue price would be set, one of the sources said. The indicated price range is 30-40 francs per share.\nSubscriptions close on May 14, with trade on the SIX Swiss Exchange set to start a day later.\n($1 = 0.9971 Swiss francs)\nReporting by Oliver Hirt, Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
