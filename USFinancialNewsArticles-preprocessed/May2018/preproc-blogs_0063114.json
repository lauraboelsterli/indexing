In other consolidation in the sector, China's state-owned ChemChina purchased Syngenta and two huge Canadian fertilizer producers merged to form a new company, now called Nutrien.\nBayer committed to selling its entire cotton, canola, soybean and vegetable seeds businesses and digital farming business, as well its Liberty herbicide, which competes with Monsanto's Roundup.\nUnder agreements with European and other antitrust enforcers, Bayer agreed to sell assets with revenues of 2.2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), to rival BASF for 7.6 billion euros.\nBayer said in a statement it expected Bayer and Monsanto to begin the integration process as soon as the sales to BASF are complete, which it said are expected to take two months to complete.\nIf Bayer does not close the deal by June 14, Monsanto could withdraw from the takeover agreement and seek a higher price.\nIt has already secured the go-ahead from key jurisdictions, including the European Union, Brazil and Russia. Apart from the United States, it still needs clearance in Canada and Mexico.\nIn a separate statement, Bayer said on Tuesday said the European Commission had approved BASF as a suitable buyer of the businesses to be divested.\nGerman seed seller KWS Saat, which had made an eleventh-hour bid for Bayer's vegetable seed business, said on Wednesday it accepted the Commission's decision.\nBayer last week said synergies from folding Monsanto into its organization would be about $300 million below its previous target because it will have to sell more businesses than initially expected.\n($1 = 0.8668 euros) (Additional reporting by Patricia Weiss; Editing by Mark Potter, Dan Grebler and David Evans)",
