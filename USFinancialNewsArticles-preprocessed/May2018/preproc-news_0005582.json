Similarly, Marc's proven experience in scaling biotechnology companies will be critical as we further expand the company to support our advancing R&D pipeline. I look forward to working in close partnership with both Niti and Marc, and know they share our passion for delivering novel therapies to patients with unmet needs across the autoimmune disease landscape.\"\nPrior to joining Kezar, Dr. Goel was Vice President of Strategic Drug Development at IQVIA, where she focused on the design and implementation of clinical trials, as well as development and commercialization planning for molecules in autoimmunity and autoinflammation.
