    "text": "LAKE ZURICH, Ill., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ACCO Brands Corporation (NYSE: ACCO), one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded academic, consumer and business products, today reported its first quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\n\"First quarter results demonstrate the strength and balance of our more diversified global business,\" said Boris Elisman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACCO Brands. \"I am especially pleased with the growth of our EMEA region, where the Esselte acquisition is driving organic sales growth and profit improvements.\"\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales increased 13% to $405.8 million from $359.8 million in the prior-year quarter driven by the additional month of sales from Esselte and foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of the acquisition and foreign exchange, comparable sales decreased 4%, primarily due to declines in the North America segment. Net income was $10.4 million, or $0.09 per share, including $6.3 million of restructuring and integration charges. This compared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.03 per share, in the prior-year quarter, which included $0.3 million of refinancing-related charges and $6.8 million of transaction, integration and restructuring charges. Adjusted net income increased to $8.9 million, or $0.08 per share, from $4.9 million, or $0.04 per share, in the prior-year quarter. The increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the Esselte acquisition.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nACCO Brands North America - Sales decreased 5% to $165.6 million from $174.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The additional month of sales from Esselte added 1% to sales, or $0.9 million, and foreign exchange added 1%. Comparable sales decreased 6%, or $11.1 million, due to customer inventory reductions and lost placements. Operating income decreased to $2.9 million from $5.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased to $4.7 million from $7.2 million in the prior year primarily due to lower gross margin.\nACCO Brands EMEA - Sales increased 60% to $154.5 million from $96.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The additional month of sales from Esselte added 44%, or $42.7 million, and foreign exchange added 14%. Comparable sales increased 2%, or $1.6 million. Operating income increased to $14.1 million from $3.6 million in the prior-year quarter, and adjusted operating income increased to $17.4 million from $5.5 million, due to the acquisition and higher gross margin.\nACCO Brands International - Sales decreased 3% to $85.7 million from $88.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The additional month of sales from Esselte added 1%, or $0.6 million, and foreign exchange added 3%. Comparable sales declined 7%, or $5.7 million, as growth in Brazil was offset by lower sales in Australia and Mexico. Operating income decreased to $5.8 million from $10.1 million in the prior-year quarter and adjusted operating income decreased to $6.6 million from $10.7 million in the prior-year quarter, due to lower sales and higher distribution costs associated with warehouse and systems consolidation driven by the Pelikan Artline integration in Australia.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe company is reiterating its outlook for 2018 revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. The company expects 2018 sales growth of approximately 2% and adjusted EPS growth of 12-15%, a range of $1.33-$1.37 per share, assuming a normalized tax rate of 28%. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $180 million.\nWebcast\nAt 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today, ACCO Brands Corporation will host a conference call to discuss the company's results. The call will be broadcast live via webcast. The webcast can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of www.accobrands.com . The webcast will be in listen-only mode and will be available for replay for one month following the event.\nAbout ACCO Brands Corporation\nACCO Brands Corporation is one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded academic, consumer and business products.

More information about ACCO Brands, the Home of Great Brands Built by Great People, can be found at www.accobrands.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, effective tax rate and comparable net sales at constant currency. We have included a description of each of these measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the tables attached to this press release.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures both in the internal evaluation and management of our business and to explain our results to stockholders and the investment community. Senior management's incentive compensation is derived, in part, using certain of these measures. We believe these measures provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends, facilitate meaningful comparisons and enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and our future prospects. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that we considered to be outside our core operating results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results such as unusual income tax items, restructuring and integration charges, acquisition-related expenses, foreign currency fluctuation, and other one-time or non-recurring items. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the directly comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read in connection with the company's financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThis press release also provides forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and normalized tax rate. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted earnings per share or tax rate to GAAP because the GAAP financial measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such a reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, the variability of our tax rate and other charges reflected in our historical numbers. The probable significance of each of these items is high and, based on historical experience, could be material.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth, operating strategies and similar matters are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are generally identifiable by the use of the words \"will,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" and similar expressions, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no duty or obligation to update them. Because actual results may differ materially from those suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on them when deciding whether to buy, sell or hold the company's securities.\nOur business outlook is based on certain assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These include, without limitation, assumptions regarding the timing, cost and synergies expected from integration of acquisitions; the impact of the recent changes in U.S. tax laws; changes in the macro environment; fluctuations in foreign currency rates and share count; changes in the competitive landscape and consumer behavior; as well as other factors described below.\nAmong the factors that could cause actual our forward-looking statements are: the concentration of our business with a relatively limited number of large customers; consumer spending decisions during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness; risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations; challenges related to the highly competitive business environments in which we operate; our ability to develop and market innovative products that meet consumer demands; our ability to grow profitably through acquisitions and expand our product assortment into new and adjacent categories; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition, including synergies; the failure, inadequacy or interruption of our information technology systems or supporting infrastructure; risks associated with a cybersecurity incident or information security breach; our ability to successfully expand our business in emerging markets which generally expose us to greater financial, operational, regulatory and compliance and other risks; the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; risks associated with the changes to U.S. government policies, including increased import tariffs or quotas and other changes in trade relations and policies; the impact of litigation or other legal proceedings; the risks associated with outsourcing production of certain of our products, information systems and other administrative functions; the continued decline in the use of certain of our products; risks associated with seasonality and raw material, labor and transportation availability and cost fluctuations; our failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and self-regulatory requirements and the costs of compliance; the sufficiency of investment returns on pension assets and risks related to actuarial assumptions; any impairment of our intangible assets; risks associated with our indebtedness, including our debt service obligations, limitations imposed by restrictive covenants and our ability to comply with financial ratios and tests; the bankruptcy or financial instability of our customers and suppliers; our failure to comply with customer contracts; our ability to secure, protect and maintain our intellectual property rights; product liability claims or regulatory actions; our ability to attract and retain key employees; the volatility of our stock price; material disruptions at one of our or our suppliers' major manufacturing or distribution facilities resulting from circumstances outside our control; and other risks and uncertainties described in \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in other reports we file with the SEC.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(in millions of dollars)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n122.7\n$\n76.9\nAccounts receivable, net\n316.1\n469.3\nInventories\n294.5\n254.2\nOther current assets\n51.5\n29.2\nTotal current assets\n784.8\n829.6\nTotal property, plant and equipment\n657.1\n645.2\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(376.8)\n(366.7)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n280.3\n278.5\nDeferred income taxes\n132.9\n137.9\nGoodwill\n667.9\n670.3\nIdentifiable intangibles, net\n838.1\n839.9\nOther non-current assets\n50.7\n42.9\nTotal assets\n$\n2,754.7\n$\n2,799.1\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nNotes payable\n$\n0.7\n$\n—\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n42.0\n43.2\nAccounts payable\n188.6\n178.2\nAccrued compensation\n40.4\n60.9\nAccrued customer program liabilities\n98.5\n141.1\nAccrued interest\n6.8\n1.2\nOther current liabilities\n112.1\n113.8\nTotal current liabilities\n489.1\n538.4\nLong-term debt, net\n908.4\n889.2\nDeferred income taxes\n174.8\n177.1\nPension and post-retirement benefit obligations\n268.3\n275.5\nOther non-current liabilities\n149.1\n144.8\nTotal liabilities\n1,989.7\n2,025.0\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock\n1.1\n1.1\nTreasury stock\n(33.9)\n(26.4)\nPaid-in capital\n1,999.1\n1,999.7\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(467.4)\n(461.1)\nAccumulated deficit\n(733.9)\n(739.2)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n765.0\n774.1\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n2,754.7\n$\n2,799.1\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\n(In millions of dollars, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017 (A)\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n405.8\n$\n359.8\n13%\nCost of products sold\n278.3\n248.9\n12%\nGross profit\n127.5\n110.9\n15%\nOperating costs and expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n101.8\n94.2\n8%\nAmortization of intangibles\n9.3\n8.0\n16%\nRestructuring charges\n4.7\n1.5\n213%\nTotal operating costs and expenses\n115.8\n103.7\n12%\nOperating income\n11.7\n7.2\n63%\nNon-operating expense (income):\nInterest expense\n9.4\n9.8\n(4)%\nInterest income\n(1.0)\n(1.3)\n(23)%\nNon-operating pension income\n(2.2)\n(2.1)\n5%\nOther (income) expense, net\n(0.6)\n0.7\nNM\nIncome before income tax\n6.1\n0.1\nNM\nIncome tax benefit\n(4.3)\n(3.5)\n23%\nNet income\n$\n10.4\n$\n3.6\n189%\nPer share:\nBasic income per share\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.03\n233%\nDiluted income per share\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.03\n200%\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding:\nBasic\n106.8\n108.3\nDiluted\n110.0\n112.4\nDividends per common share\n$\n0.06\n—\nStatistics (as a % of Net sales, except Income tax rate)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nGross profit (Net sales, less Cost of products sold)\n31.4\n%\n30.8\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n25.1\n%\n26.2\n%\nOperating income\n2.9\n%\n2.0\n%\nIncome before income tax\n1.5\n%\n—\n%\nNet income\n2.6\n%\n1.0\n%\nIncome tax rate\n(70.5)\n%\nNM\n(A) 2017 historical data has been restated for ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. This new standard requires presentation of all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service costs, in an income statement line item outside of a subtotal of income from operations. This has resulted in the reclass of $2.1 million of income out of operating income into the account \"non-operating pension income\" for the period ending March 31, 2017.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(in millions of dollars)\n2018\n2017\nOperating activities\nNet income\n$\n10.4\n$\n3.6\nAmortization of inventory step-up\n—\n0.9\nLoss on disposal of assets\n0.1\n—\nDepreciation\n9.0\n9.0\nAmortization of debt issuance costs\n0.5\n1.4\nAmortization of intangibles\n9.3\n8.0\nStock-based compensation\n3.2\n2.4\nChanges in balance sheet items:\nAccounts receivable\n162.0\n165.3\nInventories\n(43.5)\n(31.2)\nOther assets\n(8.0)\n(0.8)\nAccounts payable\n8.8\n(4.3)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\n(78.7)\n(73.4)\nAccrued income taxes\n(12.7)\n(15.5)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n60.4\n65.4\nInvesting activities\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\n(8.0)\n(5.2)\nProceeds from the disposition of assets\n—\n0.1\nCost of acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n—\n(292.6)\nNet cash used by investing activities\n(8.0)\n(297.7)\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from long-term borrowings\n21.5\n412.0\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(11.6)\n(94.4)\nBorrowings of notes payable, net\n0.7\n—\nPayments for debt issuance costs\n—\n(3.4)\nDividends paid\n(6.4)\n—\nRepurchases of common stock\n(9.1)\n—\nPayments related to tax withholding for stock-based compensation\n(7.4)\n(9.2)\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options\n5.3\n1.4\nNet cash (used) provided by financing activities\n(7.0)\n306.4\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n0.4\n1.3\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n45.8\n75.4\nCash and cash equivalents\nBeginning of the period\n76.9\n42.9\nEnd of the period\n$\n122.7\n$\n118.3\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Information (Unaudited)\n(In millions of dollars, except per share data)\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of certain Income Statement information reported in accordance with GAAP to adjusted Non-GAAP Information.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nReported\n% of\nAdjusted\nAdjusted\n% of\nReported\n% of\nAdjusted\nAdjusted\n% of\n% Change\nGAAP\nSales\nItems\nNon-GAAP\nSales\nGAAP\nSales\nItems\nNon-GAAP\nSales\nAdjusted\nGross profit\n$\n127.5\n31.4\n%\n$\n—\n$\n127.5\n31.4\n%\n$\n110.9\n30.8\n%\n$\n0.9\n(A.1)\n$\n111.8\n31.1\n%\n14\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n101.8\n25.1\n%\n(1.6)\n(A.2)\n100.2\n24.7\n%\n94.2\n26.2\n%\n(4.4)\n(A.2)\n89.8\n25.0\n%\n12\n%\nRestructuring charges\n4.7\n(4.7)\n(A.3)\n—\n1.5\n(1.5)\n(A.3)\n—\nNM\nOperating income\n11.7\n2.9\n%\n6.3\n18.0\n4.4\n%\n7.2\n2.0\n%\n6.8\n14.0\n3.9\n%\n29\n%\nOther (income) expense, net\n(0.6)\n—\n(0.6)\n0.7\n(0.3)\n(A.4)\n0.4\nNM\nIncome before income tax\n6.1\n1.5\n%\n6.3\n12.4\n3.1\n%\n0.1\n—\n%\n7.1\n7.2\n2.0\n%\n72\n%\nIncome tax expense\n(4.3)\n7.8\n(A.5)\n3.5\n(3.5)\n5.8\n(A.5)\n2.3\n52\n%\nIncome tax rate\n(70.5)\n%\n28.0\n%\nNM\n32.0\n%\nNet income\n$\n10.4\n2.6\n%\n$\n(1.5)\n$\n8.9\n2.2\n%\n$\n3.6\n1.0\n%\n$\n1.3\n$\n4.9\n1.4\n%\n82\n%\nDiluted income per share\n$\n0.09\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.08\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.04\n100\n%\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding:\n110.0\n110.0\n112.4\n112.4\nNotes for Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Information (Unaudited)\nA.\n\"Adjusted\" results exclude restructuring charges, amortization of the step-up in value of finished goods, transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisitions of Esselte Group Holdings AB (\"Esselte\") and Pelikan Artline, other one-time or non-recurring items and all unusual income tax items, including income taxes related to the aforementioned items; in addition, income taxes have been recalculated at a normalized tax rate of 28% for 2018 and 32% for 2017.\n1.\nRepresents the adjustment related to the amortization of step-up in the value of finished goods inventory associated with the acquisition of Esselte in 2017.\n2.\nRepresents the elimination of transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisitions of Esselte (in 2018 and 2017) and Pelikan Artline (in 2017 only).\n3.\nRepresents the elimination of restructuring charges.\n4.\nRepresents the write-off of debt issuance costs and other costs associated with the Company's refinancing in the first quarter of 2017 related to the Esselte acquisition.\n5.\nPrimarily reflects the tax effect of the adjustments outlined in items A.1-4 above and adjusts the company's effective tax rate to a normalized rate of 28% for 2018 and 32% for 2017. The lower normalized tax rate for 2018 is primarily due to the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company's estimated long-term rate remains subject to variations from the mix of earnings across the Company's operating jurisdictions and changes in tax laws.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited)\n(In millions of dollars)\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" represents net income after adding back depreciation; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of intangibles; interest expense, net; other (income) expense, net; and income tax benefit.

This new standard requires presentation of all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service costs, in an income statement line item outside of a subtotal of income from operations. This has resulted in the reclass of $8.5 million of income out of operating income into the account \"non-operating pension income/costs\" for the annual period ending December 31, 2017.\n(B) See \"Notes for Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Information (Unaudited)\" for a description of adjusted items on page 8.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Net Sales Change Analysis (Unaudited)\nPercent Change - Sales\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nComparable\nNet Sales\nChange $'s (A)\n(In millions of\ndollars)\nComparable\nNet Sales\nCurrency\nNet Sales\nChange\nTranslation\nAcquisition\nChange (A)\nQ1 2018:\nACCO Brands North America\n(5.3)%\n0.5%\n0.5%\n$(11.1)\n(6.3)%\nACCO Brands EMEA\n60.1%\n14.2%\n44.2%\n1.6\n1.7%\nACCO Brands International\n(3.1)%\n2.7%\n0.7%\n(5.7)\n(6.5)%\nTotal\n12.8%\n4.7%\n12.3%\n$(15.2)\n(4.2)%\n(A) Comparable net sales excluding acquisitions and with current period foreign operation sales translated at prior year currency rates.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acco-brands-corporation-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300639612.html\nSOURCE ACCO Brands Corporation",
