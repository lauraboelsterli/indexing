    "text": "1 st Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues increased 20.1% year-over-year to $246.6 million Net loss of $84.7 million; $122.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA a 55,502 New Subscribers, 41.3% year-over-year Increase 10.7% Attrition Rate, 130 basis points year-over-year improvement\nPROVO, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- APX Group Holdings, Inc. (“APX Group”, “Vivint” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAdoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nAs of January 1, 2018, the company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), the new U.S. accounting standard for revenue recognition, using the cumulative catch-up transition method. Adoption of the new standard resulted in changes to the accounting policies for revenue recognition, deferred revenue and capitalized contract costs (formerly subscriber acquisition costs). The cumulative effect of applying the new standard to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of January 1, 2018 was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date. The company is providing comparable results, in addition to GAAP, to help investors better understand the impact on financials from Topic 606. The impact of the adoption of Topic 606 is primarily related to the acceleration of revenue recognition associated with deferred product revenue. All results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 in this earnings release are reported under Topic 606 unless otherwise indicated. All results for periods prior to 2018 are reported under previous accounting standards and are consistent with previously reported results for those periods.\nTodd Pedersen, CEO of APX Group, commented, ”As always, the first quarter is a busy time of year for Vivint as we prepare for the summer selling season, focus on key initiatives and roll out new products and offerings. From a sales perspective, we achieved strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter, adding over 55,000 New Subscribers during the quarter, up 41% from the same period a year ago. The retail channel added approximately 8,000 customers, while our Inside Sales channel added over 31,000, or a 27% increase year-over-year, and our Direct to Home channel added over 16,400 New Subscribers, or an 11% increase year-over-year. We have several new hardware devices coming to market during 2018, including a second generation version of our proprietary Sky Panel, which we believe will improve customer experience and service costs, particularly in the area of wireless connectivity. We have fine-tuned pricing and service packages, which we believe will enhance customer close-rates and improve our unit of one economics. We have work to do in all areas of our business, including the scaling of our fixed costs infrastructure and subscriber acquisition costs. I feel we are off to a good start to the year.”\nRevenue and Subscriber Data\nAPX Group reported total revenues of $246.6 million versus $205.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $41.2 million, or 20.1%, as compared to the same period in 2017, of which $8.6 million was associated with the adoption of Topic 606 related to the timing of revenue recognition.\nTotal recurring and other revenue increased $49.7 million, or 25.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, of which $19.3 million was associated with the adoption of Topic 606 related to the timing of revenue recognition and classification of revenue components.\nExcluding the impact of the adoption of Topic 606 , recurring and other revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $227.3 million, which represented an increase of $30.4 million, or 15.5% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. Approximately $25.8 million was due to an increase of 14.1% in Total Subscribers. Recurring and other revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, included recognized deferred product revenue and RIC imputed interest of $12.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The increase in recurring and other revenue was partially offset by $11.0 million from a decrease in the average MSR per user of approximately $3.00 attributable to the Company's transition to Vivint Flex Pay in early 2017. When compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, foreign currency translation positively affected total revenues by $0.8 million, as computed on a constant currency basis.\nThe Company added 55,502 New Subscribers during the first quarter of 2018, a 41.3% increase compared to the 39,292 New Subscribers added during the same period in 2017. The Company experienced growth in all sales channels; direct-to-home and inside sales channel grew 10.9% and 27.0%, respectively.\na: This earning release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a metric that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See the “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section at the end of this earnings release for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSummary of Quarterly Key Financial and Portfolio Metrics\n($ in millions, except for subscriber data)\nMarch 31,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nTotal Revenues $ 205.4 $ 212.1 $ 228.7 $ 235.8 $ 246.6 Net Loss $ (82.6 ) $ (84.2 ) $ (107.9 ) $ (135.4 ) $ (84.7 ) Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 115.4 $ 120.5 $ 128.6 $ 125.9 $ 122.9 Adj EBITDA Margin 56.2 % 56.8 % 56.2 % 53.4 % 49.8 % New Subscribers (1) 39,292 92,837 89,019 52,342 55,502 Total Subscribers (1) 1,151,453 1,215,056 1,270,478 1,292,698 1,313,742 Total Monthly Service Revenue (1) $ 65.99 $ 68.52 $ 71.24 $ 70.99 $ 70.95 Average Monthly Service Revenue per User (1) $ 57.31 $ 56.40 $ 56.07 $ 54.92 $ 54.00 Total Monthly Revenue (1) $ 68.45 $ 70.71 $ 76.22 $ 78.62 $ 82.20 Average Monthly Revenue per User (1) $ 59.53 $ 59.56 $ 60.52 $ 61.09 $ 62.97 Attrition Rate (2) 12.0 % 11.5 % 11.3 % 11.0 % 10.7 % (1) Data excludes wireless internet business and pilot programs and are provided as of each period end\n(2) Attrition Rate is reported on an LTM basis for each period end and excludes wireless internet business and pilot programs\n“Vivint continues to grow top-line revenue at an acceptable rate, 20% year-over-year under ASC 606 accounting, subscriber additions are healthy and our attrition rates have shown steady improvement, coming in at 10.7% in the first quarter which is a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year,” said Mark Davies, Chief Financial Officer of APX Group. “However, we would like to improve our fixed-costs scaling, subscriber acquisition costs and customer credit profile. As we have previously communicated, Vivint has spent the last several years building out a strategically-differentiated smart home platform, including software, cloud and hardware technologies, sales channels and innovative service offerings, such as Flex Pay. And, as we have more than doubled our revenue over the last five years, along with our plans to continue industry-leading smart home growth, we have added resources in IT, infrastructure and key management capabilities. While we will continue to judiciously invest in growth and differentiation, we believe we have reached a stage where we can scale our adjusted EBITDA, while being more selective in adding new customers from a subscriber acquisition costs perspective. Driving efficiency in all areas of our business – subscriber acquisition and service costs, G&A, strategic investments and credit-based pricing – is a key element of our go-forward plans.”\nCosts and Expenses\nOperating expenses increased $12.4 million, or 17.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in personnel and support costs of $11.5 million driven by a 14.1% increase in the Total Subscribers, an additional $3.2 million in channel expansion costs associated with our retail sales efforts, an increase of $1.2 million of auto-related costs and $0.7 million of payment processing costs primarily attributed to the Vivint Flex Pay. These increases were offset by $4.2 million of certain contract costs previously expensed, but now recorded as capitalized contract costs in connection with the adoption of Topic 606. Net service cost per subscriber was $17.04, which contributed to a net service margin of 68.6% for the first quarter 2018, as compared to $15.95 in 2017.\nSelling expenses increased by $24.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to $13.1 million in channel expansion costs, specifically $11.0 million of personnel and related support cost and $1.4 million of travel related costs, associated with the retail sales channel. In addition, our direct to home and inside sales channels selling expenses increased by $7.3 million in personnel and related costs, $1.9 million of information technology costs and marketing costs of $1.8 million primarily associated with lead generation related to subscriber growth in inside sales and materials to support the direct to home sales force.\nThe Company’s Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs per New Subscriber was $1,488 for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $2,021 for the same period in 2017. Vivint Flex Pay increased the average proceeds collected at point of sale by approximately $957 per new subscriber. For the first quarter 2017, Vivint Flex Pay did not include an option for New Subscribers to finance through Citizens Bank.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses increased $12.1 million, or 31.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs of $7.0 million, including $1.6 million associated with the Company offering a 401(k) match, and an increase in legal services of $3.1 million, related to on-going litigation fees, and a $1.0 million increase in insurance costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Net Loss\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $122.9 million and net loss was $84.7 million, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $115.4 million and net loss of $82.6 million for the same period in 2017.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity position on a consolidated basis, defined as cash on hand, short-term marketable securities and available borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility, was approximately $219 million.\nCertain Credit Statistics\nThe Company’s net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, was 5.7x at March 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nVivint Smart Home will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the quarterly results at 5:00 p.m. ET today, May 15, 2018.

This metric excludes subscribers originated under pilot sales programs.\nTotal Monthly Service Revenue (MSR) – the aggregate, contracted recurring monthly service billings to our smart home and security subscribers, based on the number of Total Subscribers as of the end of a given period. This metric reflects billings for our services and excludes monthly billings for the purchases of our products.\nAverage Monthly Service Revenue per User (AMSRU) – MSR divided by the number of Total Subscribers as of the end of a given period.\nTotal Monthly Revenue (Total MR) – average monthly total revenue recognized during the period.\nAverage Monthly Revenue per User (AMRU) – Total MR divided by average monthly Total Subscribers during a given period.\nAttrition Rate – the aggregate number of canceled smart home and security subscribers during the prior 12 month period divided by the monthly weighted average number of Total Subscribers, based on the Total Subscribers at the beginning and end of each month of a given period. Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us or if payment from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible (when at least four monthly billings become past due). If a sale of a service contract to third parties occurs, or a subscriber relocates but continues their service, we do not consider this as a cancellation. If a subscriber transfers their service contract to a new subscriber, we do not consider this as a cancellation.\nNet Service Cost per Subscriber– average monthly service costs for the period, including monitoring, customer service, field service and other service support costs, less total non-recurring product and service billings for the period divided by average monthly Total Subscribers for the same period.\nNet Service Margin - the monthly average MSR for the period, less average net service costs for the period divided by the average MSR for the period.\nNew Subscribers – the aggregate number of net new smart home and security subscribers originated during a given period. This metric excludes new subscribers acquired by the transfer of a service contract from one subscriber to another and subscribers originated under pilot sales programs.\nNet Subscriber Acquisition Costs per New Subscriber – the direct and indirect costs to create a new smart home and security subscriber divided by New Subscribers for a given 12 month period. These costs include commissions, equipment, installation, marketing, sales support and other allocations (general and administrative and overhead); less cash received from product sales associated with the initial installation, activation fees, installation fees and upsell revenue.\na: Thi s earning release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a metric that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”).

We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nSee the following table for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss, which we believe is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAPX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In millions)\nAPX GROUP HOLDINGS, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In millions) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, March 31, 2017 2017 2017 2017 2018 Net loss $ (82.6 ) $ (84.2 ) $ (107.9 ) $ (135.4 ) $ (84.7 ) Interest expense, net 53.6 54.9 58.0 59.1 58.8 Other expense (income), net 12.0 (1.9\n) 8.6 9.2 5.1 Gain on sale of spectrum(i) - - - - (50.4\n) Income tax expense (benefit), net 0.4 0.7 1.2 (1.2\n) (0.4\n) Depreciation and amortization (ii) 30.0 30.6 30.9 31.6 28.9 Amortization of capitalized contract costs 46.9 49.5 53.6 56.2 95.4 Non-capitalized contract costs (iii) 43.3 59.8 69.5 82.9 70.9 Non-cash compensation (iv) 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2 Other Adjustments (v) 11.4 10.7 14.4 23.2 12.0 Adjustment for change in accounting principle (Topic 606)(vi) - - - - (12.9\n) Adjusted EBITDA $ 115.4 $ 120.5 $ 128.6 $ 125.9 $ 122.9 i.\nGain on sale of spectrum intangible assets during the three months end March 31, 2018.\nii.\nExcludes loan amortization costs that are included in interest expense.\niii.\nReflects subscriber acquisition costs that are expensed as incurred because they are not directly related to the acquisition of specific subscribers.\nCertain other industry participants purchase subscribers through subscriber contract purchases, and as a result, may capitalize the full cost to purchase these subscribers' contracts, as compared to our organic generation of new subscribers, which requires us to expense a portion of our subscriber acquisition costs under GAAP.\niv.\nReflects non-cash compensation costs related to employee and director stock and stock option plans\nv.\nOther adjustments including items such as product development costs, subcontracted monitoring fee savings, non-recurring gain, and other adjustments.\nvi.\nAdjustment to eliminate the impact of the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180515006687/en/\nAPX Group Holdings, Inc.\nDale R.
