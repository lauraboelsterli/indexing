    "text": "(Corrects first paragraph to say surplus instead of deficit)\nWASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that China is “meeting many of our demands” on reducing its trade surplus with the United States but that no deal had emerged yet.\n“China has come to trade,” Kudlow told reporters at the White House as U.S. officials met with a Chinese trade delegation for a second day. “They are meeting many of our demands. There is no deal yet to be sure, and it’s probably going to take a while to process, but they’re coming to play.” (Reporting By Steve Holland; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n ",
