    "text": "ROCK HILL, S.C., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the company reported six percent revenue growth to $165.9 million compared to $156.4 million in the first quarter of the previous year. The company reported a first quarter 2018 GAAP loss of $0.19 per share compared to a loss of $0.09 per share in the prior year, and first quarter 2018 non-GAAP loss of $0.03 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\n“We are pleased with our revenue in the first quarter, which was driven by printers, healthcare and software,” commented Vyomesh Joshi (VJ), chief executive officer, 3D Systems. “While we still have work to do, we believe our investments in go-to-market, process improvements and better execution worldwide are starting to show returns. We remain excited about the new products we plan to bring to market throughout the year and the incremental opportunity we believe they will provide for long term growth.”\nThe company reported 24 percent higher printer revenue on 44 percent higher printer unit sales as well as growth in software, on demand manufacturing and healthcare solutions.\nThe company reported GAAP gross profit margin of 46.9 percent for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 51.3 percent in the first quarter of the prior year. The impact of mix of sales and continued investment in services and on demand manufacturing offset cost reductions achieved from ongoing supply chain cost reduction initiatives.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP operating expenses were $95.4 million compared to $89.3 million in the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased 5 percent to $69.5 million, which included continued investment in go-to-market and IT transformation. R&D expenses increased 13 percent over the first quarter of 2017 to $25.9 million, including continued investments in support of the previously announced new products the company plans to start shipping throughout 2018.\n”We have made significant progress in many areas of the company, and we continue to make strategic investments in organizational and operational improvements which we believe are critical for long term success,” commented John McMullen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “We remain committed to improving our cost structure over the long term. In line with that, during the first quarter, we put in place a cost optimization plan to drive efficiencies, continue to focus resources around our strategic priorities, and leverage our IT investments.”\nDuring the quarter, the company used $1.5 million of cash in operations and ended the quarter with $121.6 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\n“We believe 2018 is a corner turn year in our multi-year turnaround and transformation process. We are focused on execution, operational efficiency and bringing our new solutions to market to drive long-term growth and profitability,” concluded Joshi.\nQ1 2018 Conference Call and Webcast\nThe company expects to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the Commission on May 2, 2018. 3D Systems plans to hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss these results on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nDate: Wednesday, May 2, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time\nListen via Internet: www.3dsystems.com/investor\nParticipate via telephone:\nWithin the U.S.: 1-877-407-8291\nOutside the U.S.: 1-201-689-8345\nA replay of the webcast will be available approximately two hours after the live presentation at www.3dsystems.com/investor .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
