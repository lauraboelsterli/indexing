    "text": "(Reuters) - Factbox on the Costa Rica national team ahead of the 2018 World Cup:\nFIFA ranking: 25 (till June 7)\nPrevious tournaments:\nCosta Rica will be appearing in their fifth World Cup four years after their best finish with a run to the quarter-finals in Brazil, where they lost to the Netherlands on penalties.\nFew expected Costa Rica to get out of a group featuring three former World Cup winners — England, Italy and Uruguay. However, some spirited and enterprising displays saw the Central Americans top the section and beat Greece on penalties in the last 16 before their heartbreaking defeat by the Dutch.\nThe first appearance of Los Ticos in a finals was at Italia ‘90 where they upset the odds by beating Scotland and Sweden to qualify from their group but then lost 4-1 to Czechoslovakia.\nIn 2002 and 2006 they failed to get out of their group.\nCoach:\nOscar Ramirez: The 53-year-old took over the national team reins in 2015 when he was promoted from his role as assistant to Paulo Wanchope when the former Manchester City player stood down after he was involved in an altercation with a fan.\nRamirez was a safe choice for the Costa Rican federation, given he had had a previous spell with the national team, as assistant to Hernan Medford, and also had plenty of experience in the domestic league with top clubs Saprissa and Alajuelense.\nAs a player, midfielder Ramirez made 75 appearances for his country including at the 1990 World Cup in Italy.\nDuring qualification Ramirez stuck largely with his experienced core group of players but he has gradually integrated a younger set of emerging talent.\nKey players:\nKeylor Navas: The 2014 World Cup changed the goalkeeper’s career when, after a series of outstanding performances, particularly against Greece in the last 16, he was signed by Real Madrid to replace Iker Casillas. While Navas has had to play against a backdrop of constant media reports that Real will replace him with a bigger name, the Costa Rican has kept his place with the European champions and heads into his second World Cup with two Champions League titles to his name.\nBryan Ruiz: The main creative force for Los Ticos, Ruiz has played in Europe since 2006 and the 32-year-old is enjoying something of an Indian summer at Sporting in Portugal. Ruiz can play as an advanced midfielder, support striker or winger.\nJoel Campbell: The 25-year-old striker’s career has yet to live up to the expectations generated by his move as a teenager to Arsenal. But while his club career has consisted of a series of loan moves to Spanish clubs (he is currently with Real Betis) Campbell has shown his quality for Costa Rica, with impressive performances in Brazil four years ago and two goals in the 4-0 thrashing of the United States in World Cup qualification.\nForm guide:\nSince qualification was secured, Ramirez’s side have suffered three defeats in four friendly games with a solitary win against Scotland. Defeats by Tunisia and Hungary hardly inspired confidence, while a 5-0 thrashing by Spain set off alarm bells. Ramirez will be hoping for better signs in June’s friendlies against Northern Ireland, England and Belgium.\nHow they qualified:\nLos Ticos got off to a flying start in CONCACAF’s final round of qualifying with a 2-0 win away to Trinidad & Tobago and then a 4-0 thrashing of the United States.\nA 2-0 win on the road in the U.S. was another impressive display and they finished comfortably in second place despite failing to win in their last three games.\nProspects:\nSerbia, Brazil and Switzerland represent a tough challenge in Group E. Costa Rica’s performances in advancing from an arguably tougher group four years ago offers hope but they do not look as sharp or effective as Jorge Luis Pinto’s 2014 side.\nRecent form would suggest Costa Rica will need a huge improvement to have any chance of getting out of the group.\nReporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
