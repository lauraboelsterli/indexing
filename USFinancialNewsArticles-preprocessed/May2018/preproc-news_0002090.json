Soccer Football - Champions League Semi Final Second Leg - Real Madrid v Bayern Munich - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - May 1, 2018 Real Madrid's Gareth Bale in action with Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich REUTERS/Michael Dalder\nBayern defender Joshua Kimmich had put the visitors ahead after three minutes but Benzema levelled with a free header in the 11th. A goalkeeping howler from Sven Ulreich then allowed Benzema to tap in Madrid’s second just after the break.\nJames Rodriguez, on loan from Madrid, equalised for Bayern in the 63rd to set up a gripping finale but Real held on despite waves of pressure to become the first team since Juventus in 1998 to reach the final for three years in succession.\nThey will meet Liverpool or AS Roma in the final in Kiev on May 26, where they will bid to become the first side since Bayern in 1976 to win the competition for three straight years.

We knew how to suffer together,” Real captain Sergio Ramos told reporters. “They had more possession but overall we were better. This team deserves to be in Kiev.”\nReal rode their luck to win the first leg in Munich 2-1 after Bayern had missed a slew of chances and Zinedine Zidane’s side made the most of their few opportunities.

Slideshow (2 Images) BAYERN FUMING\nAn end-to-end game ensued, with the midfield frequently bypassed with long balls up to the forwards.\nBayern could have re-taken the lead but striker Robert Lewandowski was foiled by Madrid goalkeeper Navas and Rodriguez sent the rebound flying over the bar from close range.\nBayern finished the half strongly but were left fuming at a failed penalty appeal when Kimmich’s shot struck Marcelo’s arm.\nThey contributed to their own demise, though, when Ulreich lost his footing as he tried to control a backpass from Corentin Tolisso, allowing Real’s much-maligned striker Benzema to tap in what proved to be the killer blow.\nBayern did create chances before and after Rodriguez’s goal but Navas denied the Colombia international while Mats Hummels headed wide from a corner in stoppage time.\nIt was Bayern’s fifth consecutive Champions League exit to a Spanish side, and their third to Madrid in that time.\n“We feel extremely bitter,” said Bayern defender Hummels. “We had chances in the first leg, we were more dangerous today (than Madrid) but in the end Real made fewer big mistakes.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis and Ken Ferris",
