    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (“Cheniere Partners Holdings”) (NYSE American: CQH) reported net income of $122.8 million, or $0.53 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.02 per common share, for the comparable 2017 period. Results include the distribution received from our limited partner interests in Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”), a publicly traded limited partnership (NYSE American: CQP).\nThe increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven by increased equity income from our investment in Cheniere Partners primarily as a result of distributions being paid to our subordinated units, an increase in common units held by us subsequent to the conversion of Class B units into common units on August 2, 2017, and an increase in quarterly distributions per unit received from Cheniere Partners.\nOur only business consists of owning Cheniere Partners common units and subordinated units representing an aggregate approximately 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners as of March 31, 2018.\nRevised 2018 Full Year Dividend Guidance\nPrevious Revised Dividend per Share $ 2.05 - $ 2.25 $ 2.25 - $ 2.35 SPL Project Update\nSPL Project Liquefaction Train Trains 1-4 Train 5 Train 6 Project Status Operational Under Construction Permitted Expected Substantial Completion Complete 1H 2019 — Expected DFCD (1) Window Start Complete 2H 2019 — (1) Date of First Commercial Delivery\nThrough Cheniere Partners, we are developing up to six natural gas liquefaction Trains (“Trains”) at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities (the “SPL Project”). Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place.\nDividends\nWhen Cheniere Partners makes cash distributions to us with respect to our Cheniere Partners units, we will pay dividends to our shareholders consisting of the cash that we receive from Cheniere Partners, less income taxes and reserves established by our Board of Directors.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nCheniere Energy, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its financial and operating results for the first quarter on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern time / 9 a.m. Central time.
