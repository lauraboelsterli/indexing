    "text": "10 COMMENTS Apple Inc. AAPL 1.40% and Goldman Sachs GS 0.83% Group Inc. are preparing to launch a new joint credit card, a move that would deepen the technology giant’s push into its customers’ wallets and mark the Wall Street firm’s first foray into plastic.\nThe planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said. Apple will replace its longstanding rewards-card partnership with Barclays BCS 0.68% PLC, the people said.\nThe Apple-Goldman card could help the companies combat weaknesses in their core businesses. As new iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is focusing on services such as mobile payments, streaming-music subscriptions, and App Store sales. Apple Pay, which generates revenue on each transaction, is a key contributor, but adoption has been slower than executives hoped.\nGoldman, meanwhile, is pushing into consumer banking to compensate for a slump in securities-trading, where revenue has fallen by two-thirds since the financial crisis. It launched a retail banking business called Marcus in 2016 for online savings accounts and personal loans, and executives have been exploring adding credit cards and wealth-management tools.\nThe partnership will extend into other services including Goldman offering in-store loans to Apple customers buying iPhones and other gadgets, an effort The Wall Street Journal reported on in February.\nApple and Goldman are still hashing out the terms and benefits of the planned card including the perks for customers, these people said. The current Apple credit card with Barclays offers interest-free financing on Apple devices and points toward Apple gift cards.\nApple, Goldman and Barclays declined to comment.\nMore Business News\nRelease of Thousands of Russia-Linked Facebook Ads Shows How Propaganda Sharpened May 10, 2018 Nvidia Is Poised to Report a Strong Lift from AI and Gaming May 10, 2018 In Dropbox’s First Earnings Report, Look for Number of Paying Users May 10, 2018 U.S. Safety Investigators Examine Another Fatal Tesla Crash May 9, 2018 Pension-Fund Adviser Urges No Votes Against Three on Tesla Board May 9, 2018 The Apple Pay card is the latest example of a technology giant broadening its presence in the banking and finance industry. Besides Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Samsung Electronics Co. are all vying to make mobile payments easier for consumers while adding to their formidable revenue streams.\nGoldman has the potential to raise Apple Pay’s profile, tying the mobile payment service to plastic touted in advertising and pushed by cashiers at Apple stores.\nApple also stands to boost its revenue by collecting a bounty from Goldman for each new cardholder, the people said. These payments, which are common in store-brand cards, can exceed $100 per account. With the Barclays card, Apple declined to collect bounties and instead put that money toward interest-free financing of devices.\nAdditionally, Apple could take a larger cut of mobile payments from the card if it is used for purchases, the person said. Currently, when a consumer pays for a purchase using the digital wallet on the iPhone—regardless of what credit card the customer charges—Apple receives 0.15% per transaction. Apple could more than double that under the agreement with Goldman, one of the people said.\nThe additional revenue could help Apple as it pursues a goal of doubling its services business to about $50 billion annually by 2020 from $24.35 billion in 2016.\nBut as Apple shifts from a Barclays card that encourages device sales with interest-free financing to a card designed to boost Apple Pay, the challenge could be driving enough of an uptick in mobile payments to offset any decline of high-price iPhones, iPads or Macs.\nFor Goldman, the card could help its nascent retail-banking operation, launched in 2016, add new customers who may be sold other banking products. It also deepens the firm’s ties to Apple, a company its bankers have advised in deals and fundraisings for years.\nWithout branches or a well-known Main Street brand, Goldman has relied on referrals, and pays for customer leads from firms including tax-preparation software maker Intuit Inc. and personal-finance website Credit Karma Inc. Last month it bought personal-finance app Clarity Money, gaining access to its roughly one million users.​\nStill, the push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two-years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants.\nAnd after marketing its Marcus products in part by criticizing credit-card fees and high interest rates, its entry into that business may invite criticism from consumer advocates and regulators.\nIt is unclear which card network— Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. or Discover Financial Services —will process transactions for the new card. Apple has had a longstanding relationship with Visa, which is based in San Francisco.\nBarclaycard executives managing the Apple account met at the tech giant’s Cupertino, Calif., office in recent weeks to determine whether the account—one of its most high profile—would be extended, a person familiar with the meeting said. The bank began issuing the Apple credit card in 2005.\n—AnnaMaria Andriotis contributed to this article.\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com and Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com",
