    "text": "Oil workers go on strike in Brazil Published 8 Mins Ago The Associated Press\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) â€” Brazilian oil workers have begun a 72-hour strike on the heels of a crippling nationwide truck drivers' strike that has started winding down after 10 days.\nThe country's two main oil workers' unions say the strike was called to demand lower fuel prices and the resignation of Pedro Parente, president of state-owned oil company Petrobras.\nThe strike began Wednesday in defiance of Brazil's top labor court, which declared it illegal and said the unions will have to pay a daily fine of 500,000 reals (about $135,000).\nAccording to the Oil Worker's Federation, the strike has halted production at refineries in six states.\nPetrobras said in a statement that contingency teams were operating production units where the strike prevented shift changes from taking place.",
