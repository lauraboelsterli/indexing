    "text": "1 COMMENTS OTTAWA—Canada on Tuesday struck a multibillion deal with Kinder Morgan Inc. to take ownership of the Trans Mountain pipeline project in a bid to save the project.\nCanada and Kinder Morgan agreed on a pricetag of 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.5 billion), Finance Minister Bill Morneau said at a press conference Tuesday morning. The federal government and the Houston company were in talks for over a month about saving the project, which Kinder Morgan threatened to abandon as of Thursday unless federal officials remove political and legal uncertainty.\nMr. Morneau said this deal will eliminate “political risk” over the project, and ensures the corridor will be built.\nIn a statement, Kinder Morgan chief executive Steve Kean said the deal “represents the best opportunity to complete [the project] and thereby realize the great national economic benefits promised by that project.”\nMr. Morneau added the government does not intend to be a long-term owner of the pipeline, adding that Canadian pension funds, indigenous groups and other investors have expressed interest in it.\nMr. Kean said during a conference call that the deal should close by the end of the year, and the company would help the government find a new buyer for the pipeline through July 22.\nShareholders of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd. will receive C$12 a share after taxes. The company expects its proceeds from the deal to total C$1.25 billion after taxes.\nMr. Kean said the company has not yet decided what to do with that money.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com",
