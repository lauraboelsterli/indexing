    "text": "(Repeats to attach to additional alerts) TOKYO, May 18 (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday. The core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, compared with economists' median estimate for a 0.8 percent annual gain. Stripping away the effect of fresh food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April from a year ago. (Reporting by Leika Kihara)\n ",
