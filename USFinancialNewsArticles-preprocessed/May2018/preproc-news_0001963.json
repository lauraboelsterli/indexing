    "text": "Revenues of $41.0 Billion for the Second Quarter, a 10.5 Percent Increase Year-Over-Year\nSecond Quarter GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.29 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.94\nAdjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Maintained at $6.45 to $6.65 for Fiscal 2018; Company Expects to be at Bottom of Range\nVALLEY FORGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today reported that in its fiscal year 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018, revenue increased 10.5 percent to $41.0 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.29 for the March quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.86 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 9.6 percent to $1.94 in the fiscal second quarter.\nAmerisourceBergen now believes adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2018 will be at the bottom of its guidance range of $6.45 to $6.65, reflecting growth of 10 percent versus last fiscal year. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2018 Expectations.\n“I am pleased with our performance in the March quarter as associates and businesses within AmerisourceBergen continue to execute. Our distribution businesses are creating significant value for our customers as we grow volumes and help support their businesses in a dynamic healthcare market,” said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen.\n“Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects the strong performance of our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, helping to offset a lower contribution from its PharMEDium business. We remain confident in the value, efficiency and safety PharMEDium provides the healthcare system and are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products and services,” Mr. Collis continued. “As we move further into fiscal 2018, we are excited to begin realizing the benefits of investments throughout AmerisourceBergen that further enhance the value and efficiency we offer to our provider customers and manufacturer partners. Our long-term relationships and unique portfolio of integrated pharmaceutical services enable AmerisourceBergen to continue living its purpose as we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Summary Results\nGAAP Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Revenue $41.0B $41.0B Gross Profit $1.3B $1.3B Operating Expenses $774M $692M Operating Income $481M $586M Interest Expense, Net $49M $49M Tax Rate 21.9% 20.7% Net Income Attributable to ABC $287M $432M Diluted Shares Outstanding 222M 222M Diluted Earnings Per Share $1.29 $1.94 In conjunction with incremental investments made in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 relating to Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil, AmerisourceBergen began consolidating their operating results. Below, AmerisourceBergen presents descriptive summaries of the Company’s GAAP quarterly results as well as its adjusted (Non-GAAP) quarterly results. In the tables that follow, GAAP results and GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations are presented. For more information related to Non-GAAP financial measures, including our fiscal year 2018 expectations, please refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures following the tables.\nSecond Quarter GAAP Results\nRevenue: In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $41.0 billion, up 10.5 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a 10.4 percent increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue and a 12.6 percent increase in revenue within Other. Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $1.3 billion, relatively flat compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, due to the negative impact of PharMEDium's lower revenues and its facility remediation costs in the current year quarter and a LIFO credit that benefited the previous year period. There was no LIFO expense or credit in the fiscal 2018 second quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 3.06 percent, a decrease of 32 basis points from the prior year quarter. Operating Expenses: In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, operating expenses were $774.3 million, compared to $631.4 million in the same period last fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of H. D. Smith, consolidation of Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil, operating additional distribution centers in the current year quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems, as well as increased costs to support our revenue growth. Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, operating income was $481.4 million versus $625.0 million in the prior year period. Other Loss (Income): In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, other loss included a $30.0 million impairment on a non-customer note receivable related to a start-up venture. Interest Expense, Net: In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, net interest expense of $48.6 million was up 30.4 percent versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the new debt issued to finance the H. D. Smith acquisition. Loss on Consolidation of Equity Investments: In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, a loss of $42.3 million was incurred primarily relating to the recognition of unrealized foreign currency translation losses in connection with the remeasurement of equity interests in Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil. Tax Rate: The effective tax rate of 21.9 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflects the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the benefit from stock option exercises. Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was $1.29 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.86 in the previous fiscal year’s second quarter. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were 222.3 million, a 0.5 percent increase versus the prior fiscal year second quarter, due primarily to stock option exercises, net of share repurchases.\nDefinition of Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Results\nThe comments below compare adjusted results, which exclude:\nGain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense (credit); PharMEDium remediation costs; Acquisition-related intangibles amortization; Employee severance, litigation, and other; Loss on consolidation of equity investments; Impairment on non-customer note receivable; Loss on early retirement of debt; and a One-time tax reform adjustment.\nIn addition, we previously issued $600 million of 1.15 percent senior notes that were repaid in May 2017 to fund our initial special share repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of the Warrants. The interest expense incurred relating to this borrowing has been excluded from the Non-GAAP presentation.\nSecond Quarter Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Results\nRevenue: In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $41.0 billion, up 10.5 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a 10.4 percent increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue and a 12.6 percent increase in revenue within Other. Adjusted Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 second quarter was $1.3 billion, which was up 9.2 percent when compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, which includes the acquisition of H. D. Smith and the consolidation of Profarma. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 3.11 percent, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year quarter. Adjusted Operating Expenses: In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, operating expenses were $691.5 million, an increase of 18.9% compared to the same period in the last fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fiscal 2018 second quarter were 1.69 percent, compared to 1.57 percent for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was driven by the acquisition of H. D. Smith, consolidation of Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil, operating additional distribution centers in the current year quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems, as well as increased costs to support our revenue growth. Adjusted Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, operating income of $586.3 million decreased 0.4 percent from the prior year period. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 15 basis points to 1.43 percent in the fiscal 2018 second quarter compared to the previous fiscal year’s second quarter. Adjusted Interest Expense, Net: In the fiscal 2018 second quarter, net interest expense of $48.6 million was up 38.4 percent versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the new debt issued to finance the H. D. Smith acquisition. Adjusted Tax Rate: The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 20.7 percent, down from 30.1 percent in the previous fiscal year’s second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was up 9.6 percent to $1.94 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.77 in the previous fiscal year’s second quarter, driven by the benefit from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were 222.3 million, a 0.5 percent increase versus the prior fiscal year second quarter due primarily to stock option exercises, net of share repurchases.\nSegment Discussion\nThe Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI).\nPharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment\nPharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $39.5 billion, an increase of 10.4 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Segment operating income of $489.1 million in the March quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 0.9 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to growth in revenues and gross profit, including the acquisition of H. D. Smith, largely offset by reduced sales at PharMEDium and the operating loss at Profarma.\nOther\nRevenue in Other was $1.6 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 12.6 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and revenue growth from MWI, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and World Courier. Operating income in Other decreased 6.3 percent to $97.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by performance at ABCS, specifically the Lash Group, and was partially offset by increased contributions from World Courier and MWI.\nRecent Company Highlights & Milestones\nSuccessfully completed on-boarding all of the 1,932 retail pharmacies acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance through its phased acquisition of certain Rite Aid stores. Recorded our 17th consecutive quarter with 10 percent or greater revenue growth in Specialty distribution. World Courier opened four new offices in strategic markets worldwide to meet the growing demand for the specialty logistics services the company provides. The AmerisourceBergen Foundation announced the creation of its External Advisory Board and Opioid Grant Resource Program and the donation of 55,000 drug deactivation resources to communities nationwide to combat the opioid epidemic. ION Solutions hosted its Large Practice Program National Meeting in Washington, D.C. to bring together 500 of the nation’s leading community oncology professionals, including physicians, administrators, pharmacists, and industry leaders, to evaluate the challenges facing the community segment and create the best paths forward.\nFiscal Year 2018 Expectations\nThe Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. Please refer to the Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures following the tables for additional information.\nFiscal Year 2018 Expectations on an Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Basis\nBased upon the Company’s performance in the first half of the fiscal year, evaluation of current business expectations and lower than previously anticipated operating income contributions from PharMEDium and the Lash Group, AmerisourceBergen has updated its fiscal year 2018 financial guidance. The higher operating expense growth expectation reflects the Company's current assumption that the PharMEDium remediation costs should be excluded from cost of goods sold instead of operating expenses. The Company expects:\nRevenue growth in the range of 8 percent to 11 percent; and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.45 to $6.65.\nAdditional expectations now include:\nAdjusted operating expenses to increase between 8 percent to 10 percent; Adjusted operating income growth to be flat; Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income growth to be flat; Other, which is comprised of businesses focused on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, operating income decline in the range of down 2 percent to 4 percent; Adjusted effective tax rate of between 22 percent and 23 percent; Adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.35 billion to $1.6 billion; Capital expenditures of approximately $325 million; and Share repurchases will offset dilution from employee stock option exercises.\nAmerisourceBergen also continues to operate under the following working assumptions regarding the pharmaceutical market:\nBrand drug inflation to be in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent; Generic drug deflation to be in the range of -7 percent to -9 percent; Contributions from new generic launches similar to the prior year; and No significant contributions from biosimilars.\nConference Call & Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the results at 8:30 a.m. ET on May 2, 2018.

D. Smith and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto or to capture the anticipated synergies within the expected time period; the effects of disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of the Company and H. D.
