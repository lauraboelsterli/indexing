Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are our intent, belief and current expectations as to business operations and operating results, uncertainties regarding the governmental, economic and political circumstances in the People's Republic of China, uncertainties associated with the Company's reliance on third-party contractors, uncertainties relating to possible future increases in operating expenses, including costs of labor and materials, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
