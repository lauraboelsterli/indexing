    "text": "NESS ZIONA, Israel, May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nCollPlant (NASDAQ: CLGN) (TASE: CLGN), a regenerative medicine company utilizing its proprietary plant-based rhCollagen technology for tissue repair products (recombinant human, \"rhCollagen\"), today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on the Company's business developments. Certain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted basis, are non-GAAP measures. See \"Use of Non-IFRS (non-GAAP) Measures\" below.\nCollPlant reported revenues of $222,000 (NIS 779,000) for the first quarter of 2018. The Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with $3.9 million (NIS 13.8 million) in cash and cash equivalents, excluding an additional $1.0 million (NIS 3.5 million) that the Company received from Alpha Capital Anstalt (\"Alpha\") at the end of April 2018, while comprehensive loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.1 million (NIS 7.2 million) on a GAAP basis, or adjusted comprehensive loss of $1.2 million (NIS 4.2 million), on a non-GAAP basis.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we made progress advancing our 3D bioprinting business. We continue to move forward with our development activities with various biotechnology and medical device companies that are using CollPlant's rhCollagen based BioInk for the bioprinting of organs and tissues,\" said Yehiel Tal, CollPlant's Chief Executive Officer.\n\"CollPlant is also working with foundations and academic institutions, and during the first quarter of 2018, we announced that CollPlant is part of the Regenerative Medicine Development Organization's (ReMDO) advanced biomanufacturing initiative for the development of a universal BioInk with tunable properties for 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs,\" noted Mr. Tal.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we continued with the development of next generation dermal fillers for the aesthetic field. This month, we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for photocurable dermal fillers comprised of rhCollagen and hyaluronic acid, and are actively pursuing collaborations with key companies in this field,\" added Mr. Tal.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018, we established a new rhCollagen production facility in Rehovot, Israel. This cGMP facility will be used for purification of rhCollagen and the formulation of end-products, including BioInks for 3D bioprinting. The facility includes clean rooms and dedicated production equipment to support the company's commercial and R&D demand for the next few years. Furthermore, we expect the new facility to enable operational flexibility, cost reduction and process development. Consequently, we believe our competitiveness and profitability will be enhanced,\" noted Mr. Tal.\n\"Additionally, during 2018 we continued to establish our position in the European market, with sales of our advanced wound care product (VergenixFG), and orthopedic product (VergenixSTR). Over time, we have received positive feedback from physicians who have treated patients with both products, and we are aiming to expand sales into new territories across Europe,\" concluded Mr. Tal.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results on IFRS basis (\"GAAP\")\nRevenues for the first three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 309% to $222,000 (NIS 779,000), compared to $72,000 (NIS 252,000) in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues were derived from sales in the U.S. of CollPlant's BioInk for development of 3D bioprinting of organs, as well as sales in Europe of CollPlant's soft tissue repair matrix, VergenixSTR, for treating tendinopathy and its wound care product, VergenixFG.\nThe Company's gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 275% to $198,000 (NIS 693,000) compared to $72,000 (NIS 252,000) in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal operating costs and expenses were $2.3 million (NIS 7.9 million) compared to $1.5 million (NIS 5.4 million) in the first quarter of 2017. The increase is mainly due to non-cash expenses of the fair market value attributed to services received through the securities purchase agreement with Alpha (the \"Alpha Agreement\"), which amounted to $435,000 (NIS 1.5 million) and an increase in non-cash share based compensation amounting to $154,000 (NIS 540,000).\nOperating loss was $2.1 million (NIS 7.2 million) compared to an operating loss of $1.5 million (NIS 5.1 million) in the first quarter of 2017. Comprehensive loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.1 million (NIS 7.2 million), or $0.01 (NIS 0.04) per share, compared to a comprehensive loss of $1.5 million (NIS 5.2 million), or $0.01 (NIS 0.04) per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nCash used in operating activities during the first quarter was $1.4 million (NIS 4.9 million) compared to $1.7 million (NIS 6.0 million) in the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.9 million (NIS 13.8 million). In addition, in April 2018, the Company received $1.0 million (NIS 3.5 million) from Alpha, as part of the third closing of the Alpha Agreement.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results on Non-IFRS Basis (\"non-GAAP\")\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the operating costs and expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $1.5 million (NIS 5.3 million), compared to $1.4 (NIS 4.8 million) for the first quarter of 2017, while the comprehensive loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.2 million (NIS 4.2 million), or $0.01 (NIS 0.03) per share, compared to $1.3 million (NIS 4.6 million), or $0.01 (NIS 0.04) per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-cash expenses. The table on page 8 includes a reconciliation of the Company's GAAP results to non-GAAP results. The reconciliation reflects non-cash expenses in the amount of $853,000 (NIS 3.0 million) with respect to fair market value attributed to services received through the Alpha Agreement, recognition of unrecognized day one loss and share-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants in the first quarter of 2018.\nUse of Non-IFRS (\"non-GAAP\") Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures for operating costs and expenses, operating loss, comprehensive loss and basic and diluted comprehensive loss per share that exclude the effects of non-cash expense for fair market value attributed to services received through the Alpha Agreement, recognition of unrecognized day one loss, and share-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's operating costs, comprehensive loss and loss per share, and to compare them to historical Company results.\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table on page 8 in this press release. This accompanying table on page 8 has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nFor the convenience of the reader, the amounts have been translated from NIS into U.S. dollars, at the representative rate of exchange as of March 31, 2018 (U.S. $1.00 = NIS 3.514).\nThe Company's consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nAbout CollPlant\nCollPlant is a regenerative medicine company focused on 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, and on developing and commercializing tissue repair products for orthobiologics, and advanced wound care markets.
