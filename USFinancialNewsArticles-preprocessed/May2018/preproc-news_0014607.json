    "text": "TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices barely budged on Monday ahead of a 10-year bond auction the following day, though expectations of continued buying by the Bank of Japan underpinned the market.\nThe BOJ kept the size of its buying in short and super-long JGBs unchanged on Monday from previous operations.\nThe 10-year JGB futures rose 0.03 point to 150.86, with a meagre trading volume of 14,747 lots, one of the lowest levels so far this year.\nThe benchmark cash 10-year JGBs were flat at 0.040 percent in the afternoon after seeing no trades in the morning.\nThe Ministry of Finance will offer 2.2 trillion yen of 10-year JGBs through an auction on Tuesday.\nThe 20-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.520 percent while the 30-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.730 percent.
