    "text": "May 22 (Reuters) - Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said late on Monday that the braking issue on Tesla Inc’s Model 3 sedan, pointed out by Consumer Reports, can be fixed with a firmware update which the electric car maker will be rolling out in a few days.\n\"With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won't stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car,\" Musk wrote in a tweet here .co%2F2018%2F05%2F22%2Ftesla-will-update-model-3-firmware-to-fix-braking-calibration-in-coming-days%2F&tfw_creator=electrekco&tfw_site=electrek.\nInfluential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports on Monday said it will not recommend the affordable Model 3, seen as key to Tesla’s profitability, as it braked slower than a full-sized pickup truck.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
