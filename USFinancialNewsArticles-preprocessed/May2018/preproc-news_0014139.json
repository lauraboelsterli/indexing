    "text": "Bangkok, Thailand, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A4M/MMI has recently announced the addition of internationally recognized expert in Integrative Medicine and Director of Integrative Medicine at George Washington University Andrew Heyman, MD, MHSA to its agenda for the 10th Annual A4M-Thailand Congress in Bangkok. As hundreds of participants gather at The Athenee Hotel for the three-day conference taking place from September 6-8, an extensive agenda of clinical educational sessions and interactive lectures will collectively deliver the most recent research in Anti-Aging & Aesthetic Medicine.\n“Traditional Chinese Medicine taught me how to listen very closely to patients, and to look for patterns of illness expression that sometimes escapes a standard evaluation. My research now seeks to bridge the gap between what we observe in patients and their underlying metabolic and genomic expression, especially in complex presentations,” said Dr. Heyman. As a proliferation of scientific information continues to emerge regarding the underlying causes of chronic diseases, coupled with ways to optimize longevity and the aging process, A4M/MMI is proud to continue its tradition of providing the latest, most current updates and clinical education through renowned keynote presenters and cutting-edge thought leaders.\nThe 10th Annual Congress on Anti-Aging and Aesthetic Medicine will begin with a pre-conference workshop on September 6th, followed by general session lectures on September 7th and 8th. Lectures from Dr. Heyman in the Anti-Aging lecture track will focus on topics including stress & neuroinflammation, biotoxins and chronic inflammatory response syndrome, and detoxification of heavy metals and chemicals.\nOther topics highlighted at the conference will include the applications of intermittent fasting for weight loss, in addition to exercise management for weight loss. Speakers will further focus on gut inflammation, coupled with the efficacy and benefits of an anti-inflammatory diet, while a track specifically dedicated to Aesthetic Medicine will concentrate on body & facial contouring with fillers—with discussions surrounding pre and post-operative care for successful patient outcomes.\nThis conference offers an exciting and unique opportunity for attendees to be at the forefront of wellness and longevity, and serves as an optimal platform for delegates to establish new business and networking contacts, receive extensive education specifically engineered to enhance practices and patient care, and socialize with international medical professionals from a wide array of disciplines and fields.\n###\nAbout the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine & Metabolic Medical Institute:\nEstablished in 1992, A4M is the leading nonprofit medical society dedicated to the detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases associated with aging. The organization is comprised of over 26,000 members from 120 nations across the globe, and is dedicated to educating medical and public health professionals and practitioners on the most progressive and innovative clinical research, in addition to cutting-edge scientific technologies.
