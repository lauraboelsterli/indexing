    "text": "(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday and raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the year, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of cancer drug Keytruda.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Merck is pictured in this illustration photograph in Cardiff, California, U.S., April 26, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Keytruda, which replaced diabetes treatment Januvia as Merckâ€™s biggest drug by revenue last year, raked in sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of the estimated $1.40 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company raised its adjusted per-share earnings forecast for the year to between $4.16 and $4.28 from between $4.08 and $4.23 estimated previously.\nNet income fell to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, from $1.55 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.05 per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion.\nAnalysts on average were expecting earnings of $1 per share on revenue of $10.11 billion.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
