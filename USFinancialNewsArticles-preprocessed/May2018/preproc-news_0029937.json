    "text": "BALLERUP, Denmark, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LiqTech International, Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN: LIQT) (\"LiqTech\"), a clean technology company that manufactures and markets highly specialized filtration technologies, announced today its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nNet sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2.4 million compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2017, representing a decrease of $0.6 million or 20%.\nThe decrease in sales consisted of a decrease in sales of liquid filters and systems of $0.2 million and a decrease in sales of DPFs of $0.4 million.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $(0.1) million compared to a gross profit of $0.3 million for the same period in 2017, representing a decrease of $0.4 million.\nIncluded in gross profit is depreciation of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1.3 million, representing an increase of $0.06 million, or 4.7%, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2017.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $0.8 million for the comparable period in 2017, representing an increased loss of $0.7 million.\nCash on hand and restricted cash for the period ended March 31, 2018 was $0.8 million compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $1.7 million.\nWorking capital for the period ended March 31, 2018 was $3.5 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $1.2 million.\nManagement Commentary\nIn discussing the financial results in the first quarter of 2018, Mr. Sune Mathiesen, LiqTech CEO, remarked:\n\"Our results for the first quarter were below our expectations, which was largely attributable to delayed deliveries of our marine scrubber water treatment systems.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we have experienced a significant ramp-up in inquiries for our marine scrubber water treatment systems. We are encouraged by this development, and we believe that our long-term commitment has positioned us well to be one of the market leaders for water treatment systems to this industry. Importantly, also in the first quarter of 2018, we have entered into significant contracts that should facilitate large orders in future periods:\nOn March 21, 2018, we announced that the Company had signed a framework agreement with one of the world's largest manufactures of marine scrubbers. The framework agreement has an initial term for 2018 and 2019, and it provides that more than 95 systems are estimated to be delivered during the initial term. On April 11, 2018, we announced that the Company had signed another framework agreement with a large marine scrubber manufacturer. The framework agreement has an initial term for 2018 and 2019, and it provides that a minimum of 35 systems are estimated to be delivered during the initial term. On April 11, 2018, we announced that the Company had signed a Letter of Intent with one of the world's largest marine scrubber manufactures. The Letter of Intent provides that the parties intend to enter into a definitive partnership agreement no later than July 1, 2018.\nAlthough still in early stages, we have noted that more ship owners are considering, or have already taken the decision, to install scrubbers. We believe that we will see first orders from a number of ship owners in the second quarter, and that the early adopters are now ready to place multiple system orders. We are pleased with the progress we made so far, and we believe that we will continue to make sustained progress as we reinforce our position in this industry.\nAdditionally, we have been successful in establishing technology in the power plant industry in Denmark. On March 27, 2018, the Company announced that we had won a EU tender to supply a turn-key water treatment system to a large power plant in Finland. This was our first large international order for this industry, and in 2018, we will continue our efforts to establish our technology in several international markets.\nWe are pleased to note our progress in the marine scrubber and power plant industries. The positive development has, however, raised the need for further working capital, and on April 12, 2018, we successfully completed a public offering of new shares. The net proceeds of over $6 million has strengthened our balance sheet and will enable us to service the abovementioned agreements.\nWe believe that our narrowed focus and the development of standardized systems have proven to be the right strategy. We are continuing our efforts to turn the Company profitable, and we believe that 2018 will prove to be a turning point in our business .\"\nConference Call Details\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing (877) 407-8029 or (201) 689-8029.
