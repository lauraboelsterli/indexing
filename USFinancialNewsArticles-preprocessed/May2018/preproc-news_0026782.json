It didn't disappoint. The 2018 Mazda 3 offers a fun driving experience with a refined ride for a price that demands consideration. You can always nitpick, but Mazda's built a small car with no glaring or deal-breaking faults. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nI spent the last week driving the Mazda 3 and, getting straight to the point, it's superb.\nThat shouldn't' be a surprise.\nThe Mazda Miata is one of my favorite cars to date and I called the Mazda 6 one of the \"most impressive and fantastic cars on sale today.\"\nMazda's been doing a stellar job, and it continues to show with the Mazda 3. The Good Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nThe Mazda 3 was created by the same design team as the rest of Mazda's modern family of cars. It looks gorgeous for the segment. Despite working with a short, front-wheel drive platform — terrible for proportions — the wizards at Mazda HQ managed to create an athletic and svelte hatchback shape.\nThe Mazda 3 is offered in two forms, including a hatchback model and a sedan. We tested the $26,970 Grand Touring hatchback, and you can expect to pay $750 less for the sedan. The hatchback's styling and improved practicality are worth the added cost. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nThat price gets you a lot. Our tester had essentially every option boxed ticked except the automatic transmission, offering a slick six-speed row-your-own gearbox instead. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nHeated leather seats, a heated steering wheel, a heads-up display, radar cruise control and blind-spot monitoring were all included. It also had premium materials throughout and looked more expensive than its price tag would suggest.\nThe Mazda 3 is more fun than any standard-kit Ford Focus, VW Golf or Honda Civic. Still, Mazda still refuses to offer a performance trim — think Volkswagen GTI or Civic Si — so it can't quite claim the crown for the segment. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nIt's a great commuter car, too. Despite its fantastic handling and naturally-aspirated engine that makes all of its power in the top of the rev range, the 3 is still happy to settle in for highway cruises. It's composed over rough pavement and relatively quiet. It doesn't blow its competitors away in terms of refinement, but it strikes a near-perfect balance between backroad fun and interstate cruising. The Bad Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nThe flaws with the Mazda 3 are minute and mostly unimportant. I don't like the dull gauge cluster or the lack of one-touch up windows, but I don't have any major complaints.\nI wish Mazda made an even fancier version with the rosewood trim from the CX-9 Signature and more equipment like cooled seats and lane-keeping that centers the car. I wish there was a faster model, too. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nBut these aren't actual problems. I like the Mazda 3 so much that I wish there were additional models for every possible use. How to configure yours Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nStart with a 5-door Mazda 3 Grand Touring with the manual transmission. You can get the automatic if you want but it betrays the \"driving-first\" mantra of the car. Mazda's lovely Soul Red and Machine Gray paints are both $300 options you should consider. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nThe Grand Touring trim requires a $1,600 premium package, but you can skip the pricey appearance package. That brings the total to $26,685, just shy of our tester which had extra floor mats and a bumper guard. Final Thoughts Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2018 Mazda 3 Grand Touring\nThe Mazda 3 is brilliant and I recommend it to almost anyone who needs a small car. It's practical and gets great fuel mileage. It's well-equipped, well-priced, gorgeous and lovely to drive.\nRating:",
