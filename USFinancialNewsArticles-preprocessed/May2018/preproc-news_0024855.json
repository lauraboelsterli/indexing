    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 2:25 PM / Updated 44 minutes ago Italy police bust suspected terrorism financing ring Domenico Lusi 3 Min Read\nROME (Reuters) - Italian anti-terrorism police on Thursday dismantled a suspected international network that smuggled migrants across Europe and then funnelled some of the proceeds to Islamist militants in Syria.\nA judge in northern Italy issued 14 arrest warrants for charges including money laundering, association with terrorist groups, and conspiracy to finance terrorism. One of the men sought for arrest remains at large, police said.\nEleven of the men were born in Syria and were living in Italy, Sweden, and Hungary, the arrest warrant says. Three of the men were Moroccan.\nPolice tracked the laundering of about two million euros (1.77 million pounds), some of which had been sent to the former Nusra Front, which cut ties with al Qaeda and rebranded in 2016, and now spearheads an alliance of Islamist groups.\n“The money came in large part from people smuggling,” Italy’s top anti-terror judge, Federico Cafiero de Raho, told reporters. For a fee, the group spirited migrants through the Balkans to Italy and on to other European countries, he said.\nMore than 600,000 migrants reached Italian shores over four years, and many have since moved on to other destinations.\nGroups close to the former Nusra Front and Islamic State used the cash “to buy weapons, pick-up trucks” and other battle supplies, said Claudio Galzerano, a senior anti-terrorism police official.\n“All of the men under investigation are legal immigrants,” Galzerano added.\nThere was no evidence that the group was seeking to prepare any attacks in Italy or Europe, Cafiero de Raho said.\nThe man considered the head of the organisation was a Syrian, Anwar Daadoue, who is a resident on the Italian island of Sardinia, where he owns several construction companies. Daadoue often worked in Sweden, where he is already in state custody, the arrest warrant said.\nSwedish authorities collaborated with Italians during the investigation. An Italian undercover agent was also involved in the probe.\nDuring early morning operations, police also searched 20 homes in three northern Italian regions and on Sardinia.\n($1 = 0.8389 euros)",
