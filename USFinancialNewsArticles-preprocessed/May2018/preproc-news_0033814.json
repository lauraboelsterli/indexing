(NYSE:JCAP), a leading capital partner for self-storage entrepreneurs nationwide, today announced that Jonathan Perry will join the Company on or about June 10, 2018 as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.\n“The addition of Jonathan rounds out what we believe to be an outstanding management team,” said Dean Jernigan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JCAP. “I have had the pleasure of working with Jonathan for over 20 years and have found him to be one of the most talented executives in the self-storage sector. As we continue to provide innovative capital solutions to self-storage entrepreneurs while we move into different stages of the real estate cycle, I am confident that Jonathan’s experience, relationships and prominence in the self-storage industry will create additional opportunities for JCAP to create value for our shareholders.”\nJohn Good, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, added: “I am delighted to welcome Jonathan as our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Dean, our board of directors and I all believe that as the real estate cycle progresses and we move into a period of more customized and innovative investment opportunities, including a period of increased acquisitions of developer interests in our properties and other potential growth initiatives, Jonathan is the perfect addition to our already strong team. Jonathan has led billions of dollars of self-storage investments over the course of his 20-year career, and that investment experience will be invaluable to us as he leads our investment efforts. Jonathan’s ten years of distinguished service with CubeSmart also provides a seamless bridge to his overseeing our asset management function, as we would expect to continue to expand our extensive third-party management relationship with CubeSmart as we continue to grow. I look forward to partnering with Jonathan for many years of continuing to build JCAP into one of the great companies in our industry.\nAs Chief Investment Officer of JCAP, Mr. Perry will be responsible for overseeing all investment and asset management activities of the Company, including development of new relationships with self-storage entrepreneurs, origination of new investment opportunities, consummation of new investments and managing relationships with the Company’s third-party managers. Mr. Perry will report to Mr. Good and will join Messrs. Jernigan and Good as the third member of the Company’s investment committee.\nMr. Perry joins Jernigan Capital from CubeSmart, where he has held several positions since 2008, most recently as Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Mr. Perry began his career at Storage USA in February 1998, serving in a variety of roles until the company’s sale in 2002 to GE Capital. After a period with GE Capital following the Storage USA acquisition, Mr. Perry partnered with Mr. Jernigan in a private investment partnership that owned and operated self-storage facilities.\nAbout Jernigan Capital, Inc.\nJernigan Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange-listed real estate investment trust (NYSE: JCAP) that provides debt and equity capital to private developers, owners, and operators of self-storage facilities.
