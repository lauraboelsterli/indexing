    "text": "Strong financial and operating performance exceeding revenue and profitability guidance Completed debt refinancing extending maturity and increasing liquidity and flexibility\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Web.com Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WEB), the marketing partner for businesses wanting to connect with more customers and grow, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"Web.com delivered solid first quarter financial results with both revenue and profitability that exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges.

We are confident that successfully executing on these initiatives will enable us to deliver greater value for both customers and shareholders,\" said David L. Brown, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Web.com.\nBrown added, \"In addition, our recent debt refinancing strengthens our capital structure and enables us to optimize our capital deployment strategy with an expanded and flexible credit facility. Overall, we are off to a solid start to the year, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver against our long term goals.\"\nSummary of First Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nTotal revenue, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $186.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $185.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP revenue was $187.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $186.8 million in the comparable prior year period. Results exceeded the high end of both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance of $183.0 to $186.0 million and $184.0 to $187.0 million, respectively.\nGAAP operating income was $15.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 8% GAAP operating margin, compared to $20.5 million, representing a 11% GAAP operating margin, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating income was $37.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 20% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to $41.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, representing a 22% non-GAAP operating margin.\nGAAP net income was $4.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, representing a 2% GAAP net income margin. GAAP net income was $6.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, representing a 4% GAAP net income margin.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $42.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23%, surpassing the high end of the Company's adjusted EBITDA guidance of $40.5 to $42.5 million.

Web.com believes presenting non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because it describes the operating performance of the Company, in ways that management views or uses to assess the performance of the Company. Web.com's management uses these non-GAAP measures as important indicators of the Company's past performance and in planning and forecasting performance in future periods. The non-GAAP financial information Web.com presents may not be comparable to similarly-titled financial measures used by other companies, and investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.\nYou are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures included elsewhere in this press release.\nRelative to each of the non-GAAP measures Web.com presents, management further sets forth its rationale as follows:\nNon-GAAP Revenue . Web.com excludes from non-GAAP revenue the impact of the fair value adjustment to amortized deferred revenue because management believes that excluding such measures helps management and investors better understand the Company's revenue trends.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin . Web.com excludes from non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, amortization of intangibles, asset impairment, stock-based compensation charges, restructuring expenses, corporate development expenses and fair value adjustment to deferred revenue and deferred expense because management believes that adjusting for such measures helps management and investors better understand the Company's operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin . Web.com excludes from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin depreciation and amortization expense, loss on sale of assets, asset impairment, income tax provision, interest expense, interest income, stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and deferred expense, corporate development expenses and restructuring expenses, because management believes that excluding such items helps investors better understand the Company's operating activities.\nNon-GAAP Cost of Revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization). Web.com excludes from non-GAAP cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) the fair value adjustment to deferred expense and stock based compensation charges because management believes that adjusting for such measures helps management and investors better understand the company's operating activities.\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that Web.com uses and defines as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for investment opportunities.\nIn respect of the foregoing, Web.com provides the following supplemental information to provide additional context for the use and consideration of the non-GAAP financial measures used elsewhere in this press release:\nStock-based compensation . These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options and employee awards under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 718-10. While stock-based compensation expense calculated in accordance with ASC 718-10 constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by management to assess the core profitability of the Company's business operations. Web.com further believes these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in the Company's financial statements. In addition, when management performs internal comparisons to Web.com's historical operating results and compares the Company's operating results to the Company's competitors, management excludes this item from various non-GAAP measures.\nAmortization of intangibles . Web.com incurs amortization of acquired intangibles under ASC 805-10-65. Acquired intangibles primarily consist of customer relationships, customer lists, non-compete agreements, trade names, and developed technology. Web.com expects to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the acquired intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue, the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. In addition, when management performs internal comparisons to Web.com's historical operating results and compares the Company's operating results to the Company's competitors, management excludes this item from various non-GAAP measures.\nDepreciation expense . Web.com records depreciation expense associated with its fixed assets. Although its fixed assets generate revenue for Web.com, the item is excluded because management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. In addition, when management performs internal comparisons to Web.com's historical operating results and compares the Company's operating results to the Company's competitors, management excludes this item from various non-GAAP measures.\nRestructuring expense . Web.com has recorded restructuring expenses and excludes the impact of these expenses from its non-GAAP measures, because such expense is not used by management to assess the core profitability of the Company's business operations.\nFair value adjustment to deferred revenue and deferred expense . Web.com has recorded a fair value adjustment to acquired deferred revenue and deferred expense in accordance with ASC 805-10-65. Web.com excludes the impact of these adjustments from its non-GAAP measures, because doing so results in non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP net income which are reflective of ongoing operating results and more comparable to historical operating results, since the majority of the Company's revenue is recurring subscription revenue. Excluding the fair value adjustment to deferred revenue and deferred expense therefore facilitates management's internal comparisons to Web.com's historical operating results.\nCorporate development expenses . Web.com incurred expenses relating to acquisitions and the successful integration of acquisitions. Web.com excludes the impact of these expenses from its non-GAAP measures, because such expense is not used by management to assess the core profitability of the Company's business operations.\nGains or losses from asset sales or impairment and certain other transactions. Web.com excludes the impact of asset sales or impairment and certain other transactions including debt extinguishments and the sale of equity method investment from its non-GAAP measures because the impact of these items is not considered part of the company's ongoing operations.\nMonthly average revenue per user, or ARPU . ARPU is a metric the Company measures on a quarterly basis. The Company defines ARPU as quarterly non-GAAP subscription revenue divided by the average of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the quarter and the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter, divided by three months. The Company excludes from subscription revenue the impact of the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue resulting from acquisition-related write downs.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" including, without limitation, the statements regarding whether Web.com making progress on its plan to drive additional improvements to its key initiatives will enable it to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders, and the refinancing of its debt will enable Web.com to optimize its capital deployment strategy.

The actual amount of net income and such responding reconciling items will have a significant effect on Adjusted EBITDA.
