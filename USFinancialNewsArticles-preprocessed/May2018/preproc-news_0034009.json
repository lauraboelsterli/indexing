GAAP EPS declined 28% and Adjusted EPS increased 14%. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 2.1%, and comp traffic increased 0.8%. Sam’s Club comp sales increased 3.8% led by comp traffic growth of 5.6%. Tobacco sales negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 140 basis points. Net sales at Walmart International were $30.3 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Excluding currency, net sales were $28.3 billion, an increase of 4.5%. Eight of eleven markets posted positive comp sales, including our four largest markets. The company generated $5.2 billion in operating cash flow. Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of two items. The first item is an unrealized loss of $0.47 on the company’s equity investment in JD.com due to a change in accounting principles. The second item benefited EPS by $0.05 due to an adjustment in the provisional amount recorded in Q4 fiscal 2018 related to Tax Reform.\nBENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Walmart Inc.
