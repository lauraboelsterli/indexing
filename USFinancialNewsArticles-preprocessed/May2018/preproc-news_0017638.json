    "text": "Multimillion-dollar iPass SmartConnect ™ software license, a milestone in iPass’ transformation to a software and technology company\nREDWOOD SHORES, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iPass Inc. (NASDAQ GS:IPAS), a leading provider of global mobile connectivity, reported total revenue of $11.4 million, GAAP net loss of $4.0 million, and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\n\"As you know, since joining iPass, we’ve been on a mission to transform our business to software and technology,\" said Gary Griffiths, iPass president and CEO. \"Today, we’re announcing a multimillion-dollar license for iPass SmartConnect software, which marks a milestone on this journey, while providing cash and bolstering the balance sheet. Last quarter we emphasized the importance of achieving positive cash flow, and we remain committed to that goal. To that end, we've made significant progress lowering our Network Access Costs (\"NAC\"), which we expect to be about $10 million lower this year than in 2017. In addition, while operating expenses have already been reduced dramatically from pre-2016 levels, we have continued to lower expenses and have lowered our quarterly break-even revenue point to less than $15 million. So with cost and expense significantly better than last year, and deals like the one announced today in the pipeline, all focus is on getting back to revenue growth. And we believe we have access to sufficient cash to meet these goals.\"\nQuarterly Metrics\nRevenue of $11.4 million in Q1'18 as closing Veri-Fi ™ business was slower than expected on global General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") concerns ahead of the May 25, 2018 enactment in the European Union.\nNet Annual Contract Value (\"ACV\") , defined as the annualized sales value under committed contract for newly acquired or significant upsell customers signed, in Q1’18 totaled $1.6 million compared to $1.2 million in Q4'17 and $0.9 million in Q3’17.\nCustomer Churn , defined as the annualized impact on revenue, based on the prior quarter run-rate, of any customer that terminates or has write-down of committed contract value, was $1.5 million in Q1’18 compared to $1.0 million in Q4’17 and $1.1 million in Q3’17.\nNetwork Access Cost (\"NAC\") was $6.8 million in Q1'18, down from $9.1 million in Q4'17 and $10.3 million in Q3'17, with no adverse impact on the usage capacity under contract.\nCapital Raise was $0.5 million in the quarter from the common stock purchase agreement signed in November 2017, leaving capacity of $8.3 million available. In April 2018, we raised an additional $0.8 million under this facility, bringing the total raised to $2.5 million since inception in November 2017.\nNasdaq Delisting Extension Granted on May 7, 2018, to regain compliance with the previously received Nasdaq delisting notice. We will transfer from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market and continue to remediate our bid price and market capitalization deficiencies in accordance with the plan we presented to Nasdaq in April 2018.\n“We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet, including cash-rich, non-dilutive deals like the one we announced today,\" continued Griffiths. “Our investment in iPass SmartConnect has opened up large markets in the enterprise space, allowing management insight, understanding, and control of their mobile workforce, while providing to mobile operators, and those that depend on them, intelligent management of global connectivity with access to low-cost, secure, and reliable networks to relieve constrained cellular capacity. And given the emerging reality of the expected costs of 5G deployments, the value of iPass SmartConnect will be even more apparent.\"\nSelected Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 (unaudited; in millions) Revenue Mobile Connectivity Services 11.4 13.2 14.3 Enterprise 9.2 10.4 11.7 Unlimited Customers 2.6 3.0 2.2 Other Pricing Plan Customers 6.6 7.4 9.5 Strategic Partnerships 2.2 2.8 2.6 Network Access Costs 6.8 9.1 9.6 Gross Margin (1) 28.0 % 20.9 % 21.2 % Network Operations Expense 1.4 1.4 1.7 R&D, S&M, and G&A expense 7.0 7.3 7.2 Total Operating Expenses 8.4 8.7 8.9 Other income (expense) and provision for income taxes 0.2 0.3 (0.1 ) GAAP Total Net Loss (4.0 ) (4.3 ) (4.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA Loss (2) (3.4 ) (3.8 ) (3.4 ) As of March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Shares of Common Stock Outstanding at Period End 70.4 69.3 66.4 Cash and Cash Equivalents 2.8 5.2 13.5 Deferred Revenue (Short-term plus Long-term) 3.1 3.8 3.2 Gross Margin is defined as Total Revenue less Network Access Costs less Network Operations Expense divided by Total Revenue.

Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Detailed information about these and other risk factors that could potentially affect iPass’ business, financial condition and results of operations are included in iPass’ Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2018, and available at its Web site at www.sec.gov and iPass' website at http://investor.ipass.com . iPass undertakes no responsibility to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be an inaccurate prediction of the actual results.\nIn addition, investors and others should note that iPass announces material financial information to its investors using its investor relations website, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. iPass also uses social media to communicate with its customers and the public about iPass, its products and services and other matters relating to its business and market. It is possible that the information iPass posts on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, iPass encourages investors, the media, and others interested in iPass to review the information it posts on U.S. social media channels including the iPass Twitter Feed, the iPass LinkedIn Feed, the iPass Google+ Feed, the iPass Facebook Page, the iPass Blog, and the iPass Instagram account. These social media channels may be updated from time to time.\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures\nThis press release also contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). iPass considers Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of the iPass' performance that is not required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP.\niPass defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, out of period adjustment, and nonrecurring legal costs. iPass believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful comparison between its core operating results, on a consistent basis, over different periods of time. Accordingly, management uses this financial measure for evaluating and making operating decisions and for purposes of comparison with its strategic plan, operating budgets and allocation of resources.\nFurthermore, iPass believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors:\nTo provide an additional analytical tool for understanding the company’s financial performance by excluding the impact of items which may obscure trends in the core operating performance of the business; To provide consistency and enhance investors’ ability to compare the company’s performance across financial reporting periods; and To facilitate comparisons to the operating results of other companies in the company’s industry, which may use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to net income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than iPass does, which would limit its usefulness in comparing iPass’ financial results with those of such other companies.\niPass defines a key operating metric, ACV, as the annualized sales value committed under contract for newly acquired customers or significant upsell, in total across the Enterprise and Strategic Partnership go-to-market strategies, in the period. Because ACV is not an alternative measure for GAAP revenue, but only an operational metric to provide insight on the health and progress of the sales pipeline and revised go-to-market strategy, the signing of committed contract value should not be assumed to have met the entire revenue recognition criteria. For example, while persuasive evidence of an arrangement always exist before reporting ACV, service may not yet have been provided to the customer or collections may not yet be determined to be reasonably assured. The company makes reasonable efforts to substantiate the viability of all reported ACV, but future events could change that conclusion. As an example, when a previously reported ACV customer fails to perform under the committed contract, such remaining calculated ACV will be reversed in the current period reported ACV.\nAbout iPass Inc.\niPass (NASDAQ:IPAS) is a leading provider of global mobile connectivity, offering simple, secure, always-on Wi-Fi access on any mobile device.
