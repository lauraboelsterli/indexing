    "text": "GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (NASDAQ:GLRE) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Greenlight Re reported a net loss of $142.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $8.4 million for the same period in 2017. The net loss per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.85, compared to fully diluted net income per share of $0.22 for the same period in 2017.\nFully diluted adjusted book value per share was $18.35 as of March 31, 2018, a 22.1% decrease from $23.57 per share as of March 31, 2017, and a 17.4% decrease from the prior quarter.\nManagement Commentary\nSimon Burton, Chief Executive Officer of Greenlight Re, stated, “The investment loss this quarter overshadowed our improved underwriting performance and a quarter combined ratio of 98.3%. Our reserve position showed favorable prior year reserve development and the ongoing business is performing well under difficult market conditions. We launched Greenlight Re Innovations, where we will partner with technology and risk enterprises to deliver on our mission of supporting commerce and personal health and welfare. This initiative is central to the transformation of Greenlight Re into a risk innovation leader in an increasingly technology-enabled world.”\nDavid Einhorn, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, “I am pleased to see that the steps management has taken in our underwriting business are beginning to materialize in a positive manner. We experienced a difficult quarter in our investment portfolio, reporting a loss of 11.8%. Notwithstanding the quarterly loss, we remain confident that our disciplined, value-oriented style and patience will be rewarded.”\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\n2018 First Quarter\nGross written premiums of $175.1 million, a decrease from $197.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net written premiums were $145.3 million compared to $193.8 million in the prior year period. Gross premium ceded increased during the first quarter as the Company ceded off a portion of its non-standard automobile business.\nNet earned premiums were $145.8 million, a decrease from $151.9 million reported in the prior-year period.\nNet investment loss of $145.2 million, compared to net investment income of $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nUnderwriting income of $2.5 million, compared to an underwriting loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company reported favorable prior year development of approximately $2.7 million, primarily due to a favorable change in estimated catastrophe losses.\nA composite ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 96.0%, compared to 97.4% for the prior-year period. The combined ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 98.3%, compared to 100.1% for the prior-year period.\nConference Call Details\nGreenlight Re will hold a live conference call to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Book value is adjusted by subtracting the amount of the non-controlling interest in joint venture from total shareholders’ equity to calculate adjusted book value. We believe that long term growth in fully diluted adjusted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick by which to monitor the shareholder value generated. In addition, fully diluted adjusted book value per share may be of benefit to our investors, shareholders and other interested parties to form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used in the calculation of net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. The measure includes underwriting expenses which are directly related to underwriting activities as well as an allocation of other general and administrative expenses. Net underwriting income (loss) is calculated as net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, less, acquisition costs and less underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) net investment income; (2) any foreign exchange gains or losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, and (5) income taxes and income attributable to non-controlling interest. We exclude net investment income and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate general and administrative expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. We include other income and expense relating to deposit accounted contracts and industry loss warranty contracts which we believe are part of our underwriting operations and should be reflected in our underwriting income (loss). Net underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
