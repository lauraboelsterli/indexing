Shareholders heard about how KeyBank is helping clients and communities thrive and how the company is growing and continuing to deliver on its commitment to create shareholder value.\n\"Key had a strong year in 2017. We delivered on our commitments with a step change in performance including improved profitability and returns. We are growing our business by adding and expanding client relationships while investing for the future. And, most important, we continued to help our clients and communities thrive,\" said Beth Mooney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp.\nDuring the annual meeting, shareholders elected 15 nominees to KeyCorp's Board of Directors, each with executive leadership experience within a variety of national and international organizations, across a number of industries. Board elections were one of four proposals put before shareholders at the company's annual meeting, held at One Cleveland Center in Cleveland, OH. As announced on May 9, 2018, the KeyCorp Board of Directors also increased the dividend 14% to $.12 per common share from $.105 per share.
