I feel like it was a very good match, the hardest here. She has improved a lot since last year, we played together here, and she was a different player.”\nHalep will next face Krystyna’s twin sister Karolina Pliskova, who raced past American Sloane Stephens 6-2 6-3.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
