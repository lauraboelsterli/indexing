Group Chief Executive of BP Bob Dudley poses for a photograph at the BP International Headquarters in central London, Britain, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\nDudley’s remuneration rose by 13 percent to $13.4 million last year as the oil and gas giant’s profit more than doubled and production soared.\nIn 2016 Dudley’s pay package was cut by 40 percent after a majority of shareholders opposed the company’s pay policy.
