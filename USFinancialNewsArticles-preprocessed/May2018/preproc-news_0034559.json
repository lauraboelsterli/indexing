    "text": "MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Italy’s Pirelli on Monday reported a 4.5 percent rise in first-quarter adjusted operating profit before charges and start-up costs, helped by strong demand for high-margin premium tyres.\nThe maker of tyres for Formula One racing teams and premium automakers such as BMW, Audi and Alfa Romeo , said adjusted earnings before interest (EBIT) rose to 229.4 million euros ($274.7 million), slightly above an analyst consensus of 224 million provided by the company.\nIt confirmed profitability targets for 2018.\nRevenue is seen growing at least 9 percent on an organic basis, compared with a previous forecast of around 10 percent rise. Including currency effects, sales are seen rising around 4 percent, down from a previous guidance of at least 6 percent.\nRevenue in the period rose 5.7 percent to 1.31 billion euros, in line with expectations.\n$1 = 0.8352 euros Reporting by Stefano Rebaudo\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
