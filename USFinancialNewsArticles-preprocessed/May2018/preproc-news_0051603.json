    "text": "BRASILIA, May 24 (Reuters) - Brazilâ€™s current account surplus shrank to a smaller-than-expected $620 million in April, down from $1.1 billion the year before, central bank data showed on Thursday.\nThis brought the deficit in the twelve months through April to 0.43 percent of gross domestic product. Brazil attracted $2.6 billion worth of foreign direct investments in the month.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expected a median $1.1 billion current account surplus and $3 billion worth of foreign direct investment.
