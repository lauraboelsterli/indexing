On February 15, 2018 the Company began trading its Common Shares on the OTCQX Market, operated by OTC Markets Group, under the symbol \"SNNVF\".\nOn February 15, 2018, the Company repaid the secured convertible promissory note (the “FSD note”) related to the acquisition of Full-Scale Distributors, LLC (“FSD”) in cash of $2.8 million (US$2.2 million), plus accrued interest, and the remaining portion through the issuance of Common Shares at the conversion price of US$2.55 per share.\nOn February 21, 2018 Sunniva Medical Inc. (“SMI”) and Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”) entered into a take or pay supply agreement. Under the terms of the initial two-year agreement, which includes the distribution of Sunniva branded products, Canopy Growth will purchase approximately 45% of SMI’s annual production capacity; representing 45,000 kgs of dried cannabis annually, commencing Q1 2019 or shortly thereafter. The Company and Canopy Growth will share in the revenues as product is sold through Canopy Growth's distribution network including its online marketplace, Tweed Main Street and via provincial distribution channels. The revenue share will be based on the strain, sales channel and other relevant factors. The agreement is subject to SMI receiving its license from Health Canada, which SMI has received its Confirmation of Readiness, and completing the Sunniva Canada Campus (defined below).\nOn March 27, 2018 the Company completed a bought deal public offering for aggregate gross proceeds of $27.8 million. A total of 2,850,900 units (\"Units\") and 50,000 Warrants (as defined below) were sold at a price of $9.75 per Unit and $0.02 per Warrant. Each Unit consisted of one Common Share in the capital of the Company and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a \"Warrant\") of the Company. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price per Common Share of $12.50 for a period of 24 months.\nResults of Operations – Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nDuring the period ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated $5.2 million in revenue from its two subsidiaries, Natural Health Service Ltd. (“NHS”) and FSD, which contributed $2.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Net loss for the period ended March 31, 2018 was $6.3 million as compared to $1.0 million during the period ended March 31, 2017.\nThe key components contributing to the change in net loss from the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 comprise the following:\nRevenue increased from $2.4 million to $5.2 million due to NHS and FSD being acquired mid-way through the comparative period ended March 31, 2017 and stronger Q1 2018 results from FSD.\nCosts of goods sold increased from $1.2 million to $3.1 million resulting from the increase in revenue.\nGross margin increased from $1.2 million to $2.1 million due to the increase in revenue. On a percentage-basis, gross margin decreased from 51% to 41% due to the higher proportion of FSD sales, which realize lower margins than NHS.\nSelling, general and administration expenses increased from $1.7 million to $5.6 million due to NHS and FSD operating for the full three-month period in 2018 and the Company’s overall growth.\nShare-based payment expense increased from $nil to $2.2 million with the introduction of the Company’s stock option plan mid-way through fiscal 2017.\nThe Company realized a non-cash gain of $1.0 million on settlement of the FSD note.\nFair value changes in derivative instruments due to the revaluation of secured convertible promissory notes and warrants increased from an expense of $0.1 million to $0.9 million due to the increase in the Company’s share price.\nAmortization and depreciation expense increased from $0.4 million to $0.7 million due to NHS and FSD operating for the full three-month period in 2018.\nRecent Operating Developments Subsequent to March 31, 2018\nFor a comprehensive overview of Sunniva’s recent developments, please refer to the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018. Highlights include the following:\nSunniva’s US subsidiaries received all the necessary State of California temporary licenses for Phase one and two of construction at its purpose built state-of-the-art greenhouse cultivation facilities in Cathedral City, California (the “Sunniva California Campus”).\nThe Company selected the location to build its Sunniva Canada Campus in Okanagan Falls, British Columbia (the “Sunniva Canada Campus”). The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, SMI, has entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire the entire 126-acre industrial zoned property for a purchase price of $7 million. Closing is expected to occur on or about June 15, 2018. SMI has received development approval from the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen for construction of the Sunniva Canada Campus.\nSMI received the Confirmation of Readiness for a license under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) from Health Canada.
