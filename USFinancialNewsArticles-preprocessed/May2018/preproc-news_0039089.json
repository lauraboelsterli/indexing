They might help shield European businesses from U.S. penalties but have never been used.\n“We are working on finding a practical solution ... in a short delay of time,” Mogherini told a news conference. “We are talking about solutions to keep the deal alive,” she said, adding that measures would seek to allow Iran to keep exporting oil and for European banks to continue to operate.\n“We have a quite clear list of issues to address. We are operating in a very difficult context ... I cannot talk about legal or economic guarantees but I can talk about serious, determined, immediate work from the European side.” (Reporting by Robin Emmott, Parisa Hafezi, John Irish)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
