    "text": "CHICAGO, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FreightCar America, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAIL) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nFirst quarter revenue of $83.0 million on deliveries of 1,094 units First quarter net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted certificates of deposit of $123.0 million at March 31, 2018 Backlog totaling 2,054 railcars at an aggregate value of approximately $143 million Completed acquisition of Navistar, Inc.’s railcar operations at Shoals facility during the quarter Full-year 2018 delivery outlook raised and now expected to range between 4,000 and 4,300 railcars\n“The first quarter marked a step in the right direction for FreightCar America,” said Jim Meyer, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Last quarter, we introduced our ‘Back to Basics’ operational excellence initiative rooted in manufacturing best practices, meaningful efficiency improvements and instillation of a cultural change across the organization. This quarter, we began to implement many of these initiatives and are encouraged by our start. Our employees are engaged and excited about the work they are doing, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reducing cost of goods sold by $3,000 to $4,000 per railcar on a run rate basis by the end of 2018.”\nMeyer concluded, “While challenging industry dynamics continue to put pressure on pricing, FreightCar America is focusing its efforts on areas which we can control. During the first quarter, we delivered nearly 1,100 units, received orders totaling 756 new and rebuilt railcars and continued to have positive conversations across our client base. In particular, we’re seeing increased demand for our rebuild capabilities as it relates to coal car conversions, the large majority of which we were the original manufacturer. As a result, we have grown more confident in our ability to capitalize on that opportunity this year and we are raising the lower end of our delivery outlook by 500 railcars. We now expect to deliver between 4,000 and 4,300 railcars during fiscal 2018.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nConsolidated revenues were $83.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $139.5 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nThe Company delivered 1,094 railcars in the first quarter of 2018, which included 891 new railcars, 81 rebuilt railcars and 122 leased railcars. This compares to 1,525 railcars delivered in the first quarter of 2017, which included 1,425 new railcars and 100 leased railcars.\nThe Company had a diversified backlog totaling 2,054 railcars at March 31, 2018, valued at approximately $143 million.\nConsolidated operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.6 million compared to operating income of $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $6.4 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted certificates of deposit were $123.0 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $136.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including increases in accounts receivable that have substantially been collected and inventory on lease.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call & Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.
