(Nasdaq:VRNS), a pioneer in data security and analytics, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nYaki Faitelson, Varonis CEO, said, “Q1 was a strong start to 2018. We are successfully executing on our strategy to create a platform to track and protect data wherever it is stored, reducing risk, preventing breaches and meeting compliance requirements. As data continues to grow, on premises and in the cloud, the complexity of data protection increases and organizations globally are turning to Varonis to help them solve their evolving needs. More customers are adopting more of our product families, driving our land and expand strategy, as well as our focus on innovation. We are more effectively capturing our large market opportunity and building a business to drive meaningful levels of growth, profit and cash flow over time.”\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues:\nTotal revenues were $53.5 million, up 35% and 32% on a constant currency basis compared with the first quarter of 2017. License revenues were $25.1 million, up 39% and 32% on a constant currency basis compared with the first quarter of 2017. Maintenance and services revenues were $28.5 million, up 32% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating Loss:\nGAAP operating loss was ($15.5) million for the quarter, compared to ($11.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating loss was ($6.7) million for the quarter, compared to ($7.1) million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Loss:\nGAAP net loss was ($15.0) million, compared to GAAP net loss of ($11.7) million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share was ($0.53) compared to GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share of ($0.43) in the first quarter of 2017, based on 28.4 million and 27.0 million basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Non-GAAP net loss was ($6.3) million, compared to ($6.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share was ($0.22), compared to ($0.25) in the first quarter of 2017, based on 28.4 million and 27.0 million basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively.\nThe tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP loss from operations and net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow:\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $153.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $136.6 million as of December 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated $17.4 million of cash from operations, compared to $8.3 million of cash from operations in the prior-year period.\nRecent Business Highlights\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenues in North America increased 24% over the prior-year period to $31.6 million, total revenues from EMEA increased 60% over the prior-year period to $20.3 million, and total revenues from Rest of World were $1.6 million.

Added 183 new customers during the first quarter of 2018 compared with 184 in the prior-year period. As of March 31, 2018, 70% of customers had purchased two or more product families, and 37% had purchased three or more product families, up from 66% and 31% as of March 31, 2017, respectively. These metrics are reflective of DatAlert and Varonis Edge as their own product family. Announced several new upgrades and features for the Data Security Platform, including perimeter-informed intelligence with Varonis Edge and new threat models for DatAlert. In addition, DatAdvantage for Office 365 now supports Azure Active Directory and includes auditing and event collection capabilities.

This is in addition to previously being named as a Finalist in SC Magazine 2018 Awards in the following categories: Best Enterprise Security Solution, Best Regulatory Compliance Solution and Best Customer Service. Released our 2018 Global Data Risk Report, which revealed that organizations continue to expose sensitive data to insider threats, ransomware and data breaches. We found that, on average, 21% of a company’s folders were accessible to everyone, and 41% of companies had at least 1,000 sensitive files open to all employees.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects revenues in the range of $61.5 million to $62.5 million, representing 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. The Company anticipates second quarter 2018 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of ($1.5) million to ($0.5) million and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share in the range of ($0.07) to ($0.04), based on a tax provision of $500,000 to $700,000 and 28.8 million basic and diluted shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share exclude stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company now expects revenues in the range of $264.0 million to $268.5 million, representing 23% to 25% year-over-year growth. The Company now anticipates full year 2018 non-GAAP operating income of $2.0 million to $4.5 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.01 to $0.07. This is based on a tax provision of $2.7 million to $3.2 million and 32.3 million diluted shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nConference Call and Webcast\nVaronis will host a conference call today, April 30, 2018, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the Company's first quarter 2018 financial results, current financial guidance and other corporate developments. To access this call, dial 877-425-9470 (domestic) or 201-389-0878 (international). The passcode is 13678088. A replay of this conference call will be available through May 7, 2018 at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international). The replay passcode is 13678088. A live webcast of this conference call will be available on the \"Investors\" page of the Company's website ( www.varonis.com ), and a replay will be archived on the website as well.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nVaronis believes that the use of non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) is helpful to our investors. These measures, which the Company refers to as our non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, non-GAAP operating loss is calculated as operating loss excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, non-GAAP net loss is calculated as net loss excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expense, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. In addition, the Company excludes payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation expense because, without excluding these tax expenses, investors would not see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on our operating results. These expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, the Company believes that excluding this payroll tax expense provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies.\nEach of our non-GAAP financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time. The non-GAAP financial data are not measures of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Varonis urges investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measures to evaluate our business.\nThe Company currently has six product families, DatAdvantage (including the Automation Engine), DatAlert (including Varonis Edge), Data Classification Engine (including GDPR Patterns), DataPrivilege, Data Transport Engine and DatAnswers. As of February 1, 2018, in order to focus its resources on its data security portfolio, the Company no longer sells DatAnywhere to new customers, and it does not expect renewals or sales of the product to its existing customers. In addition, beginning in 2018, DatAlert and Varonis Edge became a new product family. The customer count and product family attach rates as of March 31, 2018 and 2017 reflect these changes.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and statements made during the above referenced conference call will contain, \"forward-looking\" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including regarding the Company's growth rate and its expectations regarding future revenues, operating income or loss or earnings or loss per share.
