A Palestinian demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli troops during a protest against U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of Nakba, at the Israel-Gaza border east of Gaza City May 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem\nThe deaths of the two men, aged 21 and 29, raised to 47 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire since the protests began on March 30. Israel says its troops have used live ammunition to prevent a border fence from being damaged or breached.\nAt least 35 Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition fired by Israeli soldiers on Monday, the health officials said.
