    "text": "STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today reported results for the three months ended Mar. 30, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, the quarter comparisons are to the prior year comparable three months ended Mar. 31, 2017. As communicated in our fourth quarter earnings announcement, the Specialty Generics Disposal Group has been moved to discontinued operations and the prior period financials have been recast to reflect this movement.\nNet sales were $572.6 million in the first quarter as compared to $560.0 million in the comparable period, up 2.3%, or 1.7% on a constant-currency basis.\nGAAP gross profit was $276.8 million with gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 48.3%, compared with 53.6%, due to product mix shift. Adjusted gross profit was $468.5 million, compared with $470.6 million. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 81.8% versus 84.0%.\n\"We've made progress in the first quarter against our 2018 strategic initiatives,\" said Mark Trudeau, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mallinckrodt, \"working to maximize the contribution of our in-line portfolio and the first quarter results displayed solid growth in our hospital business. We've continued to focus payer conversations to identify appropriate patients for Acthar based on emerging data, driving new patient referrals and solid demand at the prescriber level with emerging data driving new patient referrals, and we continue to believe it will achieve in excess of $1 billion in net sales for the year. We look forward to the presentation of supporting data related to Acthar and the anticipated VTS-270 data readout in the next few months. We continue to execute on a disciplined capital allocation strategy primarily focused on reducing debt and streamlining the organization with a focus on reducing SG&A.\"\nGAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $192.4 million or 33.6% of net sales, as compared to $217.6 million, or 38.9%, resulting primarily from the benefits of restructuring activities throughout 2017. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $189.2 million or 33.0% of net sales, compared with $216.1 million or 38.6%.\nResearch and development expenses were $64.1 million or 11.2% of net sales, as compared to $45.0 million or 8.0%, resulting from increased pipeline investment and inline portfolio data generation.\nIncome tax benefit was $43.4 million, for an effective tax rate of 50.2%. The adjusted effective tax rate was 10.0%.\nGAAP diluted loss per share results from continuing operations was $0.50 compared with a loss per share from continuing operations of $0.43. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.31 versus $1.04.\nSPECIALTY BRANDS SEGMENT RESULTS\nNet sales for the segment were $572.6 million.\nH.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) net sales were $243.8 million, a 10.3% 2 decrease over $271.8 million, resulting from the residual impact of patient withdrawal issues. INOMAX ® (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, net sales were $139.8 million, up 8.9%, or 8.8% on a constant-currency basis, over $128.4 million, due to strong utilization and favorable contractual renewals. OFIRMEV ® (acetaminophen) injection net sales were $82.0 million compared with $73.4 million, an increase of 11.7% 2 , benefiting from commercial execution and strong demand. Therakos ® immunology platform net sales were $57.4 million compared with $51.2 million, an increase of 12.1%, or 7.7% on a constant-currency basis, resulting from strong commercial execution, particularly in Europe. AMITIZA ® (lubiprostone) net sales were $23.0 million for the first quarter, a partial quarter since the acquisition closed in mid-February. BioVectra, the company's contract manufacturing business in Canada, generated net sales of $10.5 million. Other net sales were $16.1 million, impacted by the sale of the Intrathecal business in the first quarter of 2017.\nLIQUIDITY\nMallinckrodt's cash provided by operating activities was $17.8 million with free cash flow of negative $16.5 million, impacted in part by the payment of opening balance sheet liabilities following the close of the Sucampo acquisition. The company expects to generate approximately $500 million in free cash flow in 2018.\nDuring the quarter, debt activities resulted in a net increase of $79.0 million, primarily a result of the new term loan utilized for the Sucampo transaction. In addition to items previously disclosed in the Form 10-K, Mallinckrodt reduced debt by $33.0 million and recognized a $6.5 million one-time gain, which is reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment. Subsequent to the quarter, the company repaid with cash on hand the maturing $300.0 million April 2018 notes.\nThe company also repurchased 2.9 million shares in the quarter for $45.2 million.\nMallinckrodt remains focused primarily on reducing debt throughout the remainder of 2018. The debt balance has decreased by approximately $215 million since Dec. 29, 2017. As of today, the company cash balance was in excess of $250 million, with no significant maturities of debt coming due until 2020.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nMallinckrodt will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, beginning at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time.

It also uses its website to expedite public access to time-critical information regarding the company in advance of or in lieu of distributing a press release or a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing the same information. Therefore, investors should look to the Investor Relations page of the website for important and time-critical information. Visitors to the website can also register to receive automatic e-mail and other notifications alerting them when new information is made available on the Investor Relations page of the website.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis press release contains financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted SG&A, net sales growth on a constant-currency basis, adjusted effective tax rate, and free cash flow, which are considered \"non-GAAP\" financial measures under applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted gross profit and adjusted SG&A represent amounts prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) and adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of the operational performance of the business. The adjustments for these items are on a pre-tax basis for adjusted gross profit and adjusted SG&A and on an after-tax basis for adjusted net income. Adjustments to GAAP amounts include, as applicable to each measure, restructuring and related charges, net; amortization and impairment charges; discontinued operations; acquisition-related expenses; changes in fair value of contingent consideration obligations; inventory step-up expenses; significant legal and environmental charges; pension settlement charges; deferred tax benefits recognized upon reductions to intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets offset by deferred tax expense associated with the impact of the 2017 legal entity reorganization; and other items identified by the company. Adjusted diluted earnings per share represent adjusted net income divided by the number of diluted shares.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as the income tax effects on continuing and discontinued operations plus the income tax impact included in Mallinckrodt's reconciliation of net income, divided by income from continuing and discontinued operations plus the pre-tax, non-income, tax-related adjustments included in its reconciliation of adjusted net income (excluding dilutive share impact). The income tax impact item included in its reconciliation of adjusted net income primarily represents the tax impact of adjustments between net income and adjusted net income as well as deferred tax benefits recognized upon reductions to intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets offset by deferred tax expense associated with the impact of the 2017 legal entity reorganization\nNet sales growth on a constant-currency basis measures the change in net sales between current- and prior-year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior-year period.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter represents net cash provided by operating activities of $17.8 million less capital expenditures of $34.3 million, each as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company has provided these adjusted financial measures because they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the company's operating performance. In addition, the company believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure Mallinckrodt's operating results. Management believes that presenting these adjusted measures provides useful information about the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance.\nThese adjusted measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's definition of these adjusted measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\nBecause adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of certain of these historical adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.\nFurther information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations page of the company's website.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELATED TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this document that are not strictly historical, including statements regarding future financial condition and operating results, economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Mallinckrodt's businesses and any other statements regarding events or developments the company believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, may be \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThere are a number of important factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those suggested or indicated by such forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. These factors include risks and uncertainties related to, among other things: general economic conditions and conditions affecting the industries in which Mallinckrodt operates; the commercial success of Mallinckrodt's products; Mallinckrodt's ability to realize anticipated growth, synergies and cost savings from acquisitions; conditions that could necessitate an evaluation of Mallinckrodt's goodwill and/or intangible assets for possible impairment; changes in laws and regulations; Mallinckrodt's ability to successfully integrate acquisitions of operations, technology, products and businesses generally and to realize anticipated growth, synergies and cost savings; Mallinckrodt's and Mallinckrodt's licensers' ability to successfully develop or commercialize new products; Mallinckrodt's and Mallinckrodt's licensers' ability to protect intellectual property rights; Mallinckrodt's ability to receive procurement and production quotas granted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration; customer concentration; Mallinckrodt's reliance on certain individual products that are material to its financial performance; cost containment efforts of customers, purchasing groups, third-party payers and governmental organizations; the reimbursement practices of a small number of public or private insurers; pricing pressure on certain of Mallinckrodt's products due to legal changes or changes in insurers' reimbursement practices resulting from recent increased public scrutiny of healthcare and pharmaceutical costs; limited clinical trial data for H.P. Acthar Gel; complex reporting and payment obligations under healthcare rebate programs; Mallinckrodt's ability to navigate price fluctuations; future changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws; Mallinckrodt's ability to achieve expected benefits from restructuring activities; complex manufacturing processes; competition; product liability losses and other litigation liability; ongoing governmental investigations; material health, safety and environmental liabilities; retention of key personnel; conducting business internationally; the effectiveness of information technology infrastructure; and cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nThese and other factors are identified and described in more detail in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Mallinckrodt's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2017.
