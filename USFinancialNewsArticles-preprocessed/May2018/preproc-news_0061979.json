    "text": "BRATISLAVA, May 30 (Reuters) - The Slovak financial sector is resilient to any potential shocks and the economy is starting to show signs of overheating, the Slovak National Bank said on Wednesday in an annual financial stability report.\nThe central bank said foreign owners of Slovak banks will need to apply a more conservative dividend policy to meet rising capital demands.\nIt reiterated it was ready to increase the countercyclical buffer rate for banks if needed, even as soon as taking a decision in July, to get ahead of strong growth in lending to households that is maintaining a double-digit pace.\nSlovakia’s banks, including CSOB , Postova Banka, Slovenska Sporitelna, Tatra Banka and VUB , are largely foreign-owned and have avoided troubles seen by other banks in Europe in the decade since the global financial crisis.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova, writing by Jason Hovet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
