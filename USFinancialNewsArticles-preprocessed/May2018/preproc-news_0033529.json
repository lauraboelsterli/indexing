    "text": "TORONTO, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Element Fleet Management Corp. (TSX:EFN) (“Element” or the “Company”), a leading global provider of fleet management and fleet-focused business services, today announced the appointment of Jay Forbes as its new Chief Executive Officer and a significant refresh of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) that includes the planned addition of four new independent directors. The Company also announced that it will hold its annual general meeting of shareholders on June 26, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Meeting”).\nCEO Appointment – Jay Forbes\nElement is pleased to announce the appointment of Jay Forbes as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective June 1, 2018. Today’s announcement follows a comprehensive CEO search process undertaken by the Board and its external advisors, in which both internal and external candidates were considered. Until June 1, Dan Jauernig will remain Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company and will then resume his responsibilities as President and Chief Operating Officer of Element. Along with the rest of the executive leadership team at Element, Mr. Jauernig will ensure continuity and smooth onboarding for Mr. Forbes.\n“Jay Forbes has a demonstrated track record of success for helping organizations understand and realize their full potential. His skills and experience will be invaluable to us as we look to realize the promise inherent in the global fleet management platform that Element has created over the past seven years,” said The Hon. Brian Tobin, P.C., O.C., Chairman of the Board. “Combined with the addition of four new, highly qualified independent directors to bolster the expertise of our Board, this represents a tremendous step forward in Element’s evolution.”\nMr. Forbes is a proven business leader who has brought a fresh strategic perspective to a variety of industry settings to create immediate and lasting value for investors, customers and employees. With a deep passion for serving customers, Mr. Forbes brings operational expertise, strong financial acumen, and a firm grasp of technology.\nMr. Forbes commented, “Element is a truly remarkable company, having gone from concept to global leadership in the fleet leasing and service industry in seven short years. I am truly looking forward to working with my new colleagues to strengthen our current customer offerings such that we continue to grow with them in the years to come. Accordingly, we will use the next few months to better understand how we can further strengthen our business model and refine our strategies to the benefit of our customers and investors.”\nMost recently, from 2015 to 2017, Mr. Forbes was President and CEO of Manitoba Telecom Services, where he designed and executed a customer-centric strategy that created $1.1 billion in shareholder value. Similarly, Mr. Forbes made a significant impact during his tenure as President and CEO of Teranet Inc., a world-leading developer, operator and owner of electronic land registration systems, where he developed an information services growth strategy to yield billions in high-margin revenues.\nMr. Forbes’ other leadership roles included President at Ingram Micro Inc., where he successfully restructured the business to improve profitability at the onset of an economic recession, and President and CEO / CFO at Aliant Inc., where he repositioned the business to become the second largest regional telecom services provider in North America, delivering $2 billion in shareholder value. In the past, Mr. Forbes has also served as CFO at real estate and energy companies.

He is a director at Economical Insurance and previously was a director at MTS, Stratos Global Corporation and Aliant Inc., in addition to a number of not-for-profit organizations.\nAddition of Four New Independent Directors\nElement also announced today that as a result of agreements with some of the Company’s significant shareholders, and Element’s own normal course board process to refresh the Board, the Company will undertake a reconstitution of its Board that will result in eight of nine nominees at the 2018 Annual Meeting being independent of the Company.\nRubin McDougal and Keith Graham, two independent directors, have been appointed to the Board, effective immediately. Mr. McDougal brings extensive public company, finance, credit, logistics and financial reporting experience to the Board. Mr. Graham has extensive business and investment and asset management expertise.\nThe Company also announced that it will nominate for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting two additional independent directors, Andrew Clarke and Alexander Greene. Mr. Clarke and Mr. Greene each have strong backgrounds in transportation services, logistics and finance, as well as a broad range of public company executive and board-level experience.\nMr. Forbes will also join the Board immediately.\nAs a result, the Company intends to nominate a slate of the following nine individuals for election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting:\nCurrent independent directors Brian Tobin (Chairman), Paul Damp, Joan Lamm-Tennant and Bill Lovatt; Independent directors Rubin McDougal and Keith Graham; and CEO Jay Forbes, all of whom were appointed to the Board on May 14, 2018; and Independent nominees Andrew Clarke and Alexander Greene.\n“Rubin, Keith, Andrew and Alex bring considerable expertise in transportation, technology and finance. The Board is excited to welcome these highly-qualified individuals to the Element team and eager to benefit from their deep expertise and experience for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. We are pleased to have agreed to the addition of Rubin, Keith and Andrew with some of our largest shareholders, and we believe that the reconstituted Board will help drive significant value for all shareholders,” said The Hon. Brian Tobin.\nIn addition, Steven Hudson and Richard Venn have advised the Company that they will not be standing for re-election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting.\n“The Board thanks Steve and Richard for their many years of valuable service and the significant role they each played in firmly establishing Element as a leader in global fleet management. In particular, I want to acknowledge Steve Hudson’s contribution as founder and builder of the Element Fleet platform, both as CEO and for the last year and a half as Vice-Chairman of the Board,” stated The Hon. Brian Tobin.\nMr. Greene was identified as a director candidate as part of the Board’s normal course board refreshment process. The appointments of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Graham were made pursuant to separate agreements (the “ Nomination Agreements ”) entered into by the Company with each of EdgePoint Wealth Management Inc., Lion Point Capital, LP and Ancora Advisors, LLC (which respectively own approximately 4.3%, 4.6% and 2.5% of Element’s issued and outstanding common shares) as a result of discussions with such shareholders regarding the composition of the Board.
