    "text": "3 COMMENTS One of New York’s major cultural institutions, the 92nd Street Y, plans an extensive renovation after the biggest fundraising campaign in its 144-year history.\nThe $180 million capital campaign—$145 million of which already has been raised—will fund a renovation of the building from top to bottom and create several new dedicated spaces for current programs and activities, including those devoted to early childhood, seniors and Jewish life, Y officials said.\nThe Warburg Lounge at the 92nd Street Y.

It offers a full slate of concerts, lectures and readings, plus classes in a variety of subjects. It also features programming celebrating Jewish life, reflecting its founding in 1874 as the Young Men’s Hebrew Association (YMHA). It has a fitness center and nursery school as well.\nAs the Y’s activities have grown over the years, it has faced difficulties fitting so much into its 250,000-square-foot building, which fronts Lexington Avenue between 91st and 92nd Streets. Making matters more challenging: The edifice—actually, two buildings, dating back to 1929 and 1968, that are joined together as one entity—has long been in need of upgrades and improvements.\n“We underinvested in the building for decades,” said Henry Timms, the Y’s chief executive since 2014.\nWork on the overhaul is expected to take place over the next several years. The Y already completed one element within the past month—a new 16-room facility to house its music school, which serves 900 students of all ages.\nYana Stotland, the music school’s director, said she is “thrilled beyond belief” with the new setup, which gives faculty and students the room they need. Previously, the school’s facility, housed in a different part of the building, was so tight for space that Ms. Stotland typically had to give up her office for much of the day so it could be used for lessons.\nSamantha Angstman, in red, helps James Lahner during a group piano class for beginners at the 92nd street Y.

The renovation should result in dedicated classrooms for the writing program, Y officials said.\nThe Y won’t be expanding its building. Rather, the renovation calls for the elimination of some residential units—the Y has a dorm of sorts—and a reconfiguration of existing space to provide the needed room, officials said.\nThe Y’s efforts come as other major cultural institutions in the city have struggled with campaigns for ambitious and costly projects. In the past year, Lincoln Center and the New York Philharmonic shelved a $500 million plan to renovate David Geffen Hall.\nWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com",
