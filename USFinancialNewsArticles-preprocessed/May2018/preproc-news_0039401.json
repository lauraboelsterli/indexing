Vertachnik most recently served as chief sales officer (CSO) at supply chain software and services company, BlueJay Solutions. He brings more than two decades of executive-level experience in enterprise software, driving companies’ business strategy, company-wide customer relationship initiatives, and operations.\nAt IQMS, Vertachnik will leverage his extensive expertise in uniting all the teams that interact with IQMS customers behind a single vision for optimizing their relationships and providing a consistent, superior experience.

He also held positions as senior vice president of global transportation and distribution at RedPrarie Corporation and vice president of global transportation and distribution at I2 Technologies, two supply chain management companies that were subsequently acquired by JDA Software.\n“At the heart of IQMS’s success is its manufacturing-centric ERP system, which empowers customers to optimize their operations and decision-making, from the shop floor to the back office,” said Vertachnik. “I am excited to lead the IQMS sales team and our partners in synchronized efforts that create a superior experience for customers and prospects, and maximize their understanding of how to leverage our software in driving their efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability.”\nAbout IQMS\nIQMS uniquely combines ERP and MES functionality to give manufacturers a comprehensive end-to-end suite for running the business, backed by the real-time performance and scalability that companies demand.
