    "text": "May 1, 2018 / 6:23 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Rebels recruit former Wallabies hooker Charles Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Former Wallabies hooker Nathan Charles has returned home to take up a short-term deal with the Melbourne Rebels in Super Rugby after a year-long stint in the English Premiership.\nCharles, the only known professional rugby player with cystic fibrosis, has been drafted in as injury cover for Jordan Uelese who is expected to be sidelined for a month with an arm injury.\nHooker Sama Malolo has also returned to international duties with the Junior Wallabies to compete in the Oceania U20s Championships.\nCharles trained with the Rebels on Tuesday and could slot in to the side for Friday’s home match against the champion Canterbury Crusaders, a team spokesman said.\nHe will be contracted to the Rebels until the end of the season.\nThe 29-year-old takes up to 30 pills a day to treat cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder with no known cure that causes lung infections and breathing problems.\nHe played 86 matches with the now-defunct Western Force and inspired his home nation in 2014 when he earned four caps for the Wallabies.\nCharles took up a short-term deal with Bath last year and hinted at his departure from the Premiership side on Twitter last week.\n“We are fortunate to add an experienced player like Nathan to our squad mid-season and we look forward to him adding depth and competition in our hooking ranks,” Rebels general manager of rugby Nick Ryan said in a statement on Tuesday.\n“We have identified our set piece work as an area of improvement. We see Nathan being a great acquisition in support of Anaru (Rangi), and in the absence of Jordan and Sama.”\nThe Rebels will bid to end Australian teams’ 36-game losing streak to New Zealand opponents when they take on the eight-times champion Crusaders at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.
