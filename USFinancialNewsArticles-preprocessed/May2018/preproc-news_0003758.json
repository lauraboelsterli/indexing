    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 4:31 PM / in 3 minutes Exclusive: Apollo Global approaches Xerox about possible acquisition - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) has approached Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the latter’s sale to Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko\nApollo’s interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment this week of John Visentin as the company’s new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc ( PSDO.O ), two companies in which Apollo invested.\nThere is no certainty that Apollo’s approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Xerox and Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reporting by Liana B. Baker in Los Angeles and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski",
