    "text": "TORONTO, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YAMANA GOLD INC. (TSX:YRI) (NYSE:AUY) (“Yamana” or “the Company”) is herein reporting its financial and operational results 2018.\nIllustrative Timeline for the Development Opportunities at Chapada\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nGold equivalent ounce (“GEO”) (1) production from Yamana Mines (2) was 211,246, including 199,555 ounces of gold and 899,261 ounces of silver. Total attributable gold production (3) was 248,088 ounces of gold, including attributable production from Gualcamayo and Brio Gold Inc. (\"Brio Gold\"). The Company also produced 30.4 million pounds of copper.\nFirst quarter costs for Yamana Mines included AISC on a by-product basis (4) of $714 per GEO; cash costs on a by-product basis (4) of $454 per GEO; and total cost of sales of $1,037 per GEO. Refer to page 11 of this press release for additional information on costs by metal on a co-product and by-product basis.\nGold production exceeded plan with mine site costs in line with or better than plan. The Company reiterates production and cost guidance for 2018, and continues to expect approximately 47 per cent of total gold production from Yamana Mines and 46 per cent of total copper production to be delivered in the first half of the year. This production weighting is before consideration for the Company’s newest mine, Cerro Moro, where first ore was fed to the mill on April 25, 2018. The start up is progressing well with milling rates and feed grades expected to ramp up through the second quarter with first doré expected in May. First quarter activities at Cerro Moro have positioned the operation to deliver on production expectations in 2018.\nCerro Moro is expected to contribute meaningfully to Yamana’s planned growth at costs significantly below the Company’s current average cost structure. This is expected to lead to a step change in cash flows and free cash flows beginning in the second half of 2018.\nNet loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $160.6 million, with $160.1 million or $0.17 per share basic and diluted attributable to Yamana equityholders. A summary of certain non-cash and other items is included in the table on page 3 of this press release, the most notable of which is a $168.2 million ($174.0 million before tax) non-cash accounting carrying value reduction related to Company’s interest in Brio Gold.\nAdjusted cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital (4) are $146.5 million. Cash flows from operating activities were $122.4 million and cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital (4) were $206.4 million. This includes a $67.9 million payment to settle certain tax contingencies in Brazil and $127.8 million received from the Company’s copper advanced sales program, both of which were previously reported on February 15, 2018. Given the non-recurring nature of the tax payment and copper advance sales program, the Company believes adjusted cash flows more accurately represent the cash flows generated in the quarter.\nThe balance sheet as at March 31, 2018, includes cash and cash equivalents of $129.3 million, and available credit (excluding Brio Gold) of $827.8 million, for total liquidity to the Company of approximately $1.0 billion. Net debt (4) decreased by $163.5 million from December 31, 2017, notwithstanding capital expenditures while Cerro Moro was in development. This results in an improved balance sheet coincident with the start up of Cerro Moro.\n(All amounts are expressed in United States Dollars unless otherwise indicated.)\nGold equivalent ounces include gold plus silver at a ratio of 76.9:1. Yamana Mines include Chapada, El Peñón, Canadian Malartic, Minera Florida, Jacobina and Cerro Moro. Attributable production includes production from Gualcamayo and production commensurate to the Company's interest in Brio Gold, which of 2018 was a weighted average of 53.6%. Refers to a non-GAAP financial measure or an additional line item or subtotal in financial statements as described at the end of this press release. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are available at www.yamana.com/Q12018 and in Section 10 of the Company’s first quarter 2018 Management’s Discussion & Analysis , which has been filed on SEDAR.\nSummary of Certain Non-Cash and Other Items Included in Net Earnings\n(In United States Dollars, per share amounts may not add due to rounding, unaudited) Three Months\nEnded Mar 31st 2018 2017 Non-cash unrealized foreign exchange losses 3.3 2.2 Share-based payments/mark-to-market of deferred share units 0.8 3.2 Mark-to-market on derivative contracts (10.1 ) 0.4 Mark-to-market on investment and other assets 1.0 3.7 Revision in estimates and liabilities including contingencies 5.2 1.5 Gain on sale of assets (39.3 ) - Impairment of mining and non-operational mineral properties related to Brio Gold 174.0 - Financing costs paid on early note redemption 14.7 - Reorganization costs 4.0 - Other provisions, write-downs and adjustments 6.5 3.9 Non-cash tax unrealized foreign exchange losses/(gains) 4.8 (27.2) Income tax effect of adjustments 5.3 3.2 TOTAL ADJUSTMENTS 170.2 (9.1) Increase to earnings per share 0.18 - Note: For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net earnings from continuing operations, attributable to Yamana Gold Inc. equityholders, would be adjusted by an increase of $170.2 million (2017 – decrease of $9.1 million).\nThe above table includes a non-cash accounting carrying value reduction totalling $168.2 million ($174.0 million before tax) in respect of the previously announced Brio Gold and Leagold Mining Corporation (“Leagold”) transaction. The business combination of Brio Gold and Leagold, which received approval by Brio Gold shareholders on April 12, 2018, prompted a move to carry the Company’s interest in Brio Gold at market prices for the related shares as at March 31, 2018. Upon completion of the transaction, and following the recently announced planned equity issue by Leagold, Yamana will own approximately 20.5% of Leagold. The accounting adjustment to the carrying value of the Company’s Brio Gold shares does not reflect the ultimate impact to the Company, which will be based on the consideration value from the share prices when the plan of arrangement closes in the second quarter of 2018. Additionally, the adjustment does not reflect the accretion to value that is anticipated as the combined entity will create an impressive mid-tier gold producer with assets in two proven mining jurisdictions, a strong production platform, built-in potential for growth and a proven management team well positioned to deliver future value increases.\nCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe Company continues to evaluate its medium-term development opportunities and foresees that after the completion of Cerro Moro and the Canadian Malartic Extension project there will be a significant reduction in expansionary capital. This, when considered with the production growth at Cerro Moro and growth within the existing portfolio, positions the Company well to deliver on near-term step changes in cash flow and net free cash flow. The net effect also positions the Company well to execute on its corporate objective to both reduce net debt and increase cash balances. This cash-harvesting phase is expected to commence in 2018 and continue for at least the next several years.\nThe Company continues to target a leverage ratio of 1.5 or better. Opportunities to reduce leverage below this target will be considered.\nThe Company is focused on improving cash flows and returns on invested capital. In that context, the Company’s development opportunities will be managed within the framework of the balance sheet objectives. In addition to the usual project gating items, project scheduling and expenditures will be sequential so as not to interfere with the Company’s balance sheet objectives and also the period of cash flow harvesting. Monetization of certain assets or other strategic alternatives may ultimately provide additional flexibility to both the balance sheet and project timing.\nChapada\nThe Company continues to advance its exploration program with the objective of identifying higher-grade copper and gold opportunities that are proximal to the Chapada mine, completing infill drilling of the Sucupira and Baru deposits and advancing district scale targets. Mineralization has been identified along a 15-kilometre trend with numerous prospective areas under consideration for further drilling. An exploration update relating to this will be included with results for the second quarter of 2018. Infill drilling in the Baru area is expected to reduce stripping ratios for the Sucupira deposit and drilling on oxide mineralization, such as Hidrotermalito, offers the potential for heap leaching opportunities. Additionally, there are significant near mine sulphide targets that the Company is pursuing to supplement the existing mine plan.\nNotwithstanding the focus on the exploration potential to discover higher grade copper and gold areas, the Company has also advanced numerous projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the Chapada mine.\nTo this end, the Company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at Chapada. These opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries, to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows, and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones. The completed study work included third party review of capital estimates and the inclusion of a significant contingency. The study results justify progressing the opportunities to the next stage(s) of evaluation and development.\nGiven the nature of the opportunities, the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan. This flexibility in approach allows the Company to balance the maximization of value at Chapada, with the allocation of capital across the broader Company portfolio. Primary, however, is that the Company’s development opportunities are to be managed within the framework of the balance sheet objectives.\nThe Company is outlining the opportunities, such as how it envisages their phasing, the expected production benefit, estimates for capital expenditures, and approximate timing based on the current level of engineering and logistical factors such as permitting. The Phase 1 - Plant Optimization Work, as described below, has been approved with associated capital expenditures estimated at $9 million.\nEngineering is being advanced for Phases 2 and 3, an expansion of the Chapada mill and pushback of the Chapada pit wall to expose higher grade Sucupira ores, respectively. While review of these projects is progressing through the evaluation process, importantly, the Company does not anticipate the allocation of expansionary capital for these projects before 2021.\nBased on the work completed to date, the Company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 ounces of gold (not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of Suruca, which is a gold-only ore body) and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034, and represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital. This represents an increase to the production outlook, as recently disclosed in the Chapada NI 43-101 Technical Report dated March 21, 2018. Further project details are expected to be available in early 2019 with the completion of the Feasibility Study. A development decision for Phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\nhttp://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/c861f991-5ece-433d-a90f-a5756e0b3550\nPhase 1 - Plant Optimization Work Targeting Further Copper and Gold Recovery Improvements\nDuring prior plant optimization projects in 2016 and 2017, which together have delivered an approximate 4% increase to both gold and copper recoveries, the Company determined that further optimizations would allow for additional gold and copper recovery improvements.\nIn late 2017 and through the first quarter of 2018, pilot plant flotation tests were conducted at Chapada that indicated scope for an additional 1.5% to 2.0% increase in gold and copper recoveries with the increase achievable through modifications to the cleaner tailings stream and the addition of new cells in the rougher/scavenger circuit. The Company plans to start the implementation of the Phase 1 - Plant Optimization Work in 2018 with completion expected by the second quarter of 2019. Expansionary capital is estimated at $9 million.\nPhase 2 - Plant Expansion\nStudies have been completed on expanding the Chapada processing plant capacity up to 32 million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) from the current capacity of 23 Mtpa. These studies concluded that higher throughput can be achieved with the current flotation feed size of approximately 280 microns via the installation of the following new equipment: an additional ball mill, high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR), a pebble crushing circuit, an additional Vertimill, and additional cells in the flotation circuit.\nThe expansion of the mineral resource inventory in 2017, the realized and further expected improvements to gold and copper recoveries via Phase 1, and the inclusion of the existing and growing low-grade ore stockpiles for which recovery improvements also apply were factored into the analysis for the plant expansion. At year-end 2017, the low-grade stockpiles totalled 88 million tonnes with grades estimated at 0.23% copper and 0.17 g/t gold.\nA feasibility study has been initiated for the Phase 2 plant expansion and is expected to be completed in early 2019. Expansionary capital for the plant expansion is currently estimated at approximately $140 million (which includes a significant contingency), with no significant expenditures expected before 2021 as suggested on the illustrative timeline.\nPhase 3 - Pit Wall Pushback to Access Sucupira\nCurrent production at Chapada is sourced entirely from the main Chapada area, which includes the Corpo Principal, Cava Norte, and Corpo Sul pits. Future production is also expected to include the Sucupira deposit for which 46 million tonnes of Proven and Probable mineral reserves grading 0.27 g/t gold and 0.31% copper were included with the year-end 2017 mineral resource statement. The Company is evaluating opportunities to access additional higher-grade mineralization from Sucupira via a series of pushbacks on the north wall of the Chapada pit. This plan contemplates an additional 43 million tonnes of Sucupira mineralization grading 0.24 g/t gold and 0.36% copper. While the series of pushbacks necessitate the movement of certain surface infrastructure, importantly, the expansion does not require significant fleet additions as mining rates already exceed plant capacity. A feasibility study for Phase 3 is scheduled for completion in 2019. Based on current studies and the illustrative timeline, expected capital for the relocation of certain surface infrastructure is estimated at approximately $100 million with spending expected from 2024 to 2025. The first delivery of ore from Sucupira to the Chapada plant is expected in 2026, subject to positive feasibility study and a decision to proceed in 2023.\nSuruca - Gold-Only Oxide and Sulphide Development Opportunity\nConcurrent with the multi-phase plan for Chapada, development of the gold-only Suruca oxides is being evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study has been completed, and separately as part of an integrated plan with the sulphide mineralization. The integrated scenario includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold-only sulphides through a CIL plant. Evaluation of the integrated option is progressing, including an exploration program designed to test known extensions of the sulphide mineralization. The Company expects to continue this exploration program through 2019. Results from the 2017 program and initial drilling as part of the 2018 program are showing extensions of the sulphide deposit to the west and in select, previously undrilled areas along the east flank of the deposit.\nUnder evaluation is a CIL plant with processing capacity of 8,000 tonnes per day (“tpd”) up to 13,000 tpd which would add meaningfully to gold production in the broader Chapada complex. Suruca, either the standalone oxide or sulphide ore bodies, or the integrated scenario, is under consideration as a gold only opportunity independently of the other opportunities at the main Chapada operations.\nHEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\nHealth and safety are core to Yamana’s values evidenced by the continued commitment to the \"One Team, One Goal: Zero\" vision for sustainability, which reflects the Company's commitment to zero harm to employees, the environment and communities near mine operations.\nThe Company deeply regrets the previously announced fatal motor-vehicle accident involving two employees of a local contractor at the Gualcamayo mine, Argentina. All operations and exploration sites reviewed the incident to ensure that employees in similar conditions understand the risk and that the safety controls both exist and are functioning. These fatalities are included in the Company's Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) of 0.72 of 2018, which is comparatively low by industry standards. TRIFR is calculated on 200,000 hours worked and includes employees and contractors.\nGUALCAMAYO\nThe Company considers the contribution to cash flows from assets and whether or not the possible monetization of or other strategic alternatives for those assets may deliver more value than the immediate cash flows that they generate. In line with the review, the Company initiated a plan of sale for its Gualcamayo mine in Argentina late in 2017. In the meantime, mining operations continue efforts to right-size production at Gualcamayo. Further options under consideration include various harvesting options that would maximize cash flows and consider the significant exploration long-term potential at Gualcamayo.\nThis may include an eventual depletion of the oxide resource with a move towards a care and maintenance plan for the asset and further evaluations on a number of prospective oxide targets that are proximal to the mine as well as additional studies on the Deep Carbonate project. If, during the course of 2018, the Company does not receive a sale price that adequately reflects the strategic value of the asset, then the Company would move ahead with the latter options.\nKEY STATISTICS\nKey operating and financial statistics 2018 are outlined in the following tables.\nFinancial Summary (including Brio Gold on a 100% basis unless otherwise indicated)\nThree Months\nEnded Mar 31st (In millions of United States Dollars except for shares and per share amounts, unaudited) 2018 2017 Revenue 449.7 403.5 Cost of sales excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization (259.2 ) (238.0 ) Depletion, depreciation and amortization (\"DDA\") (104.1 ) (106.0 ) Total cost of sales (363.3 ) (344.0 ) Mine operating earnings/(loss) (16.6 ) 59.5 General and administrative expenses (26.2 ) (25.3 ) Exploration and evaluation expenses (3.8 ) (4.0 ) Net earnings/(loss) (160.6 ) 1.0 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to Yamana Gold equity holders (160.1 ) - Net earnings/(loss) - basic and diluted (0.17 ) - Cash flow generated from continuing operations after changes in non-cash working capital 122.4 51.3 Cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash working capital 206.4 117.2 Revenue per ounce of gold 1,310 1,209 Revenue per ounce of silver 16.50 17.28 Revenue per pound of copper 2.56 2.35 Average realized gold price per ounce 1,328 1,220 Average realized silver price per ounce 16.93 17.29 Average realized copper price per pound 3.13 2.57 For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding, basic and diluted, was 948,711 thousand.\nProduction, Financial and Operating Summary\nThree Months\nEnded Mar 31st Gold 2018 2017 Total cost of sales per ounce sold - Yamana Mines $ 1,035 $1,022 Total cost of sales per ounce sold - Attributable $ 1,086 $1,056 Co-product cash costs per ounce produced - Yamana Mines $ 667 $661 Co-product cash costs per ounce produced - Attributable $ 724 $712 All-in sustaining co-product costs per ounce produced - Yamana Mines $ 881 $927 All-in sustaining co-product costs per ounce produced - Attributable $ 928 $936 By-product cash costs per ounce produced - Yamana Mines $ 444 $565 All-in sustaining by-product costs per ounce produced - Yamana Mines $ 703 $902 Silver 2018 2017 Total cost of sales per ounce sold $ 15.20 $15.14 Co-product cash costs per ounce produced $ 10.88 $10.36 All-in sustaining co-product costs per ounce produced $ 13.83 $14.24 By-product cash costs per ounce produced $ 8.01 $9.00 All-in sustaining by-product costs per ounce produced $ 11.58 $13.72 Copper 2018 2017 Total cost of sales per copper pound sold - Chapada $ 1.71 $1.79 Co-product cash costs per pound of copper produced - Chapada $ 1.51 $1.78 All-in sustaining costs per pound of copper produced - Chapada $ 1.65 $2.13\nThree Months\nEnded Mar 31st Gold Ounces 2018 2017 Chapada 22,753 19,089 El Peñón 40,391 33,637 Canadian Malartic (50%) 83,403 71,382 Minera Florida 18,483 21,685 Jacobina 34,525 32,126 Cerro Moro - - Total production - Yamana Mines 199,555 177,919 Brio Gold (attributable to Yamana) 24,687 41,886 Gualcamayo 23,846 37,728 TOTAL 248,088 257,533\nThree Months\nEnded Mar 31st Silver Ounces 2018 2017 El Peñón 899,261 960,820 Cerro Moro - - TOTAL 899,261 960,820\nThree Months\nEnded Mar 31st Copper Pounds (million) 2018 2017 Chapada 30.4 26.5 For a full discussion of Yamana’s operational and financial results, please refer to the Company’s first quarter 2018 Management’s Discussion & Analysis and Financial Statements , which have been filed on SEDAR and are also available on the Company’s website.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nToll Free (North America): 1-866-223-7781 Toronto Local and International: 416-340-2218 Webcast: www.yamana.com Conference Call Replay Toll Free (North America): 1-800-408-3053 Toronto Local and International: 905-694-9451 Passcode: 7856108 The conference call replay will be available from 12:00 p.m. ET on May 3, 2018, until 11:59 p.m. ET on May 18, 2018.\nQualified Persons\nScientific and technical information contained in this press release relating to operations at Chapada, Canadian Malartic and Jacobina has been reviewed and approved by Yohann Bouchard (Senior Vice President, Operations); relating to operations at El Peñón, Cerro Moro, Minera Florida and Gualcamayo has been reviewed and approved by Carlos Bottinelli (Manager, Technical Services); and relating to exploration has been reviewed and approved by Henry Marsden (Senior Vice President, Exploration).

However, these terms are not defined terms under Industry Guide 7 and are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements of United States companies filed with the Commission. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into Mineral Reserves. “Inferred Mineral Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a Mineral Resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations. In contrast, the Commission only permits U.S. companies to report mineralization that does not constitute “Mineral Reserves” by Commission standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND ADDITIONAL LINE ITEMS AND SUBTOTALS IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with IFRS, including the following:\nCash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product and by-product basis; Cash costs per ounce of silver produced on a co-product and by-product basis; Co-product cash costs per pound of copper produced; All-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product and by-product basis; All-in sustaining costs per ounce of silver produced on a co-product and by-product basis; All-in sustaining co-product costs per pound of copper produced; Net debt; Net free cash flow; Adjusted cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital; Average realized price per ounce of gold sold; Average realized price per ounce of silver sold; and Average realized price per pound of copper sold.\nThe Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management's determination of the components of non-GAAP and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions, a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable. Any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable.\nCASH COSTS AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS\nThe Company discloses “cash costs” because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the Company’s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities. The Company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows. The measures, as determined under IFRS, are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities. Cash costs figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe measure of cash costs, along with revenue from sales, is considered to be a key indicator of a company’s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations. This data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non-GAAP financial measure. The terms co-product and by-product cash costs per ounce of gold or silver produced, co-product cash costs per pound of copper produced, co-product and by-product AISC per ounce of gold or silver produced and co-product AISC per pound of copper produced do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and is not necessarily indicative of operating costs, operating profit or cash flows presented under IFRS.\nBy-Product and Co-Product Cash Costs\nCash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, administration, production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, capital, development and exploration costs. The Company believes that such measure provides useful information about the Company’s underlying cash costs of operations. Cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis, net of by-product sales and on a co-product basis as follows:\nCash costs of gold and silver on a by-product basis - shown on a per ounce basis.\nThe attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by-products by applying copper and zinc net revenues, which are incidental to the production of precious metals, as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced, thereby allowing the Company’s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production. These costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced.\nCash costs of gold and silver on a co-product basis - shown on a per ounce basis.\nCosts directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal. Costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually. The attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co-product basis for the period.\nCash costs of copper on a co-product basis - shown on a per pound basis.\nCosts attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced.\nBy-Product and Co-Product AISC\nAll-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing gold and silver ounces from current operations, based on co-product costs or by-product costs, including cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures, corporate general and administrative expense excluding stock-based compensation, and exploration and evaluation expense. All-in sustaining costs do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions, exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects, income tax payments, financing costs and dividend payments. Consequently, this measure is not representative of all of the Company's cash expenditures. In addition, the calculation of all-in sustaining costs does not include depletion, depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods.\nAll-in sustaining co-product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold, silver or copper production activities. Similarly, all-in sustaining by-product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold and silver production activities but net of by-product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc.\nA reconciliation of total cost of sales of gold, silver and copper sold (cost of sales excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization, plus depreciation, depletion and amortization) per the Consolidated Financial Statements to co-product cash costs of gold produced, co-product cash costs of silver produced, co-product cash costs of copper produced, co-product AISC of gold produced, co-product AISC of silver produced, co-product AISC of copper produced, by-product cash costs of gold produced, by-product cash costs of silver produced, by-product AISC of gold produced and by-product AISC of silver produced is provided in Section 14: of the MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and comparable period of 2017 which has been filed on SEDAR.\nNET DEBT\nThe Company uses the financial measure \"Net Debt\", which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement information in its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance. The non-GAAP financial measure of net debt does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nNet Debt is calculated as the sum of the current and non-current portions of long-term debt net of the cash and cash equivalent balance as at the balance sheet date. A reconciliation of Net Debt is provided in Section 14: of the MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and comparable period of 2017 which has been filed on SEDAR.\nNET FREE CASH FLOW\nThe Company uses the financial measure \"Net Free Cash Flow\", which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement information in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Free Cash Flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance with respect to its operating cash flow capacity to meet non-discretionary outflows of cash. The presentation of Net Free Cash Flow is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flow information presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. Net Free Cash Flow is calculated as cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations adjusted for advance payments received pursuant to metal purchase agreements, non-discretionary expenditures from sustaining capital expenditures and interest and financing expenses paid related to the current period. A reconciliation of Net Free Cash Flow is provided in Section 14: of the MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and comparable period of 2017 which has been filed on SEDAR.\nADJUSTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BEFORE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL\nThe Company uses the financial measures “Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities before Net Change in Working Capital\", which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities before Net Change in Working Capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance by excluding certain items from cash flows from operating activities. The presentation of Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities before Net Change in Working Capital is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flows information presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities before Net Change in Working Capital is calculated as the sum of cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital subtracting the impact of advance payments on metal purchase agreement and other non-recurring cash items. Reconciliations of Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities before Net Change in Working Capital are below:\n(In millions of US Dollars) For the three months ended March 31\n2018 2017 Cash flows from operating activities $ 122.4 $51.3 Net change in working capital 84.0 65.9 Cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital $ 206.4 $117.2 Less: Advance payments received on metal purchase agreement and unearned revenue (127.8 ) (4.4) Add: Payments made related to the Brazilian tax matters 67.9 — Adjusted cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital $ 146.5 $(112.8) AVERAGE REALIZED METAL PRICES\nThe Company uses the financial measures \"average realized gold price\", \"average realized silver price\" and \"average realized copper price\", which are non-GAAP financial measures, to supplement in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Average realized price does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance vis-à-vis average market prices of metals for the period. The presentation of average realized metal prices is not meant to be a substitute for the revenue information presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measure.\nAverage realized metal price represents the sale price of the underlying metal before deducting sales taxes, treatment and refining charges, and other quotational and pricing adjustments. Average realized prices are calculated as the revenue related to each of the metals sold, i.e. gold, silver and copper, divided by the quantity of the respective units of metals sold, i.e. gold ounce, silver ounce and copper pound. Reconciliations of average realized metal prices to revenue provided in Section 14: of the MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and comparable period of 2017 which has been filed on SEDAR.\nADDITIONAL LINE ITEMS OR SUBTOTALS IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company uses the following additional line items and subtotals in the Consolidated Financial Statements as contemplated in IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements :\nGross margin excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization — represents the amount of revenue in excess of cost of sales excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization. This additional measure represents the cash contribution from the sales of metals before all other operating expenses and DDA, in the reporting period. Mine operating earnings — represents the amount of revenue in excess of cost of sales excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization and depletion, depreciation and amortization. Operating earnings — represents the amount of earnings before net finance income/expense and income tax recovery/expense. This measure represents the amount of financial contribution, net of all expenses directly attributable to mining operations and overheads. Finance income, finance expense and foreign exchange gains/losses are not classified as expenses directly attributable to mining operations. Cash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid and net change in working capital — excludes the payments made during the period related to income taxes and tax related payments and the movement from period-to-period in working capital items including trade and other receivables, other assets, inventories, trade and other payables. Working capital and income taxes can be volatile due to numerous factors, such as the timing of payment and receipt. As the Company uses the indirect method prescribed by IFRS in preparing its statement of cash flows, this additional measure represents the cash flows generated by the mining business to complement the GAAP measure of cash flows from operating activities, which is adjusted for income taxes paid and tax related payments and the working capital change during the reporting period. Cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital — excludes the movement from period-to-period in working capital items including trade and other receivables, other assets, inventories, trade and other payables. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, such as the timing of payment and receipt. As the Company uses the indirect method prescribed by IFRS in preparing its statement of cash flows, this additional measure represents the cash flows generated by the mining business to complement the GAAP measure of cash flows from operating activities, which is adjusted for the working capital change during the reporting period.\nThe Company’s management believes that their presentation provides useful information to investors because gross margin excluding depletion, depreciation and amortization excludes the non-cash operating cost item (i.e. depreciation, depletion and amortization), cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital excludes the movement in working capital items, mine operating earnings excludes expenses not directly associate with commercial production and operating earnings excludes finance and tax related expenses and income/recoveries. These, in management’s view, provide useful information of the Company’s cash flows from operating activities and are considered to be meaningful in evaluating the Company’s past financial performance or the future prospects.\nSource:Yamana Gold",
