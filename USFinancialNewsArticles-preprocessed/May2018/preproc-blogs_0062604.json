Nash / The Wall Street Journal\nNEW YORK — The popularity of today’s software bots is built on the promise that automating mundane corporate tasks with code frees employees to pursue more thought-intensive work. But that’s provided the bots work. problems, according to automation experts.\nBot failure isn’t uncommon, depending on how the software is designed and coded, said Kenan Corp.The IFC is part of the World Bank Group.\n“We don’t expect bots will go wild, but they will stop when something goes wrong,” said Mr. Erkan, who attended a bot-building hackathon here Tuesday sponsored by Automation Anywhere Inc., which provides tools for creating bots.\nSuch bots are part of a movement known as robotic process automation, in which advanced software bots built with machine-learning algorithms perform tasks such as object recognition. Other software bots don’t require artificial intelligence because they are designed to complete rules-based tasks.\nBots can be faster and more accurate than humans in performing monotonous tasks, such as entering data or sorting customer queries. But companies rolling out such bots are encountering challenges, such as defining the right level of automation for a set of tasks and failing to address problems in data quality, as CIO Journal reported in March .\nMr. Erkan and his team of finance experts and developers are experimenting with bots to perform routine and repetitive jobs, such as checking websites for financial data related to work the IFC does for companies in emerging markets. He expects to deploy bots next year. Meanwhile he is learning about tips and pitfalls from counterparts at World Bank, which is running several finance bots, he said in an interview.\nFor example, one bot was programmed to scrape data about the maturity dates of U.S. bonds from Bloomberg terminals. A change in Bloomberg software moved the data on the screen by about one centimeter, stymying the bot, which was coded to take data from a specific screen coordinate, Mr. Erkan said. The bot stopped, though humans monitoring the work detected the problem and collected the right data, he said.\n he said.\nDesigning bots to be resilient means anticipating change, said Jyoti Vazirani, president of Futran Solutions, a digital consulting firm.\nOne way to guard against bot breakdown is to code a bot to use application programming interfaces to interact with the applications of outside companies, rather than hard-coding bots to grab data from a specific spot on a screen, Ms. Vazirani told CIO Journal. Firms will keep APIs up to date, even as they change their underlying software, she said.\nShare this: BOTS ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION Previous : Digital Technology in Operating Room Leads to Safer, More Effective Surgery Next : Why Encryption of Corporate Data Remains a Powerful but Underutilized Tool",
