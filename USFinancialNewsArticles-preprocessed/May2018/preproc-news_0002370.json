(NYSE:ITT) today reported 2018 first-quarter financial results that reflect the company’s continued focus on operational execution and growth strategies to win share in key global end markets. “In the first quarter, ITT delivered record results and double-digit growth across a number of key metrics including orders, revenue, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS,” said CEO and President Denise Ramos. “This performance was driven by our intense focus on optimizing execution, reflected in our strong productivity gains, and on initiatives that are helping us gain share in strategic end markets around the world. In 2018, while we’ll continue to drive results through operational efficiencies, I am excited by the progress we are making in a number of new growth markets and see significant potential for us to accelerate our top-line momentum.”\nRevenue and Orders\nOn a GAAP basis, the company delivered revenue of $689 million, reflecting a 10 percent increase over the prior year, which included a 7 percent benefit from foreign exchange. Organic revenue (defined as total revenue excluding foreign exchange, acquisition and divestiture impacts) increased 2 percent driven by strength in emerging markets and transportation. The revenue results also reflect growth in aftermarket pump services and rotorcraft equipment, offset by declines in short-cycle baseline pumps in Asia. Organic orders grew 4 percent as growth in global auto friction, rotorcraft equipment, defense aftermarket, and electric vehicle connectors more than offset an unfavorable comparison due to a significant prior year oil and gas pump project order. Organic orders grew 8 percent excluding this large prior year oil and gas order.\nSegment Operating Income\nGAAP segment operating income increased 28 percent to $102 million on segment margins of 14.8 percent. Adjusted segment operating income increased 22 percent to $103 million, with double-digit growth delivered by each segment. Adjusted segment operating margins improved 140 basis points to 15.0 percent due to higher volumes, productivity and restructuring benefits, improved performance on pump projects and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher commodity costs and growth investments. GAAP segment operating income benefited from lower restructuring and realignment costs.\nEarnings Per Share\nGAAP EPS increased 119 percent to $1.14. Adjusted EPS, which excludes special items, increased 20 percent to $0.77, reflecting the growth in adjusted segment operating income and favorable impacts from a lower tax rate of 23.8 percent, partially offset by unfavorable environmental and corporate cost comparisons. GAAP EPS benefited by $32 million from an asbestos-related insurance settlement agreement, in addition to favorable tax adjustments, and lower restructuring and realignment costs.\nGuidance\nThe company is raising the mid-point of its previously announced 2018 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by five cents to $3.05 which represents an 18 percent increase compared to the prior year. The updated adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.95 to $3.15 reflects stable market dynamics and improved net operating productivity including restructuring benefits, partially offset by higher commodity costs.\n2018 First-Quarter Business Segment Results\nAll quarterly results are compared with the respective prior-year period.\nMotion Technologies\nTotal revenue increased 19 percent to $342 million, which includes a $37 million favorable impact from foreign exchange and $6 million from the Axtone acquisition. Organic revenue increased 4 percent. Both measures reflect 9.5 percent growth in global OEM automotive brake pads and significant growth in the China high-speed rail market, partially offset by an anticipated decline in European aftermarket due to phasing and destocking by distributors. GAAP operating income increased 13 percent to $62 million, and adjusted segment operating income increased 13 percent to $63 million. Both increases reflect strong volume growth, productivity improvements from the Wolverine business, and favorable impacts from foreign exchange, partially offset by unfavorable aftermarket mix, higher commodity costs, and strategic investments.\nIndustrial Process\nTotal revenue increased 2 percent to $190 million, and organic revenue was flat, reflecting growth in aftermarket service, which was offset by declines in short-cycle baseline pumps primarily in oil & gas in Asia. Project revenue declined 1 percent due to oil and gas, offset by strong petrochemical and general industrial. Total revenue also includes the impact of favorable foreign exchange. GAAP operating income increased 109 percent to $17 million, and adjusted segment operating income increased 57 percent to $17 million. Both measures reflect increased productivity from supply chain actions and restructuring benefits, as well as continued project performance improvements, partially offset by higher strategic investments in efficiency initiatives. The GAAP operating income benefited from lower restructuring and realignment costs.\nConnect and Control Technologies\nTotal revenue increased 3 percent to $158 million, and organic revenue was flat, reflecting strength in commercial aerospace, as well as increased demand for electric vehicle and oil and gas connectors, offset by a decline in defense connectors. Total revenue benefited from the impact of favorable foreign exchange. GAAP operating income increased 38 percent to $23 million and adjusted segment operating income increased 28 percent to $23 million. Both measures reflect improved productivity including restructuring benefits driven by the CCT integration, partially offset by unfavorable material cost headwinds. GAAP operating income benefited from lower realignment costs.\nInvestor Call Today\nITT's senior management will host a conference call for investors today at 9 a.m. ET to review performance and answer questions.

reviews a variety of key performance indicators including revenue, segment operating income and margins, earnings per share, order growth, adjusted free cash flow and backlog, some of which are non-GAAP. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented. These measures provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations and management of assets from period to period. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators for purposes of our reconciliation tables. Organic Revenue and Organic Orders are defined as revenue and orders, excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is estimated using a fixed exchange rate for both the current and prior periods. Management believes that reporting organic revenue and organic orders provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Segment Operating Income and Adjusted Segment Operating Margin are defined as total operating income and segment operating income, adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, asbestos-related costs, restructuring costs, realignment costs, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition-related expenses, and other unusual or infrequent operating items. Special items represent significant charges or credits that impact the current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing operations and performance. Adjusted segment operating margin is defined as adjusted segment operating income divided by total revenue. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Guidance are defined as income from continuing operations attributable to ITT Inc. and income from continuing operations attributable to ITT Inc. per diluted share, adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, asbestos-related costs, restructuring costs, realignment costs, pension settlement and other curtailment costs, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition-related expenses, income tax settlements or adjustments, and other unusual and infrequent non-operating items. Special items represent significant charges or credits, on an after-tax basis, that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing operations and performance. The after-tax basis of each special item is determined using the jurisdictional tax rate of where the expense or benefit occurred. We believe that adjusted income from continuing operations is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, adjusted for cash payments for restructuring costs, realignment actions, net asbestos cash flows and other significant items that impact current results which management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing operations and performance. Due to other financial obligations and commitments, including asbestos, the entire free cash flow may not be available for discretionary purposes. We believe that adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated by our operations.\nITT Inc.
