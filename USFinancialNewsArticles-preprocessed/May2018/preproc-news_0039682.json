(“Select Sands” or the “Company”) (TSXV:SNS) (OTC:SLSDF) today announced operational and financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and the filing of its financial statements and associated management’s discussion and analysis on www.sedar.com . As previously announced, the Company’s financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars to better reflect Select Sands’ operations and to improve investors’ ability to compare the Company’s financial results with other publicly traded silica sand businesses in the United States. Prior to reporting its fourth quarter and full year results, Select Sands’ financial statements were stated in Canadian dollars.\n2018 First Quarter and Recent Operational Highlights\nSold 92,215 tons of frac sand, which was in-line with Select Sands' guidance; Completed construction of a direct private road from the Sandtown mining operations to the main highway that lowers transportation cost due to reduced mileage to the Company’s processing facilities, while promoting Select Sands’ commitment to safety by preventing loaded trucks from traveling on local streets; Enhanced shipping capabilities through increased barging of frac sand with this mode of delivery representing as much as 40% of outbound volumes in recent months; Increased monthly sales throughout the first quarter of a new 30/50 mesh product introduced to the market during the fourth quarter of 2017; Further bolstered liquidity through an increase in the Company’s line of credit from $2.0 million to $5.0 million; On April 4, exercised option to purchase 223 acres of property in Independence County, Arkansas (the “Independence Property”), to serve as a platform to support Select Sands' expansion initiatives; and On May 3, secured a $3.9 million capital expenditure line of credit to fund the near-term expansion project on the Independence property designed to increase production capacity to 1 million tons per year.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights\nIncreased revenue to $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 – more than a 400% increase year-over-year. Revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 were $6.5 million; Grew gross profit approximately 10% to $1.3 million from $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, with first quarter 2018 gross margin of 23.4% representing a 500-basis points improvement from the preceding quarter; Increased operating income to $0.7 million, which was a substantial improvement from the operating loss of $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $0.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017; Reported net income of $0.6 million, or $0.01 earnings per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and net income of $1.3 million for the preceding quarter; Generated adjusted EBITDA (1) of $0.8 million – a significant increase from the adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.5 million reported for the first quarter of 2017 and almost 320% higher than fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $0.2 million; and As of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 million, inventory on hand was $2.1 million, accounts receivable was $4.7 million and working capital was $5.5 million.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is described and reconciled to net loss in the table under “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”.\nZig Vitols, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “As previously announced, during the first quarter we experienced widely-reported rail associated logistics issues at transload locations as well as extensive flooding on the Mississippi River that impacted our barge loading activities. Despite these headwinds, during the month of March we recorded the second highest level of monthly sales volumes since the start of operations at the beginning of 2017, which was a direct result of the tireless efforts of our operations and marketing teams. Partially offsetting lower sales volumes for the first quarter was a 14% average increase in pricing that reflected proactive initiatives implemented in late December and throughout the first quarter, as well as further improvements in both our operational and corporate cost structure.”\nSales Volumes\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Q4 2017 Frac sand 92,191 19,968 113,123 Industrial sand 24 2,720 - Frac and Industrial sand 92,215 22,688 113,123 Other sand & gravel 8,058 6,801 4,288 100,273 29,489 117,411 Supported by recent logistics enhancements, Select Sands expects frac and industrial sales volumes of 130,000 to 150,000 tons for the second quarter of 2018, an increase from its previous guidance of 120,000 to 140,000 tons.\nExpansion Initiatives\nAs previously announced, the Company recently exercised its option to purchase the 223 acres comprising the Independence Property. The property is designed to serve as a platform to support Select Sands' near- and long-term operational and capacity expansion initiatives. The Company recently secured $3.9 million financing for a near-term expansion project on the Independence Property to increase production capacity from 600,000 to 1 million tons per year and is positioned for further growth given the property’s unique characteristics. Highlights and features of the Independence Property include: Sufficient acreage to complete the current expansion, with additional acreage available for future expansion of a new-build facility; Well suited for a future potential build of a 110-150 railcar loop track for efficient and economical loading of finished products; Elevated above the floodplain allowing for uninterrupted operations; Access to natural gas, three-phase electricity and water; and Located next to a large coal power plant and adjacent to a state highway.\nFinancial Summary\nThe following table includes summarized financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017:\nSelect Sands Corp.

See table under \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for reconciliation to net income (loss).\nOutlook\nMr. Vitols concluded, “The significant progress we made during the first quarter in all facets of the business ideally positions us for further growth through the remainder of the 2018. During the second quarter, we expect to produce and deliver product at or near our current capacity rate of approximately 600,000 tons per year and will benefit from a full period of pricing increases that were implemented through the first quarter. We are also making important progress on our adjacent Independence Property, including recently securing financing to support construction of an additional 400,000 tons of production capacity – a 67% increase from current levels. We are now in the process of securing the necessary processing equipment with project completion scheduled for the second half of the year. Our decision to move forward with the expansion is supported by the outlook for continued growing demand for our high-quality silica products and our strategic location within striking distance of key oil and gas basins in the U.S. We look forward to evaluating opportunities for capacity expansion beyond our current plans at the appropriate point in the future.”\nElliott A.

Generally, a non-IFRS financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, cash flows or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance (nor does it have a standardized meanings) under IFRS. In evaluating non-IFRS financial measures, investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and analysts.\nThe Company uses both IFRS and certain non-IFRS measures to assess operational performance and as a component of employee remuneration. Management believes certain non-IFRS measures provide useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate Select Sands' financial performance using the same measures as management. Management believes that, as a result, the investor is afforded greater transparency in assessing the financial performance of the Company. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA: For the Three Months Ended March 31, March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net Income (Loss) $ 574,058 $ (2,333,268) $ 1,305,364 Add Back Depreciation and depletion 225,233 91,622 237,954 Share-based compensation 1,189 1,659,177 73,403 Interest on long-term debt 32,169 - 61,940 Deferred income tax recovery - - (2,356,000) EBITDA $ 832,649 $ (582,469) $ (677,339) Add Back Share of (income) loss of equity investee (2,171) 118,643 26,139 Provision for impairment in Investment in affiliate - - 849,289 Adjusted EBITDA $ 830,478 $ (463,826) $ 198,089\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, loss from flooding at its plant, and gain on sale of fixed assets. Select Sands uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure of its operational performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure as they exclude the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the Company’s day-to-day operations. As compared to net income according to IFRS, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's business, the charges associated with impairments, termination costs or Proposed Transaction costs. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The Company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company’s ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations or as a valuation measurement.\nIndicated Resources Disclosure\nThe Company advises that the production decision on the Sandtown deposit (the Company’s current “Sand Operations”) was not based on a Feasibility Study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, including increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that production will occur as anticipated or that anticipated production costs will be achieved.\nSource: Select Sands Corp.",
