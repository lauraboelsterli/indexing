    "text": "EditorsNote: Tweaks headline, numerous corrections in body\nScooter Gennett had five hits, including a home run, Tony Cruz also homered and the visiting Cincinnati Reds beat the Colorado Rockies 6-5 on Saturday night.\nMichael Lorenzen (1-0) pitched one inning in relief of Tyler Mahle to earn the win, and Jared Hughes survived the ninth for his third save.\nGennett tied a career high for hits, set last year against St. Louis, and used some solid defense to help the Reds secure the win.\nThe Rockies loaded the bases with no outs in the ninth off Hughes, but after a force out at home, Gennett snared David Dahl’s liner near second base and then doubled up Carlos Gonzalez to end the game.\nDahl doubled and had three RBIs, and Charlie Blackmon and starting pitcher Tyler Anderson scored twice each for the Rockies.\nChris Rusin (0-1) faced only two batters but allowed two runs on two hits to take the loss.\nGennett hit the first pitch he saw from Anderson into the Cincinnati bullpen to give the Reds a 1-0 lead in the first. Colorado rallied to take a 2-1 lead in the third on Dahl’s double off the wall in center.\nCruz gave Cincinnati the lead right back in the fourth with his first homer of the season, a two-run shot to left that went an estimated 449 feet.\nThe Rockies took a 4-3 lead in the fifth when Charlie Blackmon had an RBI triple and scored on Dahl’s sacrifice fly.\nCincinnati got to Colorado’s usually reliable bullpen in the seventh. Scott Schebler led off with a single and Billy Hamilton tripled to center off Rusin.\nBryan Shaw relieved Rusin and allowed an RBI single to Jose Peraza to put the Reds ahead 5-4. Gennett’s single put runners on the corners, and Peraza scored on a wild pitch to make it a two-run game.\nNolan Arenado led off the eighth with a double off David Hernandez, moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on Gerardo Parra’s groundout.\n—Field Level Media\n—Field Level Media\n ",
