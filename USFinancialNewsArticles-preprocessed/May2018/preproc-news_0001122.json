(b) Other items includes finance expenses, transaction expenses, dividends on preferred shares, tax benefit, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other income (loss). Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn presenting the Company’s results, management has included and discussed certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, which may be defined and calculated differently by other companies, better explain and enhance the understanding of the Company’s results of operations. However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition to presenting book value per common share determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that the following non-GAAP book value financial measures are key financial indicators for evaluating performance and measuring overall growth: book value per diluted common share, book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends and tangible book value per diluted common share. A reconciliation of book value per common share, a GAAP financial measure, to the non-GAAP book value financial measures has been included below.\nIn addition to presenting net (loss) income (attributable) available to Validus common shareholders determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company believes that showing net operating income available to Validus common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability and enables investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the Company’s results in a manner similar to how management analyzes the Company’s underlying business performance.\nNet operating income available to Validus common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by the addition or subtraction of certain Consolidated Statement of (Loss) Income line items from net (loss) income (attributable) available to Validus common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and measures the performance of the Company’s operations without the influence of gains or losses on investments and foreign currencies and other items as noted in the reconciliation below. The Company excludes these items from its calculation of net operating income available to Validus common shareholders because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to availability of investment market opportunities and other factors. The Company believes these amounts are largely independent of its core underwriting activities and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. The Company believes the reporting of net operating income available to Validus common shareholders enhances the understanding of results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the Company’s core (re)insurance operations. This profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth, adequacy of the Company’s pricing, as well as loss frequency and severity. Over time it is also influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.\nReturn on average equity, a GAAP financial measure, and net operating return on average equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the returns generated on common shareholders’ equity during the period and are presented below.\nValidus Holdings, Ltd.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\nBook Value per Common Share, Book Value per Diluted Common Share and Tangible Book Value per Diluted Common Share\nAs at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share information)\nMarch 31, 2018 Per Share\nEquity Amount Common Shares Amount (a)\nBook value per common share (b) $ 3,501,232 79,329,028 $ 44.14\nNon-GAAP Adjustments: Unvested restricted shares — 2,489,888 Book value per diluted common share (c) 3,501,232 81,818,916 $ 42.79 Goodwill (229,573 ) — Intangible assets (169,168 ) — Tangible book value per diluted common share (c) $ 3,102,491 81,818,916 $ 37.92 Book value per diluted common share (c) $ 42.79 Accumulated dividends 13.46 Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends (c) $ 56.25 December 31, 2017 Per Share\nEquity Amount Common Shares Amount (a)\nBook value per common share (b) $ 3,495,072 79,319,550 $ 44.06 Non-GAAP Adjustments: Unvested restricted shares — 2,503,859 Book value per diluted common share (c) 3,495,072 81,823,409 $ 42.71 Goodwill (229,573 ) — Intangible assets (171,411 ) — Tangible book value per diluted common share (c) $ 3,094,088 81,823,409 $ 37.81 Book value per diluted common share (c) $ 42.71 Accumulated dividends 13.08 Book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends (c) $ 55.79 (a) Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the equity amount by the common shares.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements herein may include projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Validus may make related oral, forward-looking statements on or following the date hereof. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only Validus’ belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside Validus’ control. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements include statements preceded by, followed by or including words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “focused on achieving,” “view,” “target,” “goal,” or “estimate.” Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause Validus’ actual results and financial condition to differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements.\nWe believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events; 2) rating agency actions; 3) adequacy of Validus’ risk management and loss limitation methods; 4) cyclicality of demand and pricing in the insurance and reinsurance markets; 5) statutory or regulatory developments including tax policy, reinsurance and other regulatory matters; 6) Validus’ ability to implement its business strategy during “soft” as well as “hard” markets; 7) adequacy of Validus’ loss reserves; 8) continued availability of capital and financing; 9) retention of key personnel; 10) competition; 11) potential loss of business from one or more major insurance or reinsurance brokers; 12) Validus’ ability to implement, successfully and on a timely basis, complex infrastructure, distribution capabilities, systems, procedures and internal controls, and to develop accurate actuarial data to support the business and regulatory and reporting requirements; 13) general economic and market conditions (including inflation, volatility in the credit and capital markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates); 14) the integration of businesses Validus may acquire or new business ventures Validus may start; 15) the effect on Validus’ investment portfolios of changing financial market conditions including inflation, interest rates, liquidity and other factors; 16) acts of terrorism or outbreak of war; 17) availability of reinsurance and retrocessional coverage; 18) the inability to complete the proposed transaction with AIG (the “proposed transaction”) because, among other reasons, conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied or waived; 19) uncertainty as to the timing of completion of the proposed transaction; 20) the inability to complete the proposed transaction due to the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the proposed transaction, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the transaction; 21) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; 22) risks related to disruption of management’s attention from Validus’ ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction; 23) the effect of the announcement of the proposed transaction on Validus’ relationships with its clients, operating results and business generally; and 24) the outcome of any legal proceedings to the extent initiated against Validus or others following the announcement of the proposed transaction, as well as Validus’ management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors.\nThe foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in Validus’ most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other documents of Validus on file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
