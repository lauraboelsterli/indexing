Iraq requested EBRD membership just under two weeks ago so could happen relatively quickly, while Algeria is another that could also possibly be fast-tracked.\nChakrabarti said last month that the overall expansion plan, including Sub-Saharan Africa, could see the bank’s annual lending jump by almost a third to as much as 13 billion euros ($15.41 billion) from its current average of around 9.5 billion.\n$1 = 0.8439 euros Reporting by Marc Jones, additional writing by Sujata Rao in London; editing by Diane Craft\n ",
