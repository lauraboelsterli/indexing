First quarter 2018 production averaged 127,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and came in above the midpoint of guidance. Capex for the first quarter 2018 was $187 million. First quarter 2018 net cash provided by operating activities of $233 million exceeded capital expenditures by $46 million and first quarter 2018 discretionary cash flow of $290 million exceeded capital expenditures by $103 million. Whiting’s depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) of $16.43 per BOE, oil differentials of $4.31 per barrel (Bbl) and natural gas differentials of $1.48 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) all came in below the low end of guidance. Guidance at the midpoint for such metrics called for $17.50 per BOE, $4.50 per Bbl and $1.50 per Mcf, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter 2018 and subsequent to the quarter, the Company added to its hedges and is now 71% hedged for 2018 and 15% hedged for 2019 as a percentage of March 2018 production with a mix of swaps and collars as detailed later in the press release.\nOperating and Financial Results\nThe following table summarizes the operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, including non-cash charges recorded during those periods:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Production (MBOE/d) (1) 127.05 117.36 Net cash provided by operating activities-MM $ 232.9 $ 80.1 Discretionary cash flow-MM (2) $ 290.5 $ 182.6 Realized price ($/BOE) $ 42.87 $ 35.29 Total operating revenues-MM $ 515.1 $ 371.3 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders-MM (3) $ 15.0 $ (87.0 ) Per basic share (4) $ 0.17 $ (0.96 ) Per diluted share (4) $ 0.16 $ (0.96 ) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders-MM (5) $ 83.7 $ (54.2 ) Per basic share (4) $ 0.92 $ (0.60 ) Per diluted share (4) $ 0.92 $ (0.60 ) (1)\nFirst quarter 2017 includes 8,220 BOE/d from properties that have since been divested. (2)\nA reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to discretionary cash flow is included later in this news release. (3)\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders includes $28 million and $38 million of pre-tax, non-cash derivative losses March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (4)\nAll per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the 2017 period to reflect the Company’s one-for-four reverse stock split in November 2017. (5)\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders is included later in this news release. Bradley J. Holly, Whiting’s President and CEO, commented, “I am pleased we delivered another solid quarter here at Whiting. The team did a great job managing through a heavy winter, allowing us to meet our first quarter goals. For the second quarter in a row, Whiting generated discretionary cash flow that significantly exceeded its capital expenditures. As we move through the second quarter into the summer months, we plan to increase our pace of operations in the Bakken in order to accelerate our growth profile. We remain on target with our $750 million capex budget as the focus shifts from Redtail drilled uncompleted wells to Bakken development in the second half of the year. As you can see in our operational results, our Company remains a leader in implementing optimized completions to unlock the full value of its Bakken assets.”\nOperations Update\nIn the first quarter 2018, total net production for the Company averaged 127,050 BOE/d. The Bakken/Three Forks play in the Williston Basin averaged 103,115 BOE/d. The Redtail Niobrara/Codell play in the DJ Basin averaged 23,300 BOE/d.\nWhiting Successfully Tests Optimized Completion in Southern Hidden Bench Area . Subsequent to the quarter, the Company completed a noteworthy single-well pad in its southern Hidden Bench area of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The Mallow 34-8H targeted the Bakken formation and tested at a 24-hour IP rate of 4,837 BOE/d. The well used Whiting’s new optimized completion philosophy and was fracture-stimulated in 40 stages with 8.7 million pounds of proppant. This well significantly outperformed the test rates on an offsetting three-well pad that was completed in 2013. The offsetting Smokey 2-17-5 pad had an average 24-hour IP rate of 2,647 BOE/d. These wells were completed in the Middle Bakken and Three Forks formations with an average of 30 stages and 3.8 million pounds of proppant.\nThird-Party Gas Processing Outage Impacts Outlook . On April 19, 2018, a third-party gas plant operator informed Whiting it plans to conduct unscheduled gas plant maintenance for the majority of the month of May. The plant processes nearly all of the natural gas produced at Whiting’s Sanish field. The Company does not anticipate the plant outage will have an impact on oil sales. The impact on production is a reduction of 150,000 BOE of gas and NGL sales. The impact on discretionary cash flow is a reduction of approximately $2 million. Whiting has reduced its second quarter 2018 outlook to reflect the impact of this unscheduled maintenance. The Company’s full-year production guidance remains unchanged.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Capital Expenditures and Activity Summary\nDuring the first quarter 2018, Whiting’s capital expenditures totaled $187 million. This includes $6 million for non-operated drilling and completion, $3 million for land and $1 million for facilities. Whiting drilled 24 wells in its Williston Basin area and no wells in its Redtail area during the quarter. The Company put 19 wells on production in the Williston Basin and 6 wells on production at Redtail during the quarter.\nOther Financial and Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s net production and commodity price realizations for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Production\nOil (MMBbl) 7.74 7.30 6 % NGLs (MMBbl) 1.82 1.62 12 % Natural gas (Bcf) 11.27 9.87 14 % Total equivalent (MMBOE) (1) 11.43 10.56 8 % Average sales price\nOil (per Bbl): Price received $ 58.61 $ 43.92 33 % Effect of crude oil hedging (2) (3.21 ) 0.20 Realized price (3) $ 55.40 $ 44.12 26 % Weighted average NYMEX price (per Bbl) (4) $ 62.92 $ 51.87 21 % NGLs (per Bbl): Realized price $ 23.57 $ 17.69 33 % Natural gas (per Mcf): Realized price $ 1.65 $ 2.25 (27 %) Weighted average NYMEX price (per MMBtu) (4) $ 3.13 $ 3.06 2 % (1)\nFirst quarter 2017 includes 8,220 BOE/d from properties that have since been divested.

A summary of Whiting’s outstanding hedges is included later in this news release. (3)\nWhiting’s realized price was reduced by $1.09 per Bbl and $2.21 per Bbl in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, due to the Redtail fixed fee differential deficiency payment. The remaining contract ends in April 2020. (4)\nAverage NYMEX prices weighted for monthly production volumes. First Quarter 2018 and 2017 Costs and Margins\nA summary of production and cash revenues and cash costs on a per BOE basis is as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (per BOE, except production) Production (MMBOE) 11.43 10.56 Sales price, net of hedging $ 42.87 $ 35.29 Lease operating expense 8.10 8.56 Production tax 3.31 3.03 Cash general & administrative 2.35 2.34 Exploration 0.41 0.58 Cash interest expense 3.94 3.83 Cash income tax benefit - (0.18 ) $ 24.76 $ 17.13 Outlook for Second Quarter and Full-Year 2018\nThe following table provides guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018 based on current forecasts, including Whiting’s full-year 2018 capital budget of $750 million:\nGuidance Second Quarter Full Year 2018 2018 Production (MMBOE) 11.0 - 11.5 46.5 - 47.2 Lease operating expense per BOE $ 7.90 - $ 8.50 $ 7.90 - $ 8.30 General and administrative expense per BOE $ 2.70 - $ 3.00 $ 2.60 - $ 2.90 Interest expense per BOE $ 4.00 - $ 4.40 $ 4.00 - $ 4.40 Depreciation, depletion and amortization per BOE $16.00 - $17.00 $16.00 - $17.00 Production taxes (% of sales revenue) 7.7% - 8.3% 7.8% - 8.2% Oil price differentials to NYMEX per Bbl (1) ($4.50) - ($5.50) ($4.50) - ($5.50) Gas price differential to NYMEX per Mcf ($1.50) - ($2.00) ($1.50) - ($2.00) (1) Does not include the effects of NGLs.\nCommodity Derivative Contracts\nWhiting is 71% hedged for 2018 as a percentage of March 2018 production.\nThe following summarizes Whiting’s crude oil hedges as of April 24, 2018:\nWeighted Average As a Percentage of Derivative Hedge Contracted Crude NYMEX Price March 2018 Instrument Period (Bbls per Month) (per Bbl) Oil Production Three-way collars (1) 2018 Sub-Floor/Floor/Ceiling Q2 1,450,000 $37.07 - $47.07 - $57.30 55.8% Q3 1,450,000 $37.07 - $47.07 - $57.30 55.8% Q4 1,450,000 $37.07 - $47.07 - $57.30 55.8% Swaps 2018 Fixed Price Q2 400,000 $61.74 15.4% Q3 400,000 $61.74 15.4% Q4 400,000 $61.74 15.4% Collars 2019 Floor/Ceiling Q1 400,000 $50.00 - $68.44 15.4% Q2 400,000 $50.00 - $68.44 15.4% (1)\nA three-way collar is a combination of options: a sold call, a purchased put and a sold put. The sold call establishes a maximum price (ceiling) we will receive for the volumes under contract. The purchased put establishes a minimum price (floor), unless the market price falls below the sold put (sub-floor), at which point the minimum price would be NYMEX plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable for Common Shareholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities or other income, cash flow or liquidity measures under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Discretionary cash flow is presented because management believes it provides useful information to investors for analysis of the Company’s ability to internally fund acquisitions, exploration and development. Discretionary cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities or other income, cash flow or liquidity measures under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
