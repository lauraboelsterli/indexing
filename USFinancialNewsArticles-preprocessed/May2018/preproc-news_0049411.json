But we have to do that task, since Italy is an important member of the EU,” she added.\nGermany’s DIHK Chambers of Industries and Commerce said on Monday that German businesses were relieved that eurosceptics were not taking power in Italy, the third biggest economy in the 19-member euro zone after Germany and France.\nVolker Treier, foreign trade chief at the DIHK, said the populist parties’ decision meant their “prohibitively expensive Italian coalition agreement” was off the table for now.\n“That is a relief for German businesses,” he said, adding that Italy would overtake Britain this year as Germany’s fifth biggest trading partner.\nIn Berlin, a government spokesman stressed Germany’s respect for Italian democracy and political institutions and said Berlin hoped for a stable government in Italy.\nIn Brussels, Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth said Berlin hoped that Italy would form a stable and pro-European government soon.
