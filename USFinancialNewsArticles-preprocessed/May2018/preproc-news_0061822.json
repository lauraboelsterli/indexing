Odor lined a 2-2 pitch into the left field corner, clearing the bases.\nRight-hander Chasen Bradford relieved Diaz and allowed a run-scoring double to Guzman.\nThe Mariners tied it in the eighth off right-hander Chris Martin.\nWith one out, Ben Gamel singled to left and Mike Zunino was hit by a pitch. Pinch hitter Guillermo Heredia singled to right to load the bases. Jean Segura hit a high chopper to shortstop Profar, whose only play was to first base. That allowed Gamel to score to make it 5-5.\nLeft-hander Alex Claudio (4-2) came on to face Denard Span and got him to ground out to first base to end the inning.\nChoo hit a solo homer in the first inning off former teammate Felix Hernandez.\nHernandez allowed five runs on six hits in five innings. He walked two and struck out four.\nThe 32-year-old veteran pushed his career strikeout total to 2,397, moving him past Sandy Koufax and into a tie with Kevin Brown for 44th place on the all-time list.\nRangers right-hander Austin Bibens-Dirkx allowed four runs on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings.\nTrailing 4-2, the Rangers took the lead with three runs in the sixth inning. the first two runs came home on a wild pitch and a passed before Guzman lined a single to center to score Gallo and put Texas up 5-4.\nSegura finished with three hits while Span, Ryon Healy and Nelson Cruz had two hits apiece for Seattle.\nNomar Mazara and Kiner-Falefa each had two hits for Texas.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
