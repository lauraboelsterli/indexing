    "text": "BOYNTON BEACH, Fla., May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Puradyn Filter Technologies Incorporated (OTCQB:PFTI) announced today that its Board of Directors has appointed Ed Vittoria as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Vittoria succeeds Joseph V. Vittoria who has been Chairman of the Board and CEO since 2006. Mr. Joseph Vittoria has been appointed Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Ed Vittoria was also appointed as a member of our Board of Directors to fill an existing vacancy.\n“I am very pleased that Ed has accepted the CEO role. He has been advising Puradyn for the past six months, and his fresh perspective on marketing, strategy and new business development has been well received by the whole Puradyn team as well as our key customers,” said Joseph Vittoria. “We just reported one of our best quarters in years thanks to the improvement in market conditions within our key customer segments and expanded awareness of the savings that are achievable by using our filtration systems. Ed’s decision to join Puradyn is a positive indication that we’re on the right track to growing the business and improving our financial performance.”\n“I am looking forward to contributing to Puradyn’s future success,” said Ed Vittoria. “I am confident that we will continue the positive momentum from the recent quarter because I have heard first hand from existing customers about how much they have saved by using Puradyn’s systems and how they regret not installing them sooner. Any company seeking to extend the lives of their engines while also reducing their frequency of oil changes will benefit from Puradyn’s patented technology.”\nEd Vittoria brings 25 years of corporate marketing, business development and strategic leadership to Puradyn. His experience began with over a dozen years at American Express where he managed marketing relationships with Hilton, American Airlines and other travel leaders and then went on to develop and launch the OPEN Savings program for small business cardmembers. In 2006, Ed joined Starwood Hotels & Resorts to lead their Luxury Collection brand, the third largest luxury hotel brand in the world. Seeking a more entrepreneurial opportunity, Ed joined Steve Case’s payments start-up, Revolution Money, where he led customer acquisition and branding. After Revolution Money was purchased by American Express, Ed led New Business Development for Time Inc.’s Synapse division until 2012 when he joined Simon Property Group, the leading shopping center owner and operator, where he developed and launched a first of its kind loyalty program for mall shoppers. Ed holds a B.A. in Economics from Yale University.\nAbout Puradyn Filter Technologies ( www.puradyn.com )\nPuradyn designs, manufactures and markets pura DYN ® Oil Filtration Systems, the most effective bypass oil filtration products available for internal combustion engines, transmissions and hydraulic applications.
