    "text": "MILAN, May 16 (Reuters) - Milan’s prosecutor general is not opposed to the lifting of a ban on former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi barring him from holding public office, judicial sources said on Wednesday.\nEarlier this month a Milan court lifted the ban, meaning the veteran centre-right leader could run to be prime minister in the next national election.\nBerlusconi, whose family controls broadcaster Mediaset , was convicted of tax fraud in 2013, triggering a bar on his holding any elected position for six years.
