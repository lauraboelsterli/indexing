    "text": "TOKYO, SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS CO., LTD. (the \"Company\") today announced consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (this \"Fiscal Year\").\nThe Company is listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with the stock code \"9684,\" and prepares its financial statements according to the Japan GAAP.\nKey Figures\n(millions of yen, except percentages and per share data)\nFY ended 3/18\nFY ended 3/17\nYoY change\nNet sales\n250,394\n256,824\n-2.5%\nOperating income\n38,176\n31,295\n+22.0%\nOrdinary income\n36,124\n31,128\n+16.0%\nProfit attributable to owners of parent\n25,821\n20,039\n+28.9%\nEPS, basic\n215.33 yen\n164.20 yen\n-\nFor additional information, please refer to the full-length Consolidated Financial Results document at: http://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/18q4earnings.pdf , or the Company's IR website: http://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/ .\nIn the Digital Entertainment segment for this Fiscal Year, where \"DRAGON QUEST XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age,\" the latest title of the \"DRAGON QUEST\" series and \"FINAL FANTASY XII THE ZODIAC AGE\" were launched, a decrease in the number of blockbuster titles resulted in net sales decline, as compared to the prior fiscal year. On the other hand, strong high-margin download sales of previously released catalogue titles such as \"NieR: Automata\" have resulted in an increase of operating income, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn the smart devices and PC browser area, our established lineup of popular games such as \"FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,\" \"HOSHI NO DRAGON QUEST,\" \"DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS SUPER LIGHT\" and \"KINGDOM HEARTS Union χ\" is continuing to show strong performances globally, and an increase of royalty income pushed both net sales and operating income, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn the area of massively multiplayer online role playing games, revenues from the latest expansions of \"FINAL FANTASY XIV\" and \"DRAGON QUEST X\" led to an increase in the number of paying subscribers and disk sales, which resulted in an increase of net sale and operating income, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn the Amusement segment, operation of the amusement facilities has been showing steady performance, while new amusement machine releases decreased, which led to the decline in this segment's net sales and operating income, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn the Publication segment, sales of comic books continues strong, in particular, the digital format sales increased, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn the Merchandising segment, sales and licensing performed strongly thanks to character goods and soundtracks derived from the Group's own IPs.\nAbout Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd.\nSquare Enix Holdings Co., Ltd. with headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, is the holding company leading the group of Square Enix companies (the \"Square Enix Group\") with a diverse range of content and service businesses.
