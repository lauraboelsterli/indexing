The Company’s corporate operations are not considered an operating segment and the Company does not allocate corporate expense for management and administrative services or income and expense related to other corporate activity to its operating segment to measure its operations. The Company’s management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to measure segment performance.\nEBITDA is a widely used non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance. It is presented as supplemental information that the Company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company’s core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back net interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization to net income. EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute either for net income, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or cash flow, or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA prior to non-cash stock compensation expense and non-recurring items shown above.\nFollowing is a non-GAAP, unaudited reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA of the operating segment to loss from operations before income taxes (in thousands):\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of operating segment $ 334 $ 172 Corporate expenses (1) (431 ) (380 ) Adjusted EBITDA (loss) (97 ) (208 ) Other operating expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization (112 ) (102 ) Equity based compensation (43 ) (54 ) Transaction costs\n(132 ) - Operating loss (384 ) (364 ) Non- operating income (expense):\nInterest expense and other loss, net (20 ) (26 ) Loss from operations before income taxes $ (404 ) $ (390 ) Following is a summary of the Company's total assets (in thousands):\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Operating segment $ 6,152 $ 6,160 Corporate (2) 5,634 6,286 $ 11,786 $ 12,446 (1) Consists primarily of compensation related expenses, facility costs and professional fees (2) Consists principally of cash and cash equivalents WRIGHT INVESTORS' SERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues Investment management services $ 570 $ 492 Other investment advisory services 603 669 Financial research and related data 216 183 1,389 1,344 Expenses Compensation and benefits 859 917 Other operating 782 791 Transaction costs 132 - 1,773 1,708 Operating loss (384 ) (364 ) Interest expense and other loss, net (20 ) (26 ) Loss before income taxes (404 ) (390 ) Income tax expense (13 ) (12 ) Net loss $ (417 ) $ (402 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.02 ) $ (0.02 )\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006073/en/\nWright Investors’ Service Holdings, Inc.\nIra J.
