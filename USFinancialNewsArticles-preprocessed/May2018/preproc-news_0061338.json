    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire -- South American Gold Corp (OTC:SAGD) provided a market update regarding the two cannabis related acquisition targets with whom SAGD has been negotiating. With both acquisition targets having existing operations with current revenue, and both having business models that are centered around value-added products within the cannabis sector, the Company has decided to pursue both opportunities with the hopes of securing financing and stock to complete both transactions.\nGary Austin, director of South American Gold Corp, commented on this news, “Our goal is to complete a transaction that will enable us to begin creating strong revenue with little out of pocket money on the front end. One of our targets has already agreed in principal with our offer and we are working on the final terms to move towards a final agreement. Based on recent conversations with the principals we are hopeful that we will close on this first acquisition in June. The second opportunity is still in negotiations, but we feel very confident we are getting close to a solution that makes sense for everyone involved.”\nMr. Austin continued, “Our Company is sitting on a wealth of very strong technology assets that are built around the cannabis industry. Our board feels strongly that we can unlock the full potential of those assets by combining them with the strength and longevity of a couple of very strong tangible products that support the same sector. We have made that our goal and we are moving aggressively to complete that goal. We have a good team in place and I feel encouraged that we will get the job done.”\nAbout SAGD : South American Gold Corp (SAGD) is an operational management company focused on enhancing shareholder value by acquiring and operating under valued cannabis and tech assets.\nCorporate Website: www.sagdcorp.co\nMedia contact: info@sagdcorp.co\nGeneral contact: info@sagdcorp.co\nDisclaimer : This release contains forward-looking statements that are based on beliefs of South American Gold Corp. management and reflect South American Gold Corp.'s current expectations as contemplated under section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
