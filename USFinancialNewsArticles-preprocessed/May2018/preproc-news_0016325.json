    "text": "DUBLIN, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nRealized first quarter 2018 GAAP (\"reported\") net sales of $1.2 billion, reported net income of $81 million compared to $72 million last year, an increase of 12.9%, and reported diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.57 compared to $0.50 last year, an increase of 14.6% Delivered first quarter adjusted net income of $178 million compared to $150 million last year, an increase of 18.8%, and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.26 compared to $1.05 last year, an increase of 20.6% CHC Americas segment achieved first quarter net sales of $602 million, an increase of 3.2% versus last year, or growth of 3.0% on a constant currency basis CHC International segment delivered first quarter net sales of $401 million, an increase of 7.0% versus last year; net sales grew 1.4% versus last year on a constant currency basis, excluding $22 million in net sales from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017 RX segment realized first quarter net sales of $214 million and reported operating margin of 28.9%, while delivering an adjusted operating margin of 39.9% First quarter cash flow from operations was $172 million, representing nearly 100% conversion to adjusted net income Utilized balance sheet flexibility to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares for approximately $108 million in the quarter Perrigo Board member Rolf A. Classon appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors; Laurie Brlas to continue to serve as Independent Director; see Corporate Governance section below for detail\nGuidance\nThe Company expects calendar year 2018 reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.30; reconfirms calendar year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.05 to $5.45; see Guidance section below for detail\nPerrigo Company plc (NYSE; TASE: PRGO) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAdditional first quarter reported results: Reported operating margin in the CHC Americas segment was 18.8%.\nPerrigo President and CEO, Uwe Roehrhoff commented, \"Our unique business model once again delivered results in challenging end markets evidenced by year-over-year first quarter adjusted net income growth of 18.8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 20.6%. The CHC Americas team drove net sales growth of 3.0% on a constant currency basis with adjusted operating margin of 21.4% highlighted by a relatively strong cough cold season in the U.S. Net sales in the CHC International segment grew 1.4% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding $22 million in net sales from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017, and achieved strong operating results. Our RX Pharmaceuticals (\"RX\") segment continues to perform in a challenging market. First quarter net sales in RX were slightly lower than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 39.9% as R&D investments increased versus last year. Finally, our durable platforms once again delivered strong cash flow conversion to adjusted net income, which we utilized to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares in the quarter.\"\nMr. Roehrhoff continued, \"We remain focused on delivering our consolidated 2018 net sales and adjusted EPS guidance ranges previously communicated. Our consumer-facing businesses are on track to meet their financial goals amid soft consumer trends and we have increased our adjusted operating margin expectation in the CHC International segment due to ongoing operational initiatives. Balanced against this increase, we have adjusted our expectations for the RX segment due primarily to a supply disruption of a key new product, which we are working to bring back to market in the fourth quarter of this year. We are making progress with our value creation roadmap and look forward to discussing the conclusions later this year.\"\nRefer to Tables I - VI at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information.

Net sales grew 1.6% compared to the prior year excluding the year-over-year effect of: 1) $22 million in net sales from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017 in the CHC International segment, 2) net sales from the divested Israel API business of $19 million, and 3) favorable foreign currency movements of $45 million.\nReported net income was $81 million, or $0.57 per diluted share versus net income of $72 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the prior year. Excluding charges as outlined in Table I, first quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $178 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, versus adjusted net income of $150 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nSegment Results\nConsumer Healthcare Americas (\"CHCA\") Segment\n(in millions, unaudited)\n(see the attached Tables I - VI for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nYoY\nConstant\nCurrency\n3/31/2018\n4/1/2017\n% change\n% Change\nReported Net Sales\n$602\n$583\n3.2%\n3.0%\nReported Gross Profit\n$200\n$188\n6.4%\nReported Gross Margin\n33.3%\n32.3%\n100 bps\nReported Operating Income\n$113\n$75\n50.7%\nReported Operating Margin\n18.8%\n12.9%\n590 bps\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$211\n$201\n5.0%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n35.1%\n34.5%\n60 bps\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$129\n$118\n9.6%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n21.4%\n20.2%\n120 bps\nFirst quarter net sales grew 3.0% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher net sales in the infant nutrition, analgesics and cough cold categories compared to the prior year. These positive drivers, and new product sales of $11 million, were partially offset by lower net sales in the animal health category and discontinued products of $2 million.\nThe CHCA segment first quarter reported gross profit margin was 33.3%. Adjusted gross profit margin was 35.1%, 60 basis points higher than the prior year driven by stronger volumes in the quarter.\nReported first quarter operating margin was 18.8%. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, 120 bps greater than the prior year due to gross margin flow through and lower operating expenses as a percentage to net sales.\nConsumer Healthcare International (\"CHCI\") Segment\n(in millions, unaudited)\n(see the attached Tables I - VI for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nYoY\nConstant\nCurrency\n3/31/2018\n4/1/2017\n% change\n% Change\nReported Net Sales\n$401\n$375\n7.0%\n(4.5)%\nReported Gross Profit\n$195\n$170\n14.8%\nReported Gross Margin\n48.5%\n45.2%\n330 bps\nReported Operating Income\n$15\n$0\nNM\nReported Operating Margin\n3.7%\n0.1%\n360 bps\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$217\n$190\n14.3%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n54.2%\n50.7%\n350 bps\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$68\n$52\n32.2%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n17.0%\n13.8%\n320 bps\nReported net sales increased 7.0% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Excluding $22 million in net sales from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017, and favorable foreign currency movements of $43 million, net sales grew 1.4% driven by new product sales of $20 million. Partially offsetting these favorable effects were lower net sales in the cough cold, personal care and analgesics categories in addition to discontinued products of $6 million.\nFirst quarter reported gross margin was a strong 48.5%. Adjusted gross margin increased 350 bps over the previous year to a record 54.2%, driven by improved product mix, new product launches and the continued benefit of insourcing initiatives.\nReported operating margin was 3.7%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 320 bps to 17.0% due to higher gross margin contribution and the timing of growth investments.\nPrescription Pharmaceuticals (\"RX\") Segment\n(in millions, unaudited)\n(see the attached Tables I - VI for reconciliation to GAAP numbers)\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nFirst Quarter\nEnded\nYoY\nConstant\nCurrency\n3/31/2018\n4/1/2017\n% change\n% Change\nReported Net Sales\n$214\n$217\n(1.5)%\n(1.6)%\nReported Gross Profit\n$98\n$96\n1.6%\nReported Gross Margin\n45.7%\n44.3%\n140 bps\nReported Operating Income\n$62\n$88\n(29.8)%\nReported Operating Margin\n28.9%\n40.5%\n(1160) bps\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$118\n$118\n0.1%\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n55.3%\n54.4%\n90 bps\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$86\n$89\n(4.1)%\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n39.9%\n41.0%\n(110) bps\nReported net sales in the first quarter were $214 million compared to $217 million last year. New product sales of $10 million were offset by lower net sales of existing products of $12 million, due primarily to price erosion, which was in line with expectations. New product sales were lower than expected due to a supply disruption of a key new product.\nReported gross margin was 45.7%. Adjusted gross margin was 55.3%, 90 bps higher than the previous year driven by product mix.\nReported operating margin was 28.9%. Adjusted operating margin was 39.9% compared to 41.0% in the prior year, due primarily to increased R&D investments.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Perrigo Board of Directors appointed Rolf A. Classon, who has served on Perrigo's Board since May 2017, as Chairman of the Board, effective May 7, 2018.

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential\" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases; future impairment charges; the success of management transition; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; potential third-party claims and litigation, including litigation relating to the Company's restatement of previously-filed financial information; potential impacts of ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; resolution of uncertain tax positions; the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation and healthcare policy; general economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the consummation of announced acquisitions or dispositions and the success of such transactions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other initiatives. In addition, the Company may identify new, or be unable to remediate previously identified, material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may incur additional tax liabilities in respect of 2016 or be found to have breached certain provisions of Irish company law in connection with the Company's restatement of previously filed financial statements, which may result in additional expenses and penalties. These and other important factors, including those discussed under \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations for net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales excluding sales attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution and Russian businesses, as well as adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating cash flow, guidance for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income within this press release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for these non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.\nThe Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.\nNon-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted operating cash flows and adjusted diluted shares are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company discloses adjusted net sales, which excludes operating results attributable to held-for-sale businesses, the European distribution and Russian businesses in order to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business. In addition, the Company discloses net sales growth and adjusted net sales growth on a constant currency basis to provide information about sales of the Company's continuing business excluding the exogenous impact of foreign exchange. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past, present and future underlying operating results, and also facilitate comparison of the Company's operating performance to the operating performance of its competitors.\nA copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is
