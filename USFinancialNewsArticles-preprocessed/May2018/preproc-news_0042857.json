Wiederhold also serves as executive chairman at Couchbase, where he held the title of chief executive officer from 2010 to 2017.\n“It’s exciting to work with a company as promising as Alluxio with its strong community of developers and already-impressive roster of enterprise customers around the world,” Wiederhold said. “I look forward to working closely with CEO Haoyuan Li and his executive team as they expand their role in the big data ecosystem and help enterprises access all of their data for insight and competitive advantage. It’s a huge opportunity for our customers as they leverage a virtual data layer to simplify their infrastructure and drive innovations in analytics and machine learning.”\n“Alluxio is at an inflection point after two years of amazing growth supporting the scaling demands and data access requirements of some of the largest businesses in Europe, Asia and North America,” said Haoyuan Li, CEO and co-founder of Alluxio. “Bob is a great addition to our team and his proven track record of success in open source and in enterprise technology will guide us forward as we grow into a world leader in enterprise software.”\nPrior to Couchbase, Wiederhold was chairman, CEO and president of Transitive Corporation, the worldwide leader in cross-platform virtualization with over 20 million users before IBM acquired the company in 2008.
