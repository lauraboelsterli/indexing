    "text": "(Adds details, shares)\nMay 29 (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc reported quarterly revenue on Tuesday that topped analysts' expectations as demand for its cloud-based sales and marketing software continues to fuel rapid growth.\nThe San Francisco-based company's shares rose 1.3 percent in trading after the bell.\nSalesforce has been a key beneficiary of so-called digital transformations - a growing trend in which companies move their operations onto lower cost cloud-based services that offer more scalability.\nRevenue from the company's flagship product, Sales Cloud, rose 16.3 percent to $965 million.\nThe company's unearned revenue - a key metric used to measure future business for subscription-based software vendors - rose 25 percent to $6.20 billion.\nAnalysts on average expected $6.27 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.\nSalesforce accounted for about 20 percent of the 2017 global customer relationship management software market, up from 18.1 percent in 2016, according to research firm IDC.\nOracle is the company's closest rival with 7.1 percent of the market. However, Microsoft's Dynamics enterprise software is emerging as a major competitor after nearly tripling its market share to 4 percent in 2017.\nSalesforce reported net income of $344 million, or 46 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30, compared with $1 million, or breakeven per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 25.4 percent to $3.01 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
