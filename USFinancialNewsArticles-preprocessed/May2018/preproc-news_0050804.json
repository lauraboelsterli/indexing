    "text": "An exchange-traded fund tracking South Korean stocks dropped more than 2.5 percent Thursday after President Donald Trump called off a nuclear summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\nThe iShares MSCI South Korea Capped ETF, the EWY, traded was on pace for its first negative day in four sessions. The ETF tracks stocks such as Hyundai Motor, LG, Lotte and Samsung Electronics.\nInvestors are concerned renewed geopolitical tension in the region could weigh on economic activity.\nU.S. stocks extended losses after the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly falling 150 points.",
