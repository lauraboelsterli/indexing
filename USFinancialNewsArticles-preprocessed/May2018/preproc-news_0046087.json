    "text": "Easing U.S.-China trade tensions will likely help chipmakers' stocks the most.\nAmong companies in the S&P 500, Skyworks Solutions , Qualcomm , Qorvo , Broadcom and Micron have the highest percentage of revenue generated from China, according to FactSet.\nShares of Skyworks and Qorvo traded more than 1.5 percent higher Monday morning. Qualcomm and Broadcom gained more than 1 percent.\nShares of Micron spiked more than 4 percent after the company raised guidance for its fiscal third quarter, which ends May 31. Micron now sees revenue of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, up from prior guidance of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.\nOver the weekend, the U.S. and China agreed to \"substantially reduce\" the U.S. trade deficit in goods with China and work toward \"meaningful increases\" in American agriculture and energy exports. The Trump administration is also holding off on plans to impose tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese imports, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nshow chapters Cycles to be more muted for chip names, says analyst 11:44 AM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 04:30 Other U.S. technology companies generate significant revenues from China, including Apple and Intel . As a result, roughly $100 billion to $150 billion in annual revenue is at stake if U.S. tensions with China increase, according to estimates from Jefferies analysts.\nApple traded 1.5 percent higher Monday, while Intel gained more than 2 percent amid broad gains in the major U.S. stock indexes.\nHowever, the weekend reprieve in the trade dispute lacked specifics on how much China will import from the U.S. \"If things aren't fixed and we don't get what we want, the president can always put the tariffs back on,\" Mnuchin said Monday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\"\nâ€” CNBC's Tae Kim contributed to this report.",
