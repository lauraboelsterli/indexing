    "text": "Q1 2018 Revenues of $120.5 Million; Construction Revenues of $96.8 Million\nConference Call Scheduled for 9:00am ET Wednesday May 16, 2018\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Total revenues increased 4.7% versus the prior year period to $120.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Construction segment revenue of $96.8 million grew 5.8% from the prior year period while Service segment revenues were flat at $23.7 million.\nOther key financial highlights of the quarter included:\nGross margin was 11.0% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 11.9% in the first quarter of the prior year. During the first quarter of 2018, gross profit was negatively impacted by $4.6 million of project-related write-downs. Excluding the impact of those write-downs, gross margin would have been 15.9%. Construction revenue growth of 5.8% versus the same quarter in 2017 was primarily the result of strong performances in the Ohio, New England, Harper and Eastern Pennsylvania regions, offset by declines in the Michigan and Western Pennsylvania regions. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses totaled $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $14.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expense was 13.0% in the first quarter of 2018, versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2017. First Quarter 2018 SG&A included approximately $0.5 million of stock compensation expense that was not incurred in the prior year quarter. Net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $(2.4) million, compared with $(1.2) million for the same quarter in 2017. Construction operations contributed 80.3% of total revenue, while Service operations contributed 19.7%. Aggregate backlog at March 31, 2018 was $452.5 million, compared with $461.4 million at December 31, 2017. Current backlog consists of $38.6 million of Service work and $413.9 million of Construction work. Limbach expects approximately $291.0 million of current, aggregate backlog to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2018. Combined Construction and Service sales pipeline, a measure of opportunities the Company is tracking, continues to be robust and has grown to $3.4 billion. The Company is increasing 2018 revenue guidance by $10 million to a range from $520 million to $540 million; Adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged.\nManagement Commentary\nCharlie Bacon, CEO of Limbach, commented, “Our 2018 sales effort is off to a great start as we have 94% of our budgeted sales for the year either in firm backlog or with firm commitments. We also have a number of projects that we are pursuing and which we feel our odds of winning are very good. Our Limbach Engineering and Design Services (“LEDS”) center in Orlando continues to be a key differentiator for us as 34% of our secured Construction segment opportunities are ‘Design-Build’ work. With that in mind, I am pleased to note that we are increasing our revenue guidance for the year.\nThe macroeconomic backdrop for the non-residential construction industry continues to be very favorable, with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lending further support to corporate capital expenditure budgets. We monitor a variety of key indicators, including the American Institute of Architects (“AIA”) billing index, along with research groups such as FMI and Dodge Analytics. All continue to support the growth outlook we are seeing in the field.”\nMr. Bacon continued, “Labor shortages remain a hot-button issue for our industry and we are being as proactive as we can to remain ahead of the curve. An example of the impact labor can have can be seen in the write-downs we were forced to take in the quarter. As a whole, we had several significant projects concurrently underway within the Mid-Atlantic region with high craft labor requirements all hitting the business at once, which put pressure on our management and craft worker resources. In two cases, project timelines were negatively impacted by forces out of our control, such as the late delivery of structural steel. Given the extreme tight labor situation in the Mid-Atlantic geography, adding extra workers to get our share of the project done on time increased our costs. To address these issues, we are making investments in our employee training and advancement programs and expanding our modular construction initiative to reduce onsite labor, which we believe will serve Limbach well in the years ahead.”\nFirst Quarter Summary\nRevenues\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues of $120.5 million were up 4.7% versus $115.2 million for the prior year period, driven by Construction segment growth of 5.8%. Service segment revenues were flat year over year at $23.7 million due to revenue growth in the Mid-Atlantic and Eastern Pennsylvania regions that was more than offset by revenue decreases in the Michigan and New England regions, primarily due to two projects that were completed since the first quarter of 2017. Construction operations accounted for 80.3% of revenues while Service operations provided the remaining 19.7%.\nGross Margin\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 11%, compared with 11.9% in the year ago quarter. During the first quarter of 2018 the Company incurred write-downs of approximately $4.6 million on six jobs, due to revisions in contract estimates. Excluding the write-downs, gross margin would have been 15.9%, which was level with the fourth quarter of 2017. On a dollar basis, gross profit in the first quarter was $13.3 million, compared with $13.8 million for the prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nFirst quarter of 2018 SG&A expense was $15.7 million, compared to $14.6 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of total revenue, first quarter 2018 SG&A accounted for 13.0% compared with 12.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Year over year growth in SG&A, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was driven by higher salary and benefit expense as the Company continued to add staff. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018 the Company incurred approximately $0.5 million of stock compensation expense that was not present in the year ago quarter.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $(2.4) million, compared with a net loss of $(1.2) million in the prior year period, as project write-downs negatively impacted profitability. The Company also incurred a charge of $2.2 million due to the premium paid on the redemption of its previously-outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock. As a result, Net loss attributable to Limbach Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $(4.5) million, or $(0.60) per diluted loss per share of common stock.\nBacklog\nAggregate backlog at March 31, 2018 was $452.5 million, a decrease of 1.9% compared with $461.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Company also has commitments for $143.8 million of Construction work which has not yet been recorded as backlog. Within the aggregate backlog figures, Construction backlog at March 31, 2018 was $413.9 million, a decrease of 2.9% from $426.7 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, Service backlog at March 31, 2018 was $38.6 million compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company expects approximately $291.0 million of total backlog to be converted to revenues within the current fiscal year.\nBalance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had current assets of $161.6 million and current liabilities of $129.2 million, representing a current ratio of 1.25x. Working capital was $32.4 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2017. Long-term debt was $35.2 million at March 31, 2018, up from $20.6 million at December 31, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is increasing its previously announced revenue guidance for 2018 while keeping Adjusted EBITDA guidance unchanged, summarized in the table below.\nFY 2018 Estimates Current Previous Revenues $520 - $540 million $510 - $530 million Adjusted EBITDA $20 - $24 million $20 - $24 million With respect to projected fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, a quantitative reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to taxes and other items, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We expect the variability of this item to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nConference Call Details\nDate: Wednesday, May 16, 2018 Time: 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time Participant Dial-In Numbers: Domestic callers: (866) 604-1698 International callers: (201) 389-0844 Access by Webcast\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of LMB’s website at www.limbachinc.com or by clicking on the conference call link: http://limbachinc.equisolvewebcast.com/q1-2018 .

The key measure is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of, when applicable, other non-cash items or expenses that are unusual or non-recurring that we believe do not reflect our core operating results. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. We understand that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. When assessing our operating performance, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, the results presented by Adjusted EBITDA cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, is provided below.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2,424 ) $ (1,214 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 1,371 2,646 Interest expense 769 454 Non-cash Stock-based compensation expense 467 0 Income tax benefit (1,043 ) (1,083 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (860 ) $ 803 About Limbach\nLimbach Holdings, Inc. is an integrated building systems provider – managing all components of mechanical, electrical, plumbing and control systems, from system design and construction through performance and maintenance.
