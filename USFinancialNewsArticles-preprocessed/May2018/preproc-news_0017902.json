    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s upper house of parliament on Tuesday inflicted another defeat on Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, voting in favour of staying in the European Union’s single market.\nThe House of Lords voted 245 to 218 in favour of the amendment to the government’s key Brexit blueprint that will sever political, financial and legal ties with the EU.\nThe amendment is opposed by the government and can potentially be overturned in parliament’s lower chamber, where May has a slim majority.\nReporting by Andrew MacAskill, editing by David Milliken\n ",
