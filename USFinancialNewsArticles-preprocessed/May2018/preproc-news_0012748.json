The Company’s reported results include $3.0 million of costs associated with securing the new revolving credit facility and redemption of the Company’s 5.5% high-yield notes, a net $2.3 million of one-time costs associated with the restructuring of the Company's SmartStyle ® salon portfolio and $1.3 million of other discrete costs, partially offset by $1.4 million of related tax benefits. Excluding discrete items, and the losses from discontinued operations, the Company reported third quarter 2018 as adjusted net income of $9.9 million, or $0.21 earnings per diluted share versus net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.04 earnings per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nTotal revenue in the quarter of $300.8 million decreased $12.7 million, or 4.0%, year-over-year driven primarily by the closure of 597 non-performing SmartStyle salons and the conversion of 376 company-owned salons to franchised locations, partially offset by positive same-store sales comps of 1.6%. Reported revenue includes $2.1 million of benefit related to discounted close-out product sales as part of the closure of the 597 non-performing SmartStyle salons. Excluding this one-time benefit, as adjusted sales were $298.7 million and related same-store sales comps were approximately 0.9%. Management estimates the shift of the Easter holiday benefited third quarter same-store sales comps by 90 basis points.\nThird quarter EBITDA of $6.6 million increased $5.5 million versus the same period last year. As a percentage of sales, the Company's third quarter EBITDA margin rate of 2.2% compares to 0.4% in the third quarter last year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million was 7.0% of adjusted sales and was $2.9 million, or 16.0% favorable year-over-year. Last year's third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin rate was 5.7%.\nOn a full year basis, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $54.9 million, or $1.17 per diluted share as compared to net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations was $17.5 million, an increase of $11.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $62.9 million increased $5.1 million, or 8.8% versus the same period last year.\nHugh Sawyer, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased to report continued progress in our multi-year turnaround strategy, including improvement in both our quarterly and year-over-year adjusted EBITDA results. Mr. Sawyer continued, \"During a busy quarter we closed on our new five-year revolving credit facility, accelerated the growth of our franchise platform and launched an industry-exclusive sponsorship of Major League Baseball through our Supercuts brand. We also began to consider options to further expand our franchise concept within our Supercuts company-owned salon portfolio where we believe it may support our strategy and potentially improve shareholder value.\"\nRestructuring of Company-Owned SmartStyle ® Portfolio\nIn January 2018, the Company closed 597 non-performing Company-owned SmartStyle ® salons. The 597 non-performing salons generated negative cash flow of approximately $15 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The action delivered on the Company's commitment to restructure its salon portfolio to improve shareholder value and position the Company for long-term growth. The Company anticipates this action will allow the Company to reallocate capital and human resources to strategically grow its remaining SmartStyle ® salons with creative new offerings.\nThird Quarter Segment Results\nCompany-Owned Salons\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(Decrease)\nIncrease\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(Decrease)\nIncrease\n(Dollars in millions) (1) 2018 2017 (2) 2018 2017 (2) Total Revenue, as Adjusted $ 269.8 $ 294.3 (8.3 )% $ 838.6 $ 890.0 (5.8 )% Same-Store Sales Comps, as Adjusted 0.9 % (1.7 )% 260 bps 0.2 % (1.3 )% 150 bps Year-over-Year Ticket change 3.1 % 3.1 % Year-over-Year Traffic change (2.2 )% (2.9 )% Gross Profit, as Adjusted(3) 115.2 115.8 (0.5 )% 357.3 355.3 0.6 % as a percent of revenue, as adjusted\n42.7 % 39.4 % 330 bps 42.6 % 39.9 % 270 bps EBITDA, as Adjusted 28.7 27.7 3.6 % 88.5 87.6 1.0 % as a percent of revenue, as adjusted\n10.6 % 9.4 % 120 bps 10.6 % 9.8 % 80 bps (1) Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences.\n(2) Amounts for fiscal year 2017 have been recast to account for mall-based business and International segment as discontinued operations.\n(3) Gross profit, as Adjusted, excludes depreciation and amortization.\nThird quarter revenue, as adjusted, for the Company-owned salon segment decreased 8.3% versus the prior year to $269.8 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue was driven by the closure of unprofitable salons and the sale of Company-owned salons to franchisees, partially offset by an increase in same-store sales of 0.9% driven by a 3.1% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in traffic of 2.2%.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA of $28.7 million increased $1.0 million, or 3.6% versus the same period last year driven primarily by benefits from the Company's focus on cost reductions, the closing of unprofitable salons, and same-store sales comp increases, partially offset by salon-level compensation changes, investments in a strategic digital marketing campaign, health insurance costs, and the prior year inclusion of a more favorable self-insurance reserve adjustment. The EBITDA margin rate of the Company-owned salon segment of 10.6% increased 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year.\nFranchise\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions) (1) 2018 2017 (2) 2018 2017 (2) Revenue Product $ 8.4 $ 7.5 12.0 % $ 24.8 $ 22.5 10.2 % Product sold to The Beautiful Group 6.5 — N/A 12.9 — N/A Total product $ 14.9 $ 7.5 98.6 % $ 37.7 $ 22.5 67.5 % Royalties and fees 14.0 11.6 20.2 % 40.8 35.1 16.5 % Total Revenue $ 28.9 $ 19.2 51.0 % $ 78.6 $ 57.6 36.4 % EBITDA, as Adjusted 10.3 8.6 19.4 % 29.9 25.3 17.9 % as a percent of revenue 35.5 % 44.9 % (940) bps 38.0 % 44.0 % (600) bps (1) Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences.\n(2) Amounts for fiscal year 2017 have been recast to account for mall-based business and International segment as discontinued operations.\nThird quarter Franchise revenue was $28.9 million, a $9.8 million, or 51.0%, increase compared to the prior year quarter. Royalties and fees were $14.0 million, a $2.4 million, or 20.2% increase versus the same period last year. Royalties increased 11.0% driven primarily by positive same-store revenue and increased franchise salon counts. Initial franchise fees increased $1.4 million as the Company opened, or converted, a net 144 franchised locations in the quarter as compared to 46 in the prior year quarter. Product sales to franchisees were $14.9 million, an increase of $7.4 million. Product sales to The Beautiful Group accounted for $6.5 million of this year-over-year sales increase.\nFranchise adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million improved $1.7 million, or 19.4% year-over-year. The Franchise EBITDA margin rate of 35.5% was negatively impacted by roughly 960 basis points due to the low margin rate of product sales to The Beautiful Group in accordance with the terms of our agreement. Removing the dilutive impact of these sales, EBITDA margin rates in the Franchise segment of 45.1% improved 20 basis points when compared to the third quarter of last year.\nOther Company Updates\nConsolidated Year-Over-Year General & Administrative (\"G&A\") Comparability\nThe Company announced a realignment of its field leadership team by brand during the first fiscal quarter. An outcome of this reorganization is that the costs associated with senior district leaders have been moved out of cost of goods sold and site operating expense, where the expense has historically been recorded, and into G&A. The Company notes that this change does not impact the overall consolidated results but does result in an $8.5 million decrease in cost of goods sold and site expense, and a corresponding $8.5 million increase to G&A this quarter, when compared to the comparable period last year. On a year-to-date basis, this reclassification of expenses decreased cost of goods sold and site expense, and had a corresponding increase to G&A of $23.6 million versus the same period last year.\nTransformational Strategy Update\nThe Company continued to make progress implementing its transformational strategy and operational turnaround initiatives focused on improving the performance of Company-owned salons, while at the same time accelerating the growth of its franchise portfolio. During the quarter, the Company:\nClosed 597 non-performing, cash flow negative Company-owned SmartStyle ® salons in January 2018. Repurchased 586,000 common shares at a total price of $9.6 million. Converted 126 Company-owned salons to franchise substantially in its Supercuts and SmartStyle brands. Closed on a new five-year, $260 million unsecured revolving credit facility and redeemed the Company’s 5.5% high-yield notes. The size of the credit facility has subsequently increased to $295 million as an additional bank joined the syndicate. Executed a number of operational initiatives, building on its previously discussed management initiatives, to stabilize performance and establish a platform for longer-term revenue and earnings growth in Company-owned salons. The Company estimates the initiatives delivered benefit in a range of $8.0 million to $10.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Announced the appointment of Virginia Gambale to its Board of Directors, effective March 1, 2018. Launched an e-commerce initiative to distribute the Company's DesignLine ® brand of hair care products through Amazon and eBay to supplement existing in-salon sales and raise overall brand awareness.\nNon-GAAP reconciliations:\nFor GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please refer to attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\".

Presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows investors to review our core ongoing operating performance from the same perspective as management and the Board of Directors. These non-GAAP financial measures provide investors an enhanced understanding of our operations, facilitate investors’ analyses and comparisons of our current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of our future performance. We also believe the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information research analysts frequently use to analyze financial performance.\nThe method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP results should not be regarded as a substitute for corresponding U.S. GAAP measures but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of operating performance in evaluating our business. Non-GAAP measures do have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be viewed in conjunction with both our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliation of the selected U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, which are located in the Investor Information section of the corporate website at www.regiscorp.com .\nNon-GAAP reconciling items for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThe following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as “items impacting comparability” based on how management views our business, makes financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company’s ongoing performance. The following items have been excluded from our non-GAAP results:\nSmartStyle restructuring discounting and costs. Executive transition costs. Professional fees. Severance expense for former executive officers. Legal fees. Gain on life insurance proceeds. Debt refinancing. Goodwill derecognition. Impact of tax reform. Discontinued operations.\nREGIS CORPORATION Reconciliation of selected U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP operating income (loss) and U.S. GAAP net (loss) income to equivalent non-GAAP measures Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nU.S. GAAP financial line item 2018 2017 2018 2017 U.S. GAAP revenue $ 300,801 $ 313,478 $ 919,189 $ 947,558 Non-GAAP revenue adjustments SmartStyle restructuring discounting Product Sales (2,061 ) — (2,061 ) — Non-GAAP revenue $ 298,740 $ 313,478 $ 917,128 $ 947,558 U.S. GAAP operating income (loss) $ 5,884 $ (6,214 ) $ (14,715 ) $ 6,504 Non-GAAP revenue adjustments (2,061 ) — (2,061 ) — Non-GAAP operating expense adjustments (1) SmartStyle restructuring discounting Cost of Service 190 — 190 — SmartStyle restructuring and discounting costs Cost of Product 2,407 — 2,992 — SmartStyle restructuring discounting Site operating expenses 487 — 487 — SmartStyle restructuring costs General and administrative 1,218 — 1,334 — Executive transition costs General and administrative 146 — 564 — Professional fees General and administrative (8 ) 1,037 1,628 1,711 Severance General and administrative — 7,854 2,828 7,854 Legal fees General and administrative — 1,405 — 1,405 Gain on life insurance proceeds General and administrative — (100 ) (7,986 ) (100 ) SmartStyle restructuring costs Rent — — 23,999 — SmartStyle restructuring costs Depreciation and amortization 43 — 12,922 — Total non-GAAP operating expense adjustments 4,483 10,196 38,958 10,870 Non-GAAP operating income (1) $ 8,306 $ 3,982 $ 22,182 $ 17,374 U.S. GAAP net (loss) income $ (5,806 ) $ (18,455 ) $ 3,939 $ (17,393 ) Non-GAAP net income (loss) adjustments: Non-GAAP revenue adjustments (2,061 ) — (2,061 ) — Non-GAAP operating expense adjustments 4,483 10,196 38,958 10,870 Debt refinancing Interest expense 2,957 — 2,957 — Goodwill derecognition Interest income and other, net 1,172 — 1,714 — Income tax impact on Non-GAAP adjustments (2) Income taxes (1,441 ) — (10,072 ) — Impact of tax reform Income taxes — — (68,903 ) — Discontinued operations, net of income tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 10,605 6,615 50,973 12,275 Total non-GAAP net income (loss) adjustments 15,715 16,811 13,566 23,145 Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ 9,909 $ (1,644 ) $ 17,505 $ 5,752 Notes:\n(1) Adjusted operating margins for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and 2017, were 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively, and were 2.4% and 1.8% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are calculated as non-GAAP operating income divided by non-GAAP revenue for each respective period.\n(2) Based on projected statutory effective tax rate analyses, the non-GAAP tax provision was calculated to be approximately 22% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, for all non-GAAP operating expense adjustments.
