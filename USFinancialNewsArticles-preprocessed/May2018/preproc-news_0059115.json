    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 (Reuters) - Malaysia plans to drop its plans for a high-speed rail link between its capital, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore, and will talk with its southern neighbour about the pact to build it, its prime minister said in an interview published on Monday.\n“We need to do away with some of the unnecessary projects, for example the high-speed rail, which is going to cost us RM110bn ($28bn) and will not earn us a single cent. That will be dropped,” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the Financial Times.\n“We have an agreement with Singapore. We have to talk with Singapore about dropping that project.” (Writing by John Geddie; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n ",
