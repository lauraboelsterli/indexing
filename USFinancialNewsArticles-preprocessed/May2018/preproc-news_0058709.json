    "text": "BEIJING, May 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Leju Holdings Limited (\"Leju\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: LEJU), a leading online-to-offline (\"O2O\") real estate services provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues increased by 19% year-on-year to $81.5 million\n- Revenues from e-commerce services increased by 40% year-on-year to $53.5 million\n- Revenues from online advertising services increased by 5% year-on-year to $27.1 million Loss from operations was $31.5 million, a decrease of 32% from $46.3 million for the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP [1] loss from operations was $27.1 million, a decrease of 35% from $41.8 million for the same quarter of 2017 Net loss attributable to Leju Holdings Limited shareholders was $20.9 million, or $0.15 loss per diluted American depositary share (\"ADS\"), a decrease of 26% from $28.2 million, or $0.21 loss per diluted ADS, for the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Leju Holdings Limited shareholders was $17.3 million, or $0.13 loss per diluted ADS, a decrease of 29% from $24.2 million, or $0.18 loss per diluted ADS, for the same quarter of 2017\n[1] Leju uses in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) income (loss) from operations, (2) net income (loss), (3) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders, (4) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per basic ADS, and (5) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per diluted ADS, each of which excludes share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. See \"About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" below for more information about the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release.\n\"I'm pleased that our businesses returned to a growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2018 despite the overall market environment not showing signs of major improvement,\" said Mr. Geoffrey He, Leju's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our e-commerce business had a strong recovery, benefitting from larger contribution from lower-tier cities and higher value per coupon. We also entered into annual framework contracts with many leading real estate developers. Our online advertising business achieved steady growth in the first quarter as a result of our big-data based suite of targeted advertising products, which continued to be well received by the market. Meanwhile, we further enhanced our media influence and content productivity through enhancing 'Leju Finance', our recently launched real estate vertical media platform, which helped lay a solid foundation for future growth. In addition, our efforts to streamline our cost structure began to show results in the first quarter. We will continue to improve our operational efficiency and aim to return to profitability. \"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenues were $81.5 million, an increase of 19% from $68.3 million for the same quarter of 2017, mainly due to an increase in revenues from e-commerce services and online advertising services.\nRevenues from e-commerce services were $53.5 million, an increase of 40% from $38.1 million for the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to increases in the average price per discount coupon redeemed.\nRevenues from online advertising services were $27.1 million, an increase of 5% from $25.8 million for the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in property developers' demand for online advertising.\nRevenues from listing services were $0.9 million, a decrease of 79% from $4.4 million for the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in secondary real estate brokers' demand.\nCost of revenues was $18.7 million, an increase of 32% from $14.1 million for the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased cost of advertising resources purchased from media platforms, partially offset by decreased staff cost as a result of headcount change.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $95.2 million, a decrease of 5% from $100.5 million for the same quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower staff cost as a result of headcount change.\nLoss from operations was $31.5 million, a decrease of 32% from $46.3 million for the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations was $27.1 million, a decrease of 35% from $41.8 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was $21.3 million, a decrease of 26% from $28.6 million for the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $17.7 million, a decrease of 28% from $24.7 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nN et loss attributable to Leju Holdings Limited shareholders was $20.9 million, or $0.15 loss per diluted ADS, a decrease of 26% from $28.2 million, or $0.21 loss per diluted ADS, for the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Leju Holdings Limited shareholders was $17.3 million, or $0.13 loss per diluted ADS, a decrease of 29% from $24.2 million, or $0.18 loss per diluted ADS, for the same quarter of 2017.\nCash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $157.2 million.\nFirst quarter 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million, primarily comprised of non-GAAP net loss of $17.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in customer deposit of $17.5 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company estimates that its total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 will be approximately $106 million to $111 million, which would represent an increase of approximately 15% to 20% from $92.7 million in the same quarter in 2017. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nConference Call Information\nLeju's management will host an earnings conference call on May 28, 2018 at 7 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (7 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong time).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nU.S./International:\n+1-845-675-0437\nHong Kong:\n+852-3018-6771\nMainland China:\n+400-620-8038\nPlease dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"target,\" \"going forward,\" \"outlook\" and similar statements. Leju may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its reports filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Leju's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained, either expressly or impliedly, in any of the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in China's real estate market; the highly regulated nature of, and government measures affecting, the real estate and internet industries in China; Leju's ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors; its ability to continue to develop and expand its content, service offerings and features, and to develop or incorporate the technologies that support them; its limited operating history and lack of experience as a stand-alone public company, given its carve-out from E-House and prior reliance on E-House for various corporate services; its reliance on SINA and others with which it has developed, or may develop in the future, strategic partnerships; substantial revenue contribution from a limited number of real estate markets; complexities resulting from its ongoing relationships with E-House, due to E-House's status as a principal shareholder of Leju; and relevant government policies and regulations relating to the corporate structure, business and industry of Leju. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release is current as of the date of the press release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Leju's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Leju uses in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) income (loss) from operations, (2) net income (loss), (3) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders, (4) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per basic ADS, and (5) net income (loss) attributable to Leju shareholders per diluted ADS, each of which excludes share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nLeju believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding its operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expense, and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, which may not be indicative of Leju's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Leju's historical performance and assist its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions may continue to exist in Leju's business for the foreseeable future. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables provide more details on the reconciliation between non-GAAP financial measures and their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFor investor and media inquiries please
