    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the United States had forfeited its role as a mediator in the Middle East by moving its Israel embassy to Jerusalem.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan greets his supporters during a ceremony in Istanbul, Turkey May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Murad Sezer “The United States has chosen to be a part of the problem rather than the solution with its latest step and has lost its mediating role in the peace process,” Erdogan said in a speech at Britain’s Chatham House think tank.\nThe United States is due to officially move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday in a move that has delighted Israel but infuriated Palestinians.\nReporting by Karin Strohecker; Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Daren Butler\n ",
