Leicester protested in vain that Arnautovic had fouled Christian Fuchs. Soccer Football - Premier League - Leicester City vs West Ham United - King Power Stadium, Leicester, Britain - May 5, 2018 West Ham United's Mark Noble celebrates scoring their second goal with team mates REUTERS/Darren Staples\nBooed off at halftime, the hosts improved a little with a double substitution but conceded again in the 64th minute to Mark Noble’s fine volley from outside the penalty area.\n“That’s the best I’ve scored for sure, especially with what’s involved with this game,” Noble said. Slideshow (6 Images)\n“It could have gone anywhere but it’s hit the post and gone in.\n“I hope on Thursday night against Man United we can perform like that but we want to try and finish as high as we can.”\nManager David Moyes, with his side in 15th, is also looking up the table rather than down.\n“These players are capable of winning games,” he told Sky Sports. “I’m thinking can we get closer to mid-table.”\nLeicester remained ninth in the table.
