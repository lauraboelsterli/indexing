French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian speaks during a meeting in Cairo, Egypt April 29, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n“The June deadline is the deadline that must be seen as the ultimate deadline” to find a way to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and allow progress in Brexit talks, Le Drian told reporters in Dublin.\nBritain’s Brexit minister David Davis in April told a British parliamentary committee that June was an “artificial deadline” on the issue.
