As part of the expansion, Kyriba has named Axel Canale as the new general manager for Latin America, overseeing market expansion for the region.\n“Senior finance leaders in Latin America are demanding scalable cloud-based solutions that empower them to simplify core operations and accelerate growth in a global environment,” said Axel Canale, a former SAP, IBM and EMC executive. “Kyriba brings innovation and market leadership that will create new opportunities for clients and partners alike.”\nThe move into Latin America is part of an aggressive global growth strategy that saw Kyriba’s partner ecosystem contribute 40 percent in incremental bookings to Kyriba’s record first quarter bookings results this year.\nKyriba continues to see strong across-the-board growth from companies of all sizes and industries, including energy, entertainment and hospitality, private equity, real estate and retail among others. Over the past year, Kyriba has notched several major customer and partner wins in Latin America, including Arcos Dorados (McDonald’s Mexico), Cinépolis, Cuestamoras, Keizen, Netsoft, Inforum, RSM and many others.\n“Our clients are seeking to become more agile and efficient in an increasingly complex and competitive global marketplace,” said Arturo Gonzalez, Partner at Keizen Innovación, an advisory firm specializing in tech solutions. “Kyriba’s best-in-class SaaS platform combined with our strategic and financial consulting services represents a great opportunity for us to drive new growth in this market.”\n“The growing adoption of cloud-based FinTech solutions like Kyriba is delivering enormous benefit to our clients looking to move beyond traditional tools and processes,” said Hector Garcia, CEO at Netsoft, a major NetSuite reseller in Latin America. “Kyriba’s entry into Latin America is great news for financial executives looking to transform their finance operations to be more strategic and efficient.”\nIn February, Kyriba announced new partner incentives designed to help global partners achieve first-year profitability, while driving strong recurring revenue growth for their organizations. Those incentives create a unique growth opportunity for all Latin American partners.\nToday’s announcement coincides with the IMEF “ FINTECH EM POWER ING BUSINESS ” event, scheduled for today and tomorrow in Mexico City. The IMEF CDMX conference will present a global overview of the challenges and opportunities that FinTechs offer to corporates, institutions and governments. Kyriba will be exhibiting in Booth #13.\nAbout Kyriba Corp.\nKyriba empowers financial leaders and their teams with award-winning solutions for cash and risk management, payments and supply chain finance.
