    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gourmet Ocean Products Inc. (“Gourmet” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:GOP) announces its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, Gourmet reported sales of $173,355, compared with $160,663 during the same period of last year.

Gross margin during the three months period ended March 31, 2018 was 43.5% compared with 48.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
