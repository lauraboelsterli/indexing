    "text": "May 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's Model 3 sedan recorded more registrations in California than its class rivals BMW 3-Series and Mercedes C-Class in the first quarter, according to a report by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA).\nModel 3 registrations totaled 3,723, or 14.3 percent of the near-luxury segment, compared with 3,323 for the Mercedes variant and 3,260 for the BMW model, the CNCDA report https://www.cncda.org/wp-content/uploads/California-Covering-1Q-2018.pdf said.\nTesla started delivering the Model 3 to customers in December 2017.\nCalifornia is a key market for global luxury vehicle brands not just because of its size, but because other markets often follow trends set by wealthy consumers in the state.
