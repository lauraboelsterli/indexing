The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen before the company's annual news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, February 4, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\nDaimler’s Mercedes-Benz U.S. International plant outside Tuscaloosa will gradually ramp up production as parts begin to arrive next week, the company said in a statement.\nThe same May 2 fire, at a Meridian Magnesium Products plant in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, caused Ford Motor Co to lose more than a week of production of its highly profitable F-series pickup trucks at three U.S. plants.\nAfter parts production restarted at the Michigan plant and at another Meridian plant in Britain, Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said it would resume truck production at one plant on Friday and two others on Monday.
