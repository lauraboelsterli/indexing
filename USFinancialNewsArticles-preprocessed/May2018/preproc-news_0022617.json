    "text": "NEW YORK & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hughes Hubbard & Reed announced today that Ryan Fayhee has joined the firm as a partner and will be Head of the Sanctions, Export Control and Anti-Money Laundering Group within the larger International Trade Practice. Fayhee, an accomplished U.S. Department of Justice veteran, joins the firm from Baker McKenzie. At DOJ, Fayhee served as the National Export Control Coordinator, the principal attorney overseeing export control and sanctions investigations and prosecutions nationally.\nFayhee represents companies, boards of directors, audit committees and senior executives in internal and government facing cross-border investigations, and advises clients on compliance and acquisition due diligence with a focus on sanctions, export controls, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and cybersecurity. Fayhee has significant experience assisting multinational companies facing crises and other high-profile reputational risks.\n“International Trade is an increasingly important component of our transnational business,” said Ted Mayer, the Chair of Hughes Hubbard. “We think Ryan brings substantial strengths in export controls and sanctions that will prove extremely valuable to our clients on their most sophisticated issues.”\nDuring his 11 years at the DOJ, Fayhee prosecuted cases involving export controls, sanctions, cybercrime, trade secret theft and espionage. He received special recognition from the U.S. Attorney General for devising a model approach to the identification and disruption of foreign military supply and proliferation networks. Fayhee also led an investigation and prosecution of a multinational company that resulted in the largest criminal fine to date for sanctions violations.\nFayhee’s extensive government experience also includes service as a Trial Attorney with the DOJ’s Civil Fraud Section, where he handled matters arising under the False Claims Act; he was also an Assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of Illinois.\n“Ryan Fayhee brings tremendous experience and a unique perspective to the complex OFAC, money laundering and cyber-related investigations and compliance matters that our clients increasingly face,” said Joanne Osendarp, Chair of Hughes Hubbard’s International Trade Practice. “We are thrilled to have him join our talented team.”\n“As companies continue to confront the increasingly dynamic landscape and intense enforcement environment around sanctions, export controls and related issues affecting global supply chains, I am confident my clients will benefit from Hughes Hubbard’s platform,” said Fayhee, “and I’m looking forward to collaborating with a group of distinguished colleagues who share an absolute commitment to client service.”\nFayhee received his J.D. cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center and his B.A. from Purdue University.\nAbout The International Trade Group\nHughes Hubbard’s International Trade practice helps clients navigate the complex international trade regulatory environment, advising and representing clients in the entire range of import, export, national security and trade-related regulatory matters.
