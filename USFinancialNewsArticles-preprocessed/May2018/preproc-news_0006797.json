    "text": "May 1 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index was poised to open higher on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump postponed the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on the country, the European Union and Mexico. June futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.11 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Amid a slew of earnings, investors will also focus on GDP data which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Canada's economy is likely to have expanded 0.3 percent in February. Canada's main stock index fell on Monday, weighed by declines for the financial and materials groups, as the market reopened after an outage halted trading for several hours on Friday afternoon. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.08 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.01 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.03 percent. (Morning News Call newsletter here ; The Day Ahead newsletter here ) TOP STORIES Trump has postponed the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico until June 1, and has reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil, the White House said on Monday. Canadian oil and gas producer Encana Corp beat analysts' estimates with a 50 percent rise in adjusted profit for the first quarter, helped by higher production and stronger prices for its crude. Canada's stock exchange, the world's sixth largest, was back in business on Monday after a hardware glitch abruptly ended trading on Friday and the exchange operator TMX Group said it was working to ensure there will be no repeat of the embarrassing market disruption.
