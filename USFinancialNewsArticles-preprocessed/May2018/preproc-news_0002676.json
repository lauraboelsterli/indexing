    "text": "DAVIDSON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE: CW) reports financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98, up 35% compared with the prior year; Net sales of $548 million, up 5%, including 3% organic growth; Operating income of $64 million, up 35%; Operating margin of 11.8%, up 270 basis points; Backlog of $2.1 billion, up 2% from December 31, 2017; and Share repurchases of approximately $12 million.\nFull-Year 2018 Business Outlook\nFull-year 2018 organic guidance reflects a $0.06 increase in full-year EPS driven by the benefit of solid first quarter performance and improved outlook in the Commercial/Industrial segment, which added $10 million to sales and approximately $3 million to operating income; Full-year 2018 organic guidance reflects higher sales (up 3-5%), operating income (up 10-13%), operating margin (up 90-110 bps) and diluted EPS (up 19-22%); Full-year 2018 guidance updated to include the acquisition of the Dresser-Rand government business (Dresser-Rand) within the Power segment, which added $70 million in sales and $10 million in free cash flow, but reduced operating income by approximately $14 million, operating margin by 100 basis points and diluted EPS by $0.24, due to first year purchase accounting costs associated with the acquisition. Excluding first year purchase accounting costs, the acquisition would otherwise be accretive to 2018 diluted EPS; and Overall, we increased full-year 2018 sales guidance by $80 million; reduced operating income guidance by approximately $12 million, reduced operating margin guidance by 100 basis points, and reduced diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 to new range of $5.47 to $5.62 (up 14-17%).\nEPS Guidance Prior Guidance $ 5.65 - $5.80 Increase driven by solid 1Q performance $0.06 Guidance prior to impact of acquisition $ 5.71 - $5.86 Dresser-Rand impact including first year purchase accounting costs ($0.24 ) Current Guidance $ 5.47 - $5.62\n“First quarter diluted EPS of $0.98 was ahead of our expectations, as we delivered solid 5% top-line growth, led by increased defense and industrial sales, and improved profitability, driven by the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives,” said David C. Adams, Chairman and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation.\n“We are off to a solid start to 2018 and anticipate steady, sequential margin and EPS improvement over the remainder of the year. We are projecting another solid organic operational performance this year and expect higher sales in all end markets, double-digit growth in operating income, strong margin expansion and free cash flow conversion in excess of 100%. The recently completed acquisition of Dresser-Rand significantly expands our naval defense business and supports our objective for long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation. Excluding the purchase accounting costs associated with the acquisition, we expect Dresser-Rand to be accretive to 2018 diluted earnings per share. Overall, we are executing on our long-term strategy and continuing to drive solid operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation to deliver significant value for our shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\n(In thousands) 1Q-2018 1Q-2017 Change Sales $ 547,522 $ 523,591 5% Operating income 64,498 47,692 35% Operating margin 11.8% 9.1% 270 bps Sales\nSales of $548 million in the first quarter increased $24 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, reflecting a $15 million, or 3%, increase in organic sales, and a $9 million, or 2%, benefit from favorable foreign currency translation.\nHigher organic revenues were principally driven by solid defense sales in all three segments. In addition, we also experienced improved industrial demand in the Commercial/Industrial segment and lower power generation revenues in the Power segment.\nFrom an end market perspective, sales to the defense markets increased 12%, 11% of which was organic, while sales to the commercial markets were flat compared with the prior year, as increased sales to the general industrial market were mainly offset by reduced sales to the power generation market. Please refer to the accompanying tables for a breakdown of sales by end market.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in the first quarter was $64 million, an increase of $17 million, or 35%, compared with the prior year. These results primarily reflect higher defense and industrial sales, the benefits of our margin improvement initiatives, most notably in the Commercial/Industrial segment, and increased profitability in the Defense segment as we moved beyond the first year purchase accounting costs associated with the Teletronics Technology Corporation (TTC) acquisition, which negatively impacted prior year results.\nOperating margin was 11.8%, an increase of 270 basis points over the prior year, primarily reflecting higher revenues and favorable overhead absorption, the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives, as well as the aforementioned increase in profitability in the Defense segment associated with the TTC acquisition.\nNon-segment Expense\nNon-segment expenses of $10 million were essentially flat compared with the prior year.\nNet Earnings\nFirst quarter net earnings increased 34% compared with the prior year, as higher operating income and lower interest expense more than offset a higher tax rate. The effective tax rate (ETR) for the first quarter was 28.4%, an increase from 20.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an additional provisional tax expense associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) for foreign withholding taxes, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit related to share based compensation.\nFree Cash Flow\n(In thousands) 1Q-2018 1Q-2017 Net cash used for operating activities $ (71,262 ) $ (24,941 ) Capital expenditures (8,971 ) (10,374 ) Free cash flow $ (80,233 ) $ (35,315 ) Pension payment 50,000 - Adjusted free cash flow $ (30,233 ) $ (35,315 ) Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was ($80 million) for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $45 million compared with the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow, defined as free cash flow excluding a $50 million voluntary contribution to the Company’s corporate defined benefit pension plan, increased approximately $5 million to ($30 million), primarily due to higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures decreased by $1 million to $9 million compared with the prior year period.\nNew Orders and Backlog\nNew orders of $605 million in the first quarter decreased 6% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the timing of naval defense orders received within the Commercial/Industrial and Power segments, compared with the prior year period. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2% from December 31, 2017.\nOther Items – Share Repurchase\nDuring the first quarter, the Company repurchased 93,438 shares of its common stock for approximately $12 million.\nFull-Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company is updating its full-year 2018 financial guidance to include the recently completed acquisition of the Dresser-Rand government business as well as increased sales and operating income in the Commercial/Industrial segment:\nPrior Guidance\nCurrent Guidance\nTotal sales $2.335 - $2.375 billion $2.415 - $2.455 billion Operating income $355 - $365 million $343 - $353 million Operating margin 15.2% - 15.4% 14.2% - 14.4% Interest expense $37 - $38 million $36 - $37 million Effective tax rate 24.0% 24.0% Diluted earnings per share $5.65 - $5.80 $5.47 - $5.62 Diluted shares outstanding 44.7 million 44.7 million Free cash flow $230 - $250 million $240 - $260 million Adjusted free cash flow $280 - $300 million $290 - $310 million Notes:\nFull-year 2018 guidance includes the impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-07 that requires the reclassification of the non-service components of Pension expense from Operating Income to Other Income/Expense effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Because our non-service components are a benefit, this accounting change lowered full-year 2018 operating income by $14.0 million and operating margin by 60 basis points. This change is neutral to earnings per share. Adjusted free cash flow for full-year 2018 excludes a $50 million voluntary contribution to the Company’s corporate defined benefit pension plan that it elected to make in February 2018. A more detailed breakdown of the Company’s 2018 guidance by segment and by market can be found in the accompanying schedules.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Performance\nCommercial/Industrial\n(In thousands) 1Q-2018 1Q-2017 Change Sales $ 296,641 $ 278,822 6% Operating income 39,225 30,552 28% Operating margin 13.2% 11.0% 220 bps Sales for the first quarter were $297 million, an increase of $18 million, or 6%, over the prior year. Organic sales increased $11 million, or 4%, while favorable foreign currency translation added $7 million, or 2%. Our results reflect strong sales growth in the aerospace and naval defense markets, led by higher sales of actuation systems on fighter jets and increased valve revenues on the CVN-80 Ford class aircraft carrier program. We also experienced higher sales in the general industrial market, due to solid demand for industrial vehicle products and increased sales of surface treatment services. Sales to the commercial aerospace market were flat, as higher sales of sensors, actuation systems and surface treatment services on narrowbody airplanes were offset by lower revenues resulting from FAA directives.\nOperating income in the first quarter was $39 million, an increase of $9 million, or 28%, compared with the prior year, while operating margin increased 220 basis points to 13.2%. The increase in operating income and margin primarily reflects higher sales and favorable overhead absorption for industrial vehicle products, naval valve products, sensors and controls products, and surface treatment services, and includes the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives.\nDefense\n(In thousands) 1Q-2018 1Q-2017 Change Sales $ 118,901 $ 114,662 4% Operating income 19,728 11,097 78% Operating margin 16.6% 9.7% 690 bps Sales for the first quarter were $119 million, an increase of $4 million, or 4%, from the prior year. These results reflect a $2 million, or 2%, increase in organic sales, and a $2 million, or 2%, benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. In the aerospace defense market, our results reflect higher sales of data acquisition and flight test equipment, most notably on the F-18 program. We also experienced higher domestic vehicle product sales, most notably on the G/ATOR program, in the ground defense market.\nOperating income in the first quarter was $20 million, an increase of $9 million, or 78%, compared with the prior year, while operating margin increased 690 basis points to 16.6%. This performance reflects increased profitability as we moved beyond the first year purchase accounting costs associated with the TTC acquisition which impacted prior year results, as well as the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives. Meanwhile, unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced current quarter operating income by approximately $1 million, or 7%.\nPower\n(In thousands) 1Q-2018 1Q-2017 Change Sales $ 131,980 $ 130,107 1% Operating income 15,342 15,545 (1%) Operating margin 11.6% 11.9% (30 bps) Sales for the first quarter were $132 million, an increase of $2 million, or 1%, from the prior year. In the naval defense market, our results reflect higher aircraft carrier revenues, partially offset by lower revenues on the Columbia class submarine, as this program transitions from the development to the production phase. In the power generation market, our results reflect lower revenues on the domestic AP1000 program and lower domestic aftermarket sales supporting currently operating nuclear reactors, which were partially offset by higher revenues on the AP1000 China Direct program and increased international aftermarket sales.\nOperating income in the first quarter was $15 million, essentially flat compared with the prior year, while operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 11.6%. This performance reflects reduced sales and profitability in the nuclear aftermarket business and lower revenues on the domestic AP1000 program, partially offset by higher production and profitability on the AP1000 China Direct program.\nConference Call & Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, May 3, 2018. A live webcast of the call and the accompanying financial presentation, as well as a replay of the call, will be made available on the internet by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.curtisswright.com .\n(Tables to Follow)\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS (UNAUDITED) ($'s in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 $ % Product sales $ 444,687 $ 423,229 $ 21,458 5 % Service sales 102,835 100,362 2,473 2 % Total net sales 547,522 523,591 23,931 5 % Cost of product sales 299,311 289,610 9,701 3 % Cost of service sales 67,020 67,046 (26 ) 0 % Total cost of sales 366,331 356,656 9,675 3 % Gross profit 181,191 166,935 14,256 9 % Research and development expenses 15,941 15,591 350 2 % Selling expenses 31,520 29,458 2,062 7 % General and administrative expenses 69,232 74,194 (4,962 ) (7 %) Operating income 64,498 47,692 16,806 35 % Interest expense 8,204 10,377 (2,173 ) (21 %) Other income, net 4,683 3,847 836 22 % Earnings before income taxes 60,977 41,162 19,815 48 % Provision for income taxes (17,334 ) (8,615 ) (8,719 ) (101 %) Net earnings $ 43,643 $ 32,547 $ 11,096 34 % Net earnings per share Basic earnings per share $ 0.99 $ 0.74 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.98 $ 0.73 Dividends per share $ 0.15 $ 0.13 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 44,188 44,246 Diluted 44,678 44,860\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) ($'s in thousands, except par value) March 31, December 31, Change 2018 2017 % Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 396,518 $ 475,120 (17 %) Receivables, net 518,784 494,923 5 % Inventories, net 386,787 378,866 2 % Other current assets 50,688 52,951 (4 %) Total current assets 1,352,777 1,401,860 (4 %) Property, plant, and equipment, net 385,287 390,235 (1 %) Goodwill 1,099,450 1,096,329 0 % Other intangible assets, net 322,856 329,668 (2 %) Other assets 18,689 18,229 3 % Total assets $ 3,179,059 $ 3,236,321 (2 %) Liabilities Current liabilities: Current portion of long-term and short term debt $ 982 $ 150 555 % Accounts payable 165,413 185,176 (11 %) Accrued expenses 102,602 150,406 (32 %) Income taxes payable 8,810 4,564 93 % Deferred revenue 217,959 214,891 1 % Other current liabilities 45,519 35,810 27 % Total current liabilities 541,285 590,997 (8 %) Long-term debt, net 813,576 813,989 0 % Deferred tax liabilities, net 58,486 49,360 18 % Accrued pension and other postretirement benefit costs 67,984 121,043 (44 %) Long-term portion of environmental reserves 14,681 14,546 1 % Other liabilities 104,072 118,586 (12 %) Total liabilities 1,600,084 1,708,521 (6 %) Stockholders' equity Common stock, $1 par value $ 49,187 $ 49,187 0 % Additional paid in capital 116,221 120,609 (4 %) Retained earnings 1,979,051 1,944,324 2 % Accumulated other comprehensive loss (198,807 ) (216,840 ) 8 % Less: cost of treasury stock (366,677 ) (369,480 ) 1 % Total stockholders' equity 1,578,975 1,527,800 3 % Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 3,179,059 $ 3,236,321 (2 %)\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES SEGMENT INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) ($'s in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 % Sales:\nCommercial/Industrial $ 296,641 $ 278,822 6 % Defense 118,901 114,662 4 % Power 131,980 130,107 1 % Total sales $ 547,522 $ 523,591 5 % Operating income (expense):\nCommercial/Industrial $ 39,225 $ 30,552 28 % Defense 19,728 11,097 78 % Power 15,342 15,545 (1 %) Total segments $ 74,295 $ 57,194 30 % Corporate and other (9,797 ) (9,502 ) (3 %) Total operating income $ 64,498 $ 47,692 35 % Operating margins:\nCommercial/Industrial 13.2 % 11.0 % Defense 16.6 % 9.7 % Power 11.6 % 11.9 % Total Curtiss-Wright 11.8 % 9.1 % Segment margins 13.6 % 10.9 %\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES SALES BY END MARKET (UNAUDITED) ($'s in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, Change 2018 2017 % Defense markets: Aerospace $ 75,941 $ 65,293 16 % Ground 22,011 19,737 12 % Naval 102,782 90,970 13 % Other 4,581 7,041 (35 %) Total Defense $ 205,315 $ 183,041 12 % Commercial markets: Aerospace $ 99,404 $ 98,614 1 % Power Generation 99,012 105,551 (6 %) General Industrial 143,791 136,385 5 % Total Commercial $ 342,207 $ 340,550 0 % Total Curtiss-Wright $ 547,522 $ 523,591 5 %\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe Corporation supplements its financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. Curtiss-Wright believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the Company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. Curtiss-Wright encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\nOrganic Revenue and Organic Operating Income\nThe Corporation discloses organic revenue and organic operating income because the Corporation believes it provides investors with insight as to the Company’s ongoing business performance. Organic revenue and organic operating income are defined as revenue and operating income excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and contributions from acquisitions made during the last twelve months.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 vs. 2017 Commercial/Industrial Defense Power Total Curtiss-Wright Sales Operating\nincome\nSales Operating\nincome\nSales Operating\nincome\nSales Operating\nincome\nOrganic 4% 28% 2% 85% 1% (1%) 3% 37% Acquisitions 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Foreign Currency 2% 0% 2% (7%) 0% 0% 2% (2%) Total 6% 28% 4% 78% 1% (1%) 5% 35%\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion\nThe Corporation discloses free cash flow because it measures cash flow available for investing and financing activities. Free cash flow represents cash available to repay outstanding debt, invest in the business, acquire businesses, return capital to shareholders and make other strategic investments. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow excludes contributions made to the Company’s corporate defined benefit pension plan. The Corporation discloses free cash flow conversion because it measures the proportion of net earnings converted into free cash flow and is defined as free cash flow divided by net earnings from continuing operations.\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED) ($'s in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash used for operating activities $ (71,262 ) $ (24,941 ) Capital expenditures (8,971 ) (10,374 ) Free cash flow $ (80,233 ) $ (35,315 ) Pension payment 50,000 — Adjusted free cash flow $ (30,233 ) $ (35,315 ) Free Cash Flow Conversion (69 %) (109 %)\nCURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION 2018 Guidance (1) (2) (3) As of May 2, 2018 ($'s in millions, except per share data) 2018 Guidance (Prior) 2018 Guidance (Current)\n2018 Guidance\n2017\nAdjusted\nLow High 2018 % Change\nvs 2017 Adjusted\nLow High 2018 % Change\nvs 2017 Adjusted\nSales:\nCommercial/Industrial $ 1,163 $ 1,183 $ 1,203 $ 1,193 $ 1,213 Defense 555 565 575 565 575 Power 553 587 597 657 667 Total sales $ 2,271 $ 2,335 $ 2,375 3 to 5% $ 2,415 $ 2,455 6 to 8% Operating income:\nCommercial/Industrial $ 168 $ 174 $ 179 $ 177 $ 182 Defense 109 121 124 121 124 Power 81 94 97 80 83 Total segments 359 389 400 378 389 Corporate and other (34 ) (34 ) (35 ) (34 ) (35 ) Total operating income $ 325 $ 355 $ 365 9 to 12% $ 343 $ 353 6 to 9% Interest expense $ (41 ) $ (37 ) $ (38 ) $ (36 ) $ (37 ) Other income, net 16 14 14 14 14 Earnings before income taxes 300 332 341 322 331 Provision for income taxes (85 ) (80 ) (82 ) (77 ) (79 ) Net earnings $ 215 $ 253 $ 259 $ 245 $ 251 Reported diluted earnings per share $ 4.80 $ 5.65 $ 5.80 18 to 21% $ 5.47 $ 5.62 14 to 17% Diluted shares outstanding 44.8 44.7 44.7 44.7 44.7 Effective tax rate 28.3 % 24.0 % 24.0 % 24.0 % 24.0 % Operating margins:\nCommercial/Industrial 14.5 % 14.7 % 14.9 % 20 to 40 bps 14.8 % 15.0 % 30 to 50 bps Defense 19.7 % 21.3 % 21.5 % 160 to 180 bps 21.3 % 21.5 % 160 to 180 bps Power 14.7 % 16.0 % 16.2 % 130 to 150 bps 12.2 % 12.4 % (230 to 250 bps) Total operating margin 14.3 % 15.2 % 15.4 % 90 to 110 bps 14.2 % 14.4 % (10) to 10 bps Note: Full year amounts may not add due to rounding (1) Full-year 2017 and 2018 effective tax rate guidance includes the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

This accounting change lowered operating income by $14.6 million and $14.0 million, respectfully, and lowered operating margin by 70 and 60 basis points, respectively, in full-year 2017 and projected full-year 2018 periods. This change is neutral to earnings per share in both periods. (3) Full-year 2018 guidance updated to include the acquisition of the Dresser-Rand government business (Dresser-Rand) within the Power segment, which adds $70 million in sales, but reduces operating income and operating margin, due to first year purchase accounting costs associated with the acquisition.
