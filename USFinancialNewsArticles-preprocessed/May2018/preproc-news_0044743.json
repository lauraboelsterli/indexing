    "text": "37 COMMENTS DEER PARK, Texas—The fans overflowed the bleachers, spilled into the bullpen and stretched three deep along the outfield fence as Santa Fe High School’s baseball team took the field a day after a gunman opened fire at their school, killing 10 and injuring more.\nThey needed to cheer their team at this game against Kingwood Park High, they said, as much as their ballplayers needed to play it.\nSo a day after the game was originally scheduled, they packed the ballpark in nearby Deer Park on a perfect Saturday night in a sea of green T-shirts with “Santa Fe strong” and “Indian nation,” a reference to the school’s mascot, emblazoned on the front.\nWhen Rome Shubert, a pitcher who on Friday survived a shot to the head, was announced, the crowd burst into applause.\n“Feels great, feels great,” Mr. Shubert, in jersey and shorts, said of being on the field, though he didn’t play. When a friend queried about his injury, Mr. Shubert pointed to the large bandage on his neck, then lifted his curls to show where the bullet struck him.\nRome Shubert, who survived a shot to his head, at Saturday’s game. Photo: Erin Ailworth/The Wall Street Journal “Besides this, I’m doing pretty good,” said the sophomore, who has committed to play baseball at the University of Houston.\nThe crowd stood solemnly for a moment of silence at the start as the sun hid behind a cloud.\nBy the bottom of the 2nd inning, the team was down 5-0 to Kingwood, but the fans were still cheering wildly. Players crowded around the starting pitcher, offering him comfort as he was pulled.\nSanta Fe players Tyler Martin, left, and Dalton Stevens hugged before Saturday’s game. Photo: David J. Phillip/Associated Press “I think it’s the best medicine for them…takes power away from yesterday,” said Reagan McDonald, 47 years old, whose sophomore son, No. 9, plays for the team. “They’re all here to support each other, just like right now, the guy on the mound didn’t have it, but they’re all out there giving him hugs.”\nIn the stands, Melissa Nugent’s two children held homemade signs. “Get well soon, Rome,” read the one held by her son Cole, 7. In her 5-year-old daughter Camryn’s hands, a heart-covered message: “Santa Fe strong.”\nRelated Coverage Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Exchange Student, Substitute Teachers Texas Shooting Suspect’s Family Expresses Shock President Trump Comments on ‘Horrific Attack’ in Santa Fe, Texas Lives Lost in Three Decades of School Shootings Analysis: Data Show How School Attacks Unfold Most Guns Used in School Shootings Come From Home Designing a School to Stop Shooters Along the outfield fence, Betty Lawson, 47, watched with her 16-year-old daughter, Hannah, a Santa Fe student.\n“Even if the team doesn’t win tonight,” Ms. Lawson said, “in our hearts because they wanted to play, they’re already winners.”\nWith the team down 7-0 in the bottom of the fifth, Santa Fe High fans raised their voices in a chant and began to clap: “Here we go, Santa Fe, here we go. Here we go, Santa Fe, here we go.”\nThe game ended with a Santa Fe loss, 7-0. As the players went to shake hands with the opposing team, a man in the crowd yelled out, “Keep your heads up, guys. Keep your heads up.”\nSome in the crowd sang the Santa Fe fight song: “Santa Fe, dear Santa Fe, surely thou will be, ever worthy of our homage, hail oh hail to thee.”\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com",
