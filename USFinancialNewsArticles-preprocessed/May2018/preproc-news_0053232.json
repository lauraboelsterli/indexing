This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements and Management’s Discussion & Analysis (“MD&A”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, available on the Company’s website at www.amarillogold.com and under the Company’s name on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . All monetary amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.\nMike Mutchler, CEO of Amarillo commented “With the successful closing of the private placement, the Company is well positioned to apply for the Installation License of the Mara Rosa Project next year. After already having received the Environmental License, the Installation License is the second major milestone prior to commencement of construction. Importantly, we have just started a 10K meter drilling program, which we believe would convert the 310K of inferred resources into indicated and extend the mine life to at least 10 years. We will also be doing some step-out drilling to explore for additional resources along trend and down dip from the current resource. Our work with Whittle Consulting on the Optimization Study of the deposit is ongoing. We expect a new resource by year end to provide the optimized case for mining the deposit that is timed to coincide with the beginning of the Feasibility Study in early 2019.”\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nExpenses and Loss Three Months ended March 31 2018 2017 Management and consulting fees 166,295 280,549 General and administrative 117,768 106,070 Stock-based compensation 788,131 64,671 Professional fees 93,828 66,842 Other expenses (recoveries) (54,553) 90,323 Subtotal before other items 1,111,469 608,455 Accretion on gold loans 346,519 313,416 Subtotal of expenses before Fx and FV changes 1,457,988 921,871 Foreign exchange and FV of derivatives losses 500,285 695,012 Loss before taxes 1,958,273 1,616,883 Deferred tax 110,000 - Net loss 2,068,273 1,616,883 Loss per share (0.02) (0.02) The Company’s loss is mostly attributable to non-cash items related to the gold-linked loan consisting of accretion, mark to market adjustments for gold price increase and foreign exchange loss which aggregate $846,804 (Q1 2017: $1,008,428); and to non-cash stock-based compensation of $788,131 (Q1 2017: $64,671).\nABOUT AMARILLO\nAmarillo is developing a highly economic, open pit gold resource at its Mara Rosa Project in the mining friendly jurisdiction of Goias State in Brazil. An Updated Pre-Feasibility Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for the Mara Rosa Project was filed on SEDAR on May 4, 2017. In addition, Amarillo has an advanced exploration project with excellent grades at Lavras do Sul, also in Brazil. A Mineral Resource Estimate Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for Lavras do Sul was filed on SEDAR on October 4, 2010. Both projects have excellent nearby infrastructure. The Mara Rosa Project was awarded the main permit (LP) that gives social and environment permission to mine. This has allowed Amarillo to move forward and work on the installation permit (LI) for the Mara Rosa Project.\nFor further information, please contact: Mike Mutchler or Karen Mate President & CEO External Communications 416-294-0736 416-230-6454 mike.mutchler@amarillogold.com karen.mate@amarillogold.com 32 Richmond St. East Suite 201 Toronto, ON Canada, M5C 1P1 Website: www.amarillogold.com Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nThis news release contains Forward Looking Statements regarding the Company’s current expectations regarding future events, including with respect to the Company’s business, operations and condition, management’s objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions.
