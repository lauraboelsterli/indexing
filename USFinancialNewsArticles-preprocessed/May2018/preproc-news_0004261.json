    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Griffon Corporation (NYSE:GFF) (the “Company” or “Griffon”) today reported results for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue was $478.6 million, an increase of 25% from the prior year quarter. Home & Building Products (“HBP”) revenue increased 39% and, as expected, Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\") revenue decreased 16% compared to the prior year quarter.\nIncome from continuing operations was $2.0 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.05 per share, in the prior year quarter. Current quarter results included acquisition related costs of $0.8 million ($0.4 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per share) and a provision, net, for certain tax items which affect comparability (see tax section below) of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share. The prior year quarter results included a discrete tax provision, net, of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share. Excluding these items from the respective quarterly results, income from continuing operations would have been $2.7 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $2.4 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior year quarter.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $43.8 million, an increase of 11% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by HBP revenue growth, partially offset by the impact of Telephonics' revenue decline. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and unallocated amounts (mainly corporate overhead), restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable.\nRonald J. Kramer, Chairman and CEO, commented, \"We are pleased with our solid performance this quarter and are poised for a strong second half. Our HBP team continues to integrate our recent acquisitions, ClosetMaid, Kelkay, Harper Brush, Tuscan Path and La Hacienda, driving a 39% and 44% year-over-year increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Our defense electronics business, Telephonics, ended the second quarter with an increase in backlog to $358 million, confirming our expectation for an improved business environment for the second half of fiscal 2018.\"\nEarlier today, Griffon announced CBP entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CornellCookson, Inc. (\"CornellCookson\"), a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180 million. After taking into account tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170 million. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.15 in earnings per share in the first twelve months after the acquisition. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in June 2018.\nKramer added, \"The acquisition of CornellCookson significantly expands Clopay's existing portfolio of residential and commercial sectional doors with industry leading brands and products which positions us for continued growth and enhanced profitability.\"\nSegment Operating Results\nHome & Building Products\nRevenue was $396.3 million, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the acquisition of ClosetMaid and AMES' acquisitions of Tuscan Path, La Hacienda, Harper and Kelkay, as well as improved volume, favorable mix and price increases at CBP, partially offset by reduced sales at AMES US from unfavorable weather patterns.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $39.8 million, an increase of 44% compared to the prior year quarter driven by increased revenue as noted above.\nOn February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay Limited (“Kelkay”), a United Kingdom manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to leading garden centers, retailers and grocers in the UK and Ireland, for approximately $56 million (GBP $41 million), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Kelkay is expected to contribute approximately $40 million in annualized revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nTelephonics\nRevenue was $82.3 million, a decrease of 16% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to decreased maritime surveillance radar and various international radar programs.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million compared to $11.8 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the decreased revenue and revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain airborne intercommunications systems and various international radar programs.\nContract backlog was $358 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $351 million at September 30, 2017, with approximately 67% expected to be fulfilled within the next twelve months. During the quarter, Telephonics was awarded several new contracts and received incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $108 million.\nTaxes\nIn the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized a tax provision of $1.2 million on Income before taxes from continuing operations of $3.2 million, compared to $2.2 million on Income before taxes from continuing operations of $4.2 million in the comparable prior year quarter.\nThe quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 tax rates included net discrete tax provisions that affect comparability of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Excluding these tax items and the acquisition costs net of tax, the effective tax rates for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were 32.6% and 42.1%, respectively.\nU.S. Tax Reform: On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As Griffon has a September 30 fiscal year-end, the lower tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 24.5% for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. Subsequent fiscal years will reflect the 21% federal tax rate. However, there are offsets to the lower tax rate, the most significant being the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction and the deductibility of certain incentive compensation for executives. Griffon will continue to assess the impact of the Tax Act through the balance of fiscal 2018.\nClopay Plastics\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry Global, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) (\"Berry\") for $475 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Expenditures\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and equivalents of $236 million, total debt outstanding of $1,091 million, net of discounts and issuance costs, and $320.2 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility, subject to certain loan covenants. Capital expenditures were $10.8 million in the current quarter.\nShare Repurchases\nIn August 2016, Griffon’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of Griffon’s outstanding common stock. Under these programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During the six months ended March 31, 2017, Griffon purchased 1,438,239 shares of common stock under the August 2016 Board authorized program, for a total of $28.4 million or $19.76 per share. At March 31, 2018, $21.0 million remained under existing Board authorizations.\nFrom August 2011 to March 31, 2018, Griffon repurchased 21,867,537 shares of its common stock for a total of $290.0 million or $13.26 per share.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, May 3, 2018, at 4:30 PM ET.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing 1-866-548-4713 (U.S. participants) or 1-323-794-2093 (International participants).
