The annualized returns on average assets and average equity for the six months ended March 31, 2018 were 0.67% and 2.96%, respectively, compared to 1.03% and 4.70%, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nSince September 30, 2017, total assets decreased $3.37 million, or 2.47%, from $136.26 million to $132.89 million at March 31, 2018. Net loans decreased $2.02 million, from $99.65 million to $97.63 million while securities available-for-sale decreased $1.04 million, from $18.03 million to $16.99 million over the same period.\nDeposits decreased $1.45 million, or 1.74%, from $83.67 million at September 30, 2017 to $82.22 million at March 31, 2018.

The book value of Gouverneur Bancorp, Inc. was $13.60 per common share based on 2,176,908 shares outstanding at March 31, 2018. On March 30, 2018, the Company paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.17 per share to public shareholders of record on March 15, 2018.

Van Vleet, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am pleased to announce that Gouverneur Savings & Loan continues to perform well. As reported in January, the Bank took a negative one-time adjustment to net income at the end of the first quarter due to the tax law changes of December 2017. However, we expect the change will be offset by the lower tax rate and internal strategies that have already partially offset the adjustment. We continue to explore new services, income sources, and options for controlling expenses where appropriate.\nThe Company, which is headquartered in Gouverneur, New York, is the holding company for Gouverneur Savings and Loan Association. Founded in 1892, the Bank is a New York State chartered savings and loan association offering a variety of banking products and services to individuals and businesses in its primary market area in southern St. Lawrence and northern Lewis and Jefferson Counties in New York State.\nStatements in this news release contain as that term is defined in the Private 1995. These statements are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made using information currently available to management.

Therefore, actual future results may differ significantly from results discussed in the due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in the documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nFor more information, contact Charles C.
