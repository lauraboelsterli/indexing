    "text": "NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Speculators’ net short dollar bets fell to a seven-week low in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.\nThe value of the net short dollar positions, derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars, was $15.15 billion in the week to May 1.\nThat compares with a net short position of $19.77 billion the previous week.\nTo be short a currency means traders believe it will fall in value.\nSwiss franc net shorts, meanwhile, grew to 19,456 contracts, the most since February, CFTC data showed.\nSpeculators’ bets on the Japanese yen swung to a net short position of 1,405 contracts.\nSpeculators’ net short position on bitcoin CBOE futures shrank to 1,597 contracts, from 1,829 contracts the previous week, the data showed.
