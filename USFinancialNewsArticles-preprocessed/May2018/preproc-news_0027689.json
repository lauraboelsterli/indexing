Slideshow (5 Images)\nFor much of the match, City, who fielded four changes from midweek and played Raheem Sterling at centre forward, struggled to find their familiar rhythm and failed to register a single shot on target in the first half.\nDusan Tadic had an effort cleared off the line in the second half when City brought on Phil Foden and Brahim Diaz to ensure the pair notched up their fifth Premier League appearances of the season to qualify for a medal.\nSaints looked to have secured the draw but, with virtually the final kick of the game, Jesus produced a perfect lobbed finish to spark wild City celebrations.
