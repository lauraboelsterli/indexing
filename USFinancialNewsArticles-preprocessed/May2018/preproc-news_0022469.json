    "text": "SINGAPORE, May 7 (Reuters) - Singapore’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd posted a 29 percent rise in quarterly profit on Monday, underpinned by strong growth in net interest income and wealth management.\nThe city-state’s second-biggest listed lender said net profit came in at S$1.11 billion ($832 million) in the three months ended March 31 versus S$861 million a year ago.\nIt fell short of the average estimate of S$1.18 billion from five analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters.\nNet interest margin rose 5 basis points to 1.67 percent.\nSome of OCBC’s year-ago numbers were restated as it said Singapore-incorporated companies listed on the Singapore Exchange were required to adopt a new financial reporting framework.
