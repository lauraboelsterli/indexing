(Nasdaq:SRCL) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR:\nRevenues of $895.0 million, an increase of 0.3%, driven by continued growth in Secure Information Destruction, Retail Hazardous Waste and Hospital Compliance Services\nGross profit of $358.5 million, a decrease of 2.8%, given the expected impact of pricing of small quantity medical waste customers\nDiluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.25, a decrease of 59.7%, due to certain non-recurring adjusted items partially offset by the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) of $1.21, an increase of 11.0%, as a result of strong performance in the quarter and the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform\nFIRST-QUARTER RESULTS\nRevenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $895.0 million, an increase of 0.3% from $892.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Acquisitions contributed $7.1 million to revenues. Divestitures reduced revenues by $10.8 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 1.0% compared to the first quarter of last year. Organic revenues decreased 0.6%, or decreased 0.9% when adjusted for Manufacturing and Industrial Services. Organic revenues were driven by continued growth in Secure Information Destruction, Retail Hazardous Waste and Hospital Compliance Services, offset by the expected impact of pricing of small quantity medical waste customers. See Tables 1-A and 1-B.\n“We are off to a strong start in 2018. All of our service lines delivered solid top line performance at or above plan. We also made meaningful progress executing on our Business Transformation, achieving multiple milestones across several key work streams and delivering $8.0 million in recurring Adjusted EBITDA savings for the quarter,” said Charles A. Alutto, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nGross profit was $358.5 million, a decrease of 2.8% from $368.7 million in the first quarter of last year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 40.1% compared to 41.3% in the first quarter of last year, given the expected impact of pricing of small quantity medical waste customers. See Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDiluted EPS decreased 59.7% to $0.25 from $0.62 in the first quarter of last year, due to certain non-recurring adjusted items partially offset by the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted EPS increased 11.0% to $1.21 from $1.09 in the first quarter of last year, as a result of strong performance in the quarter and the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform. See Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Table 2.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter, inclusive of $22.1 million of Business Transformation pre-tax charges, was $110.4 million, down 34.4% from $168.3 million in the same period last year. For the quarter, the Company primarily allocated cash from operations as follows: $55.6 million reduction in net debt; $28.5 million for capital expenditures; $15.9 million for acquisitions; $8.8 million in dividends to its preferred shareholders; and $7.4 million for preferred share repurchases.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nStericycle today updated its financial outlook for the full-year 2018, as summarized in the following table.\n(In millions, except per share data) Revenues $3,500 - $3,640 Regulated Waste and Compliance Services $1,935 - $1,975 Secure Information Destruction Services $875 - $915 Communication and Related Services $355 - $385 Manufacturing and Industrial Services $335 - $365 Income from Operations $328 - $333 Adjusted EBITDA (a) $760 - $810 Interest Expense $100 - $105 Tax Rate 25.5% - 26.0% Depreciation $130 - $140 Intangible Amortization $120 - $130 Diluted Earnings Per Share $1.78 - $1.89 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share $4.45 - $4.85 Shares Outstanding 90.5 Net Cash from Operating Activities $510 - $560 Capital Expenditures $160 - $180 Free Cash Flow $330 - $400 (a) Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding certain specified items, Depreciation and Intangible Amortization.\nThe Company’s outlook is based on currently known items and certain business assumptions including $0.17 from the repurchase of preferred shares and using foreign exchange rates as of the end of March 2018. The outlook also includes acquisitions, divestitures and charges for non-recurring litigation matters through the most recent period presented, but does not include amounts related to future acquisitions, divestitures or non-recurring litigation matters as the Company is not able to forecast these items without unreasonable effort.

Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.\n(b) Manufacturing and Industrial Services (M&I) is a customer subset prevalent in our Environmental Solutions business as well as some international markets. M&I has historically experienced greater volatility in Revenues from period-to-period due to more pervasive market movements in customer industrial sectors such as oil and energy and the nature and timing of customer project work. As a result, management believes it is meaningful to present Revenues with and without M&I Revenues as this aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of a more volatile aspect of the business.\nWe believe these measures provide greater transparency into Stericycle’s Revenues and related results of operations. Management uses these measures internally to monitor business unit performance and in evaluating management performance. These measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTable 2: THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Selling, General\nand\nAdministrative\nExpenses Income from\nOperations (b) Net Income\nAttributable to\nCommon\nShareholders (c) Diluted\nEarnings Per\nShare U.S. GAAP Financial Measures $ 304.4 $ 54.1 $ 21.0 $ 0.25 Adjustments: Business Transformation (1) (22.1 ) 22.1 16.4 0.19 Intangible Amortization (2) (31.9 ) 31.9 23.7 0.28 Acquisition and Integration (3) (4.1 ) 4.1 3.2 0.04 Operational Optimization (4) (8.9 ) 8.9 6.6 0.07 Divestitures (5) (4.1 ) 4.1 3.7 0.04 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (6) (27.5 ) 27.5 20.3 0.23 Capital Allocation (7) - - 10.8 0.06 Other (8) (5.8 ) 5.8 4.4 0.05 Adjusted Financial Measures (a) $ 200.0 $ 158.5 $ 110.1 $ 1.21\n(In millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Selling, General\nand\nAdministrative\nExpenses Income from\nOperations (b) Net Income\nAttributable to\nCommon\nShareholders (c) Diluted\nEarnings Per\nShare U.S. GAAP Financial Measures $ 254.2 $ 114.5 $ 53.4 $ 0.62 Adjustments: Business Transformation (1) - - - - Intangible Amortization (2) (29.1 ) 29.1 19.0 0.22 Acquisition and Integration (3) (11.5 ) 11.5 7.7 0.09 Operational Optimization (4) (10.9 ) 10.9 7.3 0.09 Divestitures (5) - - - - Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance (6) (1.9 ) 1.9 1.1 0.01 Capital Allocation (7) - - 9.4 0.04 Other (8) (2.5 ) 2.5 1.5 0.02 Adjusted Financial Measures (a) $ 198.3 $ 170.4 $ 99.4 $ 1.09 U.S. GAAP results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 include:\n(1) Business Transformation\n2018: Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include $18.2 million of consulting and professional services, $2.5 million of Transformation Management office charges for internal resources and project related incentive compensation, and $1.4 million of other related expenses.\n2017: No Business Transformation initiatives during the first quarter of 2017.\n(2) Intangible Amortization\n2018 and 2017: SG&A includes $31.9 million and $29.1 million, respectively, of intangible amortization expense from acquisitions.\n(3) Acquisition and Integration\n2018: SG&A includes $1.6 million of acquisition expenses, $2.0 million of integration expenses, and a $0.5 million unfavorable change in fair value of contingent consideration. During the first quarter of 2018, we completed 9 acquisitions.\n2017: SG&A includes $2.4 million of acquisition expenses, $8.7 million of integration expenses, and a $0.4 million unfavorable change in fair value of contingent consideration. During the first quarter of 2017, we made 13 acquisitions.\n(4) Operational Optimization\n2018: SG&A includes $3.0 million of charges in the U.S. of which $1.6 million represents lease exit costs related to the closure/consolidation of call centers in our Domestic Communication and Related Services business and $1.4 million relates to charges to improve operational efficiency such as optimizing overall logistics and sales functions primarily for our Secure Information Destruction locations; $5.9 million of international charges of which $4.7 million represents non-cash impairment charges for long-lived assets, customer relationships and operating permits, $0.9 million relates to lease exit costs, and $0.3 million relates to employee terminations.\n2017: SG&A includes $8.7 million of charges in the U.S. of which $7.1 million relates to charges to improve operational efficiency such as optimizing overall logistics and sales functions primarily for our Secure Information Destruction locations, $0.7 million represents lease exit costs related to the closure/consolidation of call centers in our Domestic Communication and Related Services business, $0.5 million relates to employee terminations, and $0.4 million represents a non-cash impairment charge related to an operating permit; $1.6 million of charges to exit certain of our patient transport services contracts and plant conversion expense in the U.K.; and $0.6 million of operational optimization costs in Latin America, primarily for employee terminations.\n(5) Divestitures\n2018: SG&A includes $4.1 million of non-cash asset impairment charges arising from changes in the fair value of assets held for sale in the U.K.\n2017: No divestiture related charges during the first quarter of 2017.\n(6) Litigation, Settlements, and Regulatory Compliance\n2018 and 2017: SG&A includes $27.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in regulatory compliance, consulting and professional services, primarily related to certain non-recurring litigation matters.\n(7) Capital Allocation\n2018 Interest expense, net includes $2.7 million of pre-tax debt modification charges related to amending our credit agreements in connection with certain non-recurring matters.\n2018 and 2017 includes dividends on our Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock of $8.8 million and $9.4 million, respectively.\nFor the purpose of calculating the ultimate EPS impact of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, we show the impact by excluding the mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend and using the “if-converted” method of share dilution. This provides insight to how our diluted share count will be affected after these preferred shares are converted to common shares.\nThe impact of excluding the preferred stock dividend from Adjusted Diluted EPS is $0.10 and $0.11 for the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in diluted shares outstanding under the “if-converted” method is 4.9 million and 5.3 million for the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe impact of all adjusted items under the “if-converted” method to our Adjusted Diluted EPS has a dilutive effect of $0.06 and $0.07 for the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(8) Other\n2018 and 2017: SG&A includes $5.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of consulting and professional services related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition and lease accounting standards as well as internal control remediation activities.\n(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain specified items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.\n(b) Income from Operations and Adjusted Income from Operations provide the basis for other financial measures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Income from Operations to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA):\n(In millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Income from Operations $ 54.1 $ 114.5 Depreciation 30.8 29.1 Intangible Amortization 31.9 29.1 EBITDA $ 116.8 $ 172.7 The following table presents the calculation of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA):\n(In millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted Income from Operations $ 158.5 $ 170.4 Depreciation 30.8 29.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 189.3 $ 199.5 (c) Under the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $26.8 million and $19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on applying either the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis.\nTable 3: RECONCILIATION OF 2018 U.S. GAAP TO ADJUSTED FINANCIAL OUTLOOK (In millions, except per share data) 2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Income from\nOperations Diluted Earnings\nPer Share U.S. GAAP Financial Measures $328 - $333 $1.78 - $1.89 Adjustments: Business Transformation $95 - $105 $0.82 - $0.90 Intangible Amortization $120 - $130 $1.03 - $1.12 Acquisition and Integration $15 - $20 $0.13 - $0.17 Operational Optimization $15 - $20 $0.13 - $0.17 Divestitures $4 $0.04 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance $28 $0.23 Capital Allocation $0 $0.08 Other $25 - $30 $0.21 - $0.25 Adjusted Financial Measures (a) $630 - $670 $4.45 - $4.85 Adjusted Income from Operations $630 - $670 Depreciation $130 - $140 Adjusted EBITDA (b) $760 - $810 The Company’s outlook is based on currently known items and certain business assumptions including $0.17 from the repurchase of preferred shares and using foreign exchange rates as of the end of March 2018.
