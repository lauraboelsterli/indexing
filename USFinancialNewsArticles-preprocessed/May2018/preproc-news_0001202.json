(Nasdaq:CARG), a leading global automotive marketplace, today announced financial results ended March 31, 2018.\n“The first quarter was a strong start to 2018, highlighted by strong listing subscription bookings and performance that drove both revenue and profitability above our guidance,” said Langley Steinert, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CarGurus. “CarGurus also became the largest automotive shopping website in the U.S. as measured by unique monthly visitors. Our site’s popularity affirms that our differentiated, transparent offering is working for consumers and our scale allows us to continue to grow the value we provide to dealers.”\nRevenue\nFirst Quarter 2018:\nTotal revenue was $98.7 million, an increase of 47% compared to $67.0 million in 2017. Marketplace subscription revenue was $89.3 million, an increase of 48% compared to $60.2 million in 2017.

Non-GAAP net income was $6.6 million, or $0.06 per share based on 113.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018, compared to $4.1 million or $0.04 per share based on 106.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017, in 2017.

GAAP operating income in the U.S. was $11.6 million, a decrease of 4% compared to $12.1 million in 2017. The decrease in GAAP operating income from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. International revenue was $3.5 million in 2018, an increase of 119% compared to $1.6 million in 2017. GAAP operating loss in International markets was ($7.7) million, an increase of 33% compared to a loss of ($5.7) million in 2017. Total paying dealers were 29,026 at March 31, 2018, an increase of 24% compared to 23,429 at March 31, 2017. Of the total paying dealers at March 31, 2018, U.S. and International accounted for 26,261 and 2,765, respectively, compared to 22,081 and 1,348, respectively, at March 31, 2017. Average annual revenue per subscribing dealer (AARSD) in the U.S. was $12,470 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 17% compared to $10,700 as of March 31, 2017. AARSD in International markets was $5,045 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 15% compared to $4,401 as of March 31, 2017. Website traffic and consumer engagement metrics of 2018 grew as follows: U.S. average monthly unique users were 30.8 million, an increase of 33% compared to 23.1 million in 2017. U.S. average monthly sessions were 84.8 million, an increase of 37% compared to 61.9 million in 2017. International average monthly unique users were 3.5 million, an increase of 64% compared to 2.1 million in 2017. International average monthly sessions were 8.1 million, an increase of 68% compared to 4.8 million in 2017.\nRecent Business Developments\nCarGurus emerged as the leading automotive shopping website in the U.S. based on the following key audience metrics measured by comScore Media Metrix Multi Platform ratings (March 2018):\nLargest Automotive Shopping Site: Total unique monthly visitors 1 Most Mobile Traffic: Total unique monthly mobile visitors 2 Most Visited Automotive Shopping Site: Total visits 1 Most Engaged Shoppers: Average minutes per unique visitor 3 Most Shopping Time Spent: Total minutes 1\n1 comScore Media Metrix® Multi Platform, March 2018, U.S., Automotive\n2 comScore Mobile Metrix®, March 2018, U.S., Automotive\n3 comScore Media Metrix® Multi Platform, March 2018, U.S. (competitive set includes CarGurus.com , Cars.com, AutoTrader.com , and TrueCar.com )\nSecond Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Guidance\nCarGurus anticipates total revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the following ranges:\nSecond Quarter 2018:\n• Total revenue $103 to $104 million • Non-GAAP operating income $4 to $5 million • Non-GAAP EPS $0.03 to $0.04 The second quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share calculation assumes 115.4 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nFull-Year 2018:\n• Total revenue $415 to $418 million • Non-GAAP operating income $25 to $28 million • Non-GAAP EPS $0.19 to $0.21\nThe full-year non-GAAP earnings per share calculation assumes 115.5 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018 does not include any potential impact of foreign exchange gains or losses.\nCarGurus has not reconciled its non-GAAP operating income guidance to GAAP operating income, or its non-GAAP EPS guidance to GAAP EPS, because stock-based compensation, the reconciling item between such GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, cannot be reasonably predicted due to timing, amount, valuation and number of future employee awards and therefore is not available without unreasonable effort. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see the reconciliations of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures and the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Business Metrics\" below.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCarGurus will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results and second quarter and full fiscal year 2018 financial guidance at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, May 3, 2018.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information and other business metrics is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. While our non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics are an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, when applicable. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations, adjusted to include purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of website development costs. We have presented Free Cash Flow because it is a measure of the Company’s financial performance that represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after expenditures required to maintain or expand our asset base.\nWe also monitor operating measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nWhile a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, stock-based compensation expenses that we may incur in the future, we have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and other business metrics to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial statement tables included in this press release.\nWe define a paying dealer as a dealer, based on a distinct associated inventory feed, that subscribes to our Enhanced or Featured Listing product at the end of a defined period.\nWe define AARSD, as measured at the end of a defined period, as the total marketplace subscription revenue during the trailing 12 months divided by the average number of paying dealers during the same trailing 12-month period.\nFor each of our websites, we define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited such website within a calendar month, based on data as measured by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. We count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses a website during a calendar month. If an individual accesses a website using a different device within a given month, the first access by each such device is counted as a separate unique user.\nWe define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by Google Analytics. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a given period, divided by the number of months in that period. A session is defined as beginning with the first page view from a device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window, after 30 minutes of inactivity, or at midnight Eastern Time each night. A session can be made up of multiple page views and visitor actions, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer.\nInvestor Contact:\nMarc Griffin\nICR, Inc., for CarGurus, Inc.\n888-508-1190\ninvestors@cargurus.com\nSource:CarGurus, Inc.",
