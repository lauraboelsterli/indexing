He walked two and struck out eight.\nKuhl went 4 2/3 innings, allowing six runs (four earned) and four hits. He walked two and struck out three.\nAdams, Harper and Turner finished with three RBIs apiece for the Nationals, who supported Scherzer with 15 runs in his last start, a 15-2 win at San Francisco.\nAdams, who had three hits, and Difo, who had two, scored three times apiece, helping Washington win for the third time in five games on their 10-game homestand.\nMax Moroff completed the scoring for Pittsburgh with a two-run homer, his first of the season, for the Pirates in the ninth.\nBell and Colin Moran had two hits apiece for the Pirates, who have begun a nine-game trip with consecutive losses.\nThe Nationals out-hit the Pirates 10-8.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
