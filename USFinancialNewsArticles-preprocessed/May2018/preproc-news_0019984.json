Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to reveal at the White House on Tuesday his decision on whether the U.S. will withdraw from the Obama -era Iran nuclear deal.\nMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that Trump intended to pull out of the deal . Oil prices were volatile ahead of the announcement.\nTrump has long criticized the deal, which involves lifting some sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country giving up much of its nuclear material, and has expressed a desire to pull the U.S. out of it. The president has said the deal is far more beneficial for Iran than it is for the U.S .\nWithdrawing from the deal would restore the sanctions.\nThe Tuesday event was first announced by Trump himself in a Monday tweet.\nTrump tweet",
