    "text": "Comparable Restaurant Sales Have Now Increased Five Consecutive Months at Pollo and Turned Positive at Taco Cabana in April\nApril Comparable Restaurant Sales Increased 2.8% at Pollo Tropical and 0.9% at Taco Cabana\nRestaurant Margins Improved at Pollo Tropical\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Fiesta” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FRGI), parent company of the Pollo Tropical® and Taco Cabana® restaurant brands, today reported results for the 13-week first quarter of 2018, which ended on April 1, 2018.\nFiesta President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Stockinger said, “Last year, we developed and began implementing our Strategic Renewal Plan (the “Plan”) in earnest, starting with Pollo Tropical and following a few months later with Taco Cabana. We believe our Plan is driving intended operational and improvements.”\nMr. Stockinger continued, “For the past five consecutive months, comparable restaurant sales at Pollo Tropical increased, including comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.8% in April. As part of the Plan, we conducted consumer research in multiple markets to develop and validate our strategic positioning, service standards and menu innovation. We initially prioritized much of our Plan implementation in Pollo Tropical’s core markets where we generated system-leading comparable restaurant sales growth in the first quarter. An important new product platform for Pollo Tropical, hand-battered crispy citrus-marinated chicken, has been extremely successful, with broad appeal across all markets. More work needs to be done, but we believe we are establishing a promising foundation for future expansion.”\nMr. Stockinger added, “The early indicators of Taco Cabana’s revitalization are mirroring what we experienced at Pollo Tropical, including improving guest and social media scores, fewer guest complaints and growing guest compliments. While still early, we are encouraged by April comparable restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Similar to Pollo Tropical, Taco Cabana’s consumer research has helped us to develop our brand positioning and related initiatives, including a focus on tacos with improved proteins, flavorful toppings and the successful reintroduction of Texas brisket. Leading up to our Taco Cabana brand re-launch this summer, we are implementing additional brand enhancements which we believe will continue to build our business momentum and improve restaurant margins.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal revenues decreased 3.5% from the prior year period to $169.5 million due primarily to closing unprofitable restaurants and comparable restaurant sales declines at Taco Cabana, partially offset by comparable restaurant sales growth at Pollo Tropical; Comparable restaurant sales at Pollo Tropical increased 1.1%. Comparable restaurant sales were negatively impacted by approximately 0.4% related to the fiscal calendar shift of New Year’s Day and Easter; Comparable restaurant sales at Taco Cabana decreased 1.7%. Comparable restaurant sales were negatively impacted by approximately 1.6% related to the reduction of overnight operating hours and by approximately 0.4% related to the fiscal calendar shift of New Year’s Day and Easter; Net income of $4.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to the prior year period net loss of $(15.1) million, or $(0.56) per diluted share; Adjusted net income of $4.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to the prior year period adjusted net income of $6.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share (see non-GAAP reconciliation table below); and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $17.0 million compared to the prior year period Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $21.2 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation table below). The decrease in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million was primarily driven by the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA at Taco Cabana of $4.0 million compared to the prior year period.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Brand Results\nPollo Tropical restaurant sales decreased 4.9% to $94.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period due primarily to 34 fewer Company-owned restaurants in operation compared to the prior year period as a result of closing unprofitable restaurants, partially offset by a comparable restaurant sales increase of 1.1%. The increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from a 3.4% increase in average check, partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in comparable restaurant transactions. Comparable restaurant sales and transactions were negatively impacted by the fiscal calendar shift of New Year’s Day and Easter. The increase in average check was primarily driven by menu price increases that positively impacted restaurant sales, higher priced promotions and add-on sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Pollo Tropical decreased to $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the impact of an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales and higher repairs and maintenance costs primarily driven by the initiatives under the Plan, partially offset by higher comparable restaurant sales, lower advertising costs and the impact of closing unprofitable restaurants in 2017.\nTaco Cabana restaurant sales decreased 1.7% to $74.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period due to a comparable restaurant sales decrease of 1.7%. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an 11.3% decrease in comparable restaurant transactions, partially offset by a 9.6% increase in average check. Comparable restaurant transactions were negatively impacted primarily by the elimination of deep discounting related to the repositioning of the brand, the reduction in overnight operating hours and the fiscal calendar shift of New Years’ Day and Easter. The increase in average check was primarily driven by positive sales mix associated with higher priced promotions and new menu items related to the repositioning of the brand, and menu price increases.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Taco Cabana decreased to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the impact of lower comparable restaurant sales, higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales and higher repairs and maintenance costs primarily driven by the initiatives under the Plan, and higher restaurant wages and related expenses, partially offset by lower advertising costs.\nCapital Allocation\nAnticipated capital expenditures in 2018 include opening seven to eight new Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and seven to eight new Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas. Up to five of the new Taco Cabana restaurants are expected to come from converting closed Pollo Tropical restaurants. Total capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be $60.0 million to $70.0 million, including $22.0 million to $25.0 million for the development of new restaurants.\nRestaurant Portfolio\nAs of April 1, 2018, there were 146 Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants, 166 Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants, 31 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Guyana, Panama and Venezuela and seven franchised Taco Cabana restaurants in the U.S. There were no restaurant openings during the first quarter of 2018.\nInvestor Conference Call Today\nFiesta will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings attributable to the applicable operating segments before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges, stock-based compensation expense, other expense (income), net, and certain significant items for each segment that are related to strategic changes and/or are not related to the ongoing operation of our restaurants as set forth in the reconciliation table below. Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses associated with administrative support for executive management, information systems and certain finance, legal, supply chain, human resources, construction and other administrative functions. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding franchise royalty revenues and fees, pre-opening costs and general and administrative expenses (including corporate-level general and administrative expenses).\nAdjusted EBITDA for each of our segments is the primary measure of segment profit or loss used by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. In addition, management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations calculated in accordance with GAAP and our reconciliation of net income (loss) to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA (i) provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period changes, (ii) provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our business, and (iii) permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

For fiscal years beginning January 1, 2018, our federal statutory tax rate is 21% as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") in December 2017. (b) Impairment and other lease charges ended April 1, 2018, primarily consist of a $(0.6) million and a $(0.1) million net benefit related to lease charge recoveries for Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana, respectively, due primarily to a lease termination, a lease assignment, subleases and other adjustments to estimates of future lease costs. Impairment and other lease charges ended April 2, 2017 primarily include impairment charges of $32.0 million primarily related to the 30 Pollo Tropical restaurants that were subsequently closed during the second quarter of 2017, seven of which were initially impaired in 2016. For the three months ended April 2, 2017, the Company also recognized impairment charges of $0.3 million with respect to three underperforming Taco Cabana restaurants. (c) Other expense (income), net for three months ended April 1, 2018 includes the write-off of site costs primarily related to a location that we decided not to develop and costs for the removal, transfer and storage of equipment from closed restaurants, partially offset by a gain on the sale of a closed restaurant property. Other expense (income), net ended April 2, 2017, includes the write-off of site costs related to locations that we decided not to develop, and costs for the removal of signs and equipment related to closed Pollo Tropical restaurants. (d) Unused pre-production costs ended April 2, 2017, include costs for advertising pre-production that were not used.
