    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intevac, Inc. (Nasdaq: IVAC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“In the first quarter, we continued to make good progress in our Thin-film Equipment growth initiatives, which support the future revenue growth trajectory of our company,” commented Wendell Blonigan, president and chief executive officer of Intevac. “We announced the adoption of our oDLC ® protective coating on a portion of a Top-3 Cellphone maker’s recently-launched flagship handsets, protecting the vibrant and striking decorative color coatings deposited on the outside of the backside cover glass. In addition, we are finalizing an agreement with a new Top-3 cover glass manufacturer to install a VERTEX ® system by mid-year and co-market the capability to their customer base, which includes the world’s leading handset makers.\n“The demand for technology upgrades in the hard disk drive market continues to drive favorable results for our core HDD business, which we expect will see similarly strong results in 2018, compared to 2017. Our expectations for revenues from the solar market remain consistent from last quarter. Given developments over the last two months, in both Photonics and new Thin-film Equipment initiatives, our revenue outlook for 2018 has moderated since our last forecast. In Photonics, we have experienced some delays in funded R&D releases, as well a temporary production slowdown in the Joint Strike Fighter program. We also now believe the application we have been working on, driving near-term opportunities with the VERTEX, will require our oDLC 2.0 solution. Our oDLC 2.0 offers additional functionality for certain types of scratch damage, and includes integration with other value-added film stacks such as anti-reflective and decorative coatings. Migrating to oDLC 2.0 will require customer qualification and acceptance on new VERTEX systems, resulting in revenue on the majority of forecasted VERTEX orders moving out of 2018. Therefore, after three straight years of revenue growth, we now expect a pause in 2018. Despite this pause, our growth story remains very much intact, and we believe the execution of our growth initiatives in 2018 will drive the resumption of growth in 2019.”\n($ Millions, except per share amounts) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 GAAP Results Non-GAAP Results GAAP Results Non-GAAP Results Net Revenues $ 18.0 $ 18.0 $ 30.4 $ 30.4 Operating Income (Loss) $ (5.1) $ (5.0) $ 2.1 $ 2.2 Net Income (Loss) $ (5.1) $ (5.0) $ 1.8 $ 1.9 Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Share $ (0.23) $ (0.23) $ 0.08 $ 0.08 Intevac’s non-GAAP adjusted results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: (1) changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with business combinations; and (2) restructuring charges. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in the financial table included in this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary\nThe net loss was $5.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The non-GAAP net loss was $5.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This compares to the first quarter 2017 non-GAAP income of $1.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share.\nRevenues were $18.0 million, including $12.8 million of TFE revenues and Photonics revenues of $5.2 million. TFE revenues consisted of one 200 Lean ® HDD system, upgrades, spares and service. Photonics revenues consisted of $2.7 million of product sales and $2.5 million of research and development contracts. In the first quarter of 2017, revenues were $30.4 million, including $21.5 million of TFE revenues which consisted of four VERTEX coating systems for display cover panels, one 200 Lean HDD system, upgrades, spares and service and Photonics revenues of $8.9 million, which included $6.9 million of product sales and $2.0 million of research and development contracts.\nTFE gross margin was 35.6%, compared to 43.1% in the first quarter of 2017, and compared to 45.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline from the first quarter of 2017 and from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to lower revenue levels and lower factory absorption. Photonics gross margin was 6.2%, compared to 42.6% in the first quarter of 2017 and 26.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline from the first quarter of 2017 and from the fourth quarter of 2017 was due lower revenue levels, a higher-mix of lower margin research and development contracts, lower margins on technology development contracts and incremental loss provisions recorded on several contracts. Consolidated gross margin was 27.1%, compared to 42.9% in the first quarter of 2017 and 39.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nR&D and SG&A expenses were $10.0 million and were down compared to $10.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and up from $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOrder backlog totaled $66.9 million on March 31, 2018, compared to $64.0 million on December 30, 2017 and $73.0 million on April 1, 2017. Backlog at March 31, 2018 included two 200 Lean HDD systems and twelve ENERGi ® solar ion implant systems. Backlog at December 30, 2017 included three 200 Lean HDD systems and twelve ENERGi solar ion implant systems. Backlog at April 1, 2017 included three 200 Lean HDD systems, one INTEVAC MATRIX ® solar system and fourteen ENERGi solar ion implant systems.\nThe Company ended the quarter with $40.7 million of total cash, restricted cash and investments and $77.2 million in tangible book value.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIntevac's non-GAAP results exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with business combinations and restructuring. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the financial tables included in this release.\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Intevac believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the Company’s business from the same perspective as the Company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will discuss its financial results and outlook in a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. PDT (4:30 p.m. EDT).
