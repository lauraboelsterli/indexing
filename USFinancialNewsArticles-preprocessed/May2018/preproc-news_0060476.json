    "text": "Wilmington, N.C., May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It’s well-known that the battle against head lice has gotten far more difficult in recent years as head lice have become immune to the chemical pesticides in the most popular lice products. The most recent study found that so-called “Super Lice” comprise 98 percent of head lice in most states.\nYou don’t have to tell that to Dena Black and Gil Ferrell, who are opening their second Lice Clinics of America® treatment center in Wilmington. She saw super lice infestations increase by 70 percent in South Charlotte, home of her first clinic.\n“With traditional treatments no longer working people are desperate for a solution,” Dena said. “One family drove four hours to our clinic, and they had been dealing with head lice for more than a year. We’re trying to make this fast, safe, effective solution available and convenient for more people.”\nLice Clinics of America – Wilmington , provides screening, diagnosis and treatment options for people infested with head lice. The clinic is staffed by certified operators of the AirAllé ® device, the only FDA-cleared medical device that kills head lice and lice eggs (nits) using just heated air.\n“We’re excited to bring this ‘one and done’ solution to families in the Wilmington area,” Dena said. “We have the only FDA-cleared medical device for head lice in North Carolina.”\nThe AirAllé device dehydrates lice and eggs in about an hour. It is a Class I medical device that has been clinically proven to kill live lice and more than 99 percent of eggs. Because no chemicals are used to kill lice, it is effective against pesticide-resistant lice.\nThrough her work with families and schools Dena has become aware of the growing problem of human trafficking in North Carolina. “When I realized we were treating boys and girls that are the same age that are targeted by human traffickers, it sickened me,” Dena said. “I knew that we needed to get involved and so we are proud supporters of Justice Ministries and $5 of every treatment goes to support this organization in the fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation in our community.”\nThe Wilmington clinic is located at 5725 Oleander Drive and is open seven days per week by appointment. AirAllé treatments come with a 30-day guarantee when all family members are treated or screened for head lice.\nThe new clinic is one of more than 350 clinics in the Lice Clinics of America network worldwide. With clinics in more than 33 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences, Inc.\nDena Black Lice Clinics of America - Wilmington 910-264-7141 info@liceclinicswilmington.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America",
