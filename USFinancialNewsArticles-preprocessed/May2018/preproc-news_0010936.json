    "text": "May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural merchant Bunge Ltd on Wednesday reported a loss for the first quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit, hurt by a devaluation of some oilseed crushing contracts.\nBunge said net loss available to shareholders was $29 million, or 21 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with a profit of $39 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe White Plains, New York-based company said net sales fell to $10.64 billion from $11.12 billion.
