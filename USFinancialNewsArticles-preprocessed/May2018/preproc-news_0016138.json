Corporate Services delivered 10% growth in revenues, driven by reduced churn as well as price increases for existing subscribers on our OTCQB market, and an uptick in new companies joining our OTCQX market. Market Data Licensing revenues saw a 7% increase over the prior period, with price increases and increased usage of our data file products, including our compliance data products, contributing to the increase. OTC Link revenues increased 1% over the prior year quarter, with higher U.S. trading volumes driving an increase in revenues from messages and revenues from our OTC Link ECN, offsetting continued attrition in our OTC Link ATS subscriber base. Operating expenses increased 8%, to $9.2 million, primarily due to an 11% increase in compensation and benefit costs. Net income increased 23%, to $3.7 million, driven by the increase in operating income and a decrease in the company's effective tax rate for the quarter from 28% to 18%, a result of the newly enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In recognition of the reduced rate of corporate tax payable, the Company awarded all employees a 3% increase in their 2018 base salary, in addition to our customary annual raises. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, increased 5%, to $5.5 million, or $0.46 per adjusted diluted share.\nBusiness Developments and News\nIn April 2018, launched our new Promotion Data File and enhanced our Compliance Analytics File, to provide broker-dealers and investment managers with efficient tools to track promotion activity in the OTC market. In March 2018, released our new Stock Promotion Flag, a new data point designed to enable investors to identify securities that are the subject of current promotional activity, and our new Shell Risk flag, each reinforcing our commitment to market surveillance programs that encourage better disclosure. In February 2018, welcomed the first Canadian-listed Regulation A+ company to our OTCQB market. In February 2018, launched our initiative with Issuer Direct Corporation, providing our corporate clients with access to a range of communications and compliance services via our OTCIQ platform. In February 2018, launched our new www.otcmarkets.com website featuring enhanced functionality and navigation, new compliance data elements and a mobile-friendly interface. In January 2018, added BMO InvestorLine, a leading broker in Canada, as a new distributor of OTC Markets' real-time Level 1+ Quote: s. As of May 1, 2018, our OTCQX market is exempt from state Blue Sky laws regarding secondary trading in thirty states and our OTCQB market is exempt in twenty-seven states. The Transfer Agent Verified Shares Program, launched in October 2016, provides investors with current and reliable share data on OTCQX, OTCQB and Pink securities. As of May 1, 2018, 18 transfer agents have joined the program, providing timely data on approximately 64% of the U.S. companies on the OTC market. Since its launch, our OTC Link ECN has added 6 new broker-dealer subscribers and enabled 22 existing OTC Link ATS subscribers for access to the OTC Link ECN.\nDividend Declaration – Quarterly Cash Dividend\nOTC Markets Group announced today that its Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 on its Class A common stock.
