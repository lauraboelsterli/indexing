    "text": "(Adds Innogy, McDermott, Eletrobras, Fortis; Updates Lilly, Canadian Tire Corp, Odebrecht)\nMay 10 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Thursday:\n** French manufacturing group Alstom said it had signed an agreement with General Electric to exit three joint ventures in return for a payment of 2.59 billion euros ($3.08 billion).\n** Eli Lilly and Co said it would buy Armo BioSciences Inc for about $1.6 billion to expand its portfolio of drugs that seeks to help the body’s immune system fight cancer as the drugmaker chases its rivals in a lucrative market.\n** Royal Dutch Shell will sell its stake in Amberjack Pipeline Co to its master limited partnership Shell Midstream Partners LP for $1.22 billion, the U.S. pipeline operator said.\n** Canadian Tire Corp will buy Norway-based Helly Hansen for C$985 million ($771.2 million) including debt, the retailer said, making a bigger push into high-end sportswear in a bid to diversify itself further.\n** India’s Fortis Healthcare Ltd said its board has accepted an offer from Hero Enterprise Investment Office and the Burman Family Office to invest in the cash-strapped hospital chain.\n** French oil and gas major Total said that it has agreed to buy up to 50.8 million shares of Clean Energy Corp’s common stock for $83.4 million, to become its largest stockholder with a 25 percent stake.\n** General Motors will stay in South Korea for at least 10 years and set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters in the country, government officials said, revealing terms of a deal aimed at rescuing the U.S. automaker’s struggling GM Korea unit.\n** Australian infrastructure fund IFM is in talks to sell its remaining 20 percent stake in German network operator 50Hertz to China’s State Grid after existing shareholder Elia snapped up the first 20 percent stake, sources said.\n** Innogy held off supporting a 4.9 billion euro ($5.9 billion) bid by German rival E.ON, saying it was not clear if a far-reaching asset swap with its parent RWE was fair for workers or minority shareholders.\n** Asmodee Group, the French maker of board game Catan and distributor of Pokemon cards in parts of Europe, is exploring a sale that could value it at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.\n** Offshore engineering firm McDermott International Inc will close its acquisition of Chicago Bridge and Iron Co NV, creating an integrated onshore and offshore services group that will expand its presence in the Middle East.\n** The tricky work of divvying up the three business segments of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA has been delaying an agreement to combine operations with Boeing Co , three people with knowledge of the matter said this week.\n** Brazilian creditors of conglomerate Odebrecht SA are leading the efforts to sell the group’s commuter rail unit Supervia Concessionaria de Transporte Ferroviario SA, as banks raise pressure on the corruption-ensnared group to accelerate asset sales, three people with knowledge of the matter said.\n** Brazil’s state-controlled power holding company Eletrobras could still manage to sell a group of power distribution subsidiaries in June, despite a tight schedule, the firm’s Chief Executive Wilson Ferreira Jr said.
