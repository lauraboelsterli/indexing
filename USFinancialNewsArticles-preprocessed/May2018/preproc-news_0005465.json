    "text": "0 COMMENTS Joshua Topolsky, the chief executive of the Outline, doesn’t want his digital-media company to get too big too fast.\nThe startup has closed a $5.15 million fundraising round, the company’s second, Mr. Topolsky said. The new financing values the Outline at $21.15 million, he said, up from the company’s $11 million valuation from the last round.\nThe latest round is relatively small compared with other recent raises in the digital-media sector, including Axios, which raised $20 million in November; theSkimm , which raised $12 million in March; and the Athletic, which raised $20 million in March.\nThat is by design, Mr. Topolsky said. The company, which was launched in December 2016 , deliberately raised a small round to avoid setting unreasonable expectations that are out-of-step with his vision for measured growth, he said.\nSome of the biggest players in the digital-media industry have struggled to meet investor expectations for significant revenue growth year after year, particularly as competition has increased for a growing pie of digital advertising sales. BuzzFeed, valued at $1.7 billion in 2016, and Vice Media, valued at $5.7 billion , both missed their revenue targets in 2017. Meanwhile, Mashable sold for $50 million , a fraction of its earlier valuation.\n“You see the industry; you see what’s happening,” Mr. Topolsky said. “We did not want to be another casualty in the world of media brands that have been overvalued and over-invested in.”\nThe Outline’s latest round was led by RRE Ventures, a New York-based early- and mid-stage venture-capital firm, Mr. Topolsky said. Other backers included Red Sea Ventures, Tegna Inc., Advancit Capital and NextView Ventures.\n“One of the reasons why we didn’t raise $25 million, or get as much money as possible, is we really want to create a sane business that’s scalable,” Mr. Topolsky said.\nMr. Topolsky said he told investors he was seeking to raise between $5 million and $8 million for this round. He said he also realized that an uptick in advertising revenue meant the company needed less outside investment.\nThe company, which drew 3 million unique visitors in April, according to its internal metrics, thinks the site will eventually reach an audience of between 10 and 20 million users, Mr. Topolsky said. So far, much of The Outline’s readership has proven to have higher-than-average education and wealth, he said.\nThe Outline plans to use the financing to hire more ad sales representatives, developers and editorial staffers, Mr. Topolsky said. The company, which has 30 employees, plans to add six to 10 people by the end of the year. It recently hired Evan Gotlib, previously senior vice president of sales at LittleThings, to be its chief revenue officer.\nMr. Topolsky said the company eventually plans to introduce sister brands to The Outline that will each have their own destinations, with the first one slated to launch sometime in 2019. The ultimate goal is to create a portfolio of prestige digital brands in the mode of Condé Nast’s print magazines, he said.\nIn recent months, the company has been focused on building out its ad sales staff to keep up with inbound advertiser interest, said Elias Rothblatt, the company’s chief operating officer. The company said it has signed deals with Samsung Electronics Co. , Belvedere, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and General Electric Co., he said.\nThe company is focused on cutting high-value direct deals with advertisers, and it has an average deal size of $120,000, Mr. Topolsky said. The Outline’s pitch to advertisers is focused on the quality of its audience, not its size, and sales representatives are touting higher-than-average advertising engagement metrics.",
