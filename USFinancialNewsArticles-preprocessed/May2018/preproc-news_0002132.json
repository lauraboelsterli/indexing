    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American:GORO) (the “Company” or “GRC”) reported production results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 of 6,647 ounces of gold and 425,884 ounces of silver, which along with base metal revenue generated $32.2 million in net revenue and $5.5 million, or $0.10 per share in net income for the quarter. Gold Resource Corporation is a gold and silver producer, developer and explorer with operations in Oaxaca, Mexico and Nevada, U.S.A. The Company has returned $110 million to its shareholders in monthly dividends since commercial production commenced July 1, 2010 and offers its shareholders the option to convert their cash dividends into physical gold and silver and take delivery.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\n$5.5 million net income, or $0.10 per share $28.6 million cash and cash equivalents (a $6.2 million increase) $32.2 million net sales 6,647 gold ounces produced 425,884 silver ounces produced Negative $316 total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold (after by-product credits) $347 total all-in sustaining cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold $20.7 million base metal by-product credits, or $2,010 per precious metal gold ounce sold $0.3 million dividend distributions, or $0.005 per share for quarter\nOverview of Q1 2018 Results\nGold Resource Corporation sold 10,275 precious metal gold equivalent ounces at a total cash cost of negative $316 per ounce (after by-product credits), benefiting from strong base metal production and sales. Average realized metal prices during the quarter included $1,342 per ounce gold and $16.58 per ounce silver*. The Company recorded net income of $5.5 million, or $0.10 per share. The Company paid $0.3 million to its shareholders in dividends, or $0.005 per share during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $28.6 million.\nProduction totals for the first quarter of 2018 included 6,647 ounces of gold, 425,884 ounces of silver, 385 tonnes of copper, 1,615 tonnes of lead and 4,793 tonnes of zinc. The Company maintains its 2018 Annual Outlook, targeting a plus or minus 10 percent production of 27,000 gold ounces and 1,700,000 silver ounces.\n*Average realized metal prices include final settlement adjustments for previously unsettled provisional sales. Provisional sales may remain unsettled from one quarter into the next. Realized prices will therefore vary from average spot metal market prices upon final settlement.\nThe following Production Statistics table summarizes certain information about our mining operations for three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Arista Mine Milled Tonnes Milled 130,789 72,609 Grade Average Gold Grade (g/t) 1.92 2.69 Average Silver Grade (g/t) 106 187 Average Copper Grade (%) 0.39 0.39 Average Lead Grade (%) 1.63 1.59 Average Zinc Grade (%) 4.41 4.28 Recoveries Average Gold Recovery (%) 78 89 Average Silver Recovery (%) 91 93 Average Copper Recovery (%) 75 78 Average Lead Recovery (%) 76 80 Average Zinc Recovery (%) 83 85 Aguila Open Pit Milled Tonnes Milled 5,108 28,721 Grade Average Gold Grade (g/t) 2.16 1.73 Average Silver Grade (g/t) 45 30 Recoveries Average Gold Recovery (%) 84 73 Average Silver Recovery (%) 86 82 Alta Gracia Milled Tonnes Milled 3,192 - Grade Average Gold Grade (g/t) 1.16 - Average Silver Grade (g/t) 182 - Recoveries Average Gold Recovery (%) 60 - Average Silver Recovery (%) 82 - Combined Tonnes milled 139,089 101,330 Tonnes Milled per Day (1) 1,636 1,206 Mill production (before payable metal deductions) (2) Gold (ozs.) 6,647 6,747 Silver (ozs.) 425,884 427,890 Copper (tonnes) 385 220 Lead (tonnes) 1,615 927 Zinc (tonnes) 4,793 2,644 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces produced (mill production) (2) Gold Ounces 6,647 6,747 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 5,262 6,090 Total Precious Metal Gold Equivalent Ounces 11,909 12,837\nBased on actual days the mill operated during the period. Mill production represents metal contained in concentrates produced at the mill, which is before payable metal deductions are levied by the buyer of our concentrates. Payable metal deduction quantities are defined in our contracts with the buyer and represent an estimate of metal contained in the concentrates which the buyer deducts from payment. There are inherent limitations and differences in the sampling method and assaying of estimated metal contained in concentrates that are shipped, and those contained metal estimates are derived from sampling methods and assaying throughout the mill production process. We monitor these differences to ensure that precious metal mill production quantities are materially correct.\nThe following Sales Statistics table summarizes certain information about our combined mining operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Metal sold Gold (ozs.) 5,563 7,133 Silver (ozs.) 381,366 420,236 Copper (tonnes) 340 225 Lead (tonnes) 1,493 839 Zinc (tonnes) 3,778 2,149 Average metal prices realized (1) Gold ($ per oz.) 1,342 1,215 Silver ($ per oz.) 16.58 17.29 Copper ($ per tonne) 7,156 5,871 Lead ($ per tonne) 2,573 2,351 Zinc ($ per tonne) 3,805 2,839 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold Gold Ounces 5,563 7,133 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 4,712 5,981 Total Precious Metal Gold Equivalent Ounces 10,275 13,114 Total cash cost before by-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (2) $ 1,694 $ 980 Total cash (credit) cost after by-product credits per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (2) (3) $ (316 ) $ 263 Total all-in sustaining cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (2) $ 347 $ 672 Total all-in cost per precious metal gold equivalent ounce sold (2) $ 395 $ 701\nAverage metal prices realized vary from the market metal prices due to final settlement adjustments from our provisional invoices when they are settled. Our average metal prices realized will therefore differ from the market average metal prices in most cases. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to total mine cost of sales, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, please see Non-GAAP Measures in the Company’s most recently filed 10-K. Total cash (credit) cost was significantly affected by unusually high base metals sales as compared to precious metals sales.\nSee Accompanying Tables\nThe calculation of our cash cost per precious metal gold equivalent per ounce sold, total all-in sustaining cost per precious metal gold equivalent per ounce sold and total all-in cost per precious metal gold equivalent per ounce sold contained in this press release are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations\" contained in the Company’s most recent Form 10-K for a complete discussion and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nThe following information summarizes Gold Resource Corporation’s financial condition at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, its results of operations including the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The summary data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is unaudited; the summary data for the year ended December 31, 2017 is derived from our audited financial statements contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, but do not include the footnotes and other information that is included in the complete financial statements.
