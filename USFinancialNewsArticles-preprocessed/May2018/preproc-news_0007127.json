    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas, Viper Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:VNOM) (\"Viper\" or the “Company”), a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) (\"Diamondback\"), today announced financial and operating 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nQ1 2018 cash distribution of $0.480 per common unit paid on April 27, 2018, up 4% quarter over quarter and 59% year over year; implies a 6.7% annualized yield based on April 30, 2018 unit closing price of $28.80 Announced proposed election to change tax status from pass-through partnership to a taxable entity; expected to be effective on or after May 10, 2018 Q1 2018 net income of $42.9 million and distributable cash flow (as defined below) of $55.0 million Q1 2018 production of 14,122 boe/d (71% oil), up 14% over Q4 2017 and 66% year over year Initiating average production guidance for Q2 2018/Q3 2018 of 15,250 to 16,250 boe/d, the midpoint of which is up 12% from Q1 2018 production Raising full year 2018 production guidance to 15,500 to 16,500 boe/d (71% - 75% oil), up 5% from previous full year 2018 guidance and implies 45% annualized growth over full year 2017 production Closed 21 acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $158 million in Q1 2018, increasing Viper's mineral assets by 967 net royalty acres to 10,537 total net royalty acres; up 62% year over year Revolving credit facility expected to be increased to $475 million from $400 million with Spring redetermination There were approximately 1,075 active well permits and 27 active rigs on Viper's mineral acreage as of April 30, 2018\n“During the first quarter, Viper continued its streak of eight consecutive quarterly distribution increases as a result of both higher production due to organic growth and accretive acquisitions, as well as the tailwind of increasing commodity prices. With strengthening oil prices resulting in continued acceleration across Viper's mineral acreage, we have the conviction to raise the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 5% and expect to achieve annualized production growth of 45% in 2018,” stated Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer of Viper’s general partner.\nMr. Stice continued, “Viper continues to be active in the acquisition market, as we closed 21 deals for over $150 million during the quarter, including our previously announced entrance into the Eagle Ford which continues to outperform expectations. The broader access to capital provided via our recently announced, and soon to be effective, election to change our tax status will allow us to continue to be acquisitive in the highly fragmented private minerals market.”\nFINANCIAL UPDATE\nViper's first quarter 2018 average realized prices were $61.43 per barrel of oil, $2.22 per Mcf of natural gas and $24.17 per barrel of natural gas liquids, resulting in a total equivalent price of $49.09/boe, up 17% year over year from $41.80/boe in Q1 2017 and up 12% from the Q4 2017 total equivalent price of $43.76/boe.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded total operating income of $62.4 million and net income of $42.9 million. Operating income was up 5% quarter over quarter and 86% year over year. Net income was up 2% quarter over quarter and up 108% year over year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had a cash balance of $18 million and approximately $160 million available under its revolving credit facility. In connection with its Spring 2018 redetermination, which is expected to close in May 2018, Viper expects to have its borrowing base increased to $475 million from $400 million currently.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 CASH DISTRIBUTION\nAs previously announced, the Board of Directors of Viper's general partner declared a cash distribution for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $0.480 per common unit, up 4% quarter over quarter and 59% year over year. This distribution was paid on April 27, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on April 20, 2018.\nThis release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d). Please note that 100 percent of Viper’s distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, all of Viper’s distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable. Nominees, and not Viper, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.\nACQUISITION UPDATE\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Viper acquired 967 net royalty acres for an aggregate purchase price of $158 million bringing Viper's footprint of mineral interests to a total of 10,537 net royalty acres. Diamondback, ConocoPhillips, Devon and EOG Resources serve as primary operators on the recently acquired assets. Viper funded the recent acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nGUIDANCE UPDATE\nBelow is Viper's updated guidance for the full year 2018, as well as average production guidance for Q2 2018 and Q3 2018.\nViper Energy Partners Q2/Q3 2018 Net Production – MBoe/d 15.25 - 16.25 Total 2018 Net Production – MBoe/d 15.5 - 16.5 Oil Production - % of Net Production 71% - 75% Unit costs ($/boe) Gathering & Transportation $0.10 - $0.30 DD&A $9.00 - $11.00 G&A Cash G&A $0.75 - $1.25 Non-Cash Unit-Based Compensation $0.75 - $1.25 Production and Ad Valorem Taxes (% of Revenue) (a) 7% Capital Budget ($ - Million) 2018 Capital Spend n/a (a) Includes production taxes of 4.6% for crude oil and 7.5% for natural gas and NGLs and ad valorem taxes.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nViper will host a conference call and webcast for investors and analysts to discuss its financial and operating quarter of 2018 on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CT.

Viper defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, net, non-cash unit-based compensation expense, depletion and gain on revaluation of investments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income as determined by United States’ generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows it to more effectively evaluate Viper’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Viper’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Viper defines cash available for distribution generally as an amount equal to its Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable quarter less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of Viper’s general partner may deem appropriate. Viper’s computations of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies or to such measure in its credit facility or any of its other contracts.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to the GAAP financial measure of net income.\nViper Energy Partners LP (unaudited, in thousands, except per unit data) Three Months\nEnded March 31, Three Months\nEnded December 31, Three Months\nEnded March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income $ 42,896 $ 42,070 $ 20,652 Interest expense, net 2,098 1,050 612 Non-cash unit-based compensation expense 1,288 356 819 Depletion 11,525 11,932 7,847 Gain on revaluation of investment (899 ) — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 56,908 $ 55,408 $ 29,930 Adjustments to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to cash available for distribution: Debt service, contractual obligations, fixed charges and reserves (1,952 ) (2,975 ) (480 ) Cash available for distribution $ 54,956 $ 52,433 $ 29,450 Limited Partner units outstanding 113,882 113,882 97,575 Cash available for distribution per limited partner unit $ 0.480 $ 0.460 $ 0.302 Investor Contact:\nAdam Lawlis\n+1 432.221.7467\nalawlis@viperenergy.com\nSource: Viper Energy Partners LP; Diamondback Energy, Inc.\nSource:Viper Energy Partners LP",
