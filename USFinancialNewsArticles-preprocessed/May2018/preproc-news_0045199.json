    "text": "Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Terrance Williams was arrested early Saturday in Frisco, Texas, charged with public intoxication — a Class C misdemeanor in Texas — near his home after police found his car wrecked at an intersection near the Cowboys’ training complex.\nDec 17, 2017; Oakland, CA, USA; Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Terrance Williams (83) runs with the ball after making a catch next to Oakland Raiders cornerback Dexter McDonald (23) in the first quarter at Oakland Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports Per a Frisco Police Department press release, around 4:45 a.m., police responded to a crash in the area of Frisco Green Avenue and Lebanon Road where they found a 2017 blue Lamborghini that had struck a light pole.\nThe driver of the vehicle had fled the scene and could not be found in the area, but police were able to determine the vehicle was registered to Williams.\nOfficers located Williams near his residence riding an electric bicycle in the road, where he was arrested for public intoxication.\nWilliams was released from the Frisco Detention Center on a $369 bond. He was also given a misdemeanor at-large charge for leaving the scene of a crash.\nThe Cowboys are aware of the arrest.\nWilliams won’t participate in upcoming workouts with the Cowboys because of a fractured foot, but he is expected to be ready for training camp.\nHe may need to impress. Despite the release of Dez Bryant, the Cowboys have signed free agent receivers Allen Hurns and Deonte Thompson and added Michael Gallup and Cedric Wilson in the recent draft.\nWilliams has played in every game of his five-year Cowboys career. The third-round pick out of Baylor in the 2013 draft has 20 touchdowns on 230 receptions over 80 games. He was shut out of the end zone last season as the Cowboys’ passing game sputtered under second-year QB Dak Prescott.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
