    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (NYSE: MIC) (“MIC”) today announced that all six MIC director nominees were reelected to the Board of Directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held earlier today.\nCommenting on the results, MIC issued the following statement:\nThe MIC Board and management team thank stockholders for their support and the valuable feedback they provided through the proxy process. MIC is committed to engaging constructively with its stockholders and considering their input as the Company works to deliver long-term growth.\nMIC is executing on its core priorities to build stockholder value and improve financial performance. Led by new Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Frost, this strategy includes repurposing a portion of capacity and repositioning certain assets of International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT), efficient portfolio and capital management and increasing balance sheet strength and flexibility. With important initiatives underway, a long-term track record of generating attractive returns and a process underway to identify new independent directors, MIC’s Board and management team are confident that MIC is on the right path to reinvigorated growth and value creation.\nLooking ahead, MIC’s management team will continue to regularly communicate its strategy and progress against its core priorities in a manner consistent with its long record of transparency.\nThe Company also announced that stockholders approved all of the other proposals considered at the Annual Meeting, including the advisory vote on executive compensation and the ratification of KPMG LLP as its independent auditor.\nMIC will file the voting results on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements.
