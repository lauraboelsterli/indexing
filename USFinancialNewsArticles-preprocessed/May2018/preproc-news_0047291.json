Colin Brynn | Getty Images There will be an additional 340,000 full-time jobs by 2022\nThe cannabis industry employs between 125,000 to 160,000 full-time workers, according to Marijuana Business Daily. It's expected to add another 340,000 full time jobs by 2022, reflecting an estimated growth of 21 percent per year.\nThose careers run the gamut, from individuals who are growing plants to those who work for \"ancillary businesses\" that don't involve coming into direct contact with weed, such as providing legal services. Robert Gauthier | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images U.S. demand for weed: $52.5 billion\nCounting both legal and black market sales, the total demand for pot is approximately $52.5 billion, Marijuana Business Daily found. Jon Paciaroni | Getty Images Six states now regulate recreational pot\nRecreational sales are legal in Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. In Washington, D.C., adults over 21 can legally possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana, grow up to six cannabis plants in their home or give away up to one ounce of marijuana to another person who is at least 21. Sales are not legal in the nation's capital.\nMaine permits recreational marijuana, and state lawmakers are pushing for legislation to establish a regulated market.\nStarting July 1 , adults over 21 will be able to purchase recreational pot at retail stores in Massachusetts. Drew Angerer | Getty Images Legal sales could double in 2018\nAnnual retail sales of cannabis are expected to rise by 50 percent from 2017, reaching $8 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2018, according to Marijuana Business Daily. Hillary Kladke | Getty Images Pot generates tax revenue\nDuring the fiscal 2017, Washington state collected $219 million in legal pot income and licensing fees . The excise tax is 37 percent on retail sales.\nLast year, weed taxes, plus revenue from licensing and fees, hit $247.4 million in Colorado .\nNew York City Comptroller Scott Stringer told CNBC that legal pot in New York could create a $3.1 billion market .
