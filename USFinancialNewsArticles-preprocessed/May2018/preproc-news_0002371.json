    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stamps.com® (Nasdaq: STMP), the leading provider of postage online and shipping software solutions to over 725 thousand customers, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue was $133.6 million, up 27% compared to $105.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income was $47.0 million, up 42% compared to $33.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $2.54, up 39% compared to $1.82 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $62.1 million, up 21% compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share was $2.54, up 39% compared to $1.83 in the first quarter of 2017.\n“We were very pleased with our first quarter performance,” said Ken McBride, Stamps.com's Chairman and CEO. “We achieved strong growth driven by continued success in the shipping area of our business. We are continuing to execute on our 2018 strategic plans and we remain excited about our long-term business opportunities.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Detailed Results\nFirst quarter 2018 total revenue was $133.6 million, up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Mailing and Shipping revenue (which includes service, product and insurance revenue but excludes Customized Postage and Other revenue) was $131.0 million, up 28% versus the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 Customized Postage revenue was $2.6 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP income from operations was $49.2 million, GAAP net income was $47.0 million and GAAP net income per share was $2.54 based on 18.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. This compares to first quarter 2017 GAAP income from operations of $34.6 million, GAAP net income of $33.1 million and GAAP net income per share of $1.82 based on 18.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding. First quarter 2018 GAAP income from operations, GAAP net income, and GAAP income per fully diluted share increased by 42%, 42% and 39% year-over-year, respectively.\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP income from operations included $7.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $4.0 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter 2018 GAAP net income also included $93 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. First quarter 2018 GAAP income tax expense was $1.6 million and non-GAAP income tax expense was $13.3 million, resulting in an $11.7 million non-GAAP tax expense adjustment. The higher non-GAAP tax expense reflects the tax impact on the non-GAAP pre-tax income at a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22.0%. See the section later in this press release entitled “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on how non-GAAP taxes are calculated. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, first quarter 2018 non-GAAP income from operations was $60.7 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and including the non-GAAP tax expense adjustment, first quarter 2018 non-GAAP adjusted income was $47.0 million or $2.54 per share based on 18.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nFirst quarter 2017 GAAP income from operations included $11.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $4.0 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter 2017 GAAP net income also included $93 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. First quarter 2017 GAAP income tax expense was $660 thousand and non-GAAP income tax expense was $16.0 million, resulting in a $15.3 million non-GAAP tax expense adjustment. The higher non-GAAP tax expense reflected the tax impact on the non-GAAP pre-tax income at a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 32.5%. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, first quarter 2017 non-GAAP income from operations was $50.0 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and including the non-GAAP tax expense adjustment, first quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted income was $33.2 million or $1.83 per share based on 18.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nTherefore, first quarter 2018 non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income, and non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share increased by 21%, 41% and 39% year-over-year, respectively.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income, and non-GAAP adjusted income per share are described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following tables (unaudited):\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (First Quarter 2018)\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Stock-Based Intangible Debt All amounts in millions except GAAP Compensation Amortization Amortization Income Tax Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expense Adjustments Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 25.53 0.48 $ - $ - $ - $ 25.05 Research & Development 12.07 1.93 - - - 10.15 Sales & Marketing 25.75 1.52 - - - 24.23 General & Administrative 21.02 3.62 4.00 - - 13.40 Total Expenses 84.37 7.55 4.00 - - 72.82 Income (Loss) from Operations 49.20 (7.55 ) (4.00 ) - - 60.75 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (0.54 ) - - (0.09 ) - (0.45 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes (1.62 ) - - - 11.65 (13.27 ) Adjusted Income (Loss) 47.04 (7.55 ) (4.00 ) (0.09 ) 11.65 47.03 On a diluted per share basis $ 2.54 $ (0.41 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.63 $ 2.54 Shares used in per share calculation 18.51 18.51 18.51 18.51 18.51 18.51 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures (First Quarter 2017)\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2017 Stock-Based Intangible Debt All amounts in millions except GAAP Compensation Amortization Amortization Income Tax Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expense Adjustments Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 17.74 $ 0.55 $ - $ - $ - $ 17.19 Research & Development 10.52 2.50 - - - 8.03 Sales & Marketing 23.15 2.31 - - - 20.84 General & Administrative 18.98 6.02 4.00 - - 8.97 Total Expenses 70.39 11.37 4.00 - - 55.03 Income (Loss) from Operations 34.65 (11.37 ) (4.00 ) - - 50.01 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (0.85 ) - - (0.09 ) - (0.76 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes (0.66 ) - - - 15.35 (16.01 ) Adjusted Income (Loss) 33.14 (11.37 ) (4.00 ) (0.09 ) 15.35 33.25 On a diluted per share basis $ 1.82 $ (0.63 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.84 $ 1.83 Shares used in per share calculation 18.17 18.17 18.17 18.17 18.17 18.17 First Quarter GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nFirst quarter 2018 GAAP net income was $47.0 million, up 42% compared to $33.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $62.1 million, up 21% compared to $51.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release and is reconciled to GAAP net income in the following table (unaudited):\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nFirst Quarter Three Months ended All amounts in millions March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ 47.04 $ 33.14 Depreciation and Amortization expense $ 5.34 $ 5.23 Interest & Other Expense (Income), net $ 0.54 $ 0.85 Income Tax Expense (Benefit), net $ 1.62 $ 0.66 Stock-based Compensation Expense $ 7.55 $ 11.37 Adjusted EBITDA $ 62.08 $ 51.24 Taxes\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported a GAAP income tax expense of $1.6 million representing an effective tax rate of 3.3%. As discussed below under the heading “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” we believe our effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 22%. Accordingly, the first quarter 2018 effective rate of 3.3% should not be assumed to apply for 2018 as a whole, and our after tax income during the remainder of 2018 will likely reflect a materially higher rate than is reflected in our after tax results 2018. Our first quarter 2018 GAAP net income should also be understood to have been positively impacted by the lower effective tax rate applicable specifically to the quarter resulting primarily from employee stock option exercises.\nShare Repurchase and Debt Repayment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 120 thousand shares at a total cost of approximately $23.2 million.\nOn April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that will take effect upon expiration of the current plan on May 11, 2018 and authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $90 million of stock over the six months following its effective date.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a required principal repayment of $2.1 million against the borrowings under the Company’s existing credit agreement related to the Endicia acquisition. As of March 31, 2018, total debt under the credit agreement excluding debt issuance costs was $68.1 million.\nSummary of our Updated Business Outlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company currently expects its GAAP financial outlook to be as follows:\nWe expect total revenue to be in a range of approximately $530 million to $560 million; this is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect GAAP net income to be in a range of approximately $150 million to $165 million; this compares to previous guidance of $138 million to $153 million. We expect GAAP net income per fully diluted share to be in a range of approximately $7.73 to $8.70; this compares to previous guidance of $7.09 to $8.04. We expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be 22.0%; this compares to our previous guidance of 28.0%.\nThe above GAAP amounts, adjusted as detailed below, result in the following non-GAAP financial outlook:\nWe expect non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of approximately $245 million to $265 million; this is unchanged from our previous guidance. We expect non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share to be in a range of $9.60 to $10.60; this compares to previous guidance of $8.80 to $9.80.\nDetailed Discussion of our Business Outlook\nAs noted above, for 2018, the Company currently expects total revenue to be in a range of approximately $530 million to $560 million; this is unchanged from our previous guidance.\nAlso, for 2018, the Company currently expects GAAP net income to be in a range of approximately $150 million to $165 million; this compares to previous guidance of $138 million to $153 million.\nThe expected GAAP net income range includes depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $21 million, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million, interest expense and other income, net of approximately $2 million and income tax expense of approximately $42 million to $47 million. Excluding the depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense and other income, net and income tax expense, we expect non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of approximately $245 million to $265 million.\nThe following table is provided to facilitate a reconciliation of 2018 expected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to expected GAAP net income:\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance All amounts in millions Low End of Range High End of Range GAAP net income $149.8 $165.4 Adjustments to reconcile adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income: Depreciation and amortization expense $21.0 $21.0 Stock-based compensation expense $30.0 $30.0 Interest expense and other income, net $1.9 $1.9 Income tax expense\n$42.3 $46.7 Total adjustments excluded from adjusted EBITDA $95.2 $99.6 Adjusted EBITDA $245.0 $265.0 As noted above, for 2018, the Company currently expects GAAP net income per fully diluted share to be in a range of approximately $7.73 to $8.70; this compares to previous guidance of $7.09 to $8.04. The expected GAAP net income per fully diluted share range includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles expense of approximately $16 million, and non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million. Excluding the stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, and amortization of debt issuance costs, and including higher expected non-GAAP income taxes of approximately $10 million from the expected tax effects of these adjustments at an assumed 22.0% effective tax rate, non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share is expected to be in a range of $9.60 to $10.60; this compares to previous guidance of $8.80 to $9.80.\nThe following table is provided to facilitate a reconciliation of 2018 expected non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share to expected GAAP net income per fully diluted share:\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance All amounts in millions except percentages and per share data Low End of Range High End of Range GAAP net income per fully diluted share $7.73 $8.70 Adjustments to reconcile non-GAAP to GAAP:\nStock-based compensation expense $30.0 $30.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles $16.0 $16.0 Amortization of debt issuance costs\n$0.4 $0.4 Total adjustments excluded from non-GAAP $46.4 $46.4 Projected effective tax rate 22% 22% Increased tax expense from non-GAAP adjustments\n$10.2 $10.2 Total tax affected adjustments excluded from non-GAAP $36.2 $36.2 Fully diluted shares 19.4 19.0 Total adjustments excluded from non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share $1.87 $1.90 Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share $9.60 $10.60 This business outlook does not include the impact from potential future acquisitions, including acquisition costs or related financings, or unanticipated events.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income, non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share and adjusted EBITDA.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that: (1) exclude certain non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, contingent consideration charges; (2) exclude certain expenses and gains such as acquisition related expenses, litigation settlement expenses, executive consulting expenses, insurance proceeds; and (3) includes income tax adjustments provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be reflective of our underlying operating performance.\nNon-GAAP adjusted income is calculated as GAAP net income plus the cumulative impact of the adjustments outlined in the paragraph immediately above.\nNon-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP adjusted income divided by fully diluted shares. Prior to the third quarter 2016, the Company referred to non-GAAP adjusted income as non-GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP income tax expense for the first, second and third quarters of our fiscal year are calculated by multiplying the projected annual effective tax rate in that quarter by the non-GAAP adjusted income before taxes for the quarter. The projected annual effective tax rate does not reflect potential future employee option exercises in the remaining quarters of the fiscal year due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting employee option exercises. The projected annual effective tax rate also considers other factors including the Company’s tax structure and its tax positions in various jurisdictions where the Company operates. The actual annual effective tax rate realized for the fiscal year could differ materially from our projected annual effective tax rate used in the first, second and third quarters.\nNon-GAAP income tax expense for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year by the non-GAAP adjusted income before taxes for the fiscal year and subtracting the non-GAAP income tax expense or benefit reported in the first, second and third quarters. As a result, the fourth quarter reflects the tax impact of reconciling the first, second and third quarter projected annual effective rates to the actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year.\nThe calculations described above reflect the methodology used for calculating non-GAAP income tax expenses in reported results for 2017 and 2018. For 2016 reported results, the Company used a different methodology for calculating non-GAAP income tax expense that reflected the Company’s ability to use its remaining tax assets such as net operating losses and other tax credits. The reason for the change in methodology was that the Company had utilized substantially all of its net operating losses and other tax credits by the end of 2016. In order to help investors better understand the impact of the change in methodology, the Company previously provided recast non-GAAP income tax expense for 2016 showing what the non-GAAP income tax expense would have been under the 2017 methodology. The Company expects that the non-GAAP income tax expense methodology for 2018 will be consistent with the 2017 methodology. As a result, the Company believes it is no longer necessary to provide recast non-GAAP income tax expenses.\nThe projected non-GAAP tax rate for 2018 is 22.0%.\nAdjusted EBITDA as calculated in this press release represents earnings before interest and other expense, net, interest and other income, net, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and excludes certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables of this press release.\nThe Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, enhance the comparability of operating results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions. The Company believes non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management and investors in comparing the Company’s financial performance to that of prior periods as well as in performing trend analysis over time.\nShare Repurchase Timing\nThe timing of share repurchases, if any, and the number of shares to be bought at any one time will depend on factors including market conditions and the Company’s compliance with the covenants in its Credit Agreement. Share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions at the Company's discretion in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's purchase of any of its shares may be subject to limitations imposed on such purchases by applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis release includes “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
