    "text": "MAYNARD, Mass., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acacia Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACIA), a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, today reported financial results for its first quarter .\n“While first quarter revenue, non-GAAP income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were in the high-end of our guidance ranges, the recent activation by the U.S. Department of Commerce of the denial order against ZTE is disappointing,” said Raj Shanmugaraj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Communications. “Although the denial order will have an adverse impact on our business for the foreseeable future, we are prioritizing several initiatives and opportunities that we believe will help mitigate that impact. We continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet, technology and product portfolio position us well for opportunities that are key to our future success.”\n“Our second quarter 2018 outlook assumes no revenue contribution from ZTE after the effective date of the ZTE denial order,” said John Gavin, Chief Financial Officer of Acacia Communications. “In addition, we have and will continue to take steps to reduce our year-over-year operating expense growth rate while continuing to fund our core strategic projects.”\nResults for the First Quarter of 2018\nRevenue of $72.9 million, decreased 36% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 33.0%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 42.9% GAAP loss from operations of $14.7 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $2.2 million GAAP net loss of $9.1 million; non-GAAP net income* of $4.3 million EBITDA* of $(11.5) million; adjusted EBITDA* of $5.4 million GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.23; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $0.10\nOutlook for the Second Quarter of 2018\nThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this press release. Acacia Communications disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nAcacia Communications’ guidance for its second quarter ending June 30, 2018 is:\nQuarter Ending June 30, 2018 Revenue (millions) $ 60.0 to $ 66.0 Non-GAAP Net Loss* (millions) $ (6.2 ) to $ (1.2 ) Non-GAAP Diluted Loss Per Share* $ (0.15 ) to $ (0.03 ) *Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), (loss) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Please refer below to Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information for descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures, attached as Schedule D, for reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nAcacia Communications has not reconciled the above second quarter 2018 guidance for GAAP net loss and GAAP diluted loss per share to non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP diluted loss per share, respectively, because the expected tax benefits derived from any employee equity awards during the second quarter of 2018 cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call\nAcacia Communications will host a conference call to discuss its results of 2018, recent developments and the Company’s business outlook and strategy at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today. The live webcast of the call, along with the Company’s earnings press release, can be accessed at the Acacia Communications’ Investor Relations website at http://ir.acacia-inc.com. The U.S. dial-in for the call is 1-877-407-8293 (1-201-689-8349 for non-U.S. callers). Please ask to be joined to the Acacia Communications call. A replay of the conference call will be available until May 17, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, while an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Acacia Communications’ Investor Relations website for 90 days. The U.S. dial-in for the conference call replay is 1-877-660-6853 (1-201-612-7415 for non-U.S. callers). The replay access code is 13679013.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nSchedule D of this press release provides reconciliations of Acacia Communications’ most comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nAcacia Communications believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, in addition to providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing the Company’s performance using the same financial metrics that its management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how its results of operations may look in the future. Acacia Communications’ management does not believe that items not involving cash expenditures, such as non-cash compensation related to equity awards, are part of its critical decision making process. Also, Acacia Communications’ management does not believe that items such as warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the seven-year denial of export privileges imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce against ZTE Kangxun Telecom Co. Ltd. (“ZTE”) or certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves outside the normal course of the Company’s business are reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance. Additionally, Acacia Communications’ management believes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), including the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred. Therefore, Acacia Communications excludes those items, as applicable, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nAcacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the metrics described below, as well as the related income tax effects. The income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments is determined by recalculating income tax expense excluding these adjustments.\nNon-GAAP gross profit and gross margin . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit as reported on its consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash charge, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue and inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross margin as the non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue as reported on its consolidated statements of operation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue and inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP research and development expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP research and development expenses as research and development expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP research and development expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses as sales, general and administrative expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP operating expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP income from operations . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP income from operations as (loss) income from operations as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP income from operations because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP net income as net (loss) income as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation which is a non-cash charge, as well as warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE, certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves and the tax effects of those excluded items. Additionally, the impacts of the Act have been excluded as it is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of the Company’s continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred.\nAcacia Communications defines non-GAAP effective tax rate as the non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes divided by non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as the (benefit) provision for income taxes as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation, as adjusted for the tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation expense, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE, certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves, as well as the impact of the Act. Non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as GAAP (loss) income before (benefit) provision for income taxes, excluding stock-based compensation expense, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves.\nIn order to calculate non-GAAP diluted EPS, Acacia Communications uses a non-GAAP weighted-average share count. For periods in which there was a GAAP net loss resulting in GAAP diluted net loss per share, the impact of dilutive stock-based awards was added to the GAAP weighted-average share count to calculate the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nAcacia Communications has presented non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS because the Company believes that the exclusion of the items discussed above facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry and more accurately reflects the underlying performance of our continuing business operations.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA . Acacia Communications defines EBITDA as net (loss) income as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operation before depreciation, interest income, net, and its (benefit) provision for income taxes. Acacia Communications defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE and certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves. Acacia Communications has presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by its management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing its business. In particular, Acacia Communications believes that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core operating performance.\nAcacia Communications uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and trends, and make planning decisions. Acacia Communications believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes. Accordingly, Acacia Communications believes that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nAcacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than gross profit, gross margin, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, (loss) income from operations, net (loss) income, effective tax rate or diluted (loss) earnings per share, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations are:\nAcacia Communications excludes stock-based compensation expense from each of its non-GAAP financial measures, although it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for its business and an important part of the Company’s compensation strategy;\nAcacia Communications excludes the tax benefits generated from the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and ESPP shares, and the vesting of restricted stock units, including any excess tax benefits and shortfalls recognized by the Company in the year of the taxable transaction, in calculating its non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. The Company believes that excluding these tax benefits enables investors to see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on the operating results. These benefits are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying employee equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of exercise or vesting, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of the Company’s business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, the Company believes that excluding these tax benefits provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of its business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies in its industry;\nAcacia Communications excludes warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue from its non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as management does not believe the charges are reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance;\nAcacia Communications excludes inventory write-offs due to the denial order against ZTE from its non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as management believes the activity is not related to the Company’s normal course of business and is not reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance;\nAcacia Communications excludes certain litigation related costs and settlement reserves from its non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, if management believes the activity is not related to the Company’s normal course of business and is not reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance. These expenses may continue in the future;\nNon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS do not reflect the impact of the Act, part of which is federal taxes incurred on the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings which will be paid over an eight-year period;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income, which increases cash available to the Company, as this income is not generated by the Company’s core operations;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the (benefit) provision for income tax which may impact cash available to the Company; and\nthe expenses and other items that the Company excludes in its calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results.\nBecause of these limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAcacia Communications’ use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that Acacia Communications will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.\nInvestors should consider Acacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Acacia Communications\nAcacia Communications develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost.
