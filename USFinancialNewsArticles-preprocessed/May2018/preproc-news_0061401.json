    "text": "PRAGUE, May 28 (Reuters) - A unit of Chinaâ€™s state-owned CITIC has taken over the chairmanship position at CEFC Europe, a Czech-based part of the troubled Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy, CEFC Europe said on Monday.\nThe firm said Ren Xia of Rainbow Wisdom, a unit of CITIC, had been appointed to the board and elected as chairwoman.\nThe move showed CITIC was going ahead with a plan to take at least partial control over the CEFC assets.\nOn Friday, CITIC paid around 12 billion crowns ($542.57 million) in debt on behalf of the CEFC group to Czech banking and private equity group J&T.\nCEFC Europe had said earlier CITIC would take 49 percent interest in the Czech assets. A CEFC Europe spokesman said on Monday he could not confirm what would be the final shape of the deal.\nThe board replacement means that a crisis management put in by creditors J&T was leaving the firm.
