(NASDAQ:IPHS) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nSales of $205 million were up 24% compared with prior year due to a combination of organic volume growth, strong contribution from acquisitions and notable progress with proactive pricing actions in the legacy business Strong growth of 39% seen in Food, Health, and Nutrition (FHN) with segment sales advancing to 61% of total Company sales GAAP Net Income of $11 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 were flat with prior year Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% versus prior year to $32 million; adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 up 3% year-over-year Free Cash Flow was up 29% from the same quarter last year. Continued good working capital performance supported by further improvements in the cash conversion cycle Reiterating 2018 full-year guidance of 12% to 14% revenue growth, with more than double GAAP EPS and 10% to 14% Adjusted EPS growth\nQ1 2018 Strategic Highlights\nLaunched new stage-gate product development process to underpin and accelerate profitable organic growth across portfolio Further advanced strategic value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization initiative. Actions planned for 2018 are well underway with estimated adjusted diluted EPS improvement of 10% by the end of 2019 Phase 2 Operational Excellence program on schedule to deliver $13 million run rate savings by end of 2018 Integration of acquisitions progressing as planned; on track to achieve $4 million of run rate cost synergies in 2018\nManagement Comments\n“We began the year with a strong first quarter as we delivered growth from both our legacy business and acquisitions, supported by the favorable impact from our proactive pricing actions,” said Kim Ann Mink, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our recent acquisitions contributed 20% of our volume growth in the quarter, with an additional 4% year over year growth coming from our legacy business, which is a significant turning point compared with the trend seen in recent years.\n“We continue to make excellent progress advancing the two parallel paths of our Vision 2022 roadmap. This includes delivering earnings growth through organic and inorganic initiatives, while simultaneously sustaining our leadership position in our cash generative phosphate portfolio through our value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization initiatives. We have taken important steps forward with this program demonstrating our continued commitment to further strengthen the competitive position of our cash-generative core phosphates product portfolio. Following targeted 2018 capital investments, which will diversify Innophos’ supply base and deliver an improved sustainable cost structure, we estimate an adjusted diluted EPS improvement of 10% by the end of 2019.\n“To accelerate organic growth, we introduced an enterprise-wide new product development (NPD) process, which positions us to address consumer trends, aligns us with specialty, high-growth FHN markets and leverages our science and technology capabilities.\n“The integration of our recent acquisitions continues to progress well and positions us for sustained growth,” said Mink. “We have an active M&A pipeline, and with our strong balance sheet and Integration Management Office (IMO), we are confident in our ability to deliver enhanced shareholder value.\n“We are making excellent progress in transforming Innophos into a leading specialty ingredients solution provider serving attractive FHN markets, as well as select Industrial Specialties markets. With a clear strategic vision, a track record of delivering on our plans, and the financial strength to achieve our goals, we continue to deliver strong shareholder value,” concluded Mink.\nQ1 2018 Results\nVariance $ and Variance % in the following tables may not foot due to rounding\n$ Millions except EPS\nQuarter 1 2018 2017 Variance $ Variance % Sales 205 166 39 24% Net Income 11 11 --- --- Adj.

Other adjusted EBITDA margins were 5%\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company reiterated its full year 2018 guidance.\nThe proactive selling price increase program that was implemented in Q4 2017 has been effective in offsetting input cost increases in the first quarter. In response to the operating environment continuing to show cost inflation, the Company has taken further price increase actions in its specialty phosphates portfolio to take effect on June 1st.\nThe Company continues to expect full year 2018 revenue to grow 12% to 14% due to the annualized contributions from acquisitions, favorable growth in the specialty nutrition end-markets served, and stabilization in the legacy business.\nFull year GAAP EPS is expected to more than double in 2018. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA are expected to grow by 10% to 14% and 15% to 17%, respectively. This includes an improvement in 2018 full year EPS of approximately $0.16 per diluted share due to the lower effective tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 17% of sales.\nThe Company expects free cash flow to be similar to prior year with capital cash outflow of approximately $45 million to principally support the strategic value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization programs.\nConference Call\nInnophos will host its first quarter 2018 conference call today May 1, 2018 at 9:00 am ET to discuss its earnings results.

The current quarter selling price dollar variance is derived from the current quarter year to date selling price dollar variance less the previous quarter year to date selling price dollar variance. The selling price dollar variance is then divided by the prior period sales dollars to calculate the percentage change. Volume/mix variance is calculated as the total sales variance minus the selling price variance. The following table illustrates the percentage changes in net sales by reportable segments compared with the same period of the prior year, including the effect of selling price and volume/mix changes upon revenue:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nReportable Segments\nPrice\nVolume/Mix Total Food, Health and Nutrition 0.5 % 38.2 % 38.7 % Industrial Specialties 2.5 % (3.0 )% (0.5 )% Other 3.2 % 37.4 % 40.6 % Total 1.5 % 22.3 % 23.8 % Summary Cash Flow Statement\nINNOPHOS HOLDINGS, INC.

The Company believes net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net debt as total long-term debt (including any current portion) less cash and cash equivalents.\nFree cash flow is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes free cash flow is helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as performance measures for purposes of presentation in this release.\nNet Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net working capital as total current assets less cash and cash equivalents less total current liabilities plus current portion of capital leases.\nOperating Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes operating working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines operating working capital as net working capital less taxes less interest.\nInnophos is not able to provide a reconciliation of its 2022 expectation for Adjusted EBITDA margin to GAAP net income due to the number of variables in the projected EBITDA margin for 2022 and because we are currently unable to quantify accurately certain amounts that would be required to be included in GAAP net income or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005453/en/\nInvestors\nInnophos\nMark Feuerbach, 609-366-1204\ninvestor.relations@innophos.com\nor\nMedia\nSharon Merrill Associates\nRyan Flaim, 617-542-5300\niphs@investorrelations.com\nSource: Innophos Holdings, Inc.",
