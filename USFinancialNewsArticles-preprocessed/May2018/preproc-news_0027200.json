    "text": "Sacramento, CA, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spotlight Growth has published new content on Innovest Global, Inc. (OTC PINK: IVST). Innovest Global, Inc. is a diversified holding company that focuses on acquiring niche, high-growth businesses that are capable of generating significant annual revenue. The company’s planned subsidiaries operate across telehealth, biotech, commercial energy, business-to-business distribution, national call center and auto sales.\nThe report provides an overview of Innovest Global, Inc., its subsidiaries, financials, industry analysis and more. The content also covers the global outlook for commercial energy and LED lighting markets.\nTechnavio: Global Industrial Energy Efficiency Services Market To Exceed $10 Billion By 2020\nEnergy efficiency continues to see a global push, as cost cutting and reducing environmental impact drive demand and awareness. A surprising portion of the world still relies on old and outdated energy systems, which is both cost-ineffective and wasteful of energy resources. As a result, the energy efficiency services market is forecast to see stable growth over the next several years.\nAccording to Technavio market research, the global industrial energy efficiency services market is forecast to be valued around $10.18 billion by 2020, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%.\nAccording to Renub Research , the global LED lighting market is estimated to be worth $100 billion by the end of 2024. The market research firm sees the vast global growth primarily stemming from exponential global urbanization and greater awareness to energy efficiency systems.\nAccording to MarketsAndMarkets , the global LED lighting market is estimated to be worth $92.40 billion by 2022, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.66%. The market research firm sees the growth being driven by increasing demand for energy efficiency products, LED costs are falling, and overall greater adoption of the technology as a general lighting source.\nIn PwC’s “ 2017 Power and Utilities Trend ” report, analysts concluded that a vast majority of the growth will come from a “blueprint for a service-based model.” This would include: emerging technologies, monitoring equipment, sensors, energy management technology, and more.\nInnovest Reports Record Monthly Revenue of $326K, Energy Division Annual Revenue Run Rate of $4 Million\nInnovest Global recently released a May shareholder update, which announced the company reported record monthly revenues of $326,000 in April. The revenues primarily came from Innovest’s Commercial & Industrial Energy division. As a result of the successful developments, the Energy division now has an annual revenue run rate of $4 million.\nHere is a summary detailing of the major accomplishments from April:\nGenerated highest monthly sales in company history, Board of Directors resolved to apply for uplist to OTCQB upon audit completion, Launched ‘Demand Cost Reduction’ (DCR) Energy Efficiency Technology with first contract, $118K, for one of the six figure efficiency units (not included in April revenue number), Launched Equestrian Lighting Solution with signing of world renown Stachowski Farm contract for Equestrian Showcase, with lighting technologies that benefit Championship bred horses, Achieved a Quick Ratio of 2.6, four times the short term financial health of other Conglomerates, who average 0.6, Held a leadership meeting attended by 7, 8, and 9 figure acquisition candidates, and all Innovest executives and board members, Integrated another Energy acquisition.\n“We have a team of people that are first class, and entirely committed to execution,” said Dan Martin, CEO of Innovest Global, Inc. “The team trusts each other and is performing individually at a high level. And to our Shareholders, we thank you for your trust in our vision, goals and strategy. The company is a reflection of its people. The Innovest shareholders are cohesive, and your encouragement and enthusiasm has been the fuel, that has allowed us to begin to do great things. We are just getting started and couldn’t be more thankful for the support.”\nOn May 2, 2018, Innovest Global announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire a forensic energy auditing firm that is generating annual revenues of $500,000. The business model of the acquisition target is to conduct forensic energy audits for businesses and organizations and then providing recommendations on how to improve cost savings.\nInnovest Global CFO, Mike Yukich, recently provided an update on the company’s audit and uplisting efforts.
