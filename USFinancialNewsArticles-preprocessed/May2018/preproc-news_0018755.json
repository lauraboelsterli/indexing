(Nasdaq:AMBC) (\"Ambac\"), a holding company whose subsidiaries, including Ambac Assurance Corporation (\"AAC\"), provide financial guarantees, today reported net income of $305.7 million, or $6.70 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $(19.5) million, or $(0.43) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted Earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were $329.8 million, or $7.22 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Earnings of $5.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAmbac Assurance's Segregated Account Rehabilitation Concluded\nOn February 12, 2018, Ambac successfully concluded the rehabilitation of the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation, following the completion of a holistic restructuring transaction (the \"Transaction\"). The Transaction was completed following the conclusion of AAC's surplus note exchange offers and consent solicitation and the satisfaction of all other conditions to the effectiveness of the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation of the Segregated Account.\nThe Transaction resulted in the discharge of all Deferred Amounts, including accretion thereon, of approximately $3.9 billion and AAC's cancellation of approximately $809.5 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest outstanding of General Account Surplus Notes in exchange for an effective consideration package of (i) $0.40 in cash, (ii) $0.41 in principal amount of new Secured Notes and (iii) $0.125 General Account Surplus Notes. Upon extinguishment of the Deferred Amounts, a $288.2 million benefit, reflecting the 6.5% discount captured, was recognized in loss and loss expenses.\nFinancial Results\nThe increases in Net income and Adjusted Earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were primarily driven by the impact of the Transaction, which drove lower losses and loss expenses incurred, higher realized gains from investments and extinguishment of debt, and lower tax expenses, partially offset by lower income on VIEs and higher operating and interest expenses.\nClaude LeBlanc, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are extremely pleased with our results for the quarter which reflect the impact of this milestone Transaction, which together with other material initiatives achieved during the quarter, has created significant value for our shareholders. We are also pleased with the continued progress we have made on de-risking initiatives which remains one of our key strategic priorities. On the litigation front, another key strategic objective for Ambac, we view the announcement by the appellate court that a hearing date of June 6, 2018 has been set for oral arguments on our appeal in our Countrywide case as a progressive step towards final resolution of our Bank of America Countrywide dispute. We remain committed to fully protecting our rights and are prepared to progress this case all the way through trial, if necessary.\"\nAmbac's First Quarter 2018 Summary Results Better (Worse) ($ in millions, except per share data) 1Q2018 4Q2017 Amount Percent Net premiums earned $ 30.9 $ 31.5 $ (0.6 ) (2 )% Net investment income 110.2 107.1 3.1 3 % Other than temporary impairment losses (0.3 ) (1.0 ) 0.7 70 % Net realized investment gains (losses) 4.9 (0.1 ) 5.0 5,000 % Net change in fair value of credit derivatives (0.3 ) 8.5 (8.8 ) (104 )% Net gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives 25.5 23.0 2.5 11 % Income (loss) on Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") 0.6 21.2 (20.6 ) (97 )% Losses and loss expenses (benefit) (247.4 ) 102.3 349.7 342 % Operating expenses 36.4 28.9 (7.5 ) (26 )% Interest expense 48.1 31.0 (17.1 ) (55 )% Insurance intangible amortization 28.6 34.2 5.6 16 % Provision for income taxes 2.6 12.6 10.0 79 % Net income (loss) attributable to Common Stockholders 305.7 (19.5 ) 325.2 1,668 % Net income (loss) per diluted share $ 6.70 $ (0.43 ) $ 7.13 1,658 % Adjusted earnings (loss) 1 329.8 5.5 324.3 5,896 % Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share 1 $ 7.22 $ 0.12 $ 7.10 5,917 % Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity 1,845.1 1,381.1 464.0 34 % Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders' equity per share $ 40.70 $ 30.52 $ 10.18 33 % Adjusted book value 1 1,430.9 1,101.3 329.6 30 % Adjusted book value per share 1 $ 31.56 $ 24.34 $ 7.22 30 % Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 45.7 45.4 (0.3 ) (1 )% 1 See Non-GAAP Financial Data section of this press release for further information\nNet Premiums Earned\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, net premiums earned were $30.9 million, compared to $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, including accelerations of $9.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively. Normal premiums earned decreased $1.2 million or 5% primarily due to the continued runoff of the insured portfolio. Accelerated premiums earned increased $0.6 million or 7%, despite a 7% reduction in public finance par calls, as a result of a change in mix of transactions called.\nThe following table provides a summary of net premiums earned for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively:\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Public Finance $ 10.0 $ 11.5 Structured Finance 5.2 5.2 International Finance 6.3 6.0 Total normal premiums earned 21.5 22.7 Accelerated earnings 9.4 8.8 Total net premiums earned $ 30.9 $ 31.5 Net Investment Income\nNet investment income for the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 was $110.2 million and $107.1 million, respectively. Net investment income for the first quarter of 2018 increased due to the impact of increased ownership in AAC insured non-RMBS bonds and Secured Notes received as part of the Transaction, partially offset by lower net trading gains and the impact of a smaller investment portfolio. Net losses on invested assets classified as trading were $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to gains of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The fair value of the consolidated investment portfolio decreased approximately $1.0 billion from December 31, 2017, to $4.7 billion at March 31, 2018, due primarily to cash payments and the reduction in Ambac insured RMBS securities related to the Transaction, partially offset by Ambac's receipt of Secured Notes and positive performance on Ambac insured securities during the quarter.\nLosses and Loss Expenses and Loss Reserves\nLosses and loss expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were a benefit of $247.4 million, as compared to an expense of $102.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe following table provides losses and loss expenses incurred by bond type for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 RMBS $ 45.8 $ 18.2 Domestic public finance (11.3 ) 42.2 Student loan 2.9 0.9 Ambac UK (14.9 ) (7.3 ) All other credits (2.3 ) 2.6 Interest on deferred amounts 20.6 45.7 Discount on rehabilitation exit transactions (288.2 ) — Total losses and loss expenses $ (247.4 ) $ 102.3 First quarter of 2018 RMBS losses and loss expenses of $45.8 million were driven by higher projected losses in the RMBS portfolio mostly due to the negative impact of interest rates on excess spread and loss expenses incurred. Fourth quarter of 2017 RMBS losses and loss expenses of $18.2 million were driven by excess spread compression, loss expenses incurred and a reduction of representation and warranty subrogation recoveries, partially offset by a benefit of $21.8 million related to RMBS transactions proactively terminated during the quarter.\nDomestic public finance losses and loss expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2018 were a benefit of $11.3 million primarily related to an increase in loss reserve discount rates partially offset by adverse development in Puerto Rico. In the fourth quarter of 2017, domestic public finance losses and loss expenses were $42.2 million and were impacted mostly by additions to loss reserves in Puerto Rico.\nAmbac UK losses and loss expenses were a benefit of $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains. Fourth quarter of 2017 Ambac UK losses and loss expenses were a benefit of $7.3 million primarily as a result of improved credit performance and foreign exchange gains.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, net claim and loss expenses paid, net of reinsurance, were $62.3 million, excluding Deferred Amounts settled in connection with the Transaction, which included $101.3 million of loss and loss expenses paid, offset by $39.0 million of subrogation received. Upon closing of the Transaction, all claims previously allocated to the Segregated Account are being paid in full effective from October 1, 2017. Included in first quarter loss payments was $22.1 million of fourth quarter 2017 deferred claims. During the fourth quarter of 2017, net claim and loss expenses paid, net of reinsurance, were $14.2 million which included $73.9 million of losses and loss expenses paid, offset by $88.1 million of subrogation received. Subrogation received in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $49.7 million received from a mortgage insurer settlement.\nGross loss and loss expense reserves (gross of reinsurance) were $0.244 billion at March 31, 2018, and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2017, of which both were net of $1.834 billion of estimated subrogation recoveries related to AAC's pursuit of legal remedies to seek redress for breaches of representations and warranties. The decline in gross loss and loss expense reserves was attributable to the full discharge of $3.9 billion of Deferred Amounts, including accrued interest as a result of the Transaction.\nThe following table provides gross loss and loss expense reserves by bond type at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017:\n($ in millions) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 RMBS $ (1,207 ) $ 2,598 Domestic public finance 756 816 Student loans 312 308 Ambac UK 282 286 All other credits 14 17 Loss expenses 87 89 Total loss and loss expense reserves $ 244 $ 4,114 Net Gains (Losses) on Interest Rate Derivatives\nThe interest rate derivatives portfolio is positioned to benefit from rising interest rates as a partial economic hedge against interest rate exposure in the AAC insured and investment portfolios.\nNet gains on interest rate derivatives were $25.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $23.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $7.5 million to $36.4 million from $28.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher Transaction related costs and higher compensation costs. First quarter operating expenses included $9.2 million and $4.5 million of expenses associated with the Transaction and the OCI, respectively, compared to $5.2 million and $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher compensation costs are primarily due to the timing of recognition of short-term equity based performance compensation and higher accruals for long-term performance based compensation, partially offset by lower cash bonuses.\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $17.1 million to $48.1 million from $31.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher interest costs from the issuance of the Ambac Note and Tier 2 Notes in connection with the Transaction, partially offset by the reduction of debt.\nTaxes and Net Operating Loss Carry-Forwards (\"NOLs\")\nProvision for income taxes was $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter provision included $1.0 million of state income taxes and $1.6 million in deferred taxes associated with foreign subsidiaries. The fourth quarter provision included $8.7 million of Ambac UK current taxes, $2.0 million of state taxes, $1.9 million of net impact related to the implementation of H.R.1 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) stemming from $31.4 million in deferred taxes associated with foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a benefit of $29.6 million from the repeal of the corporate AMT.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Ambac consolidated group had approximately $3.3 billion of NOLs, including $1.4 billion at Ambac and $1.9 billion at AAC.\nAs a result of taxable income at AAC during the first quarter of 2018, AAC utilized NOLs in an amount that resulted in the accrual of $14.1 million of tolling payments. As long as AAC's taxable income does not fall below $168.2 million, Ambac will receive this additional tolling payment before the end of May 2019.\nTotal Ambac Financial Group, Inc. Stockholders' Equity\nStockholders’ equity at March 31, 2018, was up 34% to $1.85 billion, or $40.70 per share compared to $1.38 billion or $30.52 per share as of December 31, 2017, due to net income of $305.7 million, unrealized gains of $122.3 million related mostly to Ambac insured bonds held in the investment portfolio and translation gains related to Ambac's foreign subsidiaries.\nInsured Portfolio\nThe financial guarantee insurance portfolio net par amount outstanding declined 5% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, to $59.6 billion from $62.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The reduction in the insured portfolio was primarily related to decreases of $2.2 billion and $1.1 billion in the public finance and structured finance sectors, respectively, partially offset by a $0.2 billion increase in the international sector due to the impact of the weakening US dollar versus the British Pound.\nDetails of financial guarantee insurance portfolio are highlighted in the below table.\nNet Par Outstanding March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 By Sector: Public finance 50% 51% Structured Finance 21% 22% International 29% 27% By Holder: General account 73% 60% Ambac UK 27% 25% Segregated account —% 15% Adversely Classified Credits decreased by a net $1.5 billion, or 10.4% to $12.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to runoff and upgrades of certain RMBS transactions resulting from AAC's remediation activity.\nSecured Notes\nA newly formed special purpose entity issued $2.15 billion of new secured notes (\"Secured Notes\") secured by all the assets of the special purpose entity, which include a note issued by AAC to the special purpose entity which is secured by a pledge of AAC's right, title and interest in $1.4 billion (net of reinsurance) of RMBS representation and warranty litigation recoveries and investment securities with a fair value of $368 million at March 31, 2018. The Secured Notes were issued on February 12, 2018 in connection with the Transaction and have a five year final maturity (subject to acceleration under certain conditions) and a coupon paying LIBOR + 500bp.\nTier 2 Financing\nAAC issued $240.0 million of new money senior notes on February 12, 2018 in connection with the closing of the Transaction, secured by AAC’s right, title and interest in proceeds (net of reinsurance) above $1.6 billion received in connection with RMBS representation and warranty litigation. Interest on the Tier 2 Notes is at an annual rate of 8.50%.\nNon-GAAP Financial Data\nIn addition to reporting Ambac’s quarterly financial results in accordance with GAAP, Ambac reports two non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Book Value. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance or financial position that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP measures are net income attributable to common stockholders for Adjusted Earnings and Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity for Adjusted Book Value. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide greater transparency and enhanced visibility into the underlying drivers of our business. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Book Value are not substitutes for Ambac’s GAAP reporting, should not be viewed in isolation, may be subject to change, and may differ from similar reporting provided by other companies, which may define these non-GAAP measures differently.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss). Adjusted Earnings (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as reported under GAAP, adjusted on an after-tax basis for the following:\nNon-credit impairment fair value (gain) loss on credit derivatives: Elimination of the non-credit impairment fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives, which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated credit losses. Such fair value adjustments are affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market factors such as interest rates and credit spreads, including the market’s perception of Ambac’s credit risk (“Ambac CVA”), and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. These adjustments allow for all financial guarantee contracts to be accounted for consistent with the Financial Services – Insurance Topic of ASC, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules. Insurance intangible amortization: Elimination of the amortization of the financial guarantee insurance intangible asset that arose as a result of Ambac’s emergence from bankruptcy and the implementation of Fresh Start reporting. This adjustment ensures that all financial guarantee contracts are accounted for consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services – Insurance Topic of the ASC. Foreign exchange (gains) losses: Elimination of the foreign exchange gains (losses) on the re-measurement of assets, liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies. This adjustment eliminates the foreign exchange gains (losses) on all assets, liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies, which enables users of our financial statements to better view the business results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly as assets held in non-functional currencies have grown, and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of Ambac's operating performance.\nAdjusted Earnings were $329.8 million, or $7.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2018 as compared to Adjusted Earnings of $5.5 million or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted Earnings for the first quarter 2018 relative to Adjusted Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted mostly from gains, reflected in losses and loss expenses, in connection with the Transaction.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings (Loss), for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ($ in millions, other than per share data) $ Amount Per Diluted\nShare $ Amount Per Diluted\nShare Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 305.7 $ 6.70 $ (19.5 ) $ (0.43 ) Adjustments: Non-credit impairment fair value (gain) loss on credit derivatives 0.5 0.01 (7.9 ) (0.17 ) Insurance intangible amortization 28.6 0.63 34.2 0.75 Foreign exchange (gains) losses (5.0 ) (0.12 ) (1.3 ) (0.03 ) Adjusted Earnings (loss) $ 329.8 $ 7.22 $ 5.5 $ 0.12 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (in millions) 45.7 45.4 Adjusted Book Value. Adjusted Book Value is defined as Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity as reported under GAAP, adjusted for after-tax impact of the following:\nNon-credit impairment fair value losses on credit derivatives: Elimination of the non-credit impairment fair value loss on credit derivatives, which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit loss. GAAP fair values are affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, including Ambac’s CVA that are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss. These adjustments allow for all financial guarantee contracts to be accounted for within Adjusted Book Value consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services—Insurance Topic of the ASC, whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules. Insurance intangible asset: Elimination of the financial guarantee insurance intangible asset that arose as a result of Ambac’s emergence from bankruptcy and the implementation of Fresh Start reporting. This adjustment ensures that all financial guarantee contracts are accounted for within Adjusted Book Value consistent with the provisions of the Financial Services—Insurance Topic of the ASC. Net unearned premiums and fees in excess of expected losses: Addition of the value of the unearned premium revenue (\"UPR\") on financial guarantee contracts, in excess of expected losses, net of reinsurance. This non-GAAP adjustment presents the economics of UPR and expected losses for financial guarantee contracts on a consistent basis. In accordance with GAAP, stockholders’ equity reflects a reduction for expected losses only to the extent they exceed UPR. However, when expected losses are less than UPR for a financial guarantee contract, neither expected losses nor UPR have an impact on stockholders’ equity. This non-GAAP adjustment adds UPR in excess of expected losses, net of reinsurance, to stockholders’ equity for financial guarantee contracts where expected losses are less than UPR. Net unrealized investment (gains) losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Elimination of the unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investments that are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on the investment portfolio may differ from realized gains and losses ultimately recognized by the Company based on the Company’s investment strategy. This adjustment only allows for such gains and losses in Adjusted Book Value when realized.\nAmbac has a significant tax NOL that is offset by a full valuation allowance in the GAAP consolidated financial statements. As a result of this and other considerations, for purposes of non-GAAP measures, we utilize a 0% effective tax rate, which is subject to change in the future.\nAdjusted Book Value was $1.431 billion, or $31.56 per share, at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.101 billion, or $24.34 per share, at December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted Book Value was primarily attributable to Adjusted Earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe following table reconciles Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity to the non-GAAP measure Adjusted Book Value as of each date presented:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ($ in millions, other than per share data) $ Amount Per Share $ Amount Per Share Total Ambac Financial Group, Inc. stockholders’ equity $ 1,845.1 $ 40.70 $ 1,381.1 $ 30.52 Adjustments: Non-credit impairment fair value losses on credit derivatives 1.0 0.02 0.6 0.01 Insurance intangible asset (833.0 ) (18.37 ) (847.0 ) (18.71 ) Net unearned premiums and fees in excess of expected losses 570.9 12.59 597.3 13.20 Net unrealized investment (gains) losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (153.1 ) (3.38 ) (30.8 ) (0.68 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 1,430.9 $ 31.56 $ 1,101.3 $ 24.34 Shares outstanding (in millions) 45.3 45.3 Earnings Call and Webcast\nOn May 9, 2018 at 8:30am ET, Claude LeBlanc, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Trick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss first quarter 2018 results during a conference call.
