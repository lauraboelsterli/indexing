    "text": "HOUSTON, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sanchez Energy Corporation (NYSE:SN) (\"Sanchez Energy\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter 2018. First quarter 2018 highlights include:\nProduction of nearly 7.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (\"MMBoe\"), or 80,572 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"Boe/d\");\nR evenues of approximately $251 million, an 88 percent increase compared to the first quarter 2017;\nA net loss of $4.8 million, which includes a non-cash mark-to-market hedging loss of $24.4 million and compares to net income of $15.7 million for the first quarter of 2017;\nAdjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) of approximately $117.9 million which includes $19.7 million in realized hedging losses and represents an increase of approximately 133 percent compared to the first quarter 2017;\nAt Catarina, four South Central wells averaged 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,785 Boe/d, 37 percent oil;\nAt the Briscoe Metcalf Lease of Comanche, six Lower Eagle Ford wells achieved average 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,342 Boe/d, 60 percent oil;\nSecond quarter 2018 production guidance of 80,000 Boe/d to 84,000 Boe/d, and updated full year 2018 production guidance of 80,000 Boe/d to 84,000 Boe/d; and\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's liquidity was approximately $734 million, with approximately $550 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $184 million of combined borrowing capacity under the Company's two bank credit facilities.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\n\"As recently reported, several factors contributed to production coming in below our guidance range for the first quarter of 2018, which impacted our financial results,\" said Tony Sanchez, III, Chief Executive Officer of Sanchez Energy. \"Among the factors that were within our control were a variety of operational tests that were conducted at Comanche with the goal of optimizing well productivity. These tests failed to meet our expectations and underperformed legacy well results. We have therefore taken all corrective measures. Additional items that negatively impacted production were a weather-related disruption and a temporary third-party bottleneck in natural gas gathering capacity.\n\"The three main variables we tested included (1) hybrid completion designs, (2) more aggressive choke management, and (3) the completion of drilled-but-uncompleted wells (\"DUCs\") acquired with the Comanche assets, many of which were spaced tighter than our normal drilling program. Post the operational tests, we have transitioned to the exclusive use of slickwater design completions on all of the Comanche properties, and project improved production rates as these wells begin producing hydrocarbons later in the second quarter. We also returned to a more conservative choke management strategy, which we expect to result in lower base decline rates and a more stable production profile, allowing us to optimize the productivity of the multi-zone development plan at Comanche.\n\"Taking all these factors into consideration, we currently project second quarter, and full year 2018, production of 80,000 Boe/d to 84,000 Boe/d.\n\"We continue to achieve strong well results in Central Catarina, which resulted in higher than expected production at Catarina for the quarter. During the first quarter of 2018, four E32 wells in South Central Catarina delivered average 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,785 Boe/d, 37 percent of which was oil. In North Central Catarina, we recently brought a six well pad on-line that is also outperforming expectations. These wells delivered average 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,300 Boe/d, 40 percent of which was oil. These results further confirm the extent of the North Central fairway at Catarina, which has a rate of return profile second only to South Central Catarina. Given these strong production results, we have added 12 additional wells to our 2018 Catarina drilling plan. These new wells are expected to come on-line late in 2018, with the production primarily impacting 2019. Taking these added wells into account, along with higher working interests and the move to full slickwater completions, we now expect our full year capital budget to be between $475 million and $525 million.\n\"After successfully completing a $500 million notes offering in February 2018, we exited the quarter with approximately $550 million in cash on the balance sheet and an additional $184 million of undrawn revolver capacity under the Company's two credit facilities. Additionally, we continue to pursue strategic divestitures to reduce debt and further increase our liquidity. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund a multi-year capital program, enabling us to develop the Company's world-class asset base while at the same time providing the cash flow needed to reduce our financial leverage over the next two to three years.\n\"For the quarter, we reported Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) of approximately $117.9 million, an increase of approximately 133 percent compared to the first quarter 2017. Importantly, the operating environment has improved considerably over the last 12 months as oil price fundamentals have significantly strengthened. As a result, Sanchez Energy's first quarter of 2018 realized oil price before hedges was over $60 per barrel (\"Bbl\"), the first time since 2014 we've reached this level of realized price. We expect to see additional improvement in the Company's financial position as operating margins increase which we believe will help drive shareholder value.\"\nPRODUCTION VARIANCES\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 production came in below corporate guidance due to a weather-related disruption, a temporary third-party bottleneck in natural gas takeaway capacity, and a variety of operational issues associated with completions tests conducted with the goal of optimizing the development of the Comanche asset. The table below details the quarterly impact of each of those items.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production Variances Estimated Key Drivers Impact (1) Comanche Step Out and Zone Testing (1,900) Choke Management (1,000) Completion Design (750) Well Spacing (750) Weather, Midstream Constraints, and Other (1,000) Catarina Well Outperformance and Operations 1,900 Total Impact (Boe/d) (3,500) (1) \"Estimated Impact\" reflects our reasonable estimate of the drivers\nof the production variance as well as their relative weightings. OPERATIONS UPDATE\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company drilled 49 gross (25.67 net) wells and completed 73 gross (23.3 net) wells. The Company brought 62 wells on-line at Comanche and 6 wells on-line at Catarina during the quarter.\nThe Company finished completion activities during the first quarter 2018 on all of the 132 gross DUCs acquired with the Comanche assets in March 2017. With continuous drilling activity on the asset, the Company exited the first quarter 2018 with 42 gross DUCs at Comanche, a more normalized inventory level for the asset.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had 2,233 gross (883.2 net) producing wells with 59 gross wells in various stages of completion, as detailed in the following table:\nProject Area Gross\nProducing\nWells Gross Wells\nWaiting/Undergoing\nCompletion Catarina 395 13 Comanche 1,644 42 Maverick 63 — Palmetto 84 4 TMS / Other 47 — Total 2,233 59 PRODUCTION VOLUMES, AVERAGE SALES PRICES, AND OPERATING COSTS PER BOE\nThe Company's production mix during the first quarter 2018 consisted of approximately 35 percent oil, 33 percent natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\"), and 32 percent natural gas. By asset area, Catarina, Comanche, Maverick, and Palmetto/TMS/Other comprised approximately 48 percent, 44 percent, seven percent, and one percent, respectively, of the Company's total first quarter 2018 production volumes.\nRevenue from the sale of oil, natural gas, and NGLs was approximately $246 million during the first quarter 2018, approximately 84 percent higher when compared to the first quarter 2017. Adjusted Revenue for the first quarter 2018, a non-GAAP financial measure that includes a $19.7 million loss in hedge settlements, and $4.8 million in sales and marketing revenue, was $232 million, 77 percent higher compared to the first quarter 2017.\nCommodity price realizations during the first quarter 2018, which include the impact of hedge settlements, were $53.32 per Bbl of oil, $20.50 per Bbl of NGLs, and $3.09 per thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\") of natural gas.\nProduction, average sales prices, and operating costs and expenses per barrel of oil equivalent (\"Boe\") for the first quarter 2018 are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Production: Oil (MBbl) 2,521 1,549 Natural gas liquids (MBbl) 2,406 1,371 Natural gas (MMcf) 13,950 10,456 Total oil equivalent (MBoe) (1) 7,251 4,662 Average Sales Price Excluding Derivatives (2) : Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 61.64 $ 47.31 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) 20.50 19.77 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) 2.99 3.20 Oil equivalent ($ per Boe) $ 33.98 $ 28.71 Average Sales Price Including Derivatives (3) : Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 53.32 $ 47.26 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) 20.50 19.77 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) 3.09 2.93 Oil equivalent ($ per Boe) $ 31.27 $ 28.08 Average unit costs per Boe: Oil and natural gas production expenses (4) $ 9.92 $ 8.15 Production and ad valorem taxes $ 1.86 $ 1.40 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion $ 8.17 $ 5.66 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties $ 0.13 $ 0.40 (1) Includes approximately 2,515 Boe and 876 Boe of production associated with UnSub for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(4) Includes a $5.9 million and $5.9 million non-cash gain for the three and months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017,\nrespectively, from the amortization of the deferred gain on Western Catarina Midstream divestiture. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCapital expenditures incurred during the first quarter 2018 totaled approximately $150 million, which were allocated approximately 99 percent to drilling, completion, and infrastructure, and 1 percent to leasing and business development activities.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company reported a net loss of $4.8 million for the first quarter 2018, which includes $24.4 million in non-cash mark-to-market losses related to hedging activities. This compares to the Company's reported net income of $15.7 million for the first quarter 2017. The Company's Adjusted Loss to common stockholders (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first quarter 2018 was $4.4 million.\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) of approximately $117.9 million was 133 percent higher when compared to first quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX of $50.6 million. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these, and other, non-GAAP measures to their related GAAP measures is provided within the tables of this release.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE\nThe Company reported general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses of $22.4 million in the first quarter 2018. Included in G&A expenses are $0.4 million in acquisition and divestiture costs, $(0.4) million of non-cash restricted stock, and $(0.9) million associated with a change in the value of phantom units that periodically vest in accordance with the terms of the Company's stock-based compensation plan. Excluding these items, Base G&A expense (a non-GAAP financial measure defined as G&A expenses less non-recurring and non-cash items described above) during the first quarter 2018 was approximately $23.3 million.\nThe Company presents Base G&A expense in addition to reported G&A expense in accordance with GAAP.

HEDGING UPDATE\nOn a consolidated basis, the Company has hedged approximately 22,000 Bbls per day of its 2018 oil production and 191,000 million British thermal units (\"MMBtu\") per day of its 2018 natural gas production, and approximately 10,600 Bbls per day of its 2019 oil production and 48,000 MMBtu per day of its 2019 natural gas production. Additional information on the Company's hedge positions can be found in the Sanchez Energy Investor Presentation posted at www.sanchezenergycorp.com .\nLIQUIDITY AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nIn February 2018, the Company announced and closed a comprehensive financing strategy that included the issuance of $500 million in 7.25% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2023. In conjunction with the financing strategy, the Company reduced the size of its parent-level credit facility from a commitment level of $300 million to $25 million, which remains available for working capital and to support credit and hedging activities of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The maturity date of that facility was also extended from 2019 to 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had liquidity of approximately $734 million, which consisted of $550 million in cash and cash equivalents, $184 million of combined borrowing capacity under two credit facilities, which include the parent-level credit facility, which was undrawn, and a subsidiary-level (\"UnSub\") revolving credit facility with a borrowing base and commitment amount of $330 million and $159 million of available borrowing capacity. After the end of the quarter, the Company repaid $4 million of principal under the UnSub revolving credit facility.\nSHARE COUNT\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 85.2 million common shares outstanding. Assuming all Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock were converted, total outstanding common shares as of March 31, 2018, would have been approximately 97.7 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the weighted average number of unrestricted common shares used to calculate net loss attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted, which are determined in accordance with GAAP, was 80.9 million.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nSanchez Energy will host a conference call for investors on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

It is also used to assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Our Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDAX in the same manner. The following table presents a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDAX (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss) $ (4,815 ) $ 15,735 Adjusted by: Interest expense 43,920 33,025 Net (gains) losses on commodity derivative contracts 44,054 (38,881 ) Net settlements paid on commodity derivative contracts (1) (19,651 ) (2,907 ) Exploration expense 33 352 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 59,248 26,404 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties 948 1,845 Non-cash stock-based compensation (benefit) expense (375 ) 12,091 Acquisition and divestiture costs included in general and administrative 365 24,074 Income tax benefit — (953 ) Gains on sale of oil and natural gas properties — (4,344 ) Gains on other derivatives (336 ) (685 ) (Gains) losses on investments 1,150 (8,864 ) Amortization of deferred gain on Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture (5,929 ) (5,929 ) Interest income (742 ) (357 ) Adjusted EBITDAX (2) $ 117,870 $ 50,606 (1) This amount has been reduced by premiums associated with derivatives that settled during the respective periods,\nwhich may include premiums accrued but not yet paid as of the end of the quarter based on timing of cash settlement\npayments with counterparties. (2) UnSub component of 1Q18 and 1Q17 Adjusted EBITDAX was approximately 40 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\nSANCHEZ ENERGY CORPORATION\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – Adjusted Earnings (Loss)\nWe present Adjusted Earnings (Loss) attributable to common stockholders (\"Adjusted Earnings (Loss)\") in addition to our reported net income (loss) in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This information is provided because management believes exclusion of the impact of the items included in our definition of Adjusted Earnings (Loss) below will help investors compare results between periods, identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by these items and highlight the impact that commodity price volatility has on our results. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor is it presented as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted Earnings (Loss) (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ (4,815 ) $ 15,735 Less: Preferred stock dividends (3,987 ) (3,987 ) Preferred unit dividends and distributions (9,908 ) (16,466 ) Preferred unit amortization (5,930 ) (1,710 ) Net loss attributable to common shares and participating securities (24,640 ) (6,428 ) Plus: Net (gains) losses on commodity derivatives contracts 44,054 (38,881 ) Net settlements paid on commodity derivative contracts (1) (19,651 ) (2,907 ) Impairment of oil and natural gas properties 948 1,845 Non-cash stock-based compensation (benefit) expense (375 ) 12,091 Acquisition and divestiture costs included in general and administrative 365 24,074 Gains on sale of oil and natural gas properties — (4,344 ) Gains on other derivatives (336 ) (685 ) (Gains) losses on investments 1,150 (8,864 ) Amortization of deferred gain on Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture (5,929 ) (5,929 ) Tax impact of adjustments to net loss (2) — 1,936 Adjusted Loss (4,414 ) (28,092 ) Adjusted Loss allocable to participating securities (3) - - Adjusted Loss attributable to common stockholders $ (4,414 ) $ (28,092 ) Weighted average number of shares used to calculate loss attributable to common stockholders - basic and\ndiluted 80,919 69,659 (1) This amount has been reduced by premiums associated with derivatives that settled during the respective periods, which may include\npremiums accrued but not yet paid as of the end of the quarter based on timing of cash settlement payments with counterparties. (2) The tax impact is computed by utilizing the Company’s effective tax rate on the adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to Adjusted Loss. (3) The Company's restricted shares of common stock are participating securities. SANCHEZ ENERGY CORPORATION\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – Adjusted Revenues\nWe present Adjusted Revenues in addition to our reported Revenues in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted Revenues as follows: total revenues plus cash settled derivatives. The Company believes Adjusted Revenues provides investors with helpful information with respect to the performance of the Company's operations and management uses Adjusted Revenues to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. See the table below which reconciles Adjusted Revenues and total revenues.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Total Revenues $ 251,228 $ 133,843 Net settlements paid on commodity derivative contracts (1) (19,651 ) (2,907 ) Adjusted Revenue $ 231,577 $ 130,936 (1) This amount has been reduced by premiums associated with derivatives that settled during the respective periods, which may include premiums accrued but not yet paid as of the end of the quarter based on timing of cash settlement payments with counterparties.\nSANCHEZ ENERGY CORPORATION\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – Cash Production Expense,\nNon-Cash Production Expense and Cash G&A\nCash production expense equals oil and natural gas production expense minus non‐cash production expenses. Non-cash production expense equals oil and natural gas production expense minus cash production expenses. Cash G&A expense equals G&A excluding certain non‐recurring acquisition and divestiture expenses and stock based compensation (but includes phantom stock compensation). Cash production expense, non-cash production expense and cash G&A are presented herein in an attempt to assist the public in understanding the difference between oil and natural gas production expense and G&A as will be reported in SEC filed financials. We also view the non‐GAAP measures of cash production expense, non-cash production expense and cash G&A as a useful tool for comparisons of our financial indicators with those of peer companies. In addition, these measures are commonly used by management, analysts and investors as an indicator of cost management and operating efficiency on a comparable basis from period to period. Cash production expense, non-cash production expense and cash G&A should not be considered as an alternative to oil and natural gas production expense or G&A presentations, as defined by GAAP.\nWe are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward‐looking non‐GAAP financial measures, cash production expense, non-cash production expense and cash G&A, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, oil and natural gas production expense and G&A, because the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of the forward‐looking non‐GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available to us without unreasonable efforts. The probable significance of providing these forward‐looking non‐GAAP financial measures without the directly comparable GAAP financial measures is that such GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding non‐GAAP financial measures.\nCOMPANY CONTACT:\nKevin Smith\nVP Investor Relations\n(281) 925-4828\nCham King\nInvestor Relations & Capital Markets\n(713) 756-2797\nGeneral Inquiries: (713) 783-8000\nwww.sanchezenergycorp.com\nSource:Sanchez Energy Corporation",
