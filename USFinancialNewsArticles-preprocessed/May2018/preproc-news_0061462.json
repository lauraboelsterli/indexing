    "text": "0 COMMENTS As Facebook Inc. FB 2.09% and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL 2.56% Google continue to dominate digital ad sales , publishers are increasingly teaming up to give themselves a better shot at competing with the tech giants.\nNew York Media, PopSugar and Rolling Stone are all joining Concert, a digital advertising marketplace operated by Vox Media, the companies said Thursday.\nThe new additions give Concert the ability to sell digital ads across 122 million unduplicated unique site visitors on 40 websites, according to Vox Media. The company is courting other publishers.\n“No individual publisher is going to be able to compete with Facebook and Google,” said Ryan Pauley, vice president of revenue operations at Vox Media and general manager of Concert. “But with Concert, we feel like we have a path to a publisher partnership that can.”\nConcert targets its audiences using a few large categories, such as women’s lifestyle, sports and C-Suite, which correspond to sites in its network. C-Suite, for example, includes Quartz, Recode, Vox, Verge and CNBC.\nConcert shares ad revenue with publishers in the network, said Mr. Pauley, who declined to disclose the share each party keeps.\nConcert, which is a joint venture of Vox Media and Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, still lags far behind the biggest tech giants in terms of global audience size. Facebook, for example, said it had 2.2 billion monthly users as of April.\nThere have been several other attempts by media companies to join forces in battling the tech “duopoly.” In 2016, Gannett, McClatchy, Hearst Newspaper Group and then-Tribune Publishing announced Nucleus Marketing Solutions , an ad sales network to leverage their combined reach.\nA year earlier, multiple publishers formed an automated ad sales alliance called “ Pangea .”\nThe approach is happening in television, too. NBCUniversal, Viacom Inc., Time Warner Inc.’s Turner and 21st Century Fox are all party to OpenAP , a TV network consortium. The idea behind it is to facilitate the targeting of granular audiences on TV, to make it more like digital ad-buying.\nPublishers involved in Concert are not pooling their first-party data, Mr. Pauley said. That limits Concert somewhat in its ability to target audiences with the same specificity of a company like Facebook, which maintains extensive data on its users.\n“What I walk into marketer meetings and say is that Facebook will always have more data than anybody,” Mr. Pauley said. “But what we have with these new markets is highly contextual targets.”\nAt least one company has opted to bow out of Concert. Condé Nast, which publishes titles including Vogue, the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, exited the network after less than a year. The magazine publisher was concerned that implementing technology for Concert was overly burdensome, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nIn a statement, Mr. Pauley said Concert’s “flexibility” and “seamless integration” allows its ad technology to operate successfully at scale.",
