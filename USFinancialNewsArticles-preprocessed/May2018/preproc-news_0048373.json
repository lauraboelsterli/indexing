    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 10:02 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Adds PepsiCo, Enel)\nMay 25 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Friday:\n** PepsiCo Inc said it would buy baked fruit and vegetable snack maker Bare Foods Co, as the food and beverage company expands its fast-growing healthy snack portfolio. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, while CNBC, citing a source, said Pepsi paid less than $200 million.\n** Italy’s biggest utility Enel is in advanced talks with Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko over the sale of Enel’s Reftinskaya coal plant, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.\n** France’s Thales has its eye on bolt-on acquisitions after securing chipmaker Gemalto but feels no immediate pressure to match the scale of ‘nose-to-tail’ aircraft parts suppliers like United Technologies, its chief executive said.\n** Telecom group Telia confirmed it is in talks to buy Bonnier’s broadcasting business, seeking to add television content in a deal which a media report said could be worth 10-12 billion crowns ($1.2 billion-$1.4 billion).\n** Italian oil major Eni is working on a joint bid for Terra Firma’s solar assets in Italy with Qatar Petroleum, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi told Reuters on the sidelines of the St Petersburg Forum.\n** A consortium led by Swiss asset manager Partners Group Holding will buy Techem from Macquarie in a deal that values the German metering company at an enterprise value of 4.6 billion euros ($5.4 billion), Partners Group said.\n** German investment house ATON raised its takeover offer for Murray & Roberts by about 13 percent to $426 million, attempting to secure investor backing after the South African builder struck a deal of its own last week.\n** Polish media and telecoms group Cyfrowy Polsat said late Thursday it agreed to buy a controlling stake in sports content producer and distributor Eleven Sports Network Sp.z o.o. (ESN) for 38 million euros ($44.48 million).\n** India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) are in talks to merge ahead of the implementation of a universal exchange framework in October, the Business Standard newspaper reported.\n** Australian retail conglomerate Wesfarmers is selling UK home improvement chain Homebase for a nominal 1 pound ($1.34) just two years after buying it, ending an embarrassing offshore adventure that cost it $1 billion and sowing doubts about its future investments.
