People stand in line to cast their ballot at the Conservative Party of Canada leadership convention in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, May 27, 2017. REUTERS/Mark Blinch\nThe Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted amid growing fears that outside actors, using social media and other methods, could seek to influence a vote.\nCanada is due to hold a national election in October 2019.\nUnder the proposals, which must be approved by Parliament, foreign entities would be banned from spending any money to influence elections. Previously they were able to spend up to C$500 ($389) without any regulation.\nOrganizations selling advertising space would not be allowed to knowingly accept elections advertisements from foreign entities, according to an official statement.\nRussia ran an information warfare campaign to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Republicans on a congressional panel said in a report released last Friday.\nRussia has repeatedly denied any effort to influence the U.S. election.\n($1 = 1.2842 Canadian dollars)",
