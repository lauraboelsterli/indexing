But he was brought down last year by scandal. More than 70 women have accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.\nThe event faces “a critical test for its viability”, Hollywood Reporter said in an article suggesting it had become tainted by the scandal due to Weinstein’s former involvement.\n“Tonight’s event is going to be just as exciting and entertaining as always while raising critical funds for AIDS Research,” amfAR said in reply to Reuters’ request for comment.\nHundreds of guests were invited to the event held at Cap-Eden-Roc, an exclusive hotel on the Cap d’Antibes juts into the Mediterranean along the coast Cannes.\nGrace Jones, Ellie and Sting are due to perform and the lots at auction include a sculpture by Ai Weiwei, a vintage Bentley convertible and an authorised replica of Michelangelo’s David, with proceeds going amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.\nStars often also offer themselves for auction. Last year David Beckham raised 350,000 euros ($415,000) for a chance to play soccer with him.\nAnother year George Clooney auctioned a kiss for $350,000 and, in 2008, Weinstein joked he might put himself up for bids, but admitted: “No one would pay for me”.\nIn 1999, when asked if he would get the host Sharon Stone to “strut some stuff” to help raise money, he replied: “Listen I’ll make Sharon do a striptease for the charity.”\nThe Cannes Film Festival to May 19.
