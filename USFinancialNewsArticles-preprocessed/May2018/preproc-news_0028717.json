    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Friday gave Defence Minister Khurrram Dastagir Khan the additional portfolio of foreign affairs.\nFILE PHOTO - Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi arrives to attend The Queen's Dinner during The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), at Buckingham Palace in London on April 19, 2018. Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via Reuters Khan will take on the responsibilities of former Foreign Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif who was disqualified from being a member of the parliament by a Pakistani court late last month for not disclosing a foreign source of income.\n“The prime minister has been pleased to assign, with immediate effect, the additional portfolio of foreign affairs to Eng. Khurram Dastgir Khan, federal minister for Defence,” the prime minister’s office said.\nKhan is assuming the foreign ministry office as the ruling party of ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif prepares to face new elections in late July.\nKhan, a young politician from the ruling party, is considered one of the close confidants of the ousted prime minister.\nReporting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
