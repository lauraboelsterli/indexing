    "text": "LEXINGTON, Mass., May 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pulmatrix, Inc. (NASDAQ: PULM) today reports its first quarter results.\n\"We reached a major milestone for our Pulmazole program in the first quarter with the initiation of dosing in our phase 1/1b study. With a financing that closed in April, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet by bringing in gross proceeds of $15.9 million,\" said Robert W. Clarke, Ph.D. , chief executive officer of Pulmatrix.\nFinancials\nAs of March 31, 2018, Pulmatrix had $1.55 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $3.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In early April 2018, Pulmatrix completed a financing that resulted in $15.9 million total gross proceeds, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.\nPulmatrix generated $0.2 million of revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to no revenue for the first quarter of 2017. The revenue for the first quarter of 2018 resulted from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics award related to our Pulmazole program.\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.2 million, compared to $1.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in clinical development costs and external service costs on the Pulmazole and PUR1800 projects. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 million, compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased employment costs and increased patent costs relating to the in-licensed Respivert compounds.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.2 million compared to a net loss of $3.5 million in the same period last year. The increase in net loss was attributable to the noted operating expense increases.\nAbout Pulmatrix\nPulmatrix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary disease using its patented iSPERSE™ technology. The Company's proprietary product pipeline is focused on advancing treatments for serious lung diseases, including Pulmazole, an inhaled anti-fungal for patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (\"ABPA\"), and PUR1800, a narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor for patients with obstructive lung diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\"). In addition, Pulmatrix has partnered with Vectura Group plc to develop Pulmatrix's drug candidate, PUR0200, for COPD for the U.S. market. Pulmatrix's product candidates are based on iSPERSE™, its proprietary engineered dry powder delivery platform, which seeks to improve therapeutic delivery to the lungs by maximizing local concentrations and reducing systemic side effects to improve patient outcomes.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this press release that are forward-looking and not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
