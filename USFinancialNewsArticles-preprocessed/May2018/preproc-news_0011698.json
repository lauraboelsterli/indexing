It sells Shell-branded fuels and lubricants at nearly 2,000 filling stations in 15 African countries.\n“It’s a success,” said Vivo Chief Executive Christian Chammas. “The offer was seriously oversubscribed.”\nThe IPO is the most significant Africa-focused listing in London since Seplat raised $500 million in a 2014 IPO with a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. [ reut.rs/2HUmgGb ]\nChammas said the listing would allow the company to join the benchmark FTSE 250 index.\n($1 = 0.7375 pounds)",
