    "text": "NEW YORK, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P SmallCap 600 constituent McDermott International Inc. (NYSE:MDR) will replace Diebold Nixdorf Inc. (NYSE:DBD) in the S&P MidCap 400, and Diebold Nixdorf will replace McDermott International in the S&P SmallCap 600 effective prior to the open of trading on Thursday, May 10. McDermott International is merging with Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (NYSE:CBI) in a deal expected to be completed on or about that date pending final conditions. Post-merger, the combined company will have a market capitalization more representative of the mid-cap market space. Diebold Nixdorf is ranked at the bottom of the S&P MidCap 400 and is no longer appropriate for that index.\nMcDermott International provides engineering, procurement, construction and installation, front-end engineering and design, and module fabrication services for upstream field developments. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 Global Industry Classification Sector (GICS) Oil & Gas Equipment & Services Sub-Industry index.\nDiebold Nixdorf provides connected commerce solutions to financial institutions and retailers. Headquartered in North Canton, OH, the company will be added to the S&P SmallCap 600 GICS Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals Sub-Industry index.\nFollowing is a summary of the change:\nS&P MIDCAP 400 INDEX – May 10, 2018\nCOMPANY\nGICS ECONOMIC SECTOR\nGICS SUB-INDUSTRY\nADDED\nMcDermott\nInternational\nEnergy\nOil & Gas Equipment &\nServices\nDELETED\nDiebold Nixdorf\nInformation Technology\nTechnology Hardware,\nStorage & Peripherals\nS&P SMALLCAP 600 INDEX – May 10, 2018\nCOMPANY\nGICS ECONOMIC SECTOR\nGICS SUB-INDUSTRY\nADDED\nDiebold Nixdorf\nInformation Technology\nTechnology Hardware,\nStorage & Peripherals\nDELETED\nMcDermott\nInternational\nEnergy\nOil & Gas Equipment &\nServices\nFor more information about S&P Dow Jones Indices, please visit www.spdji.com\nABOUT S&P DOW JONES INDICES\nS&P Dow Jones Indices is the largest global resource for essential index-based concepts, data and research, and home to iconic financial market indicators, such as the S&P 500 ® and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ® .
