    "text": "Just off the coast of Massachusetts is the tiny island of Nantucket — where some of the nation's wealthiest individuals own summer vacation homes, from Google's Eric Schmidt (net worth: $13.8 billion ) to former GE CEO Jack Welch .\nSotheby's International Realty There's also \"Harbor Hill,\" a waterfront vacation compound on the island, recently listed for $42.5 million.\nSource: Sotheby’s International Realty From a bird's eye view, the 18,000-square-foot residence looks like a cluster of 12 separate cottages. \"Each structure is very reminiscent of classic New England architecture,\" says Sotheby's International Realty broker Donna Barnett.\nSource: Sotheby’s International Realty But one step inside, you'll observe that each \"cottage\" is actually a different room within the mega-home, connected by enclosed breezeways. In other words, there's a structure just for the great room, dining room, kitchen, master bedroom and so on.\nSource: Sotheby’s International Realty It's also a smart home: \"Each room has an iPad that controls everything: the TVs, the heating, the cooling, the music, the lighting,\" says Barnett. \"The technology alone is worth is $2.5 million.\"\nCNBC The owner, a telecom entrepreneur based in Palm Beach, Florida, has his high-tech touches everywhere — in the master suite a covert that TV rises up from the floorboards.\nWhen the owner wanted to watch an even bigger screen, he would head down to the mega-home's state-of-the-art subterranean movie theater.\nCNBC \"It's unlike any other movie theater on the entire island,\" Barnett says.\nWhile most homeowners would probably conceal the hardware and wiring in their homes, this tech-loving owner was so proud of the \"brains\" of this house, he had it all enclosed in an air-conditioned glass room and lit it up like a giant work of art.\nCNBC The 23-room summer compound also has two separate cottages out back — one for the pool house and the other for the guest house — with a private gym, steam room, and sauna.\nSource: Sotheby’s International Realty \"People come to Nantucket to escape, to unwind,\" says Barnett. \"This is the perfect property to do that in.\"\nWant more mansion inspiration?
