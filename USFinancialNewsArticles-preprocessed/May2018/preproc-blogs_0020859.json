    "text": "0 COMMENTS ThoughtSpot co-founder Ajeet Singh Photo: ThoughtSpot\nAnalytics startup ThoughtSpot raised $145 million in new funding as data-driven decision-making becomes standard across the enterprise.\nThe Series D round brings ThoughtSpot’s total funding to $306 million, and values the startup at more than $1 billion. Investors include Lightspeed Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Khosla Ventures, the Australian Government Future Fund and General Catalyst.\nThoughtSpot, co-founded in 2012 by Nutanix co-founder Ajeet Singh, provides an analytics platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze enterprise data. After creating a cache of corporate information spanning sales, HR and other sources, the platform allows users to type in a phrase such as “product sales state last quarter” and generate a visualization. A new product, SpotIQ, uses machine learning to identify trends or relationships between different data sources.\nAn example of a visualization generated by ThoughtSpot Photo: ThoughtSpot\nCustomers include three of the Fortune 5, Mr. Singh said, as well as firms including Capital One Financial Corp., Chevron Corp., diamond firm De Beers, and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BT Group PLC uses the technology to power a tool that lets the telecom provider analyze their bills on the company’s website.\nAnalytics and business intelligence was an $18.3 billion market in 2017, according to Gartner Inc. By 2022, it’s expected to grow to nearly $28 billion. The research firm predicts that “augmented analytics,” which includes using natural-language queries and visual-based data discovery, will be a key driver of enterprise purchasing decisions.\nPlatforms that slice and dice corporate data are not new, but demand for high-powered, easy-to-use analytics platforms has risen as the need for data analytics skills grows outside the IT department. Teams in marketing, finance, HR and other functions increasingly are expected to crunch data ranging from sales figures to weather patterns to help drive their decision making.\nMuch of the process remains manual, Gartner analyst Rita Sallam said. If an analyst sees sales are declining in a certain region, for example, he or she has to conduct additional analysis to figure out if it’s due to pricing, seasonality, product quality or any number of other factors.\n“It’s virtually impossible for an analyst to do an exhaustive, unbiased, accurate assessment of what’s going on in the business,” Ms. Sallam said.\nPlatforms like ThoughtSpot helps automate some of the process, parsing corporate data to find connections and create visualizations. The ability to enter natural-language search terms makes it easier for non-experts to query the data, she said.\nThoughtSpot plans to use the funding to build out its platform, expand in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, and grow its R&D centers. The company also is working on tools that help users discover information on the platform, such as a recommendation engine that points employees to popular charts being generated within the company, Mr. Singh said.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: AJEET SINGH ANALYTICS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DATA VISUALIZATION THOUGHSPOT Previous MuleSoft Founder Connects with Salesforce in Massive Acquisition Next The Morning Download: AI Startup ThoughtSpot Raises $145 Million",
