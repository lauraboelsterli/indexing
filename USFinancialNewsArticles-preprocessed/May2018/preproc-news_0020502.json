Slideshow (5 Images)\nThe draw means City have 94 points, one short of the season record set by Chelsea back in 2004-05, but they still have two games left to play.\nHuddersfield gave their survival hopes a huge boost with a point that moves them three clear of the bottom three ahead of their midweek trip to Chelsea.
