    "text": "BERLIN, May 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to launch a national security investigation into car imports marks a further low point in business ties with Europe and could lead to costs of 6 billion euros, Germany’s DIHK Chambers of Industries and Commerce said on Thursday.\n“To cite aspects of national security as justification is totally constructed and far-fetched. We almost have to take this as a provocation,” DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said.\nThe U.S. administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March.
