Zapico, AMETEK Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Excellent organic sales growth, contributions from recently completed acquisitions and exceptional operating performance allowed AMETEK to deliver 30% earnings growth in the quarter. Record backlog, continued strong order momentum and positive market trends provides us with an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, prompting us to raise our full year guidance for 2018.\"\nElectronic Instruments Group (EIG)\nIn the first quarter of 2018, EIG sales were $716.4 million, up 16% over the same quarter of 2017.

EMG also delivered solid operating performance in the quarter through the execution of our operational excellence efforts,\" noted Mr. Zapico.\n2018 Outlook\n\"The first quarter's results were excellent and firmly position AMETEK for strong sales and earnings growth in 2018. Our businesses continue to deliver exceptional performance, generating excellent sales growth, margin expansion and cash flows through the execution of our Four Growth Strategies. We remain focused on strategically investing in our businesses to accelerate growth both organically and through value enhancing strategic acquisitions,\" commented Mr. Zapico.\n\"We now expect overall sales in 2018 to increase low-double digits on a percentage basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits. We are increasing our 2018 earnings guidance range to $3.06 to $3.12 per diluted share, up 17% to 20% over 2017's adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is an increase from our initial guidance range of $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share,\" he added.\n\"Overall sales in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to be up approximately 10% compared to the same quarter in 2017. We expect second quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, up 17% to 20% over the same quarter last year,\" concluded Mr. Zapico.\nConference Call\nAMETEK will webcast its first quarter 2018 investor conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, beginning at 8:30 AM ET.
