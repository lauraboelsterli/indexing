    "text": "First quarter 2018 reported net income was $79 million or $0.43 per share; Adjusted net income for the quarter was $93 million or $0.51 per share, up 31 percent versus the prior year period Xylem delivered $1.2 billion in first quarter 2018 revenue, up 14 percent year-over-year including the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions Orders increased 10 percent organically Reported and adjusted EBITDA increased 110 and 130 basis points, respectively\nRYE BROOK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $79 million, or $0.43 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring, realignment, acquisition-related charges and other special items, the Company delivered adjusted net income of $93 million or $0.51 per share in the quarter, a 31-percent increase over the prior year period. First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14 percent including the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions. Revenue for the quarter increased seven percent on an organic basis, driven by a strong performance in the utilities and industrial end markets in nearly every geography and continued solid growth in the commercial and residential end markets. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 17.5 percent driven by volume leverage and savings from productivity initiatives. Reported operating margin in the quarter was 9.3 percent and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.1 percent, including a 40-basis-point negative impact due to purchase accounting amortization.\n“Focused execution and increased collaboration by our teams resulted in a strong start to 2018,” said Patrick Decker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xylem. “We delivered another consecutive quarter of strong growth in revenue, orders and backlog, which sets us up for a solid year ahead. We’re encouraged by the continuing momentum we see in both the utilities and industrial end markets, where we are capturing share. In addition, our growing portfolio of advanced technologies is opening up new opportunities to expand our relationship with current customers and cultivate new ones. We continue to successfully execute against our productivity plans, which is helping to fund our growth initiatives and mitigate inflation. Looking ahead, we have strong confidence in our plans to drive continued profitable growth as we deepen our customer relationships and partnerships.”\nFull-year 2018 Outlook\nXylem continues to forecast full-year 2018 revenue in the range of $5.1 to $5.2 billion, up eight to 10 percent, including growth from previously announced acquisitions. On an organic basis, Xylem continues to anticipate revenue growth in the range of four to six percent.\nFull-year 2018 adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 13.9 to 14.3 percent, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 to $2.97. This represents an increase of 18 to 24 percent from Xylem’s 2017 adjusted results. The Company’s adjusted earnings outlook excludes projected integration, restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $35 million for the year. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.\nFirst Quarter Segment Results\nWater Infrastructure\nXylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $480 million, up nine percent organically compared with first quarter 2017. This growth includes strong results in the utilities end market, particularly in the U.S. which was up 10 percent. The industrial end market also continued to show solid growth, reflecting healthy market conditions in the U.S. for dewatering applications. First quarter reported operating income for the segment was $49 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $5 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $54 million, a 20-percent increase over the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the Water Infrastructure segment increased 30 basis points to 14.6 percent. Reported operating margin for the segment was 10.2 percent, up 40 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 11.3 percent. This growth reflects volume leverage and productivity gains, partially offset by inflation, a higher mix of treatment project deliveries and foreign exchange impacts.\nApplied Water\nXylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, and industrial applications.\nFirst quarter 2018 Applied Water revenue was $366 million, a seven-percent increase organically year-over-year. This performance reflects double-digit growth in Western Europe and solid increases in the U.S. and Emerging Markets. In the U.S., the business experienced continued improvement in large industrial projects, and also captured share gains across all end markets in Western Europe. In addition, commercial building applications showed solid growth from demand for projects. First quarter reported operating income for the segment was $50 million and adjusted operating income, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $53 million, an 18-percent increase over the comparable period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the Applied Water segment was 16.1 percent, an increase of 110 basis points over the prior year. Reported operating margin was 13.7 percent, up 290 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 14.5 percent as volume leverage and productivity initiatives more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix.\nMeasurement & Control Solutions\nXylem’s Measurement & Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics and analytic instrumentation.\nFirst quarter 2018 Measurement & Control Solutions revenue was $371 million, up five percent organically versus the prior year period. This reflects solid growth in the Sensus business, up six percent year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in North America. Double-digit growth in the electric, gas and services businesses was partially offset by modest declines in the water sector, which primarily reflects the timing of large project deliveries in Western Europe and the Middle East in the year-ago period. Xylem’s legacy analytics business increased three percent organically in the quarter. First quarter reported operating income for the segment was $33 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $10 million of restructuring and realignment costs and acquisition-related costs, was $43 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the Measurement & Control Solutions segment increased 270 basis points to 21.8 percent. Reported operating margin for the segment was 8.9 percent. Adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 11.6 percent as volume leverage and price combined with cost reductions more than offset inflation, the funding of strategic R&D investments and higher purchase accounting amortization.\nSupplemental information on Xylem’s first quarter 2018 earnings and reconciliations for certain non-GAAP items is posted at www.xylem.com/investors .\nAbout Xylem\nXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to developing innovative technology solutions to the world’s water challenges.

Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or \"adjusted\") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:\n“Organic revenue\" and \"Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.\n“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n“EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation charges, restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses and special charges.\n\"Adjusted Operating Income\", \"Adjusted Segment Operating Income\", \"Adjusted Net Income\" and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, adjusted net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable. For Sensus historical adjustments, see Sensus Historical - Adjusted Operating Income table.\n“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.\n“Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs.\n“Sensus Acquisition Related Costs \" defined as costs incurred by the Company associated with the acquisition of Sensus that are being reported within operating income. These costs include integration costs, acquisition costs, costs related to the recognition of the backlog intangible asset amortization recorded in purchase accounting.\n“Special charges \" defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as non-cash impairment charges, due diligence costs, initial acquisition and integration costs not related to Sensus and other special non-operating items.\n“Tax-related special items \" defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, significant reserves for cash repatriation, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments.\n\"Pro forma\" defined as including the results of Sensus for the calendar period prior to the acquisition of Sensus by Xylem Inc. on October 31, 2016.\nXylem Inc.
