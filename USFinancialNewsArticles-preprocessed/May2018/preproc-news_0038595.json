    "text": "TORONTO, May 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Colliers International Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CIGI) (TSX:CIGI) (\" Colliers \") announced today that it has reinforced its already-strong balance sheet with the issuance of €210 million of senior unsecured notes, with a ten-year term and a fixed interest rate of 2.23%. The senior notes were placed privately and rank equally with Colliers’ senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The proceeds of the issuance will be drawn on May 30, 2018. Colliers intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n“This Euro-denominated debt issuance aligns extremely well with the significant investments we have made in our European operations over the past few years, providing us with a natural hedge on foreign exchange risk,” said Christian Mayer, Vice President, Finance & Treasurer.\n“This issuance extends our debt maturities, increases our fixed-rate debt profile to mitigate the impact of future increases in interest rates and secures attractively priced debt capital from high quality institutions for the long term,” said John B. Friedrichsen, Chief Financial Officer. “We look forward to a long and mutually rewarding relationship with our note-holders as we continue to execute our disciplined growth strategy in the years to come,” he concluded.\nThe notes offered in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes described in this press release, nor shall there be any sale of notes in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful prior to registration under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nAbout Colliers International Group Inc.\nColliers International Group Inc.
