    "text": "ISTANBUL—Editor in Chief Murat Sabuncu and 13 colleagues at the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet are back at work in time to cover next month’s national elections, after as much as 17 months in jail and terrorism convictions that could send some of them back to prison for years.\nBut emergency rule, a media crackdown and an antigovernment reputation that has scared away advertisers have left their newspaper, a rare independent voice in Turkey, operating on a shoestring.\n ",
