    "text": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has broken relations with Burkina Faso after the African nation said it had cut diplomatic ties with the self-ruled island, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Thursday.\nWu, speaking at a news briefing, expressed regret at the decision, and added that Taiwan cannot compete with Chinaâ€™s financial resources.\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any foreign country.\nTaiwan and China have competed for influence internationally for decades, often dangling generous aid packages in front of poorer nations, though Taiwan is increasingly unable and unwilling to match Chinese aid offers.\nReporting by Jess Macy Yu; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
