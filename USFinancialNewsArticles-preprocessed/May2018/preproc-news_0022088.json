    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 8:41 AM / Updated an hour ago Hong Kong Q1 GDP grows 4.7 pct, best pace in nearly 7 years Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nHONG KONG, May 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s economy grew 4.7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the government said on Friday, the fastest annual pace for any quarter in nearly seven years.\nThe growth rate compares with an annual 3.4 percent in the last three months of 2017.\nThe last time annual growth was faster than 4.7 percent was in April-June 2011, when it was 5.1 percent.\nIn January-March, the economy expanded 2.2 percent from the previous quarter, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. The quarterly pace was faster than the fourth quarter’s 0.8 percent.\nThe government is forecasting GDP growth of 3-4 percent this year. For full-year 2017, it reported 3.3 percent expansion.
