    "text": "(Fixes day in first paragraph to Tuesday from Monday)\nPARIS, May 1 (Reuters) - France’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that information provided by Israel of Iran’s past nuclear weapons programme could be a basis for long-term monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear activities.\nThe ministry said Israeli intelligence information presented on Monday in part confirmed the non-civilian nature of the programme revealed by European powers in 2002, but that it merely proved the need to ensure the nuclear deal and U.N. inspections remained.
