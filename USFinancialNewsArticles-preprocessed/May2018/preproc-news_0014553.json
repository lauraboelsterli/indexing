    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 5:54 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Bardem and Cruz walk the red carpet to open Cannes Film Festival Robin Pomeroy 3 Min Read\nCANNES, France (Reuters) - Spanish film royalty, Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, walked the red carpet to open the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday with their film “Everybody Knows”, written and directed by Iranian double-Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi.\nFarhadi strode up the red carpet arm in arm with Bardem and Cruz, who wore a black ball gown and long ruby earrings, and Bardem, along with Argentine co-star Ricardo Darin, who is also a screenwriter and director in his own right.\nThe film is one of 21 vying for the Palme d’Or at the first Cannes festival since sexual abuse and harassment allegations rocked the global movie industry and gave birth to the MeToo campaign to get greater female participation in films.\nCannes has set up a hotline for victims to report any abuse during the festival and will host a series of discussions on the issue. And the jury that will award the Palme d’Or is this year headed by a woman, Australian actress Cate Blanchett, and is majority-female.\nBut Blanchett said the increased awareness of women’s issues would have “no direct impact” on who wins.\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that of the 21 films in the main competition, there were only three directed by women, Blanchett told a news conference:\n“A few years ago there were only two!”\n Opening ceremony and screening of the film \"Everybody Knows\" (Todos lo saben) in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France, May 8, 2018 - cast members Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem arrive. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n fortnight.\nAfter Farhadi, another Iranian director, Jafar Panahi, will screen a movie in competition, but will be that his supporters say are politically motivated.\nBlanchett, films Slideshow (4 Images)\n ",
