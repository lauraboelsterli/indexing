    "text": "FRANKFURT, May 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank is cutting a team of 10 investment bankers in London focused on deals in emerging markets, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.\nThe team, led by 18-year Deutsche veteran Philipp von Danwitz, learned of the cuts this week, the person said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThey worked on mergers and acquisitions in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\nThey are just a handful of the 600 bankers let go so far over recent weeks since Christian Sewing took over as the German lenderâ€™s chief executive officer. He is aiming to reduce global staff by more than 7,000.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nFinancial News first reported the dismissals.\nReporting by Tom Sims Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
