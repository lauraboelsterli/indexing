The decrease was due to lower product sales (hardware and software) by $0.5 million partially offset by higher managed services and professional services revenue of $0.4 million.\nTotal expenses were $954,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $983,000 in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to decreased general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses.\nNet and comprehensive loss totaled $548,000 or $(0.03) per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to a loss of $537,000 or $(0.10) per share in the same year-ago quarter.\n2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue increased 18% in 2017 to a record $10.5 million, as compared to $8.9 million in 2016. Managed and professional services increased 35% increase while product sales (hardware and software) increased 13%. The improvements reflected an increase in the number of customers during the year, as well as the size of product orders from new and existing customers.\nTotal expenses were $3.9 million in 2017 as compared to $3.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due expansion of sales and marketing teams, and to a lesser extent increased general and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreased research and development expenses.\nNet and comprehensive loss totaled $1.8 million or $(0.03) per share in 2017, an improvement from a net loss of $2.3 million or $(0.04) per share in 2016.\nManagement Commentary\n“In 2017, our record top-line growth was driven by an expanding revenue stream from managed services and professional services, as the global managed services industry continued to grow,” commented Todd Kannegieter, CEO and CFO of VirtualArmour. “We added 34 new customers in 2017 while achieving an industry-leading customer retention rate of 100%.\n“Several of these new clients became part of our managed services practice, while others came under professional services. The majority procured hardware and software cybersecurity solutions from us, which we deployed and continue to manage and maintain.\n“This momentum has continued into 2018, as we strengthened our balance sheet with a $1.6 million capital raise to further accelerate our growth and our stock began trading on the OTC Markets. We also signed three new multi-year managed service contracts and expanded the managed services for an existing customer, increasing contract revenue by more than $800,000. This elevated our managed service customer base and revenue stream to record levels.\n“For the remainder of 2018, we see continued widespread growth in demand for cybersecurity managed services, with this accelerating the adoption of our superior service offerings. We also expect to enter new geographical markets, led by our growing sales, marketing and service organization that is 100% focused on customer experience and security. We believe this will keep us on track for another year of record growth and expansion.”\nAbout VirtualArmour\nVirtualArmour is a premier Managed Services Provider (MSP) delivering customizable management of advanced network and security services to global businesses across numerous industry sectors.
