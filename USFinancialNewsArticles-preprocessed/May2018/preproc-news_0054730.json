    "text": "The first named tropical weather system of the 2018 hurricane season has formed. The National Hurricane Center says a disturbance moving toward the Gulf of Mexico is now Subtropical Storm Alberto.\nAlberto had top sustained winds of 40 mph early Friday and was located 55 miles south of Cozumel, Mexico . The storm was moving north-northeast at 6 mph. The storm is expected to bring heavy rain to the Yucatan Peninsula, western Cuba , Florida and the northeastern Gulf Coast throughout the weekend.\nA subtropical storm has a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds are found farther from its center. Subtropical storms can develop into tropical storms, which in turn can strengthen into hurricanes.",
