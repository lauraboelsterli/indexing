    "text": "RICHLAND, Wash., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IsoRay, Inc. (NYSE American:ISR), a medical technology company and innovator in seed brachytherapy and medical radioisotope applications for the treatment of prostate, brain, lung, head and neck and gynecological cancers, today announced the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.57 million, a 23% increase compared to revenue of $1.28 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and a 2% increase compared to revenue of $1.54 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The revenue increase was driven by the deepening traction of the Company’s new sales and marketing initiatives, launched 18 months ago, combined with the increasing effectiveness of the new sales team. Prostate brachytherapy represented 83% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 88% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Growing use of IsoRay’s exclusive Cesium-131 isotope in other cancers, such as brain, head and neck, and gynecological, among others, accounted for the difference.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.61 million, a 110% increase compared to $0.29 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 and an improvement over the $0.53 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily due to ongoing cost saving initiatives, including lower procurement costs and reduced staffing expenses, which included moving certain production personnel to research and development projects. Gross profit margin was 39% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 23% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 35% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nTotal operating expenses were $1.95 million compared to $1.68 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Continued increases in research & development and sales & marketing expenses, including higher headcount, were muted by a decrease in general & administrative expenses, which included reductions in legal and consulting fees and benefits from other efficiency enhancement programs. The increase in sales resulted in higher incentive compensation. The increase in research & development expenses was related to further investment in FDA 510(k) costs and product development. Operating loss in the current period was $1.34 million compared to a $1.39 million loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and a loss of $1.47 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The net loss was $1.33 million, or ($0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $1.36 million, or ($0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted per share results are based on weighted average shares outstanding of 55.1 million and 55.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. IsoRay had cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $4.5 million as of March 31, 2018, and no debt.\n“We’re gratified to report another strong quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter with a year-over-year increase,” said Thomas LaVoy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IsoRay, Inc. “This sustained growth is a result of the increasing impact of the experienced sales team that we put in place 18 months ago and reflects the early success of IsoRay’s continued investment in providing support to our customers and raising awareness with consumers.”\n“In addition, the prostate cancer market continues to benefit from a series of recent studies that have highlighted the advantages of including brachytherapy as part of a treatment regimen for high risk patients. As a result, we continue to have physicians and surgeons returning to IsoRay as well as a growing number of procedures being conducted by our current customers. We are also working with a number of target institutions and practices to bring them through the sales and approval cycle, which can take up to 6-12 months. Taken together, we remain confident about our outlook for revenue growth going forward and our guidance for revenue growth of at least 20%, or approximately $5.8 million, for the fiscal year ending on June 30 th ,” concluded Mr. LaVoy.\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018, revenue was $4.32 million, a 27% increase compared to revenue of $3.39 million for the same period of fiscal 2017. Prostate brachytherapy represented 86% of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 88% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Gross profit for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.41 million, a 315% increase compared to $0.34 million in the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017. Operating expenses were $5.76 million compared to $4.78 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Operating loss was $4.36 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a $4.44 million operating loss for the comparable period of fiscal 2017. The net loss for the nine-month period was $4.34 million, or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.31 million, or $(0.08), per basic and diluted share, for the nine-month period of fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted per share results are based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 55.0 million shares in both periods.\nConference Call Details\nManagement of IsoRay will host a teleconference to discuss third quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
