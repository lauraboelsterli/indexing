    "text": "May 22 (Reuters) - Ten-year Japanese government bond futures edged higher on Tuesday, as U.S. Treasuries regained some footing in the wake of last week’s selloff.\nThe lead June 10-year JGB futures rose 0.04 point to 150.75.\nThe benchmark 10-year cash JGB was slightly softer on the day, with its yield ticking up 0.5 basis point to 0.055 percent.\nThe finance ministry’s auction of 20-year JGBs on Tuesday attracted solid demand, with the bid to cover ratio coming in at 4.12, up from 3.69 at the previous 20-year JGB auction.\nThe 20-year JGB yield was flat on the day at 0.535 percent.\nU.S. 10-year Treasuries edged up in Tuesday’s Asian session, with their yields falling by 1 basis point to 3.0541 percent.\nThe U.S. 10-year notes have regained some footing this week as investors evaluated whether last week’s selloff that sent the benchmark 10-year yield to almost seven-year highs was overdone. The focus now is on the level of investor demand at this week’s auctions of short and intermediate-dated notes. (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sunil Nair)\n ",
