    "text": "THE COLONY, Texas, In a release issued under the same headline earlier today by Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC), please note the domestic conference call number should be 1-800-239-9838 rather than 1-800-239-9338 as originally issued.\nThe corrected release follows:\nQuest Resource Holding Reports First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nQuest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) (\"Quest\"), a national leader in environmental reuse, recycling, and disposal services, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenue was $24.7 million compared with $42.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and increased 10% sequentially from $22.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross profit was $3.5 million compared with $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 and increased 16% sequentially from $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin percentage was 14.4% of revenue compared with 9.8% for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 4.6 percentage points. Operating expense was $4.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 21%, compared with the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $1.3 million, a $596,000 improvement compared with the net loss during the first quarter of 2017 and a $267,000 improvement sequentially from the net loss during the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss per share improved $0.04 to $(0.09) compared with $(0.13) for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $114,000, a 9% increase, compared with $105,000 for the first quarter of 2017, and a $388,000 improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nKey Recent Highlights\nSequential improvement in financial performance – For the first quarter of 2018, the sequential improvement in financial performance was primarily driven by the implementation of a new contract with a national automotive service provider as well as implementation activity in the industrial vertical, which ramped steadily during the quarter. Joint marketing effort with Shell Lubricants® to expand Quest’s addressable market – Quest recently announced a joint marketing agreement with Shell Lubricants. Under the agreement, Shell Lubricants will market Quest’s recycling services to its current and target customer base, which represents a new and expanded addressable market for Quest. Through this program, Quest will provide waste oil recycling services to a variety of regional and local auto service center chains that utilize Shell Lubricants’ motor oil products in their operations.\n\"First quarter results were in line with our expectations, and the previously delayed customer implementations are beginning to ramp and contribute to sequential revenue and earnings growth.” said S. Ray Hatch, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are building a significant pipeline of new business and expect new innovative programs, such as the one we announced with Shell, to provide significant growth opportunities. We have made progress toward our annual targets and expect to show improvement throughout the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast\nQuest will conduct a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 4:00 p.m. Central Time, to review the financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Investors interested in participating on the live call can dial 1-800-239-9838 within the U.S. or 1-323-794-2551 from abroad. The conference call, which may include forward-looking statements, is also being webcast and is available via the investor relations section of Quest’s website at www.qrhc.com . A replay of the webcast will be archived on Quest’s investor relations website for 90 days.\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, a non-GAAP financial measure, \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" is presented. From time-to-time, Quest considers and uses this supplemental measure of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. Quest believes it is useful to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) certain other adjustments, and (2) non-GAAP measures that exclude such items. Quest presents this non-GAAP measure because it considers it an important supplemental measure of Quest's performance. Quest's definition of this adjusted financial measure may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Quest believes this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. This non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's GAAP measures. (See attached table \"Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\")\nAbout Quest Resource Holding Corporation\nQuest is a national provider of reuse, recycling, and disposal services that enable our customers to achieve their environmental and sustainability goals and responsibilities.
