    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. I wonder when the world will call a moratorium on inter-brand-banter. Until then, here’s the latest: A Massachusetts Burger King used its store marquee to ask a neighboring Wendy’s to prom . Of course it was promoted on Twitter. And of course the salty Wendy’s social account said yes. True love is measured in social media impressions.\nDazed and Confused The annual dog and pony show that is the TV upfronts kicks off on Monday, but among the ticker tape cannons and smoke machines, this year’s bonanza also looks set to be shrouded in a cloud of confusion . Why? As The Wall Street Journal’s Joe Flint reports, the burst of industry merger activity means many of the companies and their leadership teams presenting next week could look very different in just a few months time. Interpublic Group’s Magna Global is already predicting that ad spending on broadcast and cable will decline this upfront by at least 1%. That level of uncertainty also won’t be helping networks in the battle for talent with deep-pocketed streaming services including Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n—Gimme, Gimme More—\nA newsletter exclusive : Expect ad load—or the reduction of it—to be a theme during this year’s ad fronts. A number of networks, most notably NBCUniversal and Fox , have recently been experimenting or announcing plans to run fewer commercials. The rationale is that too much clutter leads to ad avoidance and that brands involved in reduced ad pods have a bigger impact. Yet a survey of 304 U.S. marketers and ad-buyers conducted in April by research firm Advertiser Perceptions found just 42% of those polled plan to spend more with networks that run fewer commercials. For those that do, the average premium they’re willing to pay is just 7%. Andy Sippel, Advertiser Perceptions executive vice president, tells me, “Nobody has proof yet that less-cluttered environments drive better business results.” However, he says TV’s push toward attribution and results-based selling will take care of the clutter issue. “The same can be said for innovative ad formats like six-second ads that advertisers haven’t backed yet: they don’t have a basis of proof or value,” Mr. Sippel said. “Once they get it, they’ll be all in.”\nThe Commitments As with Disney’s earnings earlier this week, analysts attempted to grill 21st Century Fox’s executives about their proposed deal, the possibility of a hostile bid from Comcast and what the remaining New Fox will look like once the sale of most of its entertainment assets goes through. But the execs were largely staying mum, with 21st Century Fox Executive Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch declining to comment on what he called “speculation” about Comcast. “ We are committed to our agreement with Disney , and are working through the conditions to bring it to closing,” Mr. Murdoch said. “In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.” As for Current Fox, the company posted a 1.9% dip in revenue to $7.42 billion in its fiscal third-quarter as higher distributor fees failed to offset a fall in ad revenue, compared to the year-ago quarter when it broadcast the Super Bowl. Also on Wednesday, Fox said it was buying seven local TV stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for about $910 million. ( Reminder: 21st Century Fox and The Wall Street Journal’s parent, News Corp, share common ownership.)\nThere’s a Tear In My Beer High-budget, meme-worthy ad campaigns like Bud Light’s “Dilly Dilly” aren’t preventing beer sales from falling flat in the U.S. , the WSJ reports. AB InBev, Molson Coors and Heineken all reported sharply lower U.S. beer volume in the first quarter compared with a year earlier as many drinkers are opting to order other alcoholic beverages like wine or spirits instead. Even craft-beer sales have started to slow recently. Brewers long had advantages over other alcohol rivals: A relatively low alcohol-by-volume content gave it an edge when it came to taxation, distribution and advertising. But that edge is being blunted. Last year, the National Football League lifted a ban on liquor ads, for example, and liquor makers are experimenting with low-calorie and low-carb products. What’s a beer marketer to do? There’s a shift toward offering more choice, healthier products and tempting drinkers to buy more premium beers.\nKeeping Score CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports : ComScore is slowly crawling out of its dark hole with the recent appointment of 360i’s Bryan Wiener as its new CEO . But it might take a little longer for the company to make up for the losses incurred during its last few years of turmoil. The media-measurement company on Wednesday reported a loss of $51.45 million for the first quarter of 2018. That’s compared with a loss of $40.79 million during the same period in 2017. “Investigation and audit-related” expenses of $31.87 million accounted for the bulk of the company’s total loss in the first quarter. ComScore recently released its first annual report in three years, after an internal investigation uncovered improper accounting practices . The company reported a 5% increase in revenue to $105.9 million in the quarter. Mr. Wiener said in the earnings release the revenue lift demonstrates “relative stability” in its digital units and “encouraging growth” in its TV and cross-platform businesses. Looking ahead, Mr. Wiener said comScore plans to accelerate product innovation and simplify its cost structure.\nBest of the rest An NBC internal investigation into accusations of sexual-harassment against Matt Lauer found no evidence that NBC News executives or senior management knew of any misconduct by the former “Today” co-host prior to a complaint in November of inappropriate behavior with a female colleague that led to his firing. [ WSJ ]\nBP selected WPP as its global agency partner after a monthslong review. WPP is forming a dedicated unit called Team Energy to handle BP’s advertising, digital, media, marketing, branding, research, and public-relations needs. [ Adweek ]\nPublishers are reportedly finding Apple News has become a significant source of traffic. [ Business Insider ]\nA+E Networks plans to offer advertisers “outcome-based guarantees” as part of its negotiations to advertisers as part of the upfront. The owner of the A&E, Lifetime and History cable networks will focus the metrics on website visit and foot traffic in retail locations. [ Variety ]\nFX and Hulu announced Wednesday they will air a new television documentary news series from the New York Times, called “The Weekly,” later this year. [ CNN ]\nMDC Partners Chairman and Chief Executive Scott Kauffman said the ad holding company’s first-quarter results were “unacceptable,” citing some client cutbacks and slower conversion in its new business pipeline. Revenue dipped from 344.7 million in the year-ago quarter to $327 million.
