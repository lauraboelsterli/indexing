    "text": "NASHUA, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nrby , pioneer of location-based awareness and collaboration, today announced that Ron Miller has joined the company as Vice President, Product Management. A 25-year cable industry veteran, Miller is responsible for driving a customer-centric approach to product development and helping extend Nrby’s adoption by cable and other service providers.\n“Mobile workers are critical to service providers’ success. They play a key role in customer satisfaction and business continuity by making sure services are working and fixing them when they’re not. But their ability to communicate about plant issues and get jobs done quickly is severely compromised by a lack of intuitive, mobile-native tools. And these inefficiencies are driving higher costs at a time when providers are focused on reducing OpEx,” said Miller. “Nrby has a powerful and highly adaptable mobile-first solution that makes it very easy for field workers to collaborate and for businesses to streamline processes and accelerate actions. I believe it will be a game-changer. I’m excited to direct Nrby’s product strategy and work with customers to realize these important benefits.”\nMiller joins Nrby from Espial, where he was General Manager of Elevate, the business unit created after the company acquired ARRIS’ Consumer Solution business. Previously at ARRIS, he was Vice President of Product Management for Consumer Solutions, which he helped conceptualize and was instrumental in driving product adoption by more than 40 service providers. Earlier he held senior product management roles in ARRIS’ CPE division. Miller’s extensive broadband career also includes product and project management positions at Tellabs and Thomson Multimedia. He earned a B.S. in Computer Engineering from Western New England College and Master of Science degrees from both Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Indiana Wesleyan University.\n“Ron is a highly accomplished cable technology executive with outstanding sales and marketing talents, and a proven track record in launching ground-breaking offerings,” said Kurt Dobbins, CEO and President, Nrby. “His forward-thinking mindset and hands-on approach will be invaluable in directing our product initiatives and inspiring and engaging our customers and employees. I'm thrilled to have Ron join our team.”\nAbout Nrby\nNrby radically improves communications among mobile workforces. With the Nrby mobile app, teams can instantly discover, securely share and rapidly act on nearby issues. Using the app’s SmartPins and SmartForms, workers consistently convey real-time information and leverage machine-generated data in powerful new ways. With Nrby’s location-based awareness and collaboration, it’s easier than ever for mobile teams to work smart and get jobs done fast. Nrby, a business unit of Ping4 , is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire.
