LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading down 0.3 percent at 10,670.00. • The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the U.S. currency as rising Treasury yields lifted the dollar index to four-month highs. • Indian government bonds are likely to fall ahead of a weekly debt sale today, even as higher U.S. Treasury yields will weigh on overall demand.
