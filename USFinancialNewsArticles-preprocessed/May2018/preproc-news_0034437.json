    "text": "BARRINGTON, Ill., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CTI Industries Corporation (NASDAQ: CTIB) (\"CTI\") , a manufacturer and global marketer of novelty balloons, vacuum and flexible packaging and storage products, printed and laminated films, party goods, Candy Blossoms and home container products, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (\"Q1 2018\").\n\"Delayed ordering from two major customers resulted in lower than anticipated sales in January and February, and for Q1 2018 overall. However, March sales were at record levels and sales in April and May have continued to be strong,\" said Stephen Merrick, Chief Executive Officer of CTI. \"The lower sales in January and February caused us to report a modest operating loss in Q1 2018, although our lower cost profile helped to mitigate the impact on our results.\"\n\"We have undertaken a series of initiatives that have stabilized our operations and created a foundation for improved performance in 2018,\" Mr. Merrick continued. \"These actions are expected to strengthen profitability, enhance efficiencies, improve product quality, catalyze business development, and expand our geographic and product footprints. We are pursuing a robust new business sales pipeline and continue to explore ways to further penetrate our existing customer base. We expect to remove $2.2 million in annualized operating costs by the end of 2018, which we believe will allow us to capitalize on anticipated higher sales.\"\n2018 Outlook\nWhile acknowledging that certain challenges and uncertainties remain in its business and industry, for the full year of 2018 CTI expects to generate higher net sales, lower total operating expenses, and operate profitably when compared to 2017.\nQ1 2018 Review\nNet sales declined to $14.0 million from $15.4 million in Q1 2017, driven by lower sales of foil balloons, vacuum sealing products, and film products, partially offset by higher sales of latex balloons and other products.\nSee table below, in $000s.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nFoil Balloons\n$ 7,766\n$ 8,891\nLatex Balloons\n$ 2,149\n$ 2,105\nVacuum Sealing Products\n$ 1,589\n$ 1,708\nFilm Products\n$ 438\n$ 838\nOther Sales (1)\n$ 2,037\n$ 1,818\nTotal\n$ 13,979\n$ 15,360\n(1)\nPrimarily comprised of sales of Candy Blossoms ($577), home container products ($1,117) and party goods ($127)\nGross profit declined to $2.9 million, or 20.5% of net sales, as compared to gross profit of $3.6 million, or 23.6% of net sales, in Q1 2017. The decline was due primarily to lower sales volume.\nOperating expenses, which include general and administrative (\"G&A\"), selling, and advertising and marketing (\"A&M\") costs, as well as gains and losses on asset sales, declined to $3.0 million from $3.1 million in Q1 2017. This was primarily the result of lower G&A and A&M costs, partially offset by higher selling expenses.\nOperating loss was $147,000 compared to operating income of $508,000 in Q1 2017.\nInterest expense rose to $564,000 from $377,000 in Q1 2017.\nNet loss attributable to CTI was $463,000, or $0.13 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $58,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in Q1 2017.\nEBITDA for Q1 2018 was $325,000 as compared to EBITDA of $894,000 in Q1 2017.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss Q1 2018 results and other matters on Monday, May 14, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time / 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n866-619-8760 entering the Conference ID code 5286837.\nParticipants are advised to dial into the call five to ten minutes prior to the starting time to register. A replay of the conference call will be available from May 14â€“21, 2018 by dialing 855-859-2056. The replay passcode is 5286837.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo provide additional information regarding the Company's results, we have disclosed in this press release EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization). The Company defines EBITDA as earnings (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has included EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure in this press release because it is a key measure used by management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate the core operating performance of the Company, to prepare budgets and operating plans, and because management believes such measure provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results. However, use of EBITDA as an analytic tool has its limitations and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation to the closest GAAP statement of this non-GAAP measure is contained in the accompanying tables.\nAbout CTI\nCTI Industries Corporation is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of foil and latex balloons, develops, produces and markets vacuum sealing systems for household use and produces laminated and printed films for commercial uses. CTI also distributes products for home organization and storage, Candy Blossoms and other gift items and, in Mexico, party goods. CTI markets its products throughout the United States and in a number of other countries.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements made in this release that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking\" statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time.
