    "text": "Published: May 27, 2018 4:21 p.m. ET Share\nPresident won’t approve of Paolo Savona’s appointment Reuters Italy's Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte leaves after a meeting Sunday with President Sergio Mattarella in Rome.\nBy Giovanni Legorano\nROME — Italy’s Premier-Designate Giuseppe Conte failed to form a new government, as the antiestablishment coalition that seemed poised to come to power clashed with the Italian president over their nomination of a euroskeptic figure as minister of the economy.\nConte met with Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Sunday evening to discuss the ministerial picks for a new government supported by the maverick 5 Star Movement and the hard-right League.\nThe coalition has insisted on appointing Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and former industry minister, to become Italy’s new economy minister. Savona has espoused skepticism about the single currency project and the budget constraints it demands of members. He has also been highly critical of Germany, likening the dominant role Berlin plays in determining Europe’s economic policies to the military aggression of Nazi Germany.\nThe 5 Star Movement and the League refused to back away from their choice of Savona, creating the standoff. Italy’s president must approve a government’s ministerial picks. ",
