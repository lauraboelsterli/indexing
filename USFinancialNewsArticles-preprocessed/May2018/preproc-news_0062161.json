    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of Walt Disney Co fell a bit further on Tuesday after ABC canceled “Roseanne” over star Roseanne Barr’s racist tweet.\nFILE PHOTO: Sunlight breaks through clouds near Disney World in Kissimmee, Florida, U.S. September 8, 2017. REUTERS/Gregg Newton At the time of the announcement, U.S. stocks were broadly lower on concerns about political instability in Italy, and the benchmark S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent. Even before the ABC statement, Disney shares were down more than the rest of the market on a disappointing debut weekend for the film “Solo,” falling $2.32 to $99.87 a share, a loss of 2.27 percent.\nIn the moments following the ABC statement, the stock ticked down further to $99.50, a loss on the day of 2.63 percent. It closed the day down 2.46 percent at $99.69.\nReporting by the U.S. stock market team\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
