FILE PHOTO: A bus passes the Bank of England in London, Britain, April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nDuring the appointment - which the BoE said was likely to last six to nine months - Van Steenis will help BoE staff study new financial technology, emerging market capital flows and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n“Huw van Steenis’s vast experience of both the asset management and banking industry, together with his track record of taking the long-term view on the major structural forces driving the economy, will be invaluable,” BoE Governor Mark Carney said.\nVan Steenis has been global head of strategy at British fund management company Schroders ( SDR.L ) since late 2016, before which he spent many years as a senior financial services analyst at U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ).
