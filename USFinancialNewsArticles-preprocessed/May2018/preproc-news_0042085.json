    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 20 ( Variety.com ) - Deadpool might not consider himself a superhero, but its latest installment is off to a powerful start.\nThe Marvel Comics film from 20th Century Fox debuted in North American with $125 million in 4,349 locations. That wasn't enough to match the debut of its predecessor, 2016's \"Deadpool,\" which had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film with $132.4 million. The Ryan Reynolds-starrer bowed overseas with $176 million for a global weekend total of $301 million.\nAlthough it debuted under estimates, \"Deadpool 2's\" launch was nothing to complain about. It still secured the second-best opening for an R-rated film, as well as the third-biggest debut of the year behind Marvel blockbusters \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Black Panther.\" It also secured Fox its second-highest opening weekend in history.\nThe sequel is still boasting a strong critical consensus, with an 84 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and an A CinemaScore.\nIts opening was enough to crush \"Avengers: Infinity War's\" reign on the domestic box office. After securing the No. 1 spot for three weeks, the Disney and Marvel superhero tentpole dropped to second place. Its fourth weekend haul was still impressive, reeling in $29 million from 4,002 screens. \"Infinity War's\" domestic tally currently sits at $595.4 million.\n\"Infinity War\" was followed by Paramount Pictures' new release, \"Book Club.\" The romantic comedy -- starring Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen -- came in slightly ahead of expectations, earning $12.3 million on 2,781 screens.\nThe weekend's other newcomer, Global Road Entertainment's \"Show Dogs,\" landed in sixth place, only digging up $6 million from 3,212 locations. The family-friendly comedy garnered an A CinemaScore. Its Rotten Tomatoes critical score didn't fare quite as well, averaging a 26 percent.\nRounding out the top five is two film's sophomore frames. Warner Bros.' \"Life of the Party\" rallied in $7.5 million from 3,656 locations. Domestically, it has made $30.9 million. Universal's \"Breaking In\" secured $6.5 million on 2,537 screens. In two weeks, it's earned $28.8 million.\nIn the specialty market, Focus Features' \"Pope Francis - A Man of His Word\" opened with $480,000 on 346 screens for a per screen average of $1,389.\n\"RBG,\" the documentary on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is still holding strong. In its third weekend, it expanded to 375 locations for a three-day total of $1.28 million. That's a per screen average of $3,413. Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media co-produced the film with Storyville Films and CNN Films.\nThanks to a trio of superhero powerhouses, the domestic box office is up 6.3 percent from 2017, according to comScore. The weekend-to-date is up a staggering 62.9 percent, compared to 2017 when \"Alien: Covenant\" was the No. 1 film.\n\"A crowded powerhouse of a mid-May weekend benefited from a very diverse lineup of newcomers to appeal to almost every taste and demographic,\" Paul Dergarabedian, box office analysis at comScore, said.",
