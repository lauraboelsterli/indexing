    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Universal Hospital Services, Inc. (“UHS”), today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $142.4 million, representing an $11.7 million or 9.0 percent increase from total revenues of $130.7 million for the same period of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $39.9 million, a $5.1 million or 14.5 percent increase from adjusted EBITDA of $34.8 million for the same period of 2017.\nConference Call Dial-in Information\nUHS will hold a conference call to discuss 2018 first quarter results on Tuesday, May 15, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time (8 a.m. Central Time).\nTo participate, call (855) 539-7565 and advise the operator that you would like to join the Universal Hospital Services 2018 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. A recording of this call will be available from 12 p.m. Eastern Time on May 15, through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 14, and can be accessed by calling (855) 859-2056 and using the conference ID 2540196.\nUHS will also use a slide presentation to facilitate the conference call discussion. A copy of the presentation may be obtained via the company’s website at www.uhs.com . Select “Investors” then “Presentations.”\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by UHS as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), and excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense, management, board and other non-recurring gain, expenses, or loss, which may not be calculated consistently among other companies applying similar reporting measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent an alternative to operating income or cash flows from operating, financing or investing activities (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)) as a measure of performance and are not representative of funds available for discretionary use due to UHS' financing obligations. EBITDA is included because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and financial analysts to assess and compare companies and is an integral part of UHS’ debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA is included because UHS’ financial guidance and certain compensation plans are based upon this measure. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an important perspective on the company's ability to service its long-term obligations, the company’s ability to fund continuing growth, and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. A reconciliation of consolidated net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included below.\n(In millions) 1st Quarter LTM 2018\n2017\n2018\nNet income (loss) attributable to UHS $ 4.7 $ (2.0 ) $ 15.4 Interest expense 13.5 13.5 53.8 Provision for income taxes 0.3 0.2 (17.1 ) 19.0 20.9 78.4 EBITDA 37.5 32.6 130.5 Management, board & other 1.7 1.4 9.4 Stock expense 0.7 0.8 3.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 39.9 $ 34.8 $ 142.9 About Universal Hospital Services, Inc.\nUniversal Hospital Services, Inc. is a leading nationwide provider of health care technology management and service solutions to the health care industry.
