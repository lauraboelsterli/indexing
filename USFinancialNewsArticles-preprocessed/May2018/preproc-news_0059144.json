    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bizness Apps, a leader in small business mobile app development, announced that Think3 has acquired the Company to further invest in creating powerful, yet affordable mobile solutions for small business growth.\nMobile apps provide a powerful connection between brands and their consumers. Bizness Apps makes it possible for all small businesses to compete with large corporate brands through mobile technologies. Their app builder allows small business owners to enhance their customers' experience, increase revenue, improve productivity, and reduce costs. Through various app platforms, Bizness Apps' customers enjoy features ranging from mobile ordering to loyalty programs, review campaigns, and messaging at affordable prices.\n\"With the mobile industry growing at an exponential rate, small businesses need guidance in order to succeed in this mobile-first world,\" said the founder of Bizness Apps, Andrew Gazdecki. \"We look forward to continuing our mission of helping local businesses create engaging mobile experiences for their customers, with the help of Think3.\"\nNow as part of the Think3 portfolio, Bizness Apps and Think3 will continue to invest in customer success while ensuring customers continue to receive the highest level of customer service, product delivery, and technical support. Bizness Apps will also become a key component of the Think3 Prime program - enabling customers to utilize software across more than seventy other portfolio companies at no additional charge.\n\"Think3 was founded for exactly this purpose - to enable strong companies like Bizness Apps to continue to flourish and grow while also enabling their great founders to go start new companies.

They are committed to continuing the mission to improve customer service and product development for the millions of customers and users Bizness Apps supports on a daily basis.\nAndrew Gazdecki, a serial entrepreneur, will remain onboard at Bizness Apps to help transition the team over to ensure the long-term success of the company. The Think3 program will also give him the opportunity to launch a new venture and continue to expand on his young entrepreneurial career.\nLumos Partners acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Bizness Apps.\nAbout Bizness Apps\nBizness Apps is a two-time \"Inc. 500 Fastest Growing\" award winning company. Our app building platform allows small businesses to build mobile solutions that compete with big brands, making it possible for everyone to create an affordable mobile app for their business. Our Partner Program allows entrepreneurs and agencies to resell mobile apps under our white label solution and provide powerful mobile solutions for local businesses.
