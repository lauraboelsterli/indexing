    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 1:43 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago FACTBOX-Cricket-Reaction to retirement of AB de Villiers from international cricket Reuters Staff 4 Min Read\nMay 23 (Reuters) - South African batsman AB de Villiers announced his retirement from all three formats of international cricket on Wednesday.\nHis decision, which came as a surprise ahead of next year’s Cricket World Cup in England, has provoked worldwide reaction, particularly from India where he is known as ‘Mr 360’ for his ability to play shots all around the wicket.\nThe following is reaction to his departure:\nCEO of Cricket South Africa Chris Nenzani said in a statement:\n“AB is one of the all-time greats of South African cricket who has thrilled spectators around the world with his sheer brilliance, coupled to his ability to innovate and take modern day batting in all three formats but particularly in the white ball ones to new levels.\n“What is probably more important is the inspiration he has been to his team mates whether playing at international or domestic level and the wonderful role model he has been to all our aspiring youngsters. It goes without saying that he is going to be greatly missed wherever international cricket is played.”\nFormer South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher tweeted:\n“I remember this young guy on his first day out for the Proteas. What an inspiration, person and player, he turned out to be. Thank you for everything you have done for your country, teammates and fans.”\nFormer Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardena tweeted:\n“One of the best! Wish you all the best AB. Amazing player, but above all that great guy...”\nCricket broadcaster Harsha Bhogle tweeted:\n“Must admit to being a bit shocked by AB de Villiers’ decision to quit all international cricket. We knew it was coming but I thought he would give the World Cup another shot.”\nFormer India seam bowler RP Singh tweeted:\n“The man who showed the world that batting 360° is an easy task. All the best for your future endeavours AB de Villiers, thank you for all the unforgettable memories!”\nFormer South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald tweeted:\n“So shocked to hear AB de Villiers has decided to call time on his international career. But that’s just life and he feels it’s time to move on. Thank you great man for your amazing match-winning performances, skillful captaincy and most of all your humility.”\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted:\n“Such a shame for international cricket. But he has been an unbelievable advert to how I would have loved to have played all three formats ... GREAT GREAT player ... top three that I have ever seen.”\nFormer South Africa spin bowler Paul Harris tweeted:\n“What a great career. Best I have ever seen. Was great to be a part of it AB de Villiers. Nou gaan ons braai (now we are going to barbeque).”\nFormer India batsman Mohammad Kaif tweeted:\n“One of the all time greats of the game, many congratulations AB de Villiers on an outstanding career. The (Roger) Federer of cricket, the most loved cricketer on the planet. Wish you the best for your future endeavours.”\nAustralia women’s international Alex Blackwell tweeted:\n“True legend. Finishing on top and allowing next generation to step up. The way AB found innovative ways to dominate bowling attacks was an inspiration.”\nFormer India batsman Aakash Chopra tweeted:\n“The biggest entertainer in the last decade has bid goodbye to International cricket. Your absence will be felt, AB. Cricket will be poorer.”\nDe Villiers’ Indian Premier League side Royal Challengers Bangalore tweeted:\n“Sudden but we’re confident there was immense thought and contemplation behind the decision. You have to come back to Bengaluru in 2019.” (Compiled by Nick Said Editing by Christian Radnedge)",
