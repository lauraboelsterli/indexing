One year ago we gave Jones the sum and product of the ages of our three children, but Jones didn’t get their ages right. Smith missed the problem earlier tonight, having heard the current sum and product of our children’s ages.” Assume all children’s ages are whole numbers less than 10.\nHow old are the couple’s children?",
