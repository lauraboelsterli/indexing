    "text": "Published: May 14, 2018 5:59 a.m. ET Share\nTrade representative’s office to hold three days of hearings STR/AFP/Getty Images Chinese workers load steel pipes at a port in Lianyungang in east China's Jiangsu province on September 8, 2016.\nBy Andrew Tangel William Mauldin\nThe Trump administration is set to face criticism this week from a large cross section of corporations, including U.S. giants like General Electric Co., over how the administration’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports will affect American manufacturing.\nThe U.S. trade representative’s office will hold three days of hearings from Tuesday on the proposed tariffs. The hearings will not only feature businesses facing supply-chain disruptions because of the tariffs proposed for $50 billion of Chinese imports, but will also feature exporters—from farmers to manufacturers—which are likely to suffer from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports threatened by China.\nThe hearings are part of a busy week on trade for the Trump administration. The team of U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer is also trying to finish negotiating with Mexico and Canada over a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congressional leadership has set a deadline of May 17 to be notified of a deal that would be eligible for a vote this year, an administration goal.\nThe U.S. business community has often been skeptical of the Trump administration’s trade initiatives, particularly its threats of tariffs, which are being contemplated under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Executives from big companies, from electronics retailer Best Buy Co. to Swedish appliance maker Electrolux AB, have asked to testify at the hearings and are expected to raise complaints. ",
