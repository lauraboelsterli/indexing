    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 9:44 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Hermes urges VW investors to oppose board nominees Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Investment advisory firm Hermes EOS on Wednesday called on Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) investors to vote against the election of supervisory board members at the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: The Volkswagen logo is seen on a vehicle at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\nThe proposed re-election of board member Wolfgang Porsche and the election of Marianne Heiss would contradict a move towards more independent representation on the 20-member controlling panel and undermine corporate governance principles, Hermes, which represents large institutional investors, said in a written statement.\nHeiss has been nominated by Volkswagen (VW) to replace Annika Falkengren, a Swedish banker who has switched jobs, while Porsche, chairman of VWâ€™s majority stakeholder Porsche SE ( PSHG_p.DE ), is seeking a new term on the VW board.
