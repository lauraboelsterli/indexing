REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\nBefore the decision, sterling was up as much as 0.4 percent at $1.3618 but fell to trade 0.2 percent lower on the day at $1.3521, not far away from a four-month low of $1.3485 hit on Tuesday.\nWhile expectations of a rate hike have fallen rapidly in recent days after a run of weak data and cautious comments from policymakers, the cut in inflation and growth forecasts weighed on currency markets.\nThe 2-year gilt yield fell around 2 basis points after the decision to 0.81 percent.
