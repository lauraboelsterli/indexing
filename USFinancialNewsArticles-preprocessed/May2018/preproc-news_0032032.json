    "text": "(Adds dropped word in lead)\nBERLIN, May 14 (Reuters) - The German Defence Ministry will notify lawmakers shortly that it will proceed with plans to lease Israeli-built Heron-TP surveillance drones, a programme that was delayed last year, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen told top military officers on Monday.\nThe ministry had postponed its plan to lease five of the unarmed drones, a deal valued by security sources at around 1 billion euros, amid concerns over their future use raised by the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) in the final months of the last coalition government.\nChancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s conservatives and SPD agreed in their new coalition accord signed in February to lease the drones built by Israel Aerospace Industries, while work continues on a separate programme to develop a new European-built drone.\nVon der Leyen said the required notification would be sent to parliament soon, but gave no details.\nDefence ministry officials say lawmakers will be asked to review two separate, nearly completely negotiated contracts - one with Airbus, which will manage the drone programme, and one with the Israeli government to cover training, infrastructure and logistics for the unmanned planes.\nThe SPD, in a surprise move, had blocked the long-planned lease of the drones last summer, citing concerns about a possible future arming of the aircraft. But SPD officials later agreed to proceed with leasing the unarmed aircraft and insisting on a full debate about the ethical, constitutional and legal ramifications of arming the drones in the future.\nIn a reply to a query by Left party member Andrej Hunko, dated March 5, a ministry official said the government planned to seek options for two additional Heron-TP aircraft.\nGermany also plans to move ahead to negotiate the acquisition of three unmanned, higher-altitude MQ-4C Triton drones built by Northrop Grumman Corp after the U.S. State Department approved the sale on April 4.\nThe ministry hopes to receive a bid from Northrop for three of the drones in the third quarter, and wants to start using them by the mid-2020s, a ministry spokeswoman said.
