(Reuters) - Player preparations for the U.S. Women’s Open were thrown into disarray when the course was closed on Tuesday amid torrential downpours.\nHeavy rain associated with subtropical storm Alberta started overnight and continued into the morning, further saturating the Shoal Creek course that was already damp in places.\nWith rain forecast for much of the day, the U.S. Golf Association decided to close the course.\nIt is possible it will remain closed on Wednesday.\nTuesday and Wednesday are normally when most players have practice rounds, though some were on site on Monday.\nTherefore, many of the 156 players could start the biggest tournament in women’s golf without the benefit of even one practice round, leaving their knowledge of the course severely limited.\nPark Sung-hyun is the defending champion at Shoal Creek, which last hosted a men’s major in 1990, when Australian Wayne Grady won the PGA Championship.
