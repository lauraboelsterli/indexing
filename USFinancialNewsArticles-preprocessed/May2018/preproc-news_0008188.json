    "text": "DUBLIN, May 2 (Reuters) - Ireland’s High Court refused a request by Facebook to delay a referral of a landmark privacy case to Europe’s top court on Wednesday, ordering its immediate referral.\nFacebook sought the delay this week to allow it attempt to pursue a Supreme Court appeal and a lawyer for the company said it would still seek permission from the Supreme Court to appeal.\nThe Irish High Court this month ordered the case to be referred to the EU’s top court to assess whether the methods used for data transfers - including standard contractual clauses and the Privacy Shield agreement - were legal.
