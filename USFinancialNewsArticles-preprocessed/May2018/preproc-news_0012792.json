    "text": "LAFAYETTE, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PHI, Inc. (The Nasdaq Select Global Market: PHII (voting) PHIIK (non-voting)) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nConsolidated operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $160.4 million, compared to $134.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $25.8 million. Oil and Gas segment operating revenues increased $23.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This increase is attributable principally to revenue derived from our newly-acquired HNZ offshore business and secondarily from an increase in revenues from our legacy Oil and Gas operations. Air Medical segment operating revenues increased $1.7 million due principally to increase in revenue from our independent provider operations due to increased patient transports. Technical Services segment operating revenues increased $0.2 million due primarily to an increase in technical services provided to a third party customer.\nOil and Gas segment loss was $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $5.9 million decrease in segment loss is primarily attributable to a $23.9 million increase in revenues, partially offset by $18.0 million increase in expenses.\nAir Medical segment loss was less than $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a segment profit of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $1.6 million decrease in profit is primarily attributable to increased employee compensation costs, partially offset by the increased revenues.\nTechnical Services segment profit was $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $0.8 million decrease in revenue is due primarily to a decrease of technical services provided to a third party customer whose service requirements typically vary from period to period.\nFor additional information, please see (i) the attachments hereto and (ii) Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that we filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPHI provides helicopter transportation and related services to a broad range of customers including the oil and gas and air medical industries, and also provides third-party maintenance services to select customers.
