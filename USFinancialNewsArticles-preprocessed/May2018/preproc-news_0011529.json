The benchmark KOSPI was down 0.2 percent.\nThe FSS said it had begun an investigation into the company earlier this year after an activist group and a lawmaker questioned whether the company had breached accounting rules to inflate its net profit before listing in late 2016.\nSamsung BioLogics reported a 1.9 trillion won net profit in 2015, compared to a roughly 28 billion won net loss in 2014 and a 62.4 billion won net loss in 2013.\nShares in Samsung C&T Corp, which held a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, also fell more than 5 percent.
