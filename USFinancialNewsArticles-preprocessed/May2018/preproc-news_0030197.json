    "text": "CBS and Viacom had reached a deal in price for a merger before the ongoing disagreement over leadership of the combined company ripped the two apart, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nThe agreed upon price was a ratio of 0.6135 CBS shares for every Viacom class B share.\nCBS sued Shari Redstone's National Amusements , the controlling shareholder of both companies, on Monday to block her from to interfering at a special board meeting where the merger would be considered.\nRedstone could counter sue CBS directors for a breach of loyalty, the sources said.
