Gene is a valued member of the East Region leadership team, with an outstanding track record managing the important Florida market. I am confident he’ll do a fantastic job building on John’s success and taking the performance of the East Region to the next level.”\nMr. Wittig, prior to his role as President of Southern Glazer’s East Region, served as Executive Vice President, General Manager of Southern Wine & Spirits of Florida.

This experience included 16 years with Seagram’s in the company’s corporate management program, which required various cross-functional roles and a period in their global management program.\nBefore his current role as Executive Vice President, General Manager of Florida, Mr. Sullivan was Executive Vice President, General Manager of Southern Glazer’s Coastal Wine & Spirits sales division from June 1, 2010 until March 1, 2016.
