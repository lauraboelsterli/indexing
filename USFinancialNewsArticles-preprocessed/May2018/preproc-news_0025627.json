    "text": "NEW YORK, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) (“Prospect”, “our”, or “we”) today announced financial results for our third fiscal quarter\nAll amounts in $000’s except\nper share amounts Quarter Ended Quarter Ended Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net Investment Income (“NII”) $70,446 $73,192 $73,080 Interest as % of Total Investment Income 89.6% 94.4% 94.6% NII per Share $0.19 $0.20 $0.20 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations (“NI”) $51,859 $121,727 $19,492 NI per Share $0.14 $0.34 $0.05 Distributions to Shareholders $65,174 $64,912 $89,892 Distributions per Share $0.18 $0.18 $0.25 Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per Share $9.23 $9.28 $9.43 Net of Cash Debt to Equity Ratio 69.1% 60.2% 75.6% For the March 2018 quarter, we earned net investment income (“NII”) of $70.4 million, or $0.19 per weighted average share, down $0.01 from the December 2017 quarter, and exceeding our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.18 per share by $0.01 per share. The decrease in NII per share resulted primarily from higher administrative overhead expense compared to the December 2017 quarter.\nAs the economic cycle ages, we are not chasing yield but are instead seeking to reduce risk and protect capital. We remain committed to our historic credit discipline, which has served us well in the past. While we have a robust pipeline of potential investments in our target range for credit quality and yield, we are not chasing risky assets with low returns and so remained underinvested at March 31, 2018. We believe our disciplined approach to credit will continue to serve us well in the coming years.\nIn the March 2018 quarter our net of cash debt to equity ratio was 69.1%, up 8.9% from December 2017 and down 6.5% from March 2017.\nFor the March 2018 quarter, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations (“NI”) was $51.9 million, or $0.14 per weighted average share, a decrease of $0.20 from the December 2017 quarter as a result of increased unrealized depreciation in the fair market value of certain investments compared to the prior quarter.\nOur interest income as a percentage of total investment income was 89.6% in the March 2018 quarter.\nOur net asset value (“NAV”) per share decreased by $0.05 to $9.23 during the March 2018 quarter.\nAll amounts in $000’s except\nper share amounts Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 NII $207,370 $236,404 NII per Share $0.57 $0.66 NI $185,559 $201,738 NI per Share $0.51 $0.56 Distributions to Shareholders $211,733 $268,989 Distributions per Share $0.59 $0.75\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, we earned NII of $207.4 million, or $0.57 per weighted average share, down $0.09 from the prior year. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, we earned NI of $185.6 million, or $0.51 per weighted average share, down $0.05 from the prior year.\nDISTRIBUTION DECLARATION\nProspect is declaring distributions as follows:\n$0.06 per share for May 2018 to May 31, 2018 record holders with June 21, 2018 payment date; $0.06 per share for June 2018 to June 29, 2018 record holders with July 19, 2018 payment date; $0.06 per share for July 2018 to July 31, 2018 record holders with August 23, 2018 payment date; and $0.06 per share for August 2018 to August 31, 2018 record holders with September 20, 2018 payment date.\nThese distributions mark Prospect’s 118 th , 119 th , 120 th , and 121 st consecutive cash distributions to shareholders.\nBased on the declarations above, Prospect’s closing stock price of $6.45 at May 8, 2018 delivers to shareholders a dividend yield of 11.2%.\nBased on past distributions and our current share count for declared distributions, Prospect since inception through our August 2018 distribution will have distributed $16.68 per share to original shareholders, exceeding $2.59 billion in cumulative distributions to all shareholders.\nProspect expects to declare September 2018 and October 2018 distributions in August 2018.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nWe continue to prioritize secured lending.
