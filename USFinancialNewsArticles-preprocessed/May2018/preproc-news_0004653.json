In our Performance Solutions business, net sales grew as our end-markets are generally robust and our teams continue to execute well. In our Ag business, we saw a strong continuation of the season in Brazil and a healthy start of the season in North America and Southern Europe, offset partially by a cold spring in Eastern Europe. In both businesses, we saw margin pressure from product mix and inflation in our raw materials. We have seen the inflationary commodity environment in late 2017 continue into 2018, and our businesses continue to take actions to offset this pressure. We remain confident with respect to our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion goals for 2018.\"\nMr. Sachdev continued, “Our outlook for the remainder of the year is optimistic given healthy end-markets in our Performance Solutions segment and improving end-markets in Agricultural Solutions. We are reaffirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $870 million to $900 million in that context.”\n“Progress against our separation continues with momentum. We remain committed to this path to create two standalone businesses with terrific market positions, growth trajectories and management teams. Strategically, we believe each of these companies will be better positioned to deliver value to their customers, and we remain confident that our shareholders should benefit from value creation from the separation.”\nFirst quarter 2018 Income Statement Highlights (compared with first quarter 2017):\nNet sales on a reported basis for the first quarter of 2018 were $964 million, an increase of 12%. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency changes and certain metal prices, increased 5%.\n- MacDermid Performance Solutions (the Performance Solutions segment): net sales increased 10% to $492 million. Organic sales increased 4%.\n- Arysta LifeScience (the Agricultural Solutions segment): net sales increased 14% to $472 million. Organic sales increased 6%.

Reported net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $37 million, as compared to a net loss of $24 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $207 million, an increase of 7%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA decreased 3%.\n- MacDermid Performance Solutions: Adjusted EBITDA was $112 million, an increase of 9%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 2%.\n- Arysta LifeScience: Adjusted EBITDA was $95 million, an increase of 5%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA decreased 8%.\n- Adjusted EBITDA margin for the combined company decreased by 90 basis points to 21.5%.

NON-GAAP MEASURES\nFor purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, Platform has provided in this release the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA guidance, adjusted earnings (loss) per share, and organic sales growth. Platform also evaluates and presents its results of operations on a constant currency basis. Management internally reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to the Company’s business, and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with an additional perspective on trends and underlying operating results on a period-to-period comparable basis. Platform also believes that investors find this information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of its operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on Platform's financial results in any particular period. These non-GAAP financial measures, however, have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to, the related financial information that Platform reports in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements, and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation between companies. In addition, these measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Platform’s businesses.\nThe Company only provides adjusted EBITDA guidance and organic sales growth expectations on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for restructurings, refinancings, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses, share-based compensation amounts, non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, adjustments to inventory and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nConstant Currency:\nThe Company discloses operating results from net sales through operating profit on a constant currency basis by adjusting to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies of its international locations into U.S. dollar. Management believes this non-GAAP financial information facilitates period-to-period comparison in the analysis of trends in business performance, thereby providing valuable supplemental information regarding its results of operations, consistent with how the Company internally evaluates its financial results.\nThe impact of foreign currency translation is calculated by converting the Company's current-period local currency financial results into U.S. dollar using the prior period's exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to its prior period reported results. The difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates represents the impact of foreign currency translation.\nOrganic Sales Growth:\nOrganic sales growth is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, changes due to the price of certain metals, and acquisitions and/or divestitures, as applicable. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying net sales trends by providing comparable sales over differing periods on a consistent basis.\nThe following tables reconcile GAAP net sales growth to organic sales growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Reported Net\nSales Growth Impact of\nCurrency Constant\nCurrency Metals Acquisitions Organic Sales\nGrowth Performance Solutions 10% (7)% 3% 1% —% 4% Agricultural Solutions 14% (7)% 6% —% —% 6% Total 12 % (7 )% 5 % — % — % 5 % For the three months ended March 31, 2018, metals pricing had a negative impact of $2.6 million on Performance Solutions' and our consolidated results.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share:\nAdjusted earnings per share is defined as net loss attributable to common stockholders adjusted to reflect adjustments consistent with our definition of adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, the Company eliminates the amortization associated with (i) intangibles assets recognized in purchase accounting for acquisitions and (ii) costs capitalized in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of its products (“registration rights”) as part of ongoing operations, and deducts capital expenditures associated with obtaining these registration rights. Further, the Company adjusts its effective tax rate to 34% for the first quarter of 2018 and 35% for the first quarter of 2017, as described in footnote (11) under the reconciliation table below. The resulting adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders is then divided by Platform's outstanding number of shares of common stock plus the number of shares that would be issued if all Platform's convertible stock was converted to common stock, stock options were vested and exercised, and awarded equity grants were vested at each period presented. Adjusted earnings per share is a key metric used by management to measure operating performance and trends as it believes the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted earnings per share facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP \"Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\" to \"Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders\" and presents the adjusted number of common shares used in calculating adjusted earnings per share for each period presented below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 37.3 $ (24.4 ) Reversal of amortization expense (1 ) 71.9 68.6 Adjustment for investment in registration of products (1 ) (13.2 ) (12.9 ) Restructuring expense (2 ) 3.0 2.3 Acquisition and integration costs (3 ) 1.0 3.6 Non-cash change in fair value of contingent consideration (4 ) 0.5 1.1 Foreign exchange (gain) loss on foreign denominated external and internal long-term debt (5 ) (55.8 ) 11.8 Nonrecourse factoring costs (6 ) 1.1 0.7 Debt refinancing costs (7 ) — 1.1 Costs related to Proposed Separation (8 ) 3.1 0.2 Gain on sale of equity investment (9 ) (11.3 ) — Other, net (10 ) (7.3 ) 1.9 Tax effect of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments (11 ) 2.4 (27.4 ) Adjustment to estimated effective tax rate (11 ) 30.0 20.4 Adjustment to reverse income attributable to certain non-controlling interests (12 ) 1.2 1.9 Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders $ 63.9 $ 48.9 Adjusted earnings per share (13 ) $ 0.21 $ 0.16 Adjusted common shares outstanding (13 ) 302.0 300.3\n(1) The Company eliminates amortization associated with (i) intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting for acquisitions and (ii) costs capitalized in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of its products (\"registration rights\") as part of ongoing operations, and deducts capital expenditures associated with obtaining these registration rights. The Company believes this adjustment provides insight with respect to the cash flows necessary to maintain and enhance the Company's product portfolio.\n(2) Adjusted for cost of restructuring the Company's operations, including those related to its acquired businesses in both the Agricultural Solutions and Performance Solutions segments. The Company adjusts these costs because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(3) The Company adjusts for costs associated with acquisition and integration activity, including costs of obtaining related financing such as investment banking, legal and accounting fees, and transfer taxes. The Company adjusts these costs because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(4) The Company adjusts for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of MacDermid, Incorporated (the \"MacDermid Acquisition\"). The Company adjusts this cost because it is not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(5) The Company adjusts for foreign exchanges gains and losses on long-term intercompany and third-party debt because the period-to-period movement of these currencies are expected to offset on a long-term basis and, due to their long-term nature, are not fully realized. The Company does not exclude foreign exchange gains and losses on short-term intercompany and third-party payables and receivables.\n(6) The Company adjusts for costs associated with its non-recourse receivables factoring programs because they are considered to be part of the Company's capital structure, comparable to interest expense. These charges are included in STG&A.\n(7) The Company adjusts for costs related to its term debt refinancing in 2017 because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(8) The Company adjusts for costs related to the proposed separation of its businesses (the \"Proposed Separation\"), which is expected to be completed in 2018. The Company adjusts these costs because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(9) The Company adjusts for gain on the sale of equity investment in 2018 because it is not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(10) 2018 adjustments include a $4.8 million favorable adjustment to the Company's ARO reserve for a facility which is in the process of closing in connection with a previously terminated supply agreement related to the acquisition of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business of Chemtura Corporation and a $3.7 million insurance gain. 2017 adjustments include non-recurring senior executive severance payments. The Company adjusts these costs because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(11) The Company adjusts its effective tax rate to 34% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This adjustment does not reflect the Company’s current or near-term tax structure, including limitations on its ability to utilize net operating losses and foreign tax credits in certain jurisdictions. These factors significantly increase the Company's effective tax rate from 34%. As a result of current tax structure, the Company’s effective tax rate in accordance with GAAP was 63.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company also applies an effective tax rate of 34% to pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, before the enactment of the Tax Reform in December 2017, the Company adjusted its effective tax rate to 35%. The Company adjusts the effective tax rates because it believes it provides a meaningful comparison of its performance between periods.\n(12) The Company adjusts for the loss or income attributable to non-controlling interest created at the time of the MacDermid Acquisition because holders of such equity interest are expected to convert their holdings into shares of Platform's common stock. The Company adjusts these costs because they are not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\n(13) The Company defines \"Adjusted common shares\" as the outstanding shares of Platform's common stock at March 31, 2018 and 2017 plus the number of shares that would be issued if all convertible stock were converted into Platform's common stock, stock options were vested and exercised, and awarded equity grants were vested at March 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company adjusts the outstanding shares of Platform's common stock for this calculation to provide an understanding of the Company’s results of operations on a per share basis.\nNON-GAAP ADJUSTED COMMON SHARES AT MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Unaudited)\nThe following table shows Platform's adjusted common shares outstanding at each period presented which consists of Platform's outstanding number of shares of common stock plus the number of shares that would be issued if all Platform's convertible stock was converted to common stock, stock options were vested and exercised, and awarded equity grants were vested at each period presented:\n2018 2017 (in millions) Q1 Q1 Basic outstanding common shares 288.1 285.7 Number of shares issuable upon conversion of PDH Common Stock 4.2 6.4 Number of shares issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock 2.0 2.0 Number of shares issuable upon vesting and exercise of Stock Options 0.7 0.7 Number of shares issuable upon vesting of granted Equity Awards 7.0 5.5 Adjusted common shares outstanding 302.0 300.3 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, excluding the impact of additional items, which the Company believes are not representative or indicative of its ongoing business or are considered to be part of its capital structure, as described in the footnotes located under the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation table above. Adjusted EBITDA for each segment also includes an allocation of corporate costs, such as compensation expense and professional fees, as indicated in this press release under \"I. Unaudited Segment Results.\" Management believes adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide investors with a more complete understanding of the long-term profitability trends of Platform’s business, and facilitate comparisons of its profitability to prior and future periods. However, these measures, which do not consider certain cash requirements, should not be construed as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP \"Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\" to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 37.3 $ (24.4 ) Add (subtract): Net income attributable to the non-controlling interests 0.7 0.8 Income tax expense 65.0 18.7 Interest expense, net 78.2 89.4 Depreciation expense 19.8 17.3 Amortization expense 71.9 68.6 EBITDA 272.9 170.4 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDA: Restructuring expense (2 ) 3.0 2.3 Acquisition and integration costs (3 ) 1.0 3.6 Non-cash change in fair value of contingent consideration (4 ) 0.5 1.1 Foreign exchange (gain) loss on foreign denominated external and internal long-term debt (5 ) (55.8 ) 11.8 Nonrecourse factoring costs (6 ) 1.1 0.7 Debt refinancing costs (7 ) — 1.1 Costs related to Proposed Separation (8 ) 3.1 0.2 Gain on sale of equity investment (9 ) (11.3 ) — Other, net (10 ) (7.3 ) 1.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 207.2 $ 193.1 NOTE: For the footnote descriptions, please refer to the footnotes located under the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation table above.\nCONTACT:\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nCarey Dorman\nSenior Director - Corporate Development\nPlatform Specialty Products Corporation\n1-561-406-8465\nSource:Platform Specialty Products Corporation",
