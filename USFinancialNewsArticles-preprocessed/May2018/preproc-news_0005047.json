    "text": "Facebook's new virtual reality headset, Oculus Go, will ship on Tuesday for $199 â€” a more affordable alternative to the company's high-end devices.\nMark Zuckerberg announced the launch when he delivered the keynote address at Facebook 's annual F8 developer conference Tuesday. He said it has 1,000 apps and has the highest quality lenses that Oculus has built into any device.\n\"It's the easiest way to get into VR and we think this is going to be how a lot of people experience virtual reality and virtual presence for the first time,\" Zuckerberg said.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg: We need to design technology to help bring people together 1 Hour Ago | 01:35 The product represents a major step forward for Oculus, after the departure of co-founder Palmer Luckey over a year ago . Last year, Zuckerberg asked investors for more \"patience\" around Oculus, saying the company was \"a little behind\" and timing was a \"disappointment.\" Facebook also endured a high-profile legal battle over Oculus intellectual property last year.\nEveryone at the conference was awarded a free Oculus Go device.\nThe social media giant in March delayed the launch of a long-reported smart speaker, according to news reports.",
