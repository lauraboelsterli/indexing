    "text": "ESCONDIDO, Calif., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OSS (NASDAQ:OSS), a leading provider of high performance computing systems, reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and reiterates its guidance for 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue increased 12% to $7.1 million, a record for a first quarter. $1.9 million of product shipped to ongoing video display server customer. $1.5 million of product shipped under a multi-year military flash array program. Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS was $(0.04). Raised $19.5 million from the company’s IPO and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOperational Highlights\nIntroduced new flash storage array based on Ion Accelerator 5.0 release. This new product line provides flexible storage capacity while maintaining the high-bandwidth and low-latency pedigree of Ion Accelerator arrays deployed in hundreds of global installations. Introduced GPUltima-CI composable infrastructure systems, which facilitate rapid reconfiguration of GPU compute and storage resources in mixed workload datacenters. Shipped first-production units of new GPU compute accelerator with eight NVIDIA SXM-2 Volta GPUs. This product represents the first SXM-2-based GPU expansion system on the market today. Won new OEM design-in for medical imaging system and shipped first custom servers. Received proof-of-concept order for compute accelerator to be used in a military surveillance aircraft.\nQ1 2018 Financial Summary\nRevenue increased 12.4% to $7.1 million from $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth of $459,000 or 7.3 percentage points of the 12.4% increase. The acquisition of the Ion business in July 2017 added $204,000 or 3.2 percentage points of the increase. SkyScale, launched in April 2017, contributed $121,000 or 1.9 percentage points of the increase.\nGross margin decreased to 31.1% of revenue, as compared to 32.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributed to an increase in inventory reserves. Exclusive of the inventory reserve adjustment, gross margin was approximately 35.0% in the first quarter of 2018.\nOperating expenses increased to $2.9 million or 41% of revenue as compared to $1.9 million or 30% of revenue in first quarter of 2017. G&A expense increased primarily due to increased third-party service costs associated with being a public company. SkyScale contributed $158,000 of the overall increase in G&A, of which $90,000 was attributed to a reserve for bad debt. Marketing and selling expense primarily increased due to increases in third-party commissions and employee related costs. R&D increased primarily due to inclusion of the Ion software development team costs of $300,000.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis was $794,000 or $(0.08) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis of $79,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $443,000 or $(0.04) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $248,000 or $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 (see definition of non-GAAP EPS and reconciliation to GAAP, below).\nAdjusted EBITDA was a negative $237,000, as compared to positive $383,000 in same period in the previous year (see definition of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, and reconciliation to GAAP, below).\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $9.1 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $186,000 at December 31, 2017. The increase is due to the proceeds from the company’s IPO on February 1. All outstanding notes, the balance of the company’s bank line of credit, and a significant portion of accounts payable were paid off from the proceeds, resulting in the company operating debt-free.\nManagement Commentary\n“We achieved a record quarter for Q1, which is historically our slowest quarter of the year,” said Steve Cooper, OSS president and CEO. “We’re excited about our new product introductions during the quarter, as well as a significant design win for a medical imaging application. We're also excited with the opportunity to deploy our GPU computing solutions into military aircraft.\n“In Q1, we shipped additional ground station and airborne versions of our military flash arrays. This moves us one step closer to full product deployment, with production ramp up beginning in Q3. These developments set the stage for strong revenue growth this year and for years to come.”\n2018 Outlook\nThe company reiterates its outlook for the full year 2018: Revenue, exclusive of any future M&A activity, is expected to range between $36 million and $38 million in 2018, representing an increase of 31% to 38% as compared to 2017.\nRevenue growth is not expected to be linear in 2018 due to the timing of shipments related to the company’s military flash array program and other customer demand variances. The company estimates second quarter 2018 revenue between $6.7 million and $6.9 million. Revenue in the third and fourth quarter is expected to increase significantly as the military flash array program enters higher level production. The expected ramp up of military flash array sales is also anticipated to increase gross margins in the third and fourth quarter. Quarterly revenue may fluctuate plus or minus 15% from the company’s plan in any given quarter due to variations in delivery.\nConference Call\nOSS management will hold a conference call to discuss these results later today, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-866-548-4713\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-794-2093\nConference ID: 1149348\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here as well as via a link in the investors section of the company’s website at ir.onestopsystems.com .

Non-GAAP EPS is defined as net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders with an adjustment for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and non-cash tax provision divided by the number of weighted average shares outstanding on a basic and diluted basis.\nOSS management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA is also helpful to assessing the company’s financial performance. The company defines adjusted EBITDA as income before depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred gain and debt discount, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, and the provision for income taxes.\nNon-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash operating expenses, management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the company’s core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating the company’s own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nThe company’s non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, or unusual items. The company’s non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. The company does not consider non-GAAP EPS or adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to non-GAAP EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Month Periods\nended March 31, 2018 2017 Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (794,419 ) $ 79,147 Amortization of intangibles 98,660 99,208 Stock-based compensation expense 35,318 24,626 Non-cash tax provision * 217,124 44,632 Non GAAP (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (443,317 ) $ 247,613 Non-GAAP (loss) income attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ (0.04 ) $ 0.05 Diluted $ (0.04 ) $ 0.03 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 10,140,459 5,379,141 Diluted 10,140,459 9,757,229 * The company is projecting a tax benefit for the year and therefore is adding back the non-cash tax provision as calculated under GAAP accounting.
