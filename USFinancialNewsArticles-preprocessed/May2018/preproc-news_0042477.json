    "text": "3 COMMENTS Global corporate deal making is on fire. The danger is that a lot of value ends up getting burned.\nThis year so far has seen an explosion of bidding activity and U.S. companies pursuing record volumes of deals at home and even more so overseas. Purchase multiples are elevated too, which suggests company chiefs are taking more risks, emboldened by their firms’ high valuations and earnings prospects.\nMany may be rushing into action before rising interest rates make financing more costly or knock confidence among equity investors. There are also growing risks from hard-to-predict political interference and battles over global trade rules .\nGlobally, mergers and acquisitions announced so far this year total $1.96 trillion, according to Dealogic, more than 60% ahead of the same point in 2017 and just behind the year-to-date record set in 2007.\nU.S. buyers are leading the way with a record $840 billion of deals even before more deals announced Monday, including General Electric ’s GE 1.67% $11 billion rail merger with Wabtec . WAB 0.21% The biggest jump though has come in U.S. cross-border deals.\nOverseas, U.S. bidders have struck almost $180 billion worth of deals so far this year, which is more than $90 billion ahead of the same period last year and $70 billion ahead of the previous year-to-date peak in 2007.\nThese deals could yet be called off, but those that go ahead will do so in the face of rising protectionism in trade and potential tariff wars, which could blow up companies’ plans for international growth or cost savings. They could also disrupt the multicountry supply chains that many companies have built in the past two decades.\nFor U.S. companies, a White House that is unpredictable both in domestic competition policy and in international disputes won’t help. Deals might not be assessed on their own merits alone but become bargaining chips in wider negotiations, particularly with China.\nThis could help in some cases—like Qualcomm ’s QCOM -0.54% deal for NXP, which appears more likely to get approval in China if the U.S. eases sanctions on China’s ZTE, a telecommunications equipment firm. But it will more likely hurt if Congress pushes through a bill that will make it easier to block Chinese deals in the U.S.\nDespite these numbers, bankers and investors say the boom isn’t yet frenzied. This year’s volumes may have been swelled by U.S. activity held back from the final quarter of last year when executives waited to see how they would be affected by the White House’s plans for corporate tax rates.\nA Qualcomm baseband modem integrated circuit chip as seen on an iPhone 6. Photo: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg News Multiples are elevated, though: U.S. bidders have been valuing targets at about 15-times trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization on average for the past few years, according to Thomson Reuters , although that has dropped to just under 13-time so far this year. The highest average multiple hit before the financial crisis was 14.5-times in 2005.\nIt won’t take much to push this deal making wave from one that seems a bit heated to one that looks very risky indeed.\nWrite to Paul J.
