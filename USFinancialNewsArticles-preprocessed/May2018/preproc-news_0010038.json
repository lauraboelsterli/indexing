On a comparable basis 1 (adjusted for the sale of Fannie May Confection Brands, which closed on May 30, 2017) total revenues increased 10.2 percent. EPS loss for the quarter was $0.13, compared with an EPS loss of $0.17 in the prior year period. On a comparable basis 1 , EPS loss in the prior year period was $0.15. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was a loss of $3.6 million, compared with a loss of $5.1 million in the prior year period.\n( 1 Refer to “Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the tables attached at the end of this press release for reconciliation of Non-GAAP (“Adjusted” and “Comparable”) results to applicable GAAP results.)\nCARLE PLACE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLWS), a leading gourmet food and floral gift provider for all occasions, today reported results for its Fiscal 2018 third quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nChris McCann, CEO of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., said, “During the fiscal third quarter, we achieved top and bottom-line growth across all three of our business segments. This was driven by strong revenue growth for the 1-800-Flowers.com brand, where we further extended our market leading position with revenue growth of nearly nine percent for the quarter and more than ten percent during the key Valentine holiday. In addition, we saw a continuation of accelerated ecommerce growth in Harry & David, which grew at a double-digit pace during the quarter.”\nMcCann noted that the Company’s BloomNet business returned to top and bottom-line growth during the third quarter, driven by increased sales of wholesale products and digital and web marketing services for local florists. “BloomNet is also seeing increasing order volumes from the 1-800-Flowers brand as well as from shop-to-shop orders. As a result, the business is well positioned to build upon these results and enhance its market position during the current fourth quarter and going forward,” he said.\nThird Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the third quarter of 2018, total revenues increased 2.1 percent to $238.5 million compared with $233.7 million in the prior year period. On a comparable basis 1 (adjusted for the sale of Fannie May Confection Brands, which closed on May 30, 2017) total revenues increased 10.2 percent. Comparable revenue growth was driven primarily by strong revenue growth of 8.9 percent in the Company’s Consumer Floral segment, combined with growth of 15.5 percent (adjusted for the sale of Fannie May) in the Company’s Gourmet Foods and Gift Baskets segment. Comparable revenue growth benefited from the shift of the Easter holiday into the period.\nGross profit margin for the quarter was 39.2 percent, compared with 40.0 percent in the prior year period. Comparable gross profit margin for the prior year was 39.9 percent. The lower reported and comparable gross profit margin in the period reflects several factors, including the growth of the Company’s Passport free-shipping program, an increase in the promotional nature of the Valentine holiday this year and continued higher transportation costs. Operating expenses as a percent of total revenues improved 260 basis points to 44.4 percent, compared with reported operating expenses as a percent of total revenues of 47.0 percent in the prior year period. Comparable operating expenses as a percent of total revenues was 46.4 percent in the prior year period.\nThe combination of these factors resulted in an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.6 million compared with an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.1 million in the prior year period. Net loss was $8.5 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with a net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.17 per share, in the prior year period. On a comparable basis, net loss was $10.0 million, or $0.15 per share, in the prior year period.\nSegment Results:\nThe Company provides fiscal 2018 third quarter selected financial results for its Gourmet Foods and Gift Baskets, Consumer Floral and BloomNet segments in the tables attached to this release and as follows:\nGourmet Foods and Gift Baskets: Revenues for the quarter were $78.5 million, compared with reported revenues of $85.6 million in the prior year period. On a comparable basis (adjusted for the sale of Fannie May), revenues for the quarter increased 15.5 percent compared with $67.9 million in the prior year period. Revenue growth for the quarter primarily reflects the shift of the Easter holiday into the quarter as well as strong growth in everyday gifting, particularly in the Harry & David, Cheryl’s and 1800Baskets.com brands. Gross profit margin was 33.8 percent, compared with 34.8 percent in the prior year period. On a comparable basis, gross profit margin increased 50 basis points compared with gross profit margin of 33.3 percent in the prior year period. Segment contribution margin loss was $8.8 million, compared with a reported segment contribution margin loss of $10.8 million in the prior year period. On a comparable basis, segment contribution margin loss in the prior year period was $10.1 million. Consumer Floral: Fiscal third quarter revenues in this segment increased 8.9 percent to $135.8 million, compared with $124.7 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 39.6 percent, compared with 40.6 percent in the prior year period. The lower gross profit margin in the quarter reflects the increased promotional nature of the Valentine holiday period this year as well as the Company’s decision to invest to accelerate revenue growth and extend its market leading position. Segment contribution margin increased 2.3 percent to $16.2 million, compared with $15.9 million in the prior year period. BloomNet Wire Service: Revenues for the quarter increased 1.7 percent to $24.5 million, compared with $24.1 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 52.8 percent, compared with 53.6 percent in the prior year period, primarily reflecting product mix. Segment contribution margin increased 2.4 percent to $8.4 million, compared with $8.2 million in the prior year period.\nCompany Guidance:\nThe Company expects to achieve solid performance in its fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the key Mother’s Day holiday period. Reflecting the results of the first nine months of the fiscal year and the impact of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” legislation, the Company is updating its guidance for fiscal 2018 as follows:\nConsolidated comparable revenue at the high end of its previously stated range of $1.13 billion - to - $1.15 billion; EPS of approximately $0.60 per diluted share; Comparable Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $80 million; Free Cash Flow for the year in a range of $30.0 million - to - $40.0 million.\nDefinitions of non-GAAP Financial Measures :\nWe sometimes use financial measures derived from consolidated financial information, but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain of these are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this document are either labeled as “non-GAAP” or designated as such with a “1”. See below for definitions and the reasons why we use these non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, see the Selected Financial Information below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted/ Comparable Revenue\nAdjusted/ Comparable revenues measure GAAP revenues adjusted for the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and other items affecting period to period comparability. See Selected Financial Information for details on how comparable revenues were calculated for each period presented. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying revenue trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of activities which are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. Management recognizes that the term \"comparable revenues\" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may influence comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the Company and its segments, and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.\nEBITDA and Adjusted/ Comparable EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted/ Comparable EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of stock based compensation, Non-Qualified Plan Investment appreciation/depreciation, and for certain items affecting period to period comparability. See Selected Financial Information for details on how EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were calculated for each period presented. The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted/ Comparable EBITDA because it considers such information meaningful supplemental measures of its performance and believes such information is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly situated companies. The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as factors used to determine the total amount of incentive compensation available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees. The Company's credit agreement uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used by the Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (a) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; (b) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debts; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with GAAP results when evaluating the Company's performance.\nSegment Contribution Margin and Adjusted/ Comparable Segment Contribution Margin\nWe define Segment Contribution Margin as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, before the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Adjusted/ Comparable Segment Contribution Margin is defined as Segment Contribution Margin adjusted for certain items affecting period to period comparability. See Selected Financial Information for details on how Segment Contribution Margin and Adjusted Segment Contribution margin were calculated for each period presented. When viewed together with our GAAP results, we believe Segment Contribution Margin and Adjusted Segment Contribution Margin provide management and users of the financial statements information about the performance of our business segments. Segment Contribution Margin and Adjusted Segment Contribution Margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of the Segment Contribution Margin and Adjusted Segment Contribution Margin is that it is an incomplete measure of profitability as it does not include all operating expenses or non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as Operating Income and Net Income.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted/ Comparable Income Per Common Share:\nWe define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Comparable Net Income Per Common Share as Net Income and Net Income Per Common Share adjusted for certain items affecting period to period comparability. See Selected Financial Information below for details on how Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Common Share were calculated for each period presented. We believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period to period results. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, GAAP Net Income and Net Income Per Common share, as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company considers Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of fixed assets, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the Company’s business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock or retire debt. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure that is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of similarly isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.\nAbout 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.\n1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. is a leading provider of gifts for all celebratory occasions.

In order to leverage the Company’s infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. The costs of these functions, other than those of the Customer Service Center, which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment.\n(b) The adjustment to deduct the impact of the U.S. tax reform from net income, for the nine months ended April 1, 2018, includes the impact of the re-valuation of the Company's deferred tax liability of $12.2mm or $0.18 per diluted share, but does not include the ongoing impact of the lower federal corporate tax rate. (c) Segment performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments, both of which are non-GAAP measurements. As such, management’s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead, described above, depreciation and amortization, other income (net), and other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance.
