(NASDAQ: CRME / TSX: COM), formerly Cardiome Pharma Corp., a revenue-generating, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing hospital drugs, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and commented on recent accomplishments and plans.\n\"2018 is off to a strong start with robust first quarter revenues that are up 26% compared to last year and completion of the strategic transaction with Cipher Pharmaceuticals for Correvio's Canadian business portfolio,\" commented William Hunter, MD, CEO and President of Correvio. \"As a reminder, this transaction enables us to reduce our cash burn while focusing our internal resources on our rapidly growing European business and rest of world commercial initiatives. It also provided important non-dilutive capital and financial flexibility for possible future business development transactions. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we believe all of the first quarter achievements leave us well positioned for long-term growth.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights\nCorporate\nCorrevio and Cipher Pharmaceuticals complete the transfer of Correvio's Canadian business portfolio to Cipher, including four commercial and pipeline hospital products administered in the acute care setting: Brinavess ® (vernakalant IV), Aggrastat ® (tirofiban hydrochloride), Xydalba ™ (dalbavancin hydrochloride), and Trevyent ® . Correvio received an upfront payment of $24.5 million (CAD) and will receive $1 million (CAD) in equal quarterly installments over the next four quarters. Going forward, all of the non-Canadian portfolio assets will be held under the newly-created Correvio Pharma Corp parent company.\nZevtera/Mabelio and Xydalba\nFifteen abstracts were presented at the 28 th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ECCMID) highlighting clinical and preclinical data for Correvio's commercial anti-infective assets, Xydalba ™ (dalbavancin hydrochloride) and Zevtera/Mabelio (ceftobiprole). For Xydalba, the presentations highlight areas of unmet need and preliminary data in treatment areas of interest beyond acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), the indication Xydalba is currently marketed for. Key Zevtera/Mabelio (ceftobiprole) presentations feature important preclinical research conducted in new treatment areas of interest, including in resistant bloodstream infections.\nCorrevio initiated the commercial launch of Zevtera in Spain in early May. In addition to Spain, Correvio currently markets Zevtera (known in certain countries as Mabelio) in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Switzerland. Correvio retains an exclusive license to commercialize Zevtera/Mabelio in Europe and Israel and plans to commercialize Zevtera where it can achieve market access.\nBrinavess\nCorrevio completed enrollment in the Phase 4 SPECTRUM study evaluating Brinavess ® in the post-authorization setting in the European Union (EU). In this prospective and retrospective, observational registry, 2,000 patients were enrolled and assessed to characterize normal conditions of use, dosing and safety following administration of Brinavess. The full clinical study report will be available during third quarter of 2018 and Correvio plans to publish these data.\nAggrastat\nCorrevio received approval from the Chinese Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) for an expansion of the Aggrastat (tirofiban hydrochloride) indications to now include, in addition to acute coronary syndromes without ST elevation (NSTEACS), patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who are intended for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The addition of high-risk STEMI patients significantly expands the number of patients in which Aggrastat can be used. In addition to the expanded indications, the CDE also approved an Aggrastat high dose bolus (HDB) regimen to be used on both indicated patient populations.\nTrevyent\nCorrevio's partner SteadyMed Therapeutics (NASDAQ: STDY) and United Therapeutics announced in April their entry into a definitive merger agreement under which United Therapeutics will acquire SteadyMed upon the achievement of a milestone related to the commercialization of Trevyent ® . The transaction is valued at $216 million, including the $75 million in contingent consideration, and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018.\nCorrevio highlighted progress by SteadyMed toward the resubmission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for Trevyent ® for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. SteadyMed announced that it plans to resubmit the Trevyent NDA and, subject to review by the Agency, have it accepted for filing by the end of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAmounts, unless specified otherwise, are expressed in U.S. dollars and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nCorrevio recorded a net loss of $8.5 million (basic loss per share of $0.24) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $6.3 million (basic loss per share of $0.20) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net loss was due primarily to an increase in selling, general and administration (\"SG&A\") expense and an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in revenue.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.5 million, compared to revenue of $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The 26% increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the commercial rollout of Xydalba TM and sales of Zevtera ® /Mabelio ® , which Correvio acquired from Basilea in the third quarter of 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, revenue from Correvio's cardiology products was $5.2 million and revenue from Correvio's antibiotic products was $1.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenue from Correvio's cardiology products accounted for all $5.2 million of its total revenue.\nCost of goods sold (\"COGS\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2.3 million, compared to COGS of $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nSG&A expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $10.9 million, compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to expansion of Correvio's direct sales force in Europe related to the launch of its antibiotic products. Additionally, Correvio incurred business development and transaction costs in connection with the arrangement agreement with Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nInterest expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was due to interest being accrued on a higher long-term debt principal amount during the three months\nLiquidity and Outstanding Share Capital\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $13.6 million. As of May 14, 2018, there were 34,871,471 common shares issued and outstanding, and 3,589,057 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (of which 1,820,474 were exercisable) at a weighted average exercise price of CAD $5.00 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, on May 15, 2018, Correvio received approximately $24.5 million CAD from Cipher upon completion of the transfer of the Company's Canadian business portfolio to Cipher.\nConference Call\nCorrevio will hold a teleconference and webcast on May 15, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern (1:30 p.m. Pacific).
