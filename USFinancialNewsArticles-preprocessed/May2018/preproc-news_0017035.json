    "text": "WORTHINGTON, Ohio, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Central Federal Corporation (NASDAQ: CFBK) (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the first quarter and the year ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nIncome before income tax expense was $978,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and increased $366,000, or 59.8%, compared to $612,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $792,000 and increased $388,000, or 96.0%, compared to net income of $404,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net interest income totaled $3.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and increased $845,000, or 27.6%, compared to $3.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Consistent with our focus on growing noninterest income, we invested in hiring an experienced mortgage team during the first quarter to expand our mortgage business.\nOverview of Results\nThe Company's income before income tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $978,000 and increased $366,000, or 59.8%, compared to $612,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in income before income tax expense was due to a $845,000 increase in net interest income, a $315,000 increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $794,000 increase in noninterest expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" was enacted into law reducing the federal corporate tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which impacted the comparability of net income (after tax) between periods. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $792,000 and increased $388,000, or 96.0%, compared to net income of $404,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income was due to a $845,000 increase in net interest income, a $315,000 increase in noninterest income and a $22,000 decrease in tax expense, partially offset by a $794,000 increase in noninterest expense.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018, totaled $766,000, or $0.03 per diluted common share, and increased $576,000, or 303%, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $190,000, or $0.01 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the accretion of discount from the Company's Series B Preferred Stock reduced net income by $26,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, preferred dividends on the Company's Series B Preferred Stock and accretion of discount reduced net income attributable to common stockholders by $214,000. The decrease in the preferred dividends on the Series B preferred stock and accretion of discount is due to the conversion of the Company's Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock of the Company, effective October 6, 2017, resulting in the elimination of the preferred dividend payments beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $187,500 quarterly.\nTimothy T. O'Dell, President and CEO, commented, \"We remain pleased with our earnings growth and trajectory as income before income tax expense for the quarter grew by approximately 60% compared to first quarter of 2017. In addition, noninterest income, an important area of focus for us, is reflecting significant growth (increasing by 189%) compared to the first quarter of the prior year. We hired a talented and experienced mortgage team during the first quarter to expand our mortgage lending business. This investment in and expansion of our mortgage lending business is a primary driver of the increase in noninterest income along with improved levels of deposit transactional related fees, mostly with business customers. More recently, we also received designation as an SBA preferred lender, which we hope to translate into increased volumes of saleable SBA guaranteed loans. Our CF Leadership Team remains focused on continuously improving sales and business execution, which we believe is an important key to increasing shareholder and franchise value.\"\nNet interest income. Net interest income totaled $3.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and increased $845,000, or 27.6%, compared to $3.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $1.2 million, or 32.3%, increase in interest income, partially offset by a $402,000, or 50.8%, increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributed to a $68.3 million, or 17.5%, increase in average interest-earning assets outstanding and a 50bp increase in average yield on interest-earning assets. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributed to a $50.4 million, or 16.5%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities and a 31bps increase in the average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities. As a result, net interest margin of 3.41% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 27bps compared to the net interest margin of 3.14% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nRobert E. Hoeweler, Chairman of the Board, added \"We are extremely pleased by our consistent and solid earnings growth and overall Bank performance. We remain well positioned to take advantage of both organic and geographic growth and expansion opportunities.\"\nProvision for loan and lease losses. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $0 and $0 for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, which is due to continued improvement in credit quality, favorable trends in certain qualitative factors and net recoveries. Net recoveries for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $6,000, compared to net recoveries of $17,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income. Noninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $481,000 and increased $315,000, or 189.8%, compared to $166,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $285,000 increase in net gain on sale of loans and a $29,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in net gain on sale of loans was a result of increased sales volume due to the expansion of the mortgage business. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was related to increased account relationships and pricing.\nNoninterest expense. Noninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $3.4 million and increased $794,000, or 30.3%, compared to $2.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $483,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and a $250,000 increase in advertising and marketing expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to the hiring of mortgage personnel during the first quarter in connection with the expansion of our mortgage business, consistent with our focus on driving noninterest income. The increase in salaries and employee benefits also resulted from an increase in personnel associated with the opening of our Glendale branch, the addition of experienced treasury management personnel, and an increase in credit and finance personnel to support our growth, infrastructure and risk management practices. The increase in advertising and marketing expense is primarily due to increased expenditures in this area related to the expansion of our mortgage business, coupled with increased advertising focusing on increasing core deposits.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense was $186,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $22,000 compared to $208,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is due to the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" that was enacted into law reducing the federal corporate tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased to approximately 19.1%, as compared to approximately 34.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet Activity\nGeneral. Assets totaled $529.9 million at March 31, 2018 and increased $48.5 million, or 10.1%, from $481.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $24.9 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $16.1 million increase in net loan balances and a $7.7 million increase in loans held for sale.\nCash and cash equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.4 million at March 31, 2018, and increased $24.9 million, or 54.7%, from $45.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributed to management's use of short-term CDARS deposits in anticipation of quarter end fluctuations associated with its mortgage business, along with ongoing efforts to grow core deposits to fund loan growth.\nSecurities. Securities available for sale totaled $11.2 million at March 31, 2018, and decreased $588,000, or 5.0%, compared to $11.8 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to scheduled maturities and repayments.\nLoans and Leases. Net loans and leases totaled $422.5 million at March 31, 2018, and increased $16.1 million, or 4.0%, from $406.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $6.4 million increase in total consumer loan balances, a $5.7 million increase in commercial real estate loan balances, a $4.4 million increase in multi-family residential loan balances, a $3.8 million increase in single-family residential loan balances, partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in construction loan balances and a $1.2 million decrease in commercial loan balances. The increases in the aforementioned loan balances were primarily due to increased sales activity and new relationships, coupled with the purchase of a pool of primarily residential mortgage loans.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $7.0 million at March 31, 2018, and increased $6,000, or 0.1%, from $7.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in the ALLL is due to net recoveries during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The ratio of the ALLL to total loans was 1.62% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.69% at December 31, 2017. In addition, the ratio of the ALLL to nonperforming loans improved to 1744.0% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1483.0% at December 31, 2017.\nDeposits . Deposits totaled $461.0 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $42.0 million, or 10.0%, from $419.0 million at December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily attributed to a $37.5 million increase in certificate of deposit account balances, a $7.0 million increase in checking account balances, and a $160,000 increase in savings account balances, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in money market account balances. The increase was primarily attributed to management's use of short-term CDARS deposits in anticipation of quarter end fluctuations associated with its mortgage business, along with ongoing efforts to grow core deposits to fund loan growth.\nStockholders' equity . Stockholders' equity totaled $41.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $841,000, or 2.1%, from $40.3 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in total stockholders' equity was primarily attributed to net income, which was partially offset by the accretion of discount from the Company's Series B Preferred Stock.\nAbout Central Federal Corporation and CFBank\nCentral Federal Corporation is a financial holding company that owns 100% of the stock of CFBank, National Association (CFBank), which was formed in Ohio in 1892 and converted from a federal savings association to a national bank on December 1, 2016.
