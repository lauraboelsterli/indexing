    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Negotiators from Britain and the European Union agreed a broad structure for further talks on their future relationship after Brexit, dividing economic issues from those on security, the EU said on Friday.\nAnti-Brexit protesters wear masks and wave flags during a demonstration in front of the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson “It is a way of moving forward,” an EU official said after three days of talks in Brussels. The list of topics was, however, not a set of formal headings for future agreements nor would it determine the make-up of negotiating sub-committees.\nIn a statement, the European Commission’s Brexit Task Force headed by chief negotiator Michel Barnier listed four broad types of discussion:\n— the overall basis for cooperation, including issues such as governance, judicial oversight and dispute settlement;\n— an economic partnership, including trade, customs, agriculture, financial services, transport, energy, subsidies and the digital and broadcasting sector;\n— a security partnership, including fighting crime and cooperation in foreign, security and defence policy;\n— other issues, notably data protection, cooperative accords in science, education and culture, and fisheries.\nThe structure was initially put forward by the British side.\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Julia Fioretti and Andrew Heavens\n ",
