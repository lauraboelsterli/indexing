Excluding the effect of gains on hotels sold during both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, net income would have increased 16.7%. Income attributable to common stockholders per diluted common share decreased 44.4% to $0.15. Excluding the effect of gains on hotels sold during both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, income attributable to common stockholders per diluted common share would have increased 14.3%. 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR decreased 0.7% to $160.54. 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Adjusted EBITDAre Margin, excluding prior year property tax adjustments, net decreased\n170 basis points to 26.0%. Excluding the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, the Marriott Boston Long Wharf and the Renaissance Los Angeles Airport, all of which were under rooms renovation during the 22 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Adjusted EBITDAre Margin, excluding prior year property tax adjustments, net would have decreased 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest decreased 10.3% to $62.4 million. Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders per diluted share decreased 16.7% to $0.20.\nJohn Arabia, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our portfolio performed well during the first quarter, resulting in better-than-anticipated revenue growth and profitability above our previously provided guidance range. Profitability benefited from robust group spend on banquets and audio visual and strength in corporate transient demand. Our recently acquired or repositioned hotels, Boston Park Plaza, Oceans Edge and Wailea Beach Resort, all continued to outperform the respective markets, driving impressive year-over-year revenue and earnings growth.\"\nMr. Arabia continued, \"Year-to-date, we continue to find opportunities to invest in our portfolio to drive future growth. Several of our 2018 capital investment projects have been or will be completed during the second quarter, including the meeting space addition at Boston Park Plaza, and the guestroom renovations at the Marriott Boston Long Wharf, Renaissance Los Angeles Airport and Hyatt Regency San Francisco. While we experienced some short-term disruption year-to-date, we expect these investments to result in future growth. Additionally, the ongoing guestroom renovation at the JW Marriott New Orleans and the 47,000 additional square feet of state-of-the-art meeting space under construction at the Renaissance Orlando are expected to drive additional growth into 2019.\"\nUNAUDITED SELECTED STATISTICAL AND FINANCIAL DATA\n($ in millions, except RevPAR, ADR and per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet Income\n$\n38.5\n$\n63.8\n(39.8)\n%\nIncome Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.27\n(44.4)\n%\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR Growth (1)\n$\n160.54\n$\n161.67\n(0.7)\n%\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Occupancy (1)\n78.6\n%\n78.7\n%\n(10)\nbps\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio ADR (1)\n$\n204.25\n$\n205.42\n(0.6)\n%\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Adjusted EBITDAre Margin (1) (2) (3)\n26.0\n%\n27.7\n%\n(170)\nbps\nAdjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest (3)\n$\n62.4\n$\n69.6\n(10.3)\n%\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders\n$\n45.9\n$\n53.2\n(13.7)\n%\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.24\n(16.7)\n%\n(1)\nThe 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio is comprised of all 25 hotels owned by the Company as of March 31, 2018, and includes prior ownership results for the Oceans Edge Resort & Marina acquired in July 2017.\n(2)\nThe 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Adjusted EBITDAre Margins exclude any prior year property tax adjustments, net.\n(3)\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company presents EBITDAre, reported in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, and Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest, as supplemental measures of performance.

In 2018, the Company expects to invest approximately $150 million to $175 million into its portfolio. Several of the 2018 projects began in the fourth quarter 2017 and are expected to be completed during the first half of 2018. Based on the expected timing and scope of its 2018 projects, the Company expects $9 million to $11 million of total revenue displacement related to all capital projects in 2018, of which approximately $4.9 million of total revenue displacement was incurred during the first quarter. The anticipated revenue displacement is expected to reduce the Company's 2018 total Comparable Portfolio RevPAR growth by approximately 100 basis points. A selection of the Company's planned 2018 capital investment projects include:\nRenaissance Orlando at SeaWorld®: The Company is currently constructing 46,500 square feet of new meeting space, including a 16,400 square foot ballroom, on vacant land adjacent to the hotel's existing 150,000 square feet of total event and meeting space. Total cost for the new meeting space is expected to be $22 million to $24 million, with a portion spent in 2017. The new, state-of-the-art meeting space is expected to allow the hotel to increase the number of group rooms sold by approximately 20,000 room nights annually. Construction of the new meeting space began during the fourth quarter 2017, and is expected to be completed during the first quarter 2019. The Company expects zero to $1 million of total revenue displacement during the second half of 2018 related to the construction. Marriott Boston Long Wharf: The Company expects to invest $31 million to $34 million, with a portion spent in 2017, to renovate all 412 guestrooms and suites. The renovation, which will better position the hotel with high-end group and business travelers, includes the complete redesign of all guestrooms and bathrooms, including enlarging many of the existing bathrooms and converting 346 bathtubs to showers, as well as expanding and upgrading the concierge lounge. The renovation began during the fourth quarter 2017, and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2018. The Company expects $5 million to $6 million of total revenue displacement during the first half of 2018. JW Marriott New Orleans: The Company expects to invest $26 million to $28 million, with a portion spent in 2017, to renovate all 501 guestrooms and suites. The renovation includes the complete redesign of all guestrooms and bathrooms, including enlarging many of the existing bathrooms and converting 381 bathtubs to showers. The renovation began during the second quarter 2018, and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter 2018. The Company expects $2 million to $3 million of total revenue displacement during 2018. Renaissance Los Angeles Airport: The Company is investing approximately $9 million, with a portion spent in 2017, to renovate all 501 guestrooms and suites. In addition, the Company previously completed a renovation of its restaurant, lounge and meeting spaces in 2017. The renovation includes the complete redesign of all guestrooms. The renovation began during the fourth quarter 2017, and will be completed during the second quarter 2018. The Company expects to incur approximately $1 million of total revenue displacement during the first half of 2018. Hyatt Regency San Francisco: The Company is investing approximately $10 million, with a portion spent in 2017, to renovate the hotel's 138 suites and Regency Club rooms. The renovation began during the fourth quarter 2017, and will be completed during the second quarter 2018. The Company expects to incur approximately $0.3 million of revenue displacement during the first half of 2018. Boston Park Plaza: The Company has converted vacant retail space to 8,000 square feet of new meeting space. The new meeting space is expected to allow the hotel to increase the number of group rooms sold by approximately 10,000 room nights annually. Construction of the new meeting space began during the fourth quarter 2017, and was completed during the second quarter 2018. Total cost for the new meeting space was approximately $3 million. The Company did not incur any displacement related to the construction.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company's achievement of the anticipated results is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's guidance does not take into account the impact of any unanticipated developments in its business, changes in its operating environment, or any unannounced hotel acquisitions, dispositions, re-brandings, management changes, transition costs, noncash impairment expense, changes in deferred tax assets or valuation allowances, severance costs associated with restructuring hotel services, uninsured property losses, early lease termination costs, prior year property tax assessments or credits, debt repurchases/repayments, or unannounced financings during 2018. The Company's 2018 guidance does include anticipated displacement from the scheduled 2018 capital investment projects. The Company expects the negative impact of its 2018 capital investment projects to result in approximately 100 basis points less annual RevPAR growth and approximately $6 million to $8 million less Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest. The Company's 2018 guidance does not anticipate any acceleration in business travel resulting from the recent federal tax cuts or other stimulus programs.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects:\nMetric\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2018\nGuidance (3)\nNet Income ($ millions)\n$48 to $51\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR Growth\n+ 0.5% to + 2.5%\nAdjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest ($ millions)\n$96 to $99\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders ($ millions)\n$77 to $81\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share\n$0.34 to $0.36\nDiluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding\n224,800,000\nFor the full year of 2018, the Company expects:\nMetric\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance (1)\nAdjustments (2)\nAdjusted Prior\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance\nCurrent\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance (3)\nChange in\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance Midpoint\nNet Income ($ millions)\n$115 to $140\n+ $16\n$130 to $156\n$145 to $164\n+ $11\n25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR Growth\n- 0.5% to + 2.5%\n―\n- 0.5% to + 2.5%\n0% to + 2.5%\n+0.3%\nAdjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest ($ millions)\n$303 to $327\n$0\n$303 to $327\n$310 to $328\n+ $4\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders ($ millions)\n$235 to $259\n$0\n$235 to $259\n$242 to $261\n+ $4\nAdjusted FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders per Diluted Share\n$1.05 to $1.15\n- $0.01\n$1.04 to $1.15\n$1.07 to $1.16\n+ $0.02\nDiluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding\n225,000,000\n―\n225,000,000\n225,000,000\n―\n(1)\nReflects guidance presented on February 12, 2018.\n(2)\nAdjustments reflect the cumulative impact of operating results for the Marriott Philadelphia and the Marriott Quincy before their sale in January 2018, including severance payments associated with the sale, the net gain on the sale of the hotels, and the effect on net income of business interruption proceeds at the Oceans Edge Resort & Marina recognized during the first quarter of 2018.\n(3)\nSee pages 13 and 14 for detailed reconciliations of Net Income to non-GAAP financial measures.\nSecond quarter and full year 2018 guidance are based in part on the following assumptions:\nFull year 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio RevPAR guidance is negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points, resulting from planned 2018 capital investment projects, a selection of which are discussed above. Full year revenue displacement of $9 million to $11 million, related to planned 2018 capital investment projects. Full year Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest displacement of approximately $6 million to $8 million, related to planned 2018 capital investment projects. Full year 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio Adjusted EBITDAre Margin is expected to decline 50 basis points to 100 basis points, which is negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points resulting from planned 2018 capital investment projects. Full year corporate overhead expense (excluding deferred stock amortization) of approximately $21 million to $22 million. Full year amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately $9 million. Full year interest expense of approximately $46 million, including approximately $3 million in amortization of deferred financing fees, approximately $2 million of capital lease obligation interest and approximately $3 million noncash gain on derivatives. Full year total preferred dividends of $13 million, which includes the Series E and Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock.\nDividend Update\nOn May 3, 2018, the Company's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, as well as cash dividends of $0.434375 per share payable to its Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stockholders and $0.403125 per share payable to its Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stockholders. The dividends will be paid on July 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of June 29, 2018.\nThe Company expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock throughout 2018. Consistent with the Company's past practice and to the extent that the expected regular quarterly dividends for 2018 do not satisfy the annual distribution requirements, the Company expects to satisfy the annual distribution requirement by paying a \"catch-up\" dividend in January 2019. The level of any future quarterly dividends will be determined by the Company's board of directors after considering long-term operating projections, expected capital requirements, and risks affecting the Company's business.\nSupplemental Disclosures\nContemporaneous with this release, the Company has furnished a Form 8-K with unaudited financial information. This additional information is being provided as a supplement to the information in this release and other filings with the SEC. The Company has no obligation to update any of the guidance or other information provided to conform to actual results or changes in the Company's portfolio, capital structure or future expectations.\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results on May 8, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Pacific Time).

Sunstone's hotels are primarily in the urban and resort upper upscale segment and are predominantly operated under nationally recognized brands, such as Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt.

As demand for lodging generally fluctuates with the overall economy, we seek to own hotels that will maintain a high appeal with travelers over long periods of time and will generate economic earnings materially in excess of recurring capital requirements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of federal securities laws and regulations. These are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"will\" and other similar terms and phrases, including opinions, references to assumptions and forecasts of future results. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to anticipated at the time the are made.

Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such are based upon reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material. All forward-looking information in this release is as of May 7, 2018, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company's expectations.\nThis release should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies of these reports are available on our website at www.sunstonehotels.com and through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (\"EDGAR\") at www.sec.gov .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: earnings before interest expense, taxes, for real estate, or EBITDAre; Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest (as defined below); funds from operations attributable to common stockholders, or FFO attributable to common stockholders; Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders (as defined below); hotel Adjusted EBITDAre; and hotel Adjusted EBITDAre margin. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculation of these measures may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly the same as the Company. These non-GAAP measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nWe present EBITDAre in accordance with guidelines established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), as defined in its September 2017 white paper \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\" We believe EBITDAre is a useful performance measure to help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period in comparison to our peers. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) plus interest expense, income tax expense, , gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change in control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in the value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance, and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, we use both EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest results in a similar metric as our previous disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe that the presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified noncash items such as real estate , amortization of lease intangibles, any real estate impairment loss and any gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and may be of lesser significance in evaluating our current performance. Our presentation of FFO attributable to common stockholders conforms to NAREIT's definition of \"FFO applicable to common shares.\" Our presentation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the terms in accordance with the current NAREIT definition, or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nWe also present Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders when evaluating our operating performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance, and may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and our peer companies.\nWe adjust EBITDAre and FFO attributable to common stockholders for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to these measures as either Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest or Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders:\nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable contracts: we exclude the noncash amortization of the favorable management contract asset recorded in conjunction with our acquisition of the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile, along with the favorable and unfavorable tenant lease contracts, as applicable, recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions of the Boston Park Plaza, the Hilton Garden Inn Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile, the Hilton New Orleans St. Charles, the Hyatt Regency San Francisco and the Wailea Beach Resort. We exclude the noncash amortization of favorable and unfavorable contracts because it is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period. Noncash ground rent: we exclude the noncash expense incurred from straight-lining our ground lease obligations as this expense does not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for the current period. Gains or losses from debt transactions: we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired because, like interest expense, their removal helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure. Acquisition costs: under GAAP, costs associated with completed acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle: from time to time, the FASB promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period. Other adjustments: we exclude other adjustments that we believe are outside the ordinary course of business because we do not believe these costs reflect our actual performance for the period and/or the ongoing operations of our hotels. Such items may include: lawsuit settlement costs; prior year property tax assessments or credits; property-level restructuring, severance and management transition costs; lease terminations; and uninsured losses.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest we exclude the noncontrolling partner's pro rata share of the net income (loss) allocated to the Hilton San Diego Bayfront partnership, as well as the noncontrolling partner's pro rata share of any EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre components. We also exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels. Additionally, we include an adjustment for the cash ground lease expenses recorded on the ground lease at the Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles and the building lease at the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile. We have determined that both of these leases are capital leases, and, therefore, we include a portion of the capital lease payments each month in interest expense. We include an adjustment for ground lease expense on capital leases in order to more accurately reflect the actual rent due to both hotels' lessors in the current period, as well as the operating performance of both hotels. We also exclude the effect of gains and losses on the disposition of undepreciable assets because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets.\nTo derive Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders, we also exclude the noncash interest on our derivatives and capital lease obligations, the noncontrolling partner's pro rata share of any FFO adjustments related to our consolidated Hilton San Diego Bayfront partnership, as well as changes to deferred tax assets or valuation allowances, and income tax benefits or provisions associated with the application of net operating loss carryforwards, uncertain tax positions or with the sale of assets other than real estate investments. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.\nIn presenting hotel Adjusted EBITDAre and hotel Adjusted EBITDAre margins, miscellaneous non-hotel items have been excluded. We believe the calculation of hotel Adjusted EBITDAre results in a more accurate presentation of the hotel Adjusted EBITDAre margins for our hotels, and that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating our property-level operating performance.\nOur 25 Hotel Comparable Portfolio is comprised of all 25 hotels we owned as of March 31, 2018, and includes both our results and the prior owner's results for the Oceans Edge Resort & Marina acquired in July 2017. We obtained prior ownership information from the Oceans Edge Resort & Marina's previous owner during the due diligence period before acquiring the hotel. We performed a limited review of the information as part of our analysis of the acquisition. We caution you not to place undue reliance on the prior ownership information. We believe that providing comparable hotel data is useful to us and to investors in evaluating our operating performance because this measure helps us and investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the fluctuations caused by any acquisitions or dispositions, as well as by those hotels that we classify as held for sale, those hotels that are undergoing a material renovation or repositioning and those hotels whose room counts have materially changed during either the current or prior year. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nReconciliations of net income to EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, excluding noncontrolling interest, FFO attributable to common stockholders and Adjusted FFO attributable to common stockholders are set forth on pages 11 and 12. Reconciliations and the components of hotel Adjusted EBITDAre and hotel Adjusted EBITDAre margin are set forth on pages 15 and 16.\nSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share data)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n467,050\n$\n488,002\nRestricted cash\n79,336\n71,309\nAccounts receivable, net\n48,589\n34,219\nInventories\n1,375\n1,323\nPrepaid expenses\n12,532\n10,464\nAssets held for sale, net\n—\n122,807\nTotal current assets\n608,882\n728,124\nInvestment in hotel properties, net\n3,110,887\n3,106,066\nDeferred financing fees, net\n1,045\n1,305\nOther assets, net\n31,971\n22,317\nTotal assets\n$\n3,752,785\n$\n3,857,812\nLiabilities and Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n34,950\n$\n31,810\nAccrued payroll and employee benefits\n18,174\n26,687\nDividends and distributions payable\n14,488\n133,894\nOther current liabilities\n43,073\n44,502\nCurrent portion of notes payable, net\n5,569\n5,477\nLiabilities of assets held for sale\n—\n189\nTotal current liabilities\n116,254\n242,559\nNotes payable, less current portion, net\n975,779\n977,282\nCapital lease obligations, less current portion\n26,854\n26,804\nOther liabilities\n31,041\n28,989\nTotal liabilities\n1,149,928\n1,275,634\nCommitments and contingencies\nEquity:\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized:\n6.95% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 4,600,000 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, stated at liquidation preference of $25.00 per share\n115,000\n115,000\n6.45% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 3,000,000 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, stated at liquidation preference of $25.00 per share\n75,000\n75,000\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 500,000,000 shares authorized, 225,614,712 issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and 225,321,660 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017\n2,256\n2,253\nAdditional paid in capital\n2,677,099\n2,679,221\nRetained earnings\n968,293\n932,277\nCumulative dividends and distributions\n(1,284,501)\n(1,270,013)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n2,553,147\n2,533,738\nNoncontrolling interest in consolidated joint venture\n49,710\n48,440\nTotal equity\n2,602,857\n2,582,178\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n3,752,785\n$\n3,857,812\nSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nRevenues\nRoom\n$\n180,276\n$\n190,367\nFood and beverage\n74,266\n75,501\nOther operating\n16,904\n14,875\nTotal revenues\n271,446\n280,743\nOperating expenses\nRoom\n51,095\n51,292\nFood and beverage\n50,154\n50,537\nOther operating\n3,941\n3,831\nAdvertising and promotion\n13,906\n14,946\nRepairs and maintenance\n11,103\n10,967\nUtilities\n7,475\n7,222\nFranchise costs\n7,853\n8,055\nProperty tax, ground lease and insurance\n21,781\n21,287\nOther property-level expenses\n33,907\n34,738\nCorporate overhead\n7,102\n6,779\n36,688\n40,807\nTotal operating expenses\n245,005\n250,461\nOperating income\n26,441\n30,282\nInterest and other income\n1,491\n721\nInterest expense\n(8,876)\n(11,249)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n(4)\nGain on sale of assets\n15,659\n44,285\nIncome before income taxes\n34,715\n64,035\nIncome tax benefit (provision), net\n3,740\n(208)\nNet income\n38,455\n63,827\nIncome from consolidated joint venture attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(2,439)\n(1,992)\nPreferred stock dividends\n(3,207)\n(3,207)\nIncome attributable to common stockholders\n$\n32,809\n$\n58,628\nBasic and diluted per share amounts:\nBasic and diluted income attributable to common stockholders per common share\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.27\nBasic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding\n224,282\n219,093\nDistributions declared per common share\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.05\nSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited and in thousands)\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, Excluding Noncontrolling Interest\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n38,455\n$\n63,827\nOperations held for investment:\n36,688\n40,807\nAmortization of lease intangibles\n63\n63\nInterest expense\n8,876\n11,249\nIncome tax (benefit) provision, net\n(3,740)\n208\nGain on sale of assets, net\n(15,669)\n(44,570)\nEBITDAre\n64,673\n71,584\nOperations held for investment:\nAmortization of deferred stock compensation\n2,000\n1,749\nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable contracts, net\n3\n99\nNoncash ground rent\n(281)\n(275)\nCapital lease obligation interest -
