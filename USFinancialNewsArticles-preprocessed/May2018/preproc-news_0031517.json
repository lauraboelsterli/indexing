    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and fiancée Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday in a ceremony that brings together royalty and Hollywood glamour.\nBritain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend a special concert \"The Queen's Birthday Party\" to celebrate the 92nd birthday of Britain's Queen Elizabeth at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Britain April 21, 2018. John Stillwell/Pool via Reuters Queen Elizabeth’s grandson Harry and Markle, who starred in the TV drama “Suits”, will tie the knot at St George’s Chapel at Windsor castle, the oldest and largest inhabited fortress in the world.\nHere are brief details about the wedding:\n(all times are approximate and in GMT)\nFRIDAY EVENING - Markle and her mother Doria Ragland will travel to Cliveden House Hotel near Windsor where they will spend the night before the wedding.\nHarry and his elder brother and best man, Prince William, will stay at the Coworth Park hotel.\nSATURDAY 0800 -\nThe 1,200 members of the public invited to the grounds of the castle for the wedding will begin to arrive.\n0830 - 1000\nThe 600 guests for the ceremony will arrive by coach at the castle’s Round Tower. They will walk to the chapel and enter via the South Door.\n1020 -\nMembers of the royal family will begin to arrive and will enter the chapel via the Galilee Porch. Some will be on foot and some will arrive by car.\nAt about this time, Markle and her mother will leave their hotel by car, travelling along the Long Walk promenade that runs up to the castle to allow spectators catch a glimpse of the bride on the way to the ceremony.\n1030 -\nHarry and William will arrive at the chapel, most likely on foot, and will enter by the chapel’s West Steps, having greeted some of the public and charity representatives invited to be in the grounds. Queen Elizabeth will be the last of the royals to arrive.\nThe car carrying Markle and her mother will stop at the chapel where Ragland will head inside. Markle is due to be joined by her father at this point, although his presence is now in doubt, along with some of the bridesmaids and page boys. She will continue to the West Steps where she will enter the chapel.\n1100 -\nThe service begins. David Conner, the Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual leader of the world’s Anglicans, will officiate for the exchanging of vows.\nMichael Curry, the Presiding Bishop and Primate of The Episcopal Church, will give the address.\n1200 -\nThe service ends. The newlyweds will process out of the chapel and then acknowledge the 200 specially invited charity representatives gathered in the Cloister outside.\nFamily members will gather on the West Steps while other members of the congregation will file out to wave off the couple as they begin a procession in an Ascot Landau carriage. The procession which will take the couple through Windsor before returning to the castle up the Long Walk is due to last about 25 minutes.\n1225 -\nGuests at the chapel will walk to the reception at St George’s Hall, a huge, grand banqueting room in the State Apartments. The couple will join them having completed the carriage procession\n1800 -\nThe bride and groom will leave the castle to attend an evening reception at nearby Frogmore House which will be attended by 200 guests.\nReporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew Heavens\n ",
