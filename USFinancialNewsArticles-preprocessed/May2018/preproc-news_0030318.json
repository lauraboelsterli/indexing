    "text": "NEW YORK, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:NHLD) (“National” or the “Company”), a leading full service independent brokerage, investment banking, trading and asset management firm providing diverse services including tax preparation, today announced its financial results for the fiscal second quarter 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Highlights:\n• Record quarterly revenue of $60.3 million, versus $51.9 million for the fiscal second quarter 2017. Strategic hires, emphasis on diversified product offerings, and strong equity market activity contributed to this quarter’s performance.\n• Investment banking continued to produce excellent results, generating $14.5 million of revenue, in line with the fiscal first quarter of 2018. Year to date Investment banking results are up 18% compared to the prior year to date.\n• Adjusted EBITDA increased to $5.9 million, a record quarter, from a strong $4.3 million in the prior year quarter. Strategic investments in technology and enterprise risk management continue to impact profitability as we improve the company’s operating platform.\n• Income before other expense and income taxes was $4.7 million, up 27% compared to profit of $3.7 million in the prior year quarter.\nPre-tax loss of $.7 million includes a non-operating, non-taxable loss of $5.6 million due to a change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability. The warrants were issued in early 2017, as part of the previously announced tender offer closing. The warrant agreement was amended on March 15 th , 2018, and accordingly this is the last quarterly period a gain or loss will be recorded.\nThe current quarter net loss of $2.3 million includes the non-operating, non-taxable $5.6 million loss in the current quarter from the fair value warrant liability change mentioned above.\n• Cash and cash equivalents of $32.2 million and no debt as of March 31, 2018 versus $27.9 million as of September 30, 2017.\n• Equity of $46.0 million as of March 31, 2018 versus $38.9 million as of September 30, 2017. The significant increase in equity period to period is due to the reclassification of the warrant liability to equity, the result of the change to the warrant agreement described above. Management Commentary\nMichael Mullen, Chief Executive Officer of National Holdings Corporation stated, “It has been just over 18 months since our reorganization and refocus initiated with the successful closing of the Fortress Biotech tender for our company. It began with an almost complete remaking of the Board of Directors of our holding company and continued with substantive changes in the management team of our operating companies. I am proud to say the transformation has been powerful and this shines through not only in the outperformance we have seen quarter over quarter, but also the high-end talent that continues to join our thriving organization. We have optimized our team by increasing senior management positions across key risk management departments, while simultaneously exiting more than 200 and adding over 100 new financial advisors, to ensure all of our personnel share in the vision, focus and success of National. The cultural shift has permeated from the top down and we are extremely proud of the progress and success we have achieved in such a short period of time.”\nMr. Mullen continued, “While implementing these changes required a substantial investment, we know that we are building an extremely solid foundation which will aid in the continued success and growth of our business. Despite all of the changes, our assets under management have never been higher, and we have driven record revenues and earnings to date. Of particular success has been our proprietary banking results. Since the tender, we have closed 91 banking transactions with an aggregate deal value of $2.8 billion dollars, while generating record banking revenues of $59 million.”\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Results\nNational reported second quarter 2018 revenue of $60.3 million, up $8.4 million or 16% over the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Total expenses increased $7.5 million or 16% to $55.7 million in the quarter.\nRevenue\nOur major revenue categories produced very strong results in the current quarter. The majority of the revenue increase in Q2 2018 was recorded in commissions and related fees, which increased to $33.2 million in the quarter, up $7.5 million, or 29%, due to significant hires and strong equity markets. Investment banking, investment management, and tax preparation and accounting all contributed strong revenue generation during the quarter.\nInvestment banking revenue of $14.5 million declined slightly from the $14.9 million recorded in the prior year quarter. Although results declined slightly, the number and diversification of deals conducted in the current quarter improved versus the comparative quarter. Through the first six months of fiscal 2018, investment banking revenue generated has increased 18%, compared to the same period in the prior year.\nInvestment advisory revenue increased $1.5 million, to $5.2 million, up 40% in the current quarter. Increased focus on this segment of our business combined with high asset values produced a very significant current quarter. Our assets under management continue to grow, adding to our percentage of recurring revenue.\nNet dealer inventory gains declined to $2.8 million in the current quarter from $3.4 million in the prior year. We have concluded our analysis of this portion of our business and have eliminated certain trading silos. As a result, we expect our operating margins to improve as we focus our trading efforts on those specifically tailored to service our retail and institutional clients.\nTax preparation and accounting revenue improved to $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2018, traditionally our busiest quarter, versus the $3.1 million during the same period in the prior year, up 23%. This is a net increase as we have eliminated underperforming offices, while adding resources to other, stronger offices.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased to $55.7 million in the current fiscal quarter, up $7.5 million, 16%, over the comparative quarter in fiscal 2017. Variable compensation expenses directly associated with overall revenue generation, and technology and enterprise risk management spending contributed to the majority of the increase.\nCommissions, compensation and fees increased $7.6 million to $49.3 million in the current quarter. The increase in investment banking, commissions, and investment advisory revenue, and therefore compensation expense, contributed to the majority of the increase. As we have previously noted, planned infrastructure spending in technology development and enterprise risk management professionals and the related incremental employee benefits contributed to the increase.\nAll other operating expense categories declined $.1 million in total. Increases in technology spending across several categories were offset by slightly lower clearing, professional fee, and other administrative expense spending.\nEarnings\nIncome before other expense and income taxes totaled $4.7 million, up 27%, versus income of $3.7 million in the prior year quarter. The loss before income taxes, which includes the change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability, totaled $.7 million, versus income of $5.6 million in the prior year quarter. The change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability is a market based adjustment that negatively impacted earnings in the current quarter by $5.6 million as noted, however positively impacted earnings in the prior year quarter by $1.8 million.\nThe impact of the re-valuation of the firm’s warrant liability is a non-operating, non-taxable earnings adjustment and should be viewed as such. Also, as noted above, due to an amendment to the 2016 warrant agreement, this is the last quarter that will be positively or negatively impacted by a warrant re-valuation.\nThe net loss for the current quarter totaled $2.3 million, versus income of $3.9 million in the prior year quarter. The variance is due entirely to the warrant valuation noted above.\nThe net loss per share, both basic and fully diluted, was $.18 in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, versus net income per share of $.31 in the comparable 2017 quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $5.9 million in the current quarter, from $4.3 million in prior year quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, National had $32.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, versus $27.9 million as of September 30, 2017. The Company's balance sheet remains debt free.\nAbout National Holdings Corporation\nNational Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:NHLD) is a full-service investment banking and asset management firm that, through its affiliates, provides a range of services, including independent retail brokerage and advisory services, investment banking, institutional sales and trading, equity research, financial planning, market making, tax preparation and insurance, to corporations, institutions, high net-worth and retail investors.
