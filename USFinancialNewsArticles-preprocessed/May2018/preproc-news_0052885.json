    "text": "LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Thrill seekers can get their next dose of adrenaline on a new rollercoaster opening in the British seaside town of Blackpool this week, with visitors promised the same feeling of acceleration as a racing driver.\nThe 16 million pound ($21 million) ICON ride is being billed as Britain’s first double launch rollercoaster with “two powerful thrusts of acceleration”, according to the Pleasure Beach amusement park where it opens to the public on Friday.\nLasting two and a half minutes, ICON offers “the same acceleration as a Formula 1 driver, before twisting and turning at speeds of up to 80 km/hour”.\nThe rollercoaster ride also races through tunnels, rises up to 88.5 feet (27 m) and dives down some 82ft. ($1 = 0.7457 pounds) (Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n ",
