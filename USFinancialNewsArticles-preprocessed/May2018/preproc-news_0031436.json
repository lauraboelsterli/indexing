    "text": "LIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITRI) announced today financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Highlights in the quarter include:\nCompleted acquisition of Silver Spring Networks on Jan. 5, 2018, which operates and reports as the new Itron Networks segment; Revenue of $607 million, compared with $478 million in the first quarter of 2017; Gross margin of 29.6 percent, compared with 33.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017; GAAP loss per share of $3.74, compared with earnings of 40 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017; Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 13 cents, compared with 57 cents the first quarter of 2017; Adjusted EBITDA of $40 million, compared with $46 million in the first quarter of 2017; and Total backlog of $3.1 billion, compared with $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Itron’s revenue increased by 27 percent in the quarter, driven by increased sales of our smart electric and gas solutions in Europe, accelerated deliveries of our OpenWay® Riva solutions in the Americas and strong performance in the new Networks segment,” said Philip Mezey, Itron president and chief executive officer. “We were very pleased with our revenue performance including the new Networks segment, which delivered 1 million endpoints in the quarter.\n“As anticipated, margins and EPS declined from last year, driven by costs related to our global supply chain transitions, higher component and commodity prices and product mix. We are making progress with operational initiatives to help drive efficiencies later in the year, including the integration of the Networks business, executing our restructuring projects and collaborating with our global supply chain partners,” continued Mezey.\n“We continue to see strong customer demand for our expanded portfolio of smart networks, software, services, meters and sensors that helps our customers better manage utility and municipal services. Total backlog has increased to $3.1 billion, including the addition of the acquired Networks segment backlog.”\nSummary of First Quarter Consolidated Financial Results\n(All comparisons made are against the prior year period unless otherwise noted)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue of $607 million increased 27 percent in the first quarter. The increased revenue includes the new Networks segment which added $86 million of revenue. Excluding the addition of the Networks segment, total revenue grew 9 percent.\nElectricity revenue increased 6 percent on higher managed services revenue, product revenue growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region and strong Riva demand in North America. Gas revenue grew 11 percent primarily driven by smart solution deliveries in EMEA. Water revenue grew by 14 percent driven by increased smart solution deliveries in North America and Asia-Pacific regions and higher residential demand in Latin America. Networks segment revenue was driven by deployments in North America and accelerating international adoption of new solutions.\nGross Margin\nConsolidated company gross margin of 29.6 percent decreased 340 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2017. The decline was due to higher costs associated with global supply chain transitions, higher component and commodity costs and product mix.\nOperating Expenses and Operating Income (loss)\nGAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $320 million compared with $127 million in the first quarter of 2017. The higher operating expenses were driven by restructuring charges of $88 million, acquisition and integration-related expenses of $63 million, the addition of Networks segment and Distributed Energy Management (DEM) operations and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Higher operating expenses drove a GAAP operating loss of $140 million compared with operating income of $31 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses of $152 million increased from $119 million in 2017 driven by the addition of acquired operations and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Non-GAAP operating income declined to $28 million compared with $39 million in 2017 due to higher expenses.\nNet Income (loss) and Earnings per Share\nNet loss attributable to Itron for the quarter was $146 million, or $3.74 per share, compared with net income of $16 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, in 2017.\nThe net loss was driven by the operating loss in the quarter and higher interest expense related to financing for the acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by a tax benefit in the U.S. on the pre-tax loss.\nExcluding certain charges, including restructuring, acquisition and integration-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets and debt placement fees, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $5 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, compared with $22 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, in 2017. Compared with last year, non-GAAP net income reflects lower operating income, higher interest expense and a higher non-GAAP effective tax rate due to the timing and mix of taxable income by jurisdiction.\nCash Flow\nNet cash used by operating activities was $24 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with cash provided by operating activities of $63 million in the same quarter of 2017. Free cash flow was negative $42 million in the first quarter compared with positive $54 million in the prior year. The decreases were primarily driven by cash outlays for acquisition and integration-related expenses and timing of working capital.\nOther Measures\nTotal backlog was $3.1 billion and 12 month backlog was $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $1.6 billion and $819 million, respectively, in the prior year quarter. Bookings in the quarter totaled $557 million. The Networks segment added $1.4 billion and $337 million to total and 12 month backlog, respectively.\nEarnings Conference Call\nItron will host a conference call to discuss the financial results and guidance contained in this release at 5 p.m. EDT on May 14, 2018.

We provide these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide greater transparency and represent supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We exclude certain costs in our non-GAAP financial measures as we believe the net result is a measure of our core business. The company believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Non-GAAP performance measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from those reported by other companies. A more detailed discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures, the limitations of using such measures, and reconciliations between non-GAAP and the nearest GAAP financial measures are included in this press release.\nITRON, INC.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, constant currency and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define such measures differently. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures please see the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures.”\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and/or as a means for determining executive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and ability to service debt by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. Our executive compensation plans exclude non-cash charges related to amortization of intangibles and certain discrete cash and non-cash charges such as acquisition and integration related expenses, restructuring charges or goodwill impairment charges. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and because they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income - We define non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses excluding certain expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, and goodwill impairment. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding the expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, and goodwill impairment. Acquisition and integration related expenses include costs which are incurred to affect and integrate business combinations, such as professional fees, certain employee retention and salaries related to integration, severances, contract terminations, travel costs related to knowledge transfer, system conversion costs, and asset impairment charges. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of expenses that are related to acquisitions and restructuring projects. By excluding these expenses, we believe that it is easier for management and investors to compare our financial results over multiple periods and analyze trends in our operations. For example, in certain periods expenses related to amortization of intangible assets may decrease, which would improve GAAP operating margins, yet the improvement in GAAP operating margins due to this lower expense is not necessarily reflective of an improvement in our core business. There are some limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating income versus operating expenses and operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information about the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP operating income together with GAAP operating expense and GAAP operating income.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS - We define non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Itron, Inc. excluding the expenses associated with amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition and integration, goodwill impairment, amortization of debt placement fees, the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the tax effect of excluding these expenses. We define non-GAAP diluted EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a diluted basis, outstanding during each period. We consider these financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that we use non-GAAP operating income. The same limitations described above regarding our use of non-GAAP operating income apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP measures and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS together with GAAP net income attributable to Itron, Inc. and GAAP diluted EPS.\nAdjusted EBITDA - We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (a) minus interest income, (b) plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, acquisition and integration related expense, goodwill impairment and (c) excluding income tax provision or benefit. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for executive compensation. A limitation to using adjusted EBITDA is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and the measure includes some non-cash items and excludes other non-cash items. Additionally, the items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the items that our peer companies exclude when they report their results. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this measure to GAAP net income.\nFree cash flow - We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for acquisitions of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund our operations and repay our debt. The same limitations described above regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA apply to our use of free cash flow. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts and reconciling to free cash flow.\nConstant currency - We refer to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in our discussions of financial results, which references the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We also use the term “constant currency,” which represents financial results adjusted to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates as compared with the rates in the comparable prior year period. We calculate the constant currency change as the difference between the current period results and the comparable prior period’s results restated using current period foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe accompanying tables have more detail on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nITRON, INC.
