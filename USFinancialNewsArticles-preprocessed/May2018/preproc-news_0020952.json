(NYSE:PBH) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with the progress we made against our long term strategies during the year and we finished fiscal 2018 with positive momentum in many key areas of our business. During the fiscal year our leading and diverse brand portfolio continued to grow categories and win market share with consumers while generating meaningful free cash flow. We also completed the integration of the Fleet business, the largest in the company's history, and positioned the brands for long term growth. As we head into fiscal 2019, we see continuing opportunities to position our business for long-term success,” said Ron Lombardi, Chief Executive Officer of Prestige Brands.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Ended March 31, 2018\nReported revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 6.4% to $256.0 million, compared to $240.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenues for the quarter were driven by solid consumption levels across the Company’s core brands and incremental revenue from the Fleet acquisition.\nGross profit margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 55.2%, compared to 54.1% reported in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Sequentially, gross margin improved from the third quarter 2018 level of 54.6% as the Company made progress in its freight and warehousing initiatives.\nAdvertising & promotion expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $35.3 million, or 13.8% of sales, compared to $41.5 million, or 17.2% of sales, in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Excluding adjustments related to the Fleet transition and integration, fourth quarter fiscal 2017 advertising and promotion spend was 16.3% of sales. Advertising and promotion spend was in line with expectations but declined on a dollar basis versus the prior year due to the impact of the Fleet acquisition during the fourth quarter 2017.\nReported net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $39.7 million versus the prior year comparable quarter’s net income of $11.1 million. A diluted loss per share of $0.75 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a $0.21 diluted earnings per share gain in the prior year comparable period. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $33.0 million, an increase of 14.5% from the comparable prior year period’s adjusted net income of $28.8 million. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share were $0.62 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.54 per share in the prior year comparable period.\nAdjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 included non-cash tradename impairments of $28.6 million and $70.7 million associated with the Company’s Beano and Comet brands, respectively. These tradename impairments reflect further de-emphasis of these brands and the anticipation of a continued decline in consumer consumption trends.\nAdjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include certain integration, transition, legal and various other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures and the related income tax effects of the adjustments as well as accelerated amortization of debt origination costs, loss on extinguishment of debt and other additional expense related to refinancing activities.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018\nReported revenues for the fiscal year 2018 increased 18.0% to $1.041 billion compared to $882.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Revenues for fiscal 2018 were driven by continued strong consumption levels across the Company’s legacy brands and $175.4 million of incremental revenue from the Fleet acquisition, which was partially offset by the divestitures of certain non-core brands during fiscal 2017.\nReported gross profit margin in fiscal 2018 was 55.4% compared to 56.7% for fiscal 2017. The gross profit margin year-over-year change was primarily due to the addition of the higher growth Fleet portfolio and higher freight and warehouse costs realized in second half of fiscal 2018.\nAdvertising & promotion expense for fiscal 2018 was $147.3 million, or 14.1% of sales, compared to $128.4 million, or 14.6% of sales, in the prior year. Increased dollar investments in advertising and promotion expense versus fiscal 2017 were attributable to the Company’s long-term brand building strategy.\nReported net income for the fiscal year 2018 totaled $339.6 million, versus the prior year comparable period net income of $69.4 million. Diluted earnings per share were $6.34 for the fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.30 per share in the prior year comparable period. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for fiscal 2018 was $138.3 million, an increase over the prior year period’s adjusted net income of $126.6 million. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share were $2.58 per share for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.37 per share in fiscal 2017.\nAdjustments to net income in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include certain integration, transition, legal and various other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures and the related income tax effects of the adjustments as well as accelerated amortization of debt origination costs, loss on extinguishment of debt related and other additional expense related to refinancing activities.\nAdjustments to net income in fiscal 2018 included income tax adjustments related to the domestic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a tax adjustment associated with an acquisition and tradename impairment associated with the Company’s Beano and Comet brands discussed above.\nAdjustments to net income in fiscal 2017 also included non-cash costs related to divestiture of certain non-core brands.\nFree Cash Flow and Balance Sheet\nThe Company's net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year 2018 increased to $210.1 million from $148.7 million versus in prior fiscal year due to continued strong cash conversion in the legacy business and incremental cash flow related to the Fleet acquisition, partially offset by the loss of cash flow from divested brands.\nNon-GAAP adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2018 increased to $208.1 million from $196.9 million in the prior year.\nThe Company's net debt position as of March 31, 2018 was approximately $2.0 billion, reflecting debt repayments of $209.0 million during the fiscal year. At March 31, 2018, the Company's covenant-defined leverage ratio declined to 5.2x.\nSegment Review\nNorth American OTC Healthcare: Segment revenues totaled $212.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, 6.6% higher than the prior year comparable quarter's revenues of $199.0 million. The fourth quarter fiscal 2018 increase was driven by revenues from the acquisition of Fleet as well as consumption growth in the Company’s core OTC brands.\nFor the fiscal 2018 year, reported revenues for the North American OTC segment were $868.9 million, an increase of 20.5% compared to $720.8 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by revenues from the acquisition of Fleet as well as consumption growth in the Company’s core OTC brands.\nInternational OTC Healthcare: Segment fiscal fourth quarter 2018 revenues totaled $24.1 million, 19.0% higher than the $20.2 million reported in the prior year comparable period. Fourth quarter revenues included incremental revenues from the Fleet acquisition, as well as continued growth of the Company’s Care brand portfolio in Australia.\nFor the current fiscal year, reported revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment were $91.7 million, an increase of 25.0% over the prior year's revenues of $73.3 million. Revenues for the International OTC Healthcare segment were impacted by favorable consumption levels as well as revenues from the Fleet acquisition.\nHousehold Cleaning: Segment revenues totaled $19.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with fourth quarter fiscal 2017 revenues of $21.4 million, a decrease of 7.4%. Reported revenues for the Household Cleaning segment were $80.6 million for fiscal 2018, a decrease of 8.3% over prior year revenues of $87.9 million due to continued declines in consumer usage trends in Comet’s core categories.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Under the authorization, the Company may purchase common stock through May, 2019 utilizing one or more open market transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, by direct purchases of common stock or a combination of the foregoing in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe timing of the purchases and the amount of stock repurchased is subject to the Company's discretion and will depend on market and business conditions, applicable legal and credit requirements and other corporate considerations including the Company’s historical strategy of pursuing accretive acquisitions and deleveraging.\nCommentary and Outlook for Fiscal 2019\nRon Lombardi, CEO, stated, “Our fiscal 2018 performance is proof that our long-term strategy of brand building continues to drive market share gains and strong cash flow. In our first full year of Fleet ownership, we achieved pro-forma sales growth of nearly 2% as we continued to grow categories and increase market share along with generating over $205 million of free cash flow. Against a challenging retail backdrop we are encouraged by this performance and believe it sets a positive stage for the upcoming fiscal year.”\n“For fiscal 2019, we anticipate continued strong cash generation and top-line growth driven by our well-positioned and diversified portfolio of leading brands. We expect our portfolio consumption rate to be in our long-term target range, although we anticipate our top-line performance to be below our long-term outlook largely attributable to expected retailer inventory reduction efforts and a positive restaging of our BC/Goody’s brand packaging. In addition to brand-building investments, improvements surrounding our freight and warehousing costs remain a priority and we expect to build on progress made in Q4. Finally, we will continue to create value for shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation approach as evidenced by todays stock repurchase announcement.”\n“We have evolved and strengthened our portfolio, and remain confident in the long-term top- and bottom-line growth prospects for our business driven by our three-pillar strategy,” Mr. Lombardi concluded.\nFiscal 2019 Full-Year Outlook Revenues $1,046 to $1,056 million Revenue Growth Percentage 0.5% to 1.5% E.P.S. $2.96 to $3.04 Free Cash Flow $215 million or more Fiscal Q4 Conference Call, Accompanying Slide Presentation and Replay\nThe Company will host a conference call to review its fourth quarter results today, May 10, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed a number of acquisitions in recent years that have resulted in revenues that would not have otherwise been recognized. The frequency and the amount of such revenues vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we disclose certain Non-GAAP financial measures (\"NGFMs\"), including, but not limited to, Non-GAAP Organic Revenues, Non-GAAP Organic Revenue Growth Percentage, Non-GAAP Proforma Revenues , Non-GAAP Proforma Revenue Growth Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Margin Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense, Non-GAAP Adjusted Advertising and Promotion Expense Percentage, Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense, Non-GAAP Adjusted General and Administrative Expense Percentage, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS, Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. We use these NGFMs internally, along with GAAP information, in evaluating our operating performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe that the presentation of these NGFMs provides investors with greater transparency, and provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures, because the supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations provides additional ways to view our operation when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliations below. In addition, we believe that the presentation of each of these NGFMs is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results in assessing shareholder value, and we use these NGFMs internally to evaluate the performance of our personnel and also to evaluate our operating performance and compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nThese NGFMs are not in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered as a measure of profitability or liquidity, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled NGFMs reported by other companies. These NGFMs have limitations and they should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to their most closely related GAAP measures reconciled below. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the reconciliations below, we believe these NGFMs provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than GAAP measures alone.\nNGFMs Defined\nWe define our NGFMs presented herein as follows:\nNon-GAAP Organic Revenues : GAAP Total Revenues excluding revenues associated with products acquired or divested in the periods presented.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS : Calculated as Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow : GAAP Net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for capital expenditures. Non-GAAP Adjusted Free Cash Flow : Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow plus cash payments made for integration, transition, and other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures, additional expense as a result of Term Loan debt refinancing, pension contribution, and additional income tax payments associated with divestitures.
