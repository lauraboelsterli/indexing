FILE PHOTO: A logo of insurer Axa is seen at the entrance of the company's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\nThe product, which will be launched initially in France, will offer insurance protection for drivers that use the BlaBlaCar service, with no excess charged for damage that may occur whilst carpooling.\nBlaBlaCar, which was founded in Paris in 2006, describes itself as the worldâ€™s largest carpooling community.\nBlaBlaCar is among several new firms challenging traditional carmakers and transport companies alike.\nSuch companies include the likes of Uber [UBER.UL] and Avis-owned ( CAR.O ) ZipCar, which offer access to self-drive vehicle fleets for as little as an hour at a time.
