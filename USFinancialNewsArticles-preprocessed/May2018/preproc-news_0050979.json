    "text": "SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Japanese retailer Muji has been fined 200,000 yuan ($31,300) in Shanghai for using packaging that lists Taiwan as a country, underscoring China’s growing sensitivity to how companies refer to the self-ruled island.\nMuji, which is owned by Ryohin Keikaku Co, imported 119 clothes hangers from Japan last year in packaging that marked Taiwan as the “country of origin”, the Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce said in a statement.\nThis violated Chinese advertising law which warns against hurting China’s dignity and interest, said the statement, which was published last month but reported by Chinese media on Wednesday.\nMuji did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\nThe regulator said Muji had since changed the packaging and made corrections. ($1 = 6.3875 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n ",
