    "text": "0 COMMENTS Julie Schiffman, Pfizers vice president of business analytics Photo: Pfizer Inc.\nPfizer Inc.’s recently-built analytics platform is helping employees from different divisions within the company collaborate in an effort to identify patients with rare diseases that might previously have gone undiagnosed, company executives said.\nWith the help of machine-learning algorithms, the analytics platform is now yielding new insights that were previously difficult to identify in a short amount of time because there too many disparate datasets to sift through.\nThe cloud-based Virtual Analytics Workbench tool officially launched in 2017 and more than 350 employees are using it including mainly data analysts and research and development teams. The goal is to scale it more broadly across different departments.\n“While data science is a critical skill set in our company, you don’t need a mathematician or data science expert to use (it),” said Jeff Keisling, Pfizer’s chief information officer, in an email. It also gives analysts “more time to pursue insights versus finding them,” he said.\nA screenshot of the Virtual Analytics Workbench tool, developed by Pfizer and vendors including Alation Inc. Photo: Alation Inc.\nThe idea for the analytics tool came about in 2014 when Pfizer was beginning to explore different capabilities around health care and technology at a time when data was proliferating, said Julie Schiffman, Pfizer’s vice president of business analytics.\n“Data has become an extremely powerful currency for any company, and what we were finding is the data was very fragmented,” Ms. Schiffman said.\nBack then, the company did not have one platform that could support searching, analyzing and visualizing different types of structured and unstructured data, including physician notes, lab reports, demographics and comorbidities — which refers to the presence of more than one disease occurring simultaneously in a patient.\nSuch data points can number in the millions. In one example, the tool is being used to explore those types of data and, using machine learning algorithms, build models to potentially identify patients with a rare form of heart failure called transthyretin cardiomyopathy, Ms. Schiffman said. This type of disease often goes undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to other forms of heart failure.\nUltimately, the findings could be used to educate physicians about how to best identify transthyretin cardiomyopathy in a patient or how to identify patients at risk of the disease, she said. The tool could also eventually be used to find patients that would be good candidates for clinical trials, she said.\nThe platform was built by Pfizer using collaborative data science software tools from Alation Inc. and Daitaku, as well as data visualization software from Tableau Software Inc.\nIt took about two years to get the tool up and running, in part because Pfizer and the vendors had to spend time locating the data, figuring out who had administrative privileges to the existing data sources, and deciding which data sources to integrate, said Satyen Sangani, CEO of Alation. A lot of time was also spent training Pfizer employees on how to use the tool, he said.\nAlation crawled through more than one million different data sources to discover potentially useful information based on how Pfizer analysts had used and trusted data in the past, Mr. Sangani said.\nShare this: ANALYTICS Jeff Keisling PFIZER Previous Oracle to Launch Internet 'Weather Map'",
