    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 3:27 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Tottenham must celebrate Champions League qualification, says Pochettino Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino said the club should be in a celebratory mood after securing a Champions League place for the third successive season despite another trophyless campaign. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg - Tottenham Hotspur vs Juventus - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - March 7, 2018 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo\nThe north London club have guaranteed a top-four Premier League finish ahead of Sunday’s final match against Leicester City, but once again failed to pick up any silverware.\nAfter suffering an FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester United and exiting this season’s Champions League at the hands of Juventus in the last 16, Tottenham’s fans have endured a 10th consecutive year without winning a major trophy.\nPochettino, however, says the club should celebrate what they have achieved.\n“At Tottenham, we have always had that feeling that what we have done is not enough,” he told reporters.\n“In the last three years we have achieved massive things at this football club, like playing in the Champions League, but we never celebrate.\n“So this time I am going to celebrate with my staff. It is not enough, because we want to win trophies and titles, but in football, winning titles is not the only thing - even though this group of people and fans deserve some trophies.”\nTottenham will assess the fitness of fullback Kieran Trippier before they face ninth-placed Leicester at Wembley.\nThe 27-year-old England international twisted a knee during their 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Wednesday.\nDefender Serge Aurier (hamstring) and central midfielder Mousa Dembele (ankle) are also a doubt for the weekend.
