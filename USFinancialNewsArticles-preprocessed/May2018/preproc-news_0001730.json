    "text": "Solidifies Industry Leading Position Through Accretive Acquisition of GCI\nHONG KONG, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Seaspan Corporation (\"Seaspan\") (NYSE: SSW) announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Financial Metrics\nTotal revenues of $224.8 million.\nReported net earnings of $67.7 million.\nEarnings per diluted share of $0.37.\nNormalized earnings per diluted share (1) of $0.13.\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders (1) of $65.5 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) of $135.2 million.\n(1) Refer to \"Description of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for definitions of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nHighlights\nCompleted accretive acquisition with an implied enterprise value of $1.6 billion of the remaining 89% that Seaspan did not own of Greater China Intermodal Investments LLC (\"GCI\"). Secured a total of $500 million in capital from affiliates of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (\"Fairfax\"), with $250 million received during the quarter and $250 million to be funded in January 2019. Achieved vessel utilization of 96.8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nBing Chen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Seaspan, commented, \"The completion of the GCI acquisition during the first quarter solidified our industry leading position and achieved a number of important strategic objectives for the Company while being accretive to earnings per share. On the strategic side, the acquisition of GCI improved our fleet composition as we increased our exposure to larger, more modern containerships that are in demand by our customers. In addition, we expanded our relationships with our customers, significantly increasing our contracted future revenue and EBITDA. Finally, the GCI acquisition provided an opportunity for Seaspan to expand its partnership with Fairfax and other financing partners, reinforcing the strength of our integrated platform.\"\nMr. Chen continued, \"Over the past few months, we have made significant progress across multiple areas within the Company. We continue to remain focused on operational excellence by providing best in class integrated solutions and service to our customers. Importantly, our industry remains fragmented, and we are actively seeking opportunities to grow our business and improve our returns on invested capital. In doing so, we remain disciplined in evaluating and executing on growth opportunities in order to generate long term shareholder value.\"\nSummary of Key Financial Results (in thousands of US dollars):\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n224,776\n$\n201,321\nReported net earnings\n$\n67,716\n$\n40,023\nNormalized net earnings (1)\n$\n35,304\n$\n31,829\nEarnings per share, basic and diluted\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.22\nNormalized earnings per share, diluted (1)\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.15\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders (1)\n$\n65,536\n$\n60,312\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n135,166\n$\n119,336\n(1)\nThese are non-GAAP financial measures.

The vessel was constructed at HHIC-PHIL Inc. and commenced a 17-year fixed-rate bareboat charter with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A. (\"MSC\"). Upon completion of the bareboat charter period, MSC is obligated to purchase the vessel for a pre-determined amount. This delivery was financed with a previously committed lease facility.\nVessel Purchases and Maersk Time Charters\nIn February 2018, Seaspan purchased two second-hand 2500 TEU vessels and entered into fixed-rate time charter agreements for the vessels with Maersk Line A/S. Each of the time charters is for a term of four years with options for up to an additional two years at increasing charter rates.\nFairfax Investments\nIn February 2018, Fairfax invested $250.0 million in Seaspan in exchange for debentures bearing 5.5% interest and Class A common share purchase warrants.\nIn March 2018, Fairfax entered into definitive agreements for an additional $250.0 million investment in Seaspan in exchange for debentures bearing 5.5% interest and Class A common share purchase warrants, which will be funded in January 2019 subject to customary closing conditions.\nAcquisition of Greater China Intermodal Investments LLC\nOn March 13, 2018, Seaspan acquired the remaining 89% of GCI that it did not own from affiliates of The Carlyle Group and the minority owners of GCI.\nDebt Financing\nIn March 2018, Seaspan entered into a secured credit facility for $100.0 million. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin and is secured by 11 previously unencumbered vessels currently owned by Seaspan.\nSubsequent Events\nDividends\nIn April 2018, Seaspan declared quarterly dividends on its common and preferred shares for the first quarter of 2018 totaling $35.4 million. The annual rate of the Series F preferred shares dividend increased to 10.5% on January 1, 2018.\nChanges in Senior Management\nIn April 2018, David Spivak, Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") of Seaspan, gave notice that he is exercising his right to terminate his employment with Seaspan effective June 29, 2018 to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Spivak will continue in his current role until May 5, 2018, after which Mr. Ryan Courson will be appointed CFO and Mr. Spivak will continue with Seaspan as Special Advisor to the President and Chief Executive Officer through the end of June.\nIn April 2018, Mark Chu, General Counsel and Chief Operating Officer of Seaspan, gave notice that he plans to terminate employment with Seaspan effective August 31, 2018 to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Chu will remain in his current roles until successors are appointed, and will continue with Seaspan through to the end of August to help facilitate a seamless transition.\nVessel Financing\nIn April 2018, Seaspan entered into a secured term loan facility for up to $120.0 million to finance two 10000 TEU vessels which are scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2018. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin.\nResults for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nAt the beginning of 2018, Seaspan had 89 vessels in operation. Seaspan accepted delivery of one 11000 TEU vessel, acquired two 2500 TEU vessels, and acquired 16 operating vessels as part of the acquisition of GCI (10 x 10000 TEU vessels and 6 x 14000 TEU vessels), bringing its operating fleet to a total of 108 vessels as at March 31, 2018. Revenue is determined primarily by the number of operating days, and ship operating expense is determined primarily by the number of ownership days.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n2018\n2017\nDays\n%\nOperating days (1)\n7,777\n7,255\n522\n7.2%\nOwnership days (1)\n8,030\n7,917\n113\n1.4%\nThe following table summarizes Seaspan's vessel utilization for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nVessel Utilization:\nOwnership Days (1)\n8,030\n7,917\nLess Off-hire Days:\nScheduled Off-hire\n(104)\n—\nUnscheduled Off-hire (2)\n(149)\n(662)\nOperating Days (1)\n7,777\n7,255\nVessel Utilization\n96.8%\n91.6%\n(1)\nOperating and ownership days include leased vessels and exclude vessels under bareboat charter.\n(2)\nUnscheduled off-hire includes days related to vessels being off-charter.\nThe following table summarizes Seaspan's consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nFinancial Summary\n(in millions of US dollars)\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n224.8\n$\n201.3\nShip operating expense\n49.5\n45.6\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n53.9\n49.9\nGeneral and administrative expense\n7.3\n7.5\nOperating lease expense\n31.2\n26.5\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees\n39.0\n28.5\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\n(19.3)\n3.4\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by 11.7% to $224.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the addition of 16 operating vessels from the acquisition of GCI on March 13, 2018, interest income from leasing five bareboat charter vessels to MSC, and the full-year impact of the delivery of one 14000 TEU vessel in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the sale of four 4250 TEU vessels in 2017.\nThe increase in operating days and the related financial impact thereof for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, relative to the same period in 2017, is attributable to the following:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nOperating\nDays Impact\n$ Impact\n(in millions\nof US dollars)\n2018 vessel deliveries\n92\n$\n0.8\nFull period contribution for 2017 vessel delivery\n90\n4.1\nAddition of vessels from acquisition of GCI\n288\n9.8\nChanges in daily charter hire rates and re-charters\n—\n(0.7)\nUnscheduled off-hire\n513\n4.2\nScheduled off-hire\n(104)\n(1.8)\nVessel disposals\n(357)\n(0.5)\nInterest income from leasing\n—\n8.8\nOther\n—\n(1.2)\nTotal\n522\n$\n23.5\nVessel utilization increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to fewer unscheduled off-hire days.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Seaspan completed dry-dockings for five 2500 TEU vessels, one 3500 TEU vessel and one 4250 TEU vessel, one of which occurred while the vessel was off-charter.\nShip Operating Expense\nShip operating expense increased by 8.6% to $49.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in ownership days from vessel deliveries and acquisitions, and higher spending on spares and repairs from planned maintenance of vessels 8500 TEU and less in size.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.0% to $53.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the addition of vessels from the GCI acquisition and an increase in the number of vessels which dry-docked during the quarter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by 2.9% to $7.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense.\nOperating Lease Expense\nOperating lease expense increased by 17.7% to $31.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the delivery of one vessel in 2017 that was financed through a sale-leaseback transaction and an increase in LIBOR.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Fees\nThe following table summarizes Seaspan's borrowings:\n(in millions of US dollars)\nAs at March 31,\n2018\n2017\nLong-term debt, excluding deferred financing fees\n$\n3,714.9\n$\n2,807.4\nLong-term obligations under capital lease, excluding\ndeferred financing fees\n684.8\n492.4\nTotal borrowings\n4,399.7\n3,299.8\nLess: Vessels under construction\n(80.6)\n(310.4)\nOperating borrowings\n$\n4,319.1\n$\n2,989.4\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees increased by $10.5 million to $39.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the borrowings related to the delivery of five 11000 TEU vessels on bareboat charters, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of GCI, an increase in LIBOR, and additional interest from the debentures issued to Fairfax.\nChange in Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe change in fair value of financial instruments resulted in a gain of $19.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and was primarily due to an increase in the forward LIBOR curve.\nUnencumbered Assets\nSeaspan currently has 12 unencumbered vessels in its operating fleet, consisting of 2 x 2500 TEUs, 2 x 3500 TEUs, 6 x 4250 TEUs, and 2 x 9600 TEUs.\nAbout Seaspan\nSeaspan provides many of the world's major shipping lines with creative outsourcing alternatives to vessel ownership by offering long-term leases on large, modern containerships combined with industry-leading ship management services. Seaspan's operating fleet consists of 112 containerships representing a total capacity of over 900,000 TEUs, including four newbuilding containerships on order scheduled for delivery to Seaspan by mid-2018. Seaspan's current operating fleet of 108 vessels has an average age of approximately six years and an average remaining lease period of approximately five years, on a TEU-weighted basis.\nSeaspan has the following securities listed on The New York Stock Exchange:\nSymbol\nDescription\nSSW\nClass A common shares\nSSW PR D\nSeries D preferred shares\nSSW PR E\nSSW PR G\nSSW PR H\nSeries E preferred shares\nSeries G preferred shares\nSeries H preferred shares\nSSWN\n6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2019\nSSWA\n7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2027\nConference Call and Webcast\nSeaspan will host a conference call and webcast presentation for investors and analysts to discuss its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on May 3, 2018 at 5:30 a.m. PT / 8:30 a.m. ET.

Cash Available for Distribution to Common Shareholders\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders is defined as net earnings adjusted for depreciation and amortization, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees, share-based compensation, change in fair value of financial instruments, bareboat charter adjustment, expenses related to customer bankruptcy, acquisition-related gain on contract settlement, amortization of deferred gain, dry-dock reserve adjustment, cash dividends paid on preferred shares, interest expense at the hedged rate, and certain other items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance.\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders is a non-GAAP measure used to assist in evaluating Seaspan's ability to make quarterly cash dividends before reserves for replacement capital expenditures. Cash available for distribution to common shareholders is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP. In addition, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet earnings\n$\n67,716\n$\n40,023\nAdjust:\nDepreciation and amortization\n53,925\n49,946\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees\n38,981\n28,468\nShare-based compensation\n627\n1,844\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(19,145)\n3,503\nBareboat charter adjustment, net (2)\n2,105\n—\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (3)\n—\n1,013\nAcquisition-related gain on contract settlement (4)\n(2,430)\n—\nAmortization of deferred gain (5)\n(5,554)\n(4,919)\nDry-dock reserve adjustment\n(7,352)\n(5,311)\nCash dividends paid on preferred shares:\nSeries D\n(2,500)\n(2,475)\nSeries E\n(2,793)\n(2,769)\nSeries F\n(2,833)\n(2,433)\nSeries G\n(3,998)\n(3,998)\nSeries H\n(4,442)\n(4,430)\nNet cash flows before interest payments\n112,307\n98,462\nLess:\nInterest expense at the hedged rate (6)\n(46,771)\n(38,150)\nCash available for distribution to common shareholders\n$\n65,536\n$\n60,312\nSEASPAN CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFOR THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n( IN THOUSANDS OF US DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA )\nB. Normalized Net Earnings and Normalized Earnings per Share\nNormalized net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees), expenses related to customer bankruptcy, change in fair value of financial instruments, acquisition-related gain on contract settlement, interest expense at the hedged rate, and certain other items Seaspan believes affect the comparability of operating results.\nNormalized net earnings is a non-GAAP measure that Seaspan believes is a useful measure because it excludes those items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance. Normalized net earnings and normalized earnings per share are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, earnings per share or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP. In addition, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet earnings\n$\n67,716\n$\n40,023\nAdjust:\nInterest expense, excluding amortization of deferred financing fees\n35,934\n25,440\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (3)\n—\n1,013\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(19,145)\n3,503\nAcquisition-related gain on contract settlement (4)\n(2,430)\n—\nInterest expense at the hedged rate (6)\n(46,771)\n(38,150)\nNormalized net earnings\n$\n35,304\n$\n31,829\nLess: preferred share dividends\nSeries D\n2,830\n2,475\nSeries E\n2,793\n2,769\nSeries F\n3,675\n2,433\nSeries G\n3,998\n3,998\nSeries H\n4,442\n4,430\n17,738\n16,105\nNormalized net earnings attributable to common shareholders\n$\n17,566\n$\n15,724\nWeighted average number of shares used to compute\nearnings per share\nReported, basic\n133,998\n106,721\nShare-based compensation\n126\n71\nReported and normalized, diluted (7)(8)\n134,124\n106,792\nEarnings per share:\nReported, basic and diluted\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.22\nNormalized, diluted (9)\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.15\nSEASPAN CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFOR THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n(IN THOUSANDS OF US DOLLARS)\nC. Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings adjusted for interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees, interest income, undrawn credit facility fees, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, expenses related to customer bankruptcy, amortization of deferred gain, bareboat charter adjustment, change in fair value of financial instruments, acquisition-related gain on contract settlement, and certain other items that Seaspan believes are not representative of its operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that Seaspan believes provides useful information to investors in assessing Seaspan's results of operations. Seaspan believes that this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an overall basis. Seaspan also believes that this measure can be useful in comparing its results with those of other companies, even though other companies may not calculate this measure in the same way as Seaspan. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other indicator of Seaspan's performance required to be reported by GAAP.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet earnings\n$\n67,716\n$\n40,023\nAdjust:\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees\n38,981\n28,468\nInterest income\n(1,270)\n(1,172)\nUndrawn credit facility fees\n211\n630\nDepreciation and amortization\n53,925\n49,946\nShare-based compensation\n627\n1,844\nExpenses related to customer bankruptcy (3)\n—\n1,013\nAmortization of deferred gain (5)\n(5,554)\n(4,919)\nBareboat charter adjustment, net (2)\n2,105\n—\nChange in fair value of financial instruments (1)\n(19,145)\n3,503\nAcquisition-related gain on contract settlement (4)\n(2,430)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n135,166\n$\n119,336\nNotes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(1) Change in fair value of financial instruments includes realized and unrealized losses (gains) on Seaspan's interest rate swaps, unrealized losses (gains) on Seaspan's foreign currency forward contracts and unrealized losses (gains) on interest rate swaps included in equity income on investment.\n(2) Certain of Seaspan's vessels are on bareboat charters, which are accounted for as direct financing-type leases. Under these arrangements, the vessels were disposed of and a gross investment in lease was recorded, which is amortized to income through revenue. The bareboat charter adjustment in the applicable non-GAAP measure is included to reverse the GAAP accounting treatment and reflect the transaction as if the vessels had not been disposed of. Therefore, the bareboat charter hire is added back and the interest income from leasing, which is recorded in revenue, is deducted, resulting in a net bareboat charter adjustment. The adjustment relates to five 11000 TEU vessels which commenced 17-year bareboat charters with MSC during 2017 and 2018. Upon completion of the bareboat charter period, MSC is obligated to purchase the vessels for pre-determined amounts.\n(3) Expenses related to customer bankruptcy primarily relates to costs and expenses related to the Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. (\"Hanjin\") bankruptcy in 2016. As of September 1, 2016, after Hanjin declared bankruptcy, no revenue was recognized on the Hanjin charters.\n(4) As part of the acquisition of GCI, a gain was recorded related to the settlement of a favourable ship management contract.\n(5) As of March 31, 2018, 11 vessels have been sold and leased back by Seaspan. For GAAP accounting purposes, the gain on sales was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of operating lease expense over the terms of the leases. As of March 31, 2017, ten vessels had been sold and leased back by Seaspan.\n(6) Interest expense at the hedged rate is calculated as the interest incurred on operating debt at the fixed rate on the related interest rate swaps plus the applicable margin on the related variable rate credit facilities and leases, on an accrual basis. Interest expense on fixed rate borrowings is calculated using the effective interest rate. Interest expense at the hedged rate includes the non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount on the Fairfax notes of $1.0 million.\n(7) Seaspan issued 38,461,539 warrants to Fairfax in February 2018, each exercisable for one Class A common share at an exercise price of $6.50 per share. The effect of these warrants is not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect is anti-dilutive for the period.\n(8) Seaspan's common shares issuable upon conversion of its convertible Series F preferred shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect is anti-dilutive for the period.\n(9) The decrease in normalized earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 is detailed below:\nNormalized earnings per share, diluted - March 31, 2017\n$\n0.15\nExcluding share count changes:\nIncrease in normalized earnings (a)\n0.02\nDecrease from impact of preferred shares\n(0.01)\nShare count changes:\nIncrease in diluted share count (from 106,792,000 shares\nto 134,124,000 shares)\n(0.03)\nNormalized earnings per share, diluted - March 31, 2018\n$\n0.13",
