    "text": "Conference Call Scheduled for Today, May 2, 2018, at 3:45 PM CT (4:45 PM ET)\nRevenues of $55.6 million increased 7% from third quarter last year Net income was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share First patients treated from radial access using Diamondback 360 ® extended length orbital atherectomy device (OAD) 1.0mm Sapphire ® II PRO coronary balloon received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance LIBERTY 360° 18-month outcomes presented at Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) 2018 interventional cardiology conference\nST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI ® ) (NASDAQ: CSII), a medical device company developing and commercializing innovative interventional treatment systems for peripheral and coronary artery disease, today reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter, ended March 31, 2018.\nThe company’s third-quarter revenues were $55.6 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the third- quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin rose to 82.1% from 78.6%. Prior-year gross margin included a $1.5 million charge to cover the costs associated with the voluntary recall and replacement of the company’s 7-10014 Saline Infusion Pump. This charge reduced 2017 third-quarter gross margin by 2.9 percentage points. Operating expenses increased $2.4 million to $45.1 million, driven primarily by the expansion of the sales force with additional clinical specialists, and increased research and development costs.\nThird-quarter net income was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($1.7) million, or ($0.05) per share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.9 million to $3.6 million.\nScott Ward, CSI’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said “CSI sold nearly 18,000 orbital atherectomy devices during the third quarter, putting us on a run-rate to help treat over 70,000 patients with peripheral and coronary artery disease in calendar year 2018. In addition to strong sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, we also successfully executed key operating objectives in manufacturing, product development, clinical research and international expansion.\n“Third-quarter results benefitted from an expanded portfolio of new products, markets and geographies. These drivers illustrate that the transformation of CSI from a single-technology, single-geography company to an innovative leader with worldwide reach is now underway.”\nFirst Patients Treated from Radial Access Using Diamondback 360 ® Extended Length OAD\nOn February 14, CSI announced that the first patients were treated using its FDA-cleared extended length Diamondback 360 ® Peripheral OAD to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD). Dr. Mahir Elder, an interventional cardiologist at the Detroit Medical Center Heart Hospital, and Drs. Ian Cawich and Vasili Lendel, both interventional cardiologists at Arkansas Heart Hospital, treated patients using the new device.\nAdded Ward, “The first procedures using the extended length Diamondback 360 OAD were a milestone for physicians, patients, and our company. When surgery is necessary, PAD lesions can be treated through femoral artery access. However, factors such as obesity, the presence of vascular disease and calcium can complicate femoral access. Radial access allows physicians to reach and treat lower-limb PAD lesions through the radial artery in the wrist, providing an alternative access point and more options to treat complicated and at-risk patients.”\n1.0mm Sapphire ® II PRO Coronary Balloon Received FDA Clearance\nOn March 1, CSI announced that the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the OrbusNeich ® 1.0mm Sapphire ® II PRO coronary balloon, the smallest coronary balloon available in the United States.\nIn January, CSI announced it is the exclusive U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. OrbusNeich is a globally recognized corporation with established balloon technologies in both percutaneous coronary intervention and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\n“As physicians, we have continued to advance techniques and expand access to interventional cardiology procedures. As a result, the patients we are treating today have become increasingly complex, with more challenging lesions and anatomy, and with more difficult clinical indications,” according to David E. Kandzari, M.D., Director of Interventional Cardiology and Chief Scientific Officer, Piedmont Heart Institute, Atlanta, GA, and principal investigator for the Sapphire II PRO U.S. Clinical Study. “With its exceptionally low profile and deliverability, the Sapphire II PRO is an important new tool to enable us to better treat the patients we serve.”\nLIBERTY 360° 18-Month Outcomes Presented at CRT\nOn March 6, Dr. William Gray, interventional cardiologist at Lankenau Heart Institute in Wynnewood, Pa. presented 18-month outcomes from CSI’s LIBERTY 360° study at CRT in Washington, D.C. The study evaluates the acute and long-term clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including CSI’s orbital atherectomy system, in treating PAD.\nDr. Gray’s presentation highlighted the continued high freedom from (FF) 18-month Major Adverse Events (MAE) in Rutherford Classifications (RC) 2-3 (76.9%) and RC4-5 (68.2%). Even when considering advanced disease in RC6, MAEs are not driven by major amputation (FF 81.7%). In addition, quality of life improved significantly from baseline to 18 months in all RC arms of the LIBERTY study.\nIn his presentation, Dr. Gray also noted that an orbital atherectomy sub analysis of the LIBERTY data indicated high freedom from major amputation in all Rutherford Classes (RC2-3, 100%; RC4-5, 95.3%; and RC6, 91.3%). Primary amputation is not necessary in RC6 as peripheral vascular intervention can be successful in this patient population.\nFiscal 2018 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Outlook and Commentary\nWard said, “We enter the fourth quarter with momentum and confidence. Our expanded portfolio of products improves our access to cases and builds on CSI’s relevancy in cath labs treating patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery disease. Internationally, we anticipate that fourth quarter revenue will include a planned stocking order of approximately $900,000 to support the launch of the Diamondback System in Japan. In total, continued revenue growth and financial discipline is forecasted to produce record revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter.”\nFor the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter ending June 30, 2018, CSI anticipates:\nRevenue in a range of $57.5 million to $59.0 million; Gross profit as a percentage of revenues of about 81.0%; Operating expenses of approximately $45.0 million; Net income in the range of $1.7 million to $2.6 million, or net earnings per diluted share ranging from $0.05 to $0.08, assuming approximately 33.7 million average shares outstanding; and Positive Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdded Ward, “Based on reported year-to-date revenue and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we now expect fiscal year 2018 revenues to be in the range of $215.4 million to $216.9 million.”\nConference Call Today at 3:45 p.m. CT (4:45 p.m. ET)\nCardiovascular Systems, Inc. will host a live conference call and webcast of its fiscal third-quarter results today, May 2, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. CT (4:45 p.m. ET).

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in tables later in this release immediately following the consolidated statements of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for CSI's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)\nAs many as 18 million Americans, most over age 65, suffer from PAD, which is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries reducing blood flow. Symptoms include leg pain when walking or at rest. Left untreated, PAD can lead to severe pain, immobility, non-healing wounds and eventually limb amputation. With risk factors such as diabetes and obesity on the rise, the prevalence of PAD is growing at double-digit rates.\nMillions of patients with PAD may benefit from treatment with orbital atherectomy utilizing the Stealth 360 ® and Diamondback 360 ® Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Systems, minimally invasive catheter systems developed and manufactured by CSI. These systems use a diamond-coated crown, attached to an orbiting shaft, which sands away plaque while preserving healthy vessel tissue — a critical factor in preventing reoccurrences. Balloon angioplasty and stents have significant shortcomings in treating hard, calcified lesions. Stents are prone to fractures and high recurrence rates, and treatment of hard, calcified lesions often leads to vessel damage and suboptimal results.\nAbout Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\nCAD is a life-threatening condition and a leading cause of death in men and women in the United States. CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, 16.3 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with CAD, the most common form of heart disease. Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year. According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).\nAbout Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.\nCardiovascular Systems, Inc., based in St. Paul, Minn., is a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for treating vascular and coronary disease. The company’s Orbital Atherectomy Systems treat calcified and fibrotic plaque in arterial vessels throughout the leg and heart in a few minutes of treatment time, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. The U.S. FDA granted the first 510(k) clearance for the use of the Orbital Atherectomy System in peripheral arteries in August 2007. In October 2013, the company received FDA approval for the Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System. To date, over 373,000 of CSI’s devices have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.

This release also references Gross Margin as adjusted to exclude recall charges.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in the following tables. In addition, an explanation of the manner in which CSI's management uses these measures to conduct and evaluate its business, the economic substance behind management's decision to use these measures, the substantive reasons why management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors, the material limitations associated with the use of these measures and the manner in which management compensates for those limitations is included following the reconciliation tables.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 365 $ (1,749 ) $ (2,025 ) $ (2,564 ) Less: Other (income) and expense, net 91 (28 ) 388 (46 ) Less: Provision for income taxes 33 18 99 66 Income (loss) from operations 489 (1,759 ) (1,538 ) (2,544 ) Add: Stock-based compensation 2,140 2,403 7,880 8,336 Add: Depreciation and amortization 990 1,044 3,080 3,100 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,619 $ 1,688 $ 9,422 $ 8,892 Gross Profit and Gross Margin (Excluding Recall Charges)\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nGross profit $\n45,618\n$ 41,005\nLess: Recall charges ̶\n1,505 Gross Profit (excluding recall charges)\n$ 45,618 $ 42,510\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nGross margin 82.1%\n78.6% Less: Recall charges as percentage of net revenues ̶\n2.9% Gross Margin (excluding recall charges) 82.1%\n81.5% Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by CSI and Usefulness of Such Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors\nCSI uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believes this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock based compensation. CSI's management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in CSI's business, assess the performance of CSI's core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate CSI's performance period over period and in relation to its competitors' operating results. Additionally, CSI's management is evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.\nCSI believes that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by CSI's management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see CSI's results \"through the eyes\" of management. CSI also believes that providing this information better enables CSI's investors to understand CSI's operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by CSI's management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:\n-- Stock-based compensation. CSI excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement. CSI's management also believes that excluding this item from CSI's non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand the application of stock-based compensation guidance and its impact on CSI's operational performance, liquidity and its ability to make additional investments in the company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in CSI's financial statements.\n-- Depreciation and amortization expense. CSI excludes depreciation and amortization expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by CSI's management to assess the core profitability of CSI's business operations. CSI's management also believes that excluding these items from CSI's non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand CSI's operational performance, liquidity and its ability to make additional investments in the company.\nIn addition, CSI uses Gross Margin as adjusted to exclude recall charges in this release. CSI excludes certain one-time charges and costs from this item primarily because such expenses are not ongoing and recurring expenses. CSI’s management believes that excluding these expenses is useful to investors to understand CSI’s core operational performance for the periods presented.\nMaterial Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in which CSI Compensates for these Limitations\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for CSI's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations associated with CSI's use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:\n-- Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect CSI's cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to CSI and are not reflected in CSI's \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.\n-- Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than CSI, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n-- CSI's management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures CSI uses. CSI compensates for these limitations by relying primarily upon its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. CSI provides full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure.\n-- CSI uses and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. CSI encourages investors to review these reconciliations. CSI qualifies its use of non-GAAP financial measures with cautionary statements as set forth above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006078/en/\nCardiovascular Systems, Inc.\nJack Nielsen, 651- 202-4919\nj.nielsen@csi360.com\nor\nPadilla\nMatt Sullivan, 612-455-1709\nmatt.sullivan@padillaco.com\nSource: Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.",
