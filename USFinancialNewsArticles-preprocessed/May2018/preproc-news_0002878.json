    "text": "DALLAS, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) (\"Ashford Trust\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results and performance measures for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The performance measurements for Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Hotel EBITDA are comparable assuming each of the hotel properties in the Company's hotel portfolio as of March 31, 2018 were owned as of the beginning of each of the periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, all reported results compare the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the first quarter March 31, 2017 (see discussion below). The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW\nOpportunistic focus on upper upscale, full-service hotels Targets moderate debt levels of approximately 55 - 60% net debt/gross assets Highly-aligned management team and advisory structure Attractive dividend yield of approximately 6.8% Targets cash and cash equivalents at a level of 25 - 35% of total equity market capitalization for the purposes of: working capital needs at property and corporate levels hedging against a downturn in the economy or hotel fundamentals being prepared to pursue accretive investments or stock buybacks as those opportunities arise\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $36.9 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the quarter Comparable RevPAR decreased 0.2% to $119.92 during the quarter Comparable RevPAR for all hotels not under renovation increased 2.5% to $119.18 during the quarter Adjusted EBITDAre was $95.8 million for the quarter Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was $0.28 per diluted share for the quarter The Company's common stock is currently trading at an approximate 6.8% dividend yield During the quarter, the Company refinanced a mortgage loan on 8 hotels Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced that it had refinanced a mortgage loan on 22 hotels Capex invested during the quarter was $64.0 million\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $4.6 billion. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $3.7 billion of mortgage debt. The Company's total combined debt had a blended average interest rate of 5.8%. After taking into account the recently announced refinancing, the Company's total combined debt had a blended average interest rate of 5.5%.\nOn January 17, 2018, the Company announced that it had refinanced a mortgage loan, secured by eight hotels, with an existing outstanding balance of approximately $377 million. The new loan totals $395 million and has a two-year initial term and five one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 2.92%. This refinancing is expected to result in annual interest savings of approximately $6.8 million as compared to the previous loan terms.\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company announced that it had refinanced a mortgage loan, secured by 22 hotels, with an existing outstanding balance totaling approximately $972 million. The previous mortgage loan that was refinanced was the Highland Pool loan with a final maturity date in April 2021. The new loan totals $985 million and has a two-year initial term and five one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 3.20%. This refinancing is expected to result in annual interest savings of approximately $11 million as compared to the previous loan terms. The next hard debt maturity for the Company is in February 2019.\nDuring and subsequent to the quarter, the Company sold the SpringHill Suites Glen Allen and the SpringHill Suites Centreville for combined gross sales proceeds of $18.4 million.\nPORTFOLIO REVPAR\nAs of March 31, 2018, the portfolio consisted of 119 properties. During the first quarter of 2018, 100 of the Company's hotels were not under renovation. The Company believes reporting its operating metrics for its hotels on a comparable total basis (all 119 hotels) and comparable not under renovation basis (100 hotels) is a measure that reflects a meaningful and focused comparison of the operating results in its portfolio. Details of each category are provided in the tables attached to this release.\nComparable RevPAR decreased 0.2% to $119.92 for all hotels on a 1.0% increase in ADR and a 1.2% decrease in occupancy Comparable RevPAR increased 2.5% to $119.18 for hotels not under renovation on a 0.9% increase in ADR and a 1.6% increase in occupancy\nHOTEL EBITDA MARGINS AND QUARTERLY SEASONALITY TRENDS\nThe Company believes year-over-year Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin comparisons are more meaningful to gauge the performance of the Company's hotels than sequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Given the substantial seasonality in the Company's portfolio and its active capital recycling, to help investors better understand this seasonality, the Company provides quarterly detail on its Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin for the current and certain prior-year periods based upon the number of hotels in the Company's portfolio as of the end of the current period. As the Company's portfolio mix changes from time to time so will the seasonality for Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin. The details of the quarterly calculations for the previous four quarters for the 119 hotels are provided in the table attached to this release.\nCOMMON STOCK DIVIDEND\nOn March 15, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per diluted share for the Company's common stock for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, payable on April 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018.\n\"Year-to-date, we have completed two significant refinancings, which are a continuation of our ongoing debt capital market strategies to create shareholder value,\" commented Douglas A. Kessler, Ashford Trust's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities and remain committed to maximizing value for our shareholders.\"\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL AND SIMULCAST\nAshford Hospitality Trust, Inc. will conduct a conference call on Friday May 4, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is (719) 325-2312. A replay of the conference call will be available through Friday, May 11, 2018, by dialing (719) 457-0820 and entering the confirmation number, 7383959.\nThe Company will also provide an online simulcast and rebroadcast of its first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. The live broadcast of Ashford Hospitality Trust's quarterly conference call will be available online at the Company's web site, www.ahtreit.com on Friday, May 4, 2018, beginning at 11:00 a.m. ET. The online replay will follow shortly after the call and continue for approximately one year.\nSubstantially all of our non-current assets consist of real estate investments secured by real estate. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance, which are not measures of operating performance under GAAP, to assist in evaluating a real estate company's operations. These supplemental measures include FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA. FFO and EBITDAre are computed in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to how these measures reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definitions or that interpret the NAREIT definitions differently than us. None of FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, or Hotel EBITDA represents cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to a) GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor are such measures indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. However, management believes FFO, AFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Hotel EBITDA to be meaningful measures of a REIT's performance and should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of our operating performance.\nAshford Hospitality Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing opportunistically in the hospitality industry in upper upscale, full-service hotels.\nAshford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community. The Ashford App is available for free download at Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store by searching \"Ashford.\"\nCertain statements and assumptions in this press release contain or are based upon \"forward-looking\" information and are being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements in this press release may include, among others, statements about the Company's strategy and future plans. These are subject to risks and uncertainties. When we use the words \"will likely result,\" \"may,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" or similar expressions, we intend to identify . Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are outside Ashford Trust's control.\nThese are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation: general volatility of the capital markets and the market price of our common stock; changes in our business or investment strategy; availability, terms and deployment of capital; availability of qualified personnel; changes in our industry and the market in which we operate, interest rates or the general economy; our ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, and manage our planned growth, and the degree and nature of our competition. These and other risk factors are more fully discussed in Ashford Trust's filings Commission. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA yield is defined as trailing twelve month EBITDA divided by the purchase price. A capitalization rate is determined by dividing the property's annual net operating income by the purchase price. Net operating income is the property's funds from operations minus a capital expense reserve of either 4% or 5% of gross revenues. Hotel EBITDA flow-through is the change in Hotel EBITDA divided by the change in total revenues. Hotel EBITDA Margin is Hotel EBITDA divided by total revenues. Funds from operations (\"FFO\"), as defined by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") in April 2002, represents net income (loss) computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and net of adjustments for the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nThe included in this press release are only made as of the date of this press release.
