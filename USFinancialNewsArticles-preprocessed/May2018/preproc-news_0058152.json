REUTERS/Michael Dalder\nStadler also told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper that he did not rule out further vehicle recalls.\nAudi said this month it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars, dealing a fresh setback to its parent Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) more than 2-1/2 years after it first admitted to cheating U.S. diesel exhaust tests.\n“We are still running into issues that we report immediately to regulators,” Stadler told the newspaper. “The diesel crisis hasn’t yet ended.”\nAudi’s chairman appealed to workers earlier this year to ignore a media report that Stadler was about to be ousted in an effort to quell further unrest Volkswagen.\nStadler told the newspaper he was not planning to give up.\n“I feel responsibility, and as long as I have the full support of the supervisory board and management, I accept this responsibility to solve the problem and lead the company into the future,” he said.
