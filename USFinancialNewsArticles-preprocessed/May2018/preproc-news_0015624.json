The A$2.85 billion sale followed a series of non-core divestments across Asia.\nSoon after the OnePath sale last year, ANZ had said it would start buying back up to A$1.5 billion of it shares on-market, to begin returning surplus capital.\nBack then, it had also said it would consider further capital management initiatives as it received proceeds of its divestments.\n$1 = 1.3312 Australian dollars Reporting by Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru Editing by Chris Reese and Stephen Coates\nOur ",
