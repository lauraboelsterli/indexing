    "text": "NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClaimsFiler, a FREE shareholder information service, reminds investors that they have only until May 8, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL). Investor losses must relate to purchases of the Company’s shares between August 19, 2016 and August 17, 2017. This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nGet Help\nFoot Locker investors should visit https://www.claimsfiler.com/cases/view-foot-locker-inc-securities-litigation or call to speak to our claim center toll-free at (844) 367-9658.\nAbout the Lawsuit\nOn August 18, 2017, the price of Foot Locker’s shares plummeted following the Company’s disclosure of negative financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, including revenue significantly below expectations, attributed in part to lower same-store sales, that many more stores were being closed than previously announced, and that weaker sales were expected for the rest of the fiscal year.\nAbout ClaimsFiler\nClaimsFiler has a single mission: to serve as the information source to help retail investors recover their share of billions of dollars from securities class action settlements.
