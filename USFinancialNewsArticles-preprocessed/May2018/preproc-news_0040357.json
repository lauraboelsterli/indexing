He will succeed Andrew Bibby who, after 35 years with the company, will retire on 31 December 2018.\nJoining Grosvenor in 2011, Steve O'Connell led Grosvenor's Development team in San Francisco establishing its residential programme there. In 2015 Steve was promoted to Managing Director, Investment to oversee Grosvenor Americas' (GA) Investment and Co-Investment activities throughout the USA and Canada.\nSteve holds an Engineering degree from McGill University and an MBA from the University of California Berkeley - Haas School of Business. Steve is a UC Berkeley Fisher Center Policy Advisory Board member, a member of the Bay Area Council board of directors and one of Urban Land Institute's (ULI) National Mixed Use Development Councils.\nSteve's first action as part of his new role is announcing that James Patillo has been appointed to the Board of Directors of Grosvenor Americas. He will be responsible for all of Grosvenor's development activity in the US and Canada as Chief Development Officer. Joining the Company in 2006 and working both in Calgary and Vancouver, James has excelled in the role of Managing Director of Development, overseeing Grosvenor's North American development pipeline valued at $C3.9b.\nPeter Vernon, Executive Director of Grosvenor Group said :\n'Grosvenor has been active in North America since 1953. It represents a significant part of our business which under Andrew's leadership has gone from strength to strength. Steve O'Connell appointment is yet a further example of the strength of Grosvenor Americas' management team and our ability to nurture talent. He is ideally suited to the role on the basis of his track record and ambitious vision for the business' future.'\nSteve O'Connell said : 'I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Grosvenor's strategic growth plan in North America. We operate an established and successful business that is deeply rooted in our local markets, while also benefitting from the experience of our international companies. Andrew has led us through a period of sustained growth over the past 10 years; our development, property portfolio and co-investment teams are all actively engaged in high quality projects in each of our North American markets. Looking forward, our teams are well positioned for growth as we actively seek opportunities which allow us to make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate.'\nAndrew Bibby added : 'As CEO I sought to drive a more active and entrepreneurial approach to Grosvenor Americas that encouraged innovation, talent development and the creation of new revenue opportunities, relying less on passive valuation increases. Today, our development pipeline is healthy at $3.9b and our assets under management are $5.0b; I'm pleased to be retiring on this positive note.'\nNotes to editors\nAbout Grosvenor Americas:\nGrosvenor Americas is an active developer, investor and co-investor across Canada and the USA.
