FILE PHOTO: Philippe Donnet, CEO of the Italian insurance company Generali, is seen before shareholders meeting in Trieste, Italy, April 27, 2017. REUTERS/Remo Casilli\n“(Growth) will be mainly organic but if there are acquisition opportunities that allow us to speed up growth then we will evaluate them,” Donnet said in an interview with la Repubblica’s Affari&Finanza weekly supplement.\nDonnet also said that with regards to acquisitions the group had a “disciplined and opportunistic” approach.\nHe added the group intended to strengthen its position in countries where it already did business but that it also wanted to expand in parts of Asia and Latin America, particularly in Argentina, where it is market leader, and Brazil.\nGenerali is due to present a new business plan at the end of November.
