    "text": "MOSCOW, May 14 (Reuters) - Russian central bank said on Monday it saw gross domestic product in the second quarter expanding by 1-1.4 percent, year-on-year, due to a high base effect in 2017.\nThe central bank also lowered its GDP forecast for the first quarter to 1.3-1.5 percent due to lower economic activity. The central bank also said it didnâ€™t take into account new U.S. sanctions against a number of Russian companies.\nThe central bank said that it saw industrial output at 1.3-1.8 percent in April in year-on-year terms.
