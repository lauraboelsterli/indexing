    "text": "LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign debt rose to the highest level in nearly four weeks on Monday as the country’s 5-Star Movement and League neared a deal to form a government.\nItalian 5-year credit default swaps added 2 basis points (bps) from Friday’s close to widen to 97 bps, according to data from IHS Markit.\nA deal between the two parties would end a 10-week political stalemate, though also bring together two parties with very different election platforms which both want to challenge Europe’s rigid budget rules and boost spending.
