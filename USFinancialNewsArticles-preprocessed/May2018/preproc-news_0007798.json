    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bovie Medical Corporation (NYSEMKT:BVX) (the \"Company\"), a maker of medical devices and supplies and the developer of J-Plasma®, a patented surgical product marketed and sold under the Renuvion™ Cosmetic Technology brand in the cosmetic surgery market, today announced the appointment of Diane I. Duncan, M.D., FACS to the Company’s Medical Advisory Board.\n“Dr. Duncan joins our Medical Advisory Board with over 30 years of experience in private practice as a plastic surgeon,” said Charlie Goodwin, Chief Executive Officer. “An internationally-recognized speaker and educator in plastic surgery, Dr. Duncan has delivered presentations at industry conferences around the world. She has also authored medical journal articles on a variety of subjects in plastic surgery and currently serves as a member of the editorial review board for the Aesthetic Surgery Journal.”\nMr. Goodwin continued “Dr. Duncan’s appointment to our Medical Advisory Board follows the appointment of Dr. Jack Zamora, an oculo-facial plastic surgeon, late last year. With these two important additions, we are pleased to expand the expertise of our Medical Advisory Board to include the field of cosmetic surgery, which is consistent with our strategic focus on this market, and we believe Dr. Duncan and Dr. Zamora will be important advisors to our organization as we continue to develop our clinical and commercial strategy.”\nDr. Duncan obtained her medical degree from the Tulane University School of Medicine. She is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and is a member of several plastic surgery professional societies, including the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ASAPS) and the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS). In addition to these affiliations, Dr. Duncan is a fellow of the American College of Surgeons (ACS).\nAbout Bovie Medical Corporation :\nBovie Medical Corporation is a leading maker of medical devices and supplies as well as the developer of J-Plasma® (marketed and sold under the Renuvion™ Cosmetic Technology brand in the cosmetic surgery market), a patented plasma-based surgical product for cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. J-Plasma/Renuvion technology utilizes a helium ionization process to produce a stable, focused beam of plasma that provides surgeons with greater precision, and minimal invasiveness. The new J-Plasma/Renuvion handpieces with Cool-Coag™ technology deliver the precision of helium plasma energy, the power of traditional monopolar coagulation and the efficiency of plasma beam coagulation - enabling thin-layer ablation and dissection and fast coagulation with a single instrument, minimizing instrument exchange and allowing a surgeon to focus on their patient and their procedures. With Cool-Coag technology, the new J-Plasma/Renuvion handpieces can deliver three distinctly different energy modalities - further increasing the utility and versatility of the system. Bovie Medical Corporation is also a leader in the manufacture of a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, marketed through both private labels and the Company’s own well-respected brands (Bovie®, IDS™ and DERM™) to distributors worldwide. The Company also leverages its expertise through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers.
