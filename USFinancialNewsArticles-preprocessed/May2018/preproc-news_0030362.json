    "text": "NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as weakness in defensive stocks offset trade optimism following U.S. President Donald Trump’s conciliatory remarks toward China’s ZTE Corp, calming the waters amid U.S.-China trade tensions.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 70.1 points, or 0.28 percent, to 24,901.27, the S&P 500 gained 2.57 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,730.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.43 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,411.32.
