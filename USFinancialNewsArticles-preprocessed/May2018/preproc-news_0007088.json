    "text": "May 2 (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has approached Xerox Corp to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the latter's sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nApollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment this week of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc, two companies in which Apollo invested.\nThere is no certainty that Apollo's approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Xerox and Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by Liana B.
