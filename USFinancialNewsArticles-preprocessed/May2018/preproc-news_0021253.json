    "text": "(Reuters) - Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Wednesday unveiled a new approach to white-collar and corporate crime that he said will improve coordination between authorities and other countries, lessen duplicativeness, and modify how penalties are assessed.\nDeputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speaks at a New York City Bar event in New York, U.S., May 9, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton “It is important for us to be aggressive in pursuing wrongdoers. But we should discourage disproportionate enforcement of laws by multiple authorities,” he said during a speech to the New York City Bar White Collar Crime Institute.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
