U.S. first lady Melania Trump walks down the White House colonnade as she arrives for the launch of her \"Be Best\" initiative in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 7, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nSpokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Mrs. Trump, 48, underwent an embolization procedure to treat the kidney condition.”The procedure was successful and there were no complications,” Grisham said. “The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere.”\nPresident Trump was expected to visit her at the hospital, which is located in Bethesda, Maryland, a Washington suburb, a White House official said.\nThe Slovenian-born first lady last week rolled out an agenda for her White House work focused on helping children.
