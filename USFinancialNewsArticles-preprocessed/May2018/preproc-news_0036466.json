    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aevi Genomic Medicine, Inc. (NASDAQ: GNMX) (the \"Company\") announced today financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provided an overview of the Company's recent corporate progress.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results and Corporate Highlights\nFirst quarter highlights include continued advancement and strengthening of the Company's pipeline through a combination of internal programs and external collaborations, with multiple data read-outs anticipated in 2018.\nAEVI-001: The Company continues screening and recruitment efforts for its Phase 2 (ASCEND) clinical trial in the mGluR mutation positive genetic subset of pediatric and adolescent patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to confirm genetic responders to AEVI-001. The primary and secondary endpoints in the trial are the change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-5 Total Score at six weeks and the percentage of subjects who respond as determined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at six weeks. Data from the study are expected by mid-2018.\nAEVI-002: The Company has completed the addition of three new clinical sites and patient screening is underway for its Phase 1b open-label, signal-finding study which will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and short-term efficacy of the Anti-Light Monoclonal Antibody AEVI-002 in diseased patients that have previously failed anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment. The study will be conducted at sites across the United States with the potential to expand to clinical trial sites outside the United States. AEVI-002 will be administered every 14 days at one of two dosage levels: 1.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg for up to eight weeks. The endpoints of the study include endoscopic evaluation, Crohn's Disease Activity Index ratings, and safety. Data from the study are expected by year-end 2018.\nAEVI-005: The Company broadened its relationship with Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK) with an option agreement for the development of an early stage, first-in-class monoclonal antibody (AEVI-005) program targeting an undisclosed ultra-orphan pediatric rare disease. This is the second monoclonal antibody signed in collaboration with KHK and reflects the Company's unique ability to leverage its genetic expertise in rare and orphan pediatric diseases. The Company intends to initiate a preclinical research program during the second quarter of 2018.\n\"We have made great progress during the first quarter and we are diligently working towards important data readouts in 2018 on our most advanced programs – AEVI-001 and AEVI-002,\" said Mike Cola, CEO of the Company. \"While AEVI-001 remains the top priority for the Company with data from the \"ASCEND\" trial expected by mid-year, we are equally enthusiastic about the broadening of our relationship with KHK and in the potential of AEVI-002. We look forward to providing updates throughout the year as we progress towards these key catalysts.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $26.52 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $33.73 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily related to the advancement of its AEVI-001 program. The Company expects the current cash balance to fund operations into early 2019.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.56 million, decreasing from $7.95 million for the same period in 2017 mainly related to decreasing clinical trial/development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2.17 million, decreasing from $2.99 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to decreased costs following the closure of the Company's operations in Israel.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $8.71 million or $0.15 per share, compared with a net loss of $10.92 million or $0.29 per share for the same period in 2017.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nUnaudited\nAudited\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n26,520\n$\n33,729\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n801\n893\nTotal current assets\n27,321\n34,622\nLONG-TERM ASSETS:\nLease deposits\n11\n11\nProperty and equipment, net\n69\n85\nOther long-term assets\n33\n43\nTotal long-term assets\n113\n139\nTotal assets\n$\n27,434\n$\n34,761\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nTrade payables\n$\n1,685\n$\n943\nOther accounts payable and accrued expenses\n3,054\n3,197\nTotal current liabilities\n4,739\n4,140\nTotal liabilities\n4,739\n4,140\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCommon stock - $0.0001 par value; 200,000,000 shares\nauthorized; 59,337,265 shares issued and outstanding at March 31,\n2018; 59,332,265 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017\n$\n6\n$\n6\nAdditional paid-in capital\n246,376\n245,593\nAccumulated deficit\n(223,687)\n(214,978)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n22,695\n30,621\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n27,434\n$\n34,761\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nUnaudited\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n6,561\n$\n7,947\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n2,174\n2,988\nOperating loss\n(8,735)\n(10,935)\nFinancial income\n26\n18\nNet loss\n$\n(8,709)\n$\n(10,917)\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n(0.29)\nWeighted average number of\ncommon stock used in computing\nbasic and diluted loss per share\n59,334,821\n37,108,261\nAbout Aevi Genomic Medicine, Inc.\nAevi Genomic Medicine, Inc. is dedicated to unlocking the potential of genomic medicine to translate genetic discoveries into novel therapies.
