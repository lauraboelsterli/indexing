Management uses these measures along with our GAAP financial statements in order to evaluate our operations results. We believe these additional measures provide users of our financial information additional comparable indicators of our industry, as well as our performance.\nFunds From Operations (FFO) Available to Common Shareholders\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), Funds From Operations (FFO) represents net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property and impairment provisions on depreciable real estate or on investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, plus depreciation and amortization, (excluding amortization of financing costs). Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our computation of FFO available to common shareholders.\nOperating FFO Available to Common Shareholders\nIn addition to FFO available to common shareholders, we include Operating FFO available to common shareholders as an additional measure of our financial and operating performance. Operating FFO excludes acquisition costs and periodic items such as gains (or losses) from sales of land and impairment provisions on land available for development or sale, bargain purchase gains, severance expense, accelerated amortization of debt premiums and gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that are not adjusted under the current NAREIT definition of FFO. We provide a reconciliation of FFO to Operating FFO. FFO and Operating FFO should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income available to common shareholders or as alternatives to cash flow as measures of liquidity.\nWhile we consider FFO available to common shareholders and Operating FFO available to common shareholders useful measures for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance between periods or to compare our performance to different REITs, our computations of FFO and Operating FFO may differ from the computations utilized by other real estate companies, and therefore, may not be comparable. We recognize the limitations of FFO and Operating FFO when compared to GAAP net income available to common shareholders. FFO and Operating FFO available to common shareholders do not represent amounts available for needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations, or other commitments and uncertainties. In addition, FFO and Operating FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends. FFO and Operating FFO are simply used as for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance between periods or to compare our performance to different REITs, our computations of FFO and Operating FFO may differ from the computations utilized by other real estate companies, and therefore, may not be comparable.\nEBITDA re /Adjusted EBITDA/Proforma Adjusted EBITDA\nNAREIT defines EBITDA re as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization and impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments; plus or minus gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and interests in real estate equity investments; and adjustments to reflect our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships for these items. The Company calculates EBITDAre in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA which is EBITDA re net of severance expense, lease termination income, and other non-recurring items. EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Proforma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts for the effect of the acquisition or disposition of properties during the period.\nSame Property Operating Income\nSame Property Operating Income (\"Same Property NOI with Redevelopment\") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance. Same Property NOI with Redevelopment is considered by management to be a relevant performance measure of our operations because it includes only the NOI of comparable properties for the reporting period. Same Property NOI with Redevelopment excludes acquisitions and dispositions. Same Property NOI with Redevelopment is calculated using consolidated operating income and adjusted to exclude management and other fee income, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expense, provision for impairment and non-comparable income/expense adjustments such as straight-line rents, lease termination fees, above/below market rents, and other non-comparable operating income and expense adjustments.\nIn addition to Same Property NOI with Redevelopment, the Company also believes Same Property NOI without Redevelopment to be a relevant performance measure of our operations. Same Property NOI without Redevelopment follows the same methodology as Same Property NOI with Redevelopment, however it excludes redevelopment activity that significantly impacts the entire property, as well as lesser redevelopment activity where we are adding GLA or retenanting a specific space. A property is designated as redevelopment when projected costs exceed $1.0 million, and the construction impacts approximately 20% or more of the income producing property's gross leasable area (\"GLA\") or the location and nature of the construction significantly impacts or disrupts the daily operations of the property. Redevelopment may also include a portion of certain properties designated as same property for which we are adding additional GLA or retenanting space.\nSame Property NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Our method of calculating Same Property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nSource:Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust",
