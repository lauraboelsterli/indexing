    "text": "(Adds forecast, share price, compares with estimates)\nMay 7 (Reuters) - Everbridge Inc on Monday forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, driven by strong demand for its software and services that help alert large groups of people during emergencies.\nShares of the company, which also beat first-quarter revenue estimates and reported a smaller-than-expected loss, rose 3.9 percent to $41.20 in extended trading.\nThe company has benefited as large corporations and government agencies are increasingly looking for faster ways to get the word out on emergencies, so that they can minimize danger to employees during incidents such as natural disasters.\nEverbridge, which is yet to report a profit since going public in 2016, forecast second-quarter revenue between $34 million and $34.3 million.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a revenue of $32.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nChief Executive Officer Jaime Ellertson told Reuters that the company will be in a position to generate profit in two-and-a-half years.\nNet loss widened to $12.3 million, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $6.2 million, or 23 cents share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company lost 17 cents per share, smaller than the analystsâ€™ average estimate of a loss of 20 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 34 percent to $30.5 million, beating estimates of $29.6 million.
