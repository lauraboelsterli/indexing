    "text": "Advertisement ALSO IN THE HEADLINES\n• Birchbox bought out. Hedge fund Viking Global Investors has acquired a majority stake in beauty startup Birchbox after agreeing to invest around $15 million in the business. Co-founder and CEO Katie Beauchamp will stay in charge of the company, which is reportedly millions of dollars in debt. Recode\n• Ashley’s after it. Actor Ashley Judd is suing Harvey Weinstein for allegedly torpedoing her career by spreading “false and malicious statements” regarding her “professionalism as an actor.” The suit, filed Monday, specifically cites reports that Weinstein successfully dissuaded director Peter Jackson and screenwriter Fran Walsh from casting Judd in their Lord of the Rings movies. People\n• Really, Roy Moore? The failed Alabama Senate candidate is now suing three women who accused him of sexual assault and harassment (major reasons why the Republican lost the special election in December). One of the defendants, Leigh Corfman, who said Moore touched her sexually when she was 14, sued Moore for defamation in January. (Is it just me, or is right now a great time to be a lawyer?) USA Today\n• Add it to the list. As if Facebook didn’t have enough on its plate, the company is currently investigating a claim that an engineer used access to Facebook’s data to stalk women online. The situation came to light thanks to a tweet by Jackie Stokes, founder of cybersecurity advisory firm Spyglass Security. The network’s response? ““We have a zero-tolerance approach to abuse, and improper behavior results in termination.” Fortune\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS: Former Twitter M&A executive Jess Verrilli is headed to the Google-backed venture capital firm GV to become the firm’s newest general partner. Cisco is acquiring business intelligence startup Accompany. Founder and CEO Amy Chang will join Cisco as senior vice president in charge of the Collaboration Technology Group. British artificial intelligence company BenevolentAI has appointed Joanna Shields as CEO. She most recently served as the UK Minister for Internet Security & Safety. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n• The jury’s out. While many think Bill Cosby’s guilty verdict is due to the ongoing #MeToo movement, the jury says otherwise. “Not once were race or the #metoo movement ever discussed, nor did either factor into our decision, as implied in various media outlets,” the jury wrote in a statement in the Philadelphia Inquirer . “Simply put, we were asked to assess the credibility of Ms. Constand’s account of what happened to her, and each one of us found her account credible and compelling.” Philadelphia Inquirer\n• Wolf stands her ground . Michelle Wolf, whose stand-up routine at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner has become a subject of national debate, is sticking to her guns. “I wouldn’t change a single word that I said,” she told NPR. “I don’t pull punches. I’m not afraid to talk about things. And, you know, I don’t think they expected that from me. I think they still have preconceived notions of how women will present themselves. And I don’t fit in that box.” NPR\n• Pressured into support? Days after NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was accused of sexual misconduct, dozens of his colleagues—including heavyweights like Rachel Maddow, Mika Brzezinski, Andrea Mitchell and Maria Shriver—signed a letter of support, calling him a “man of tremendous decency and integrity.” Yet not all of those signatures may have been sincere: Page Six reports that some of Brokaw’s coworkers put their John Hancock on the letter out of fear of repercussions if they didn’t.
