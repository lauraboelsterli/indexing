    "text": "May 6, 2018 / 11:33 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Seventeen-year-old dies from gunshot wound in south London - police Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - A 17-year-old boy has died after he was found with a gunshot wound in south London, police said on Sunday, the latest killing in the British capital which has suffered a spike in knife crime this year. Police officers enforce a cordon at the scene where a teenager was found after being shot, on Saturday, in London, Britain May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nThe shooting comes just after U.S. President Donald Trump, who is due to visit Britain on July 13, sparked anger by suggesting to the National Rifle Association that a “once very prestigious” London hospital had become overwhelmed with victims of knife attacks.\nDetectives have launched a murder investigation, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement, after police were called about reports of gunshots on Saturday.\nAt the scene, two women who identified themselves as the victim’s mother and godmother said the boy was called Rhyhiem Barton.
