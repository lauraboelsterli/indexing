Ice Hockey - 2018 IIHF World Championships - Semifinals - Sweden v USA - Royal Arena - Copenhagen, Denmark - May 19, 2018 - Team Sweden celebrate after winning a match. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\nThey will be up against a Swedish team in red-hot form after hammering the United States 6-0 in Saturday’s earlier semi-final.\nThe Swiss took a surprise lead with 1:19 to go in the first period when Tristan Scherwey swept the puck home, and although Bo Horvat struck back for Canada in the second, the Europeans went ahead again with a power-play goal from Gregory Hofmann.

REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\nThe Canadians struggled throughout to break down the dogged Swiss defense and Gaetan Haas administered the coup de grace when he steered in Switzerland’s third goal early in the final period. Slideshow (13 Images)\nColton Parayko threw his side a lifeline with a slapshot from distance with just over two minutes to go, and the Canadians threw everything forward in search of an equalizer, but the Swiss held firm to make the final for the first time since 2013.\nCurrent champions Sweden led 1-0 after a cautious first period in their semi-final but they left their American opponents reeling with a three-goal salvo in the second as Patric Hornqvist and Mattias Janmark netted two goals in 11 seconds.\nThe misery was compounded for the U.S. with Viktor Arvidsson punishing them for taking out goaltender Keith Kinkaid by firing his second goal of the game into an empty net to make it 5-0, and Adrian Kempe added a sixth before the horn sounded.\nThe Americans will be left scratching their heads as to how Swedish goalie Anders Nilsson managed to shut them out, despite facing 41 shots during the 60 minutes.\nCanada will now face the United States in a third-place playoff at Copenhagen’s Royal Arena on Sunday afternoon ahead of the decider between Sweden and Switzerland.
