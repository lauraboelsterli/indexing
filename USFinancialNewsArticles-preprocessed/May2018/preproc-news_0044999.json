    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the central bank will telegraph to markets how it plans to exit from its ultra-easy policy when prospects for hitting its price goal heighten.\nBut he said conditions are not rife yet for the BOJ to debate a specific timing for whittling down its massive stimulus programme.\n“The BOJ won’t end the ultra-easy policy before inflation reaches 2 percent,” Kuroda told parliament.\nReporting by Leika Kihara\n ",
