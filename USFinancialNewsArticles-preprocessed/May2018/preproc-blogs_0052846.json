    "text": "United Continental Holdings has selected former Federal Aviation Administration chief Jane Garvey as board chair, making her the first woman to lead the company's directors, the carrier said on Thursday.\n\"Jane steps into this critical role bringing with her decades of experience as both a leader and pioneer in our industry,\" United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement.\nGarvey's appointment to the non-executive role comes a month after the previous board chairman, Robert Milton, and a director, Laurence Simmons, announced their resignations.\nUnited's executive suite has been plagued by internal turmoil, with chief financial officer Andrew Levy last month stepping down from the role.\nGarvey brings regulatory experience to her new role. She was the first woman to lead the FAA and headed the agency during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.",
