    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ: QUIK) (\"QuickLogic\" or the \"Company\"), a developer of ultra-low power multi-core voice enabled SoCs, embedded FPGA IP, display bridge and programmable logic solutions, today announced that it intends to offer and sell, subject to market and other conditions, shares of its common stock and corresponding warrants to purchase shares of its common stock in an underwritten registered public offering. The Company anticipates that the shares of common stock and corresponding warrants will be sold in combination. The securities to be sold in the proposed offering will be sold by the Company. The proposed offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the final size or terms of the offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the proposed offering for working capital, the development of next generation new products and general corporate purposes. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire and/or license technologies and acquire and/or invest in businesses when the opportunity arises; however, the Company currently has no commitments or agreements and is not involved in any negotiations with respect to any such transactions.\nThere is no established public trading market for the warrants and the Company does not expect a market to develop. Additionally, the Company does not intend to apply for the listing of the warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system.\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group is acting as the sole book-running manager for the proposed offering. Roth Capital Partners is acting as co-manager for the proposed offering.\nThe proposed offering is being made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 16, 2017. A preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus related to the proposed offering have been filed with the SEC and may be obtained by visiting EDGAR on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov , or by contacting Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, 222 South Ninth Street, Suite 350, Minneapolis, MN 55402, by telephone at 612-334-6300, or by email at prospectus@chlm.com . The final terms of the proposed offering will be disclosed in a final prospectus supplement to be filed with the SEC.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in this offering. There shall not be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offering, sale or solicitation would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout QuickLogic\nQuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ: QUIK) enables OEMs to maximize battery life for highly differentiated, immersive user experiences with Smartphone, Wearable and IoT devices.
