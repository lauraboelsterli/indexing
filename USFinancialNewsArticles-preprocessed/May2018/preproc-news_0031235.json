    "text": "May 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has joined lawsuits accusing Insys Therapeutics Inc of paying kickbacks to doctors to prescribe a powerful opioid medication, in an effort to generate more profit.\nAccording to a filing made public on Monday in Los Angeles federal court, the department and six U.S. states intervened in whistleblower litigation against Insys, which has said it had been trying to negotiate a settlement of a federal probe into its marketing of fentanyl-based Subsys.\nThe litigation followed a wave of related criminal cases against medical practitioners and former executives and sales representatives employed by Chandler, Arizona-based Insys, including its billionaire founder John Kapoor.
