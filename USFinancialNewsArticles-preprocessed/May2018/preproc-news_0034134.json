    "text": "GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces shot and killed two Palestinians on Monday during mounting protests along Gazaâ€™s border with Israel, Palestinian health officials said.\nThe deaths of the two men, aged 21 and 29, raised to 47 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire since the protests began on March 30. Israel says its troops have used live ammunition to prevent a border fence from being damaged or breached.\nAt least 35 Palestinians were wounded by live ammunition fired by Israeli soldiers on Monday, the health officials said.\nReporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, Writing by Jeffrey Heller, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
