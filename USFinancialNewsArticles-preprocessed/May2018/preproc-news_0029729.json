But does the EU have the strategic capacity to address it?\nThe EU lost focus on the Western Balkans for much of the last decade. As the wars that followed the disintegration of Yugoslavia ended and the EU was overwhelmed by its own internal challenges, efforts to stabilize the region by bringing it into the EU fold were put on hold. But a summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, this week between EU and Western Balkan leaders—the first since 2003—is an implicit acknowledgment that the lack of attention was a mistake.\nAt the summit, Brussels is expected to offer money to help build infrastructure and transport links to revive the region’s blighted economy. But much of this has been promised before, and the sums are small compared with those lavished on poor countries inside the club.\nThe Latest From Europe File\nLimbo Lingers for the European Union (May 9) U.K.’s Windrush Scandal Highlights Case for Digital ID (May 2) Tough Choices Loom for Theresa May to Meet Brexit Promises (April 30) The key to Brussels’ efforts to bring stability to its neighborhood has always been to dangle the carrot of EU membership, as when it opened its doors to central and Eastern European countries. The EU has stepped up accession negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro, which it says could lead to them joining in 2025 , and may soon start the process with Albania and Macedonia. Yet there are three reasons why the offer of EU membership may not work in the Western Balkans.\nThe first relates to the EU’s insistence that candidate countries settle unresolved border disputes before they can join. This reflects the EU’s unhappy experiences with Cyprus, Slovenia and Croatia, which imported their border disputes into the EU.\nOf all the Balkan border issues, the most urgent and challenging relates to the status of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 . The EU has made clear that Serbia cannot join until it has normalized its relations with Kosovo. In reality, this would require Serbia to recognize Kosovan independence.\nBut a deal over Kosovo looks as elusive as ever. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic last year launched a national dialogue intended to prepare Serbian voters for a compromise. But the U.S. and most European governments have ruled out any redrawing of Kosovo’s borders along ethnic lines as Belgrade is demanding. They argue that any lasting solution lies in creating multiethnic states that respect minority rights.\nMeanwhile, Kosovo has so far failed to establish an association of Serb-majority municipalities as it was required to do under the terms of the Brussels Agreement brokered by the EU in 2013. Without progress on this by Pristina, it is hard to see how any agreement could be reached, even if Belgrade could be persuaded to back down over the borders.\nThe second issue relates to the rule of law. Again, the EU’s position on this has hardened in the light of experience, following what is now widely accepted to have been the mistake of prematurely allowing Bulgaria and Romania to join despite serious and persistent problems with corruption and organized crime.\nMore recent concerns over alleged money-laundering in Latvia and Malta and over judicial reforms in Poland and Hungary have further raised awareness of the vulnerability of the whole EU to deficiencies in the rule of law in member states. As a result, the bar for membership for the Western Balkans will be higher: it won’t be enough for these countries to pass laws and create institutions, they must also be proven to be effective.\nYet no Western Balkan country is close to clearing that bar. In a report in February , the European Commission said the six countries show “clear elements of state capture including links with organised crime and corruption at all levels of government and administration.”\nNewsletter Sign-up Western diplomats question whether the region’s leaders are really ready to pay the political price needed to get into the EU. Belgrade says it is committed to strengthening the rule of law, institutional independence and media freedom. Serbian ministers cite these as more important goals of the accession process than access to EU funds. Yet civil society groups insist that the situation has deteriorated on Mr. Vucic’s watch. Meanwhile, the extreme polarization of Serbian politics hampers any progress toward meaningful change.\nThe third issue relates to public opinion in the Western Balkans and the EU. In Serbia, recent polls suggest support among voters for joining the EU is barely above 50%, while significant elements in Serbian politics would prefer a partnership with Russia. Opposition to EU membership could yet harden if the price was seen to be a humiliating settlement in Kosovo.\nBut securing popular support could be an even bigger challenge in the EU, where enlargement requires ratification by all member states. After all, Dutch voters rejected an EU Association Agreement—which falls short of full accession—with Ukraine, and the parliament of the Belgian region of Wallonia nearly derailed the EU’s free-trade agreement with Canada.\nNo one expects any major breakthrough in Sofia this week. Nonetheless, Western diplomats believe that a window of opportunity exists to bring stability to the region—and that it may not stay open for long. Failure could see the Western Balkans lose hope in European integration. At the least, that risks accelerating the middle-class brain drain, deepening economic and social tensions. At worst, the region risks sliding deeper toward nationalism and even renewed conflict.\nWrite to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nAleksandar Vucic is the president of Serbia.
