REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\nSocGen said it would propose the new terms for Oudea at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting in May 2019.\nIt added that deputy chief executive Bernardo Sanchez Incera would also leave the bank. Incera’s departure follows that of Didier Valet, a deputy chief executive in charge of investment banking, who quit in the middle of the bank’s negotiations with the U.S. authorities over a Libor rigging case.\nSocGen added in its statement that Oudea would be supported by four deputy chief executives, who were all tapped internally.\nDiony Lebot, currently Chief Risk Officer, would be in charge of areas such as compliance, general risk management and finance.\nPhilippe Aymerich, currently CEO of SocGen’s Crédit du Nord unit, will be responsible for the company’s French retail banking activities.\nSeverin Cabannes will overview SocGen’s investment bank, while Philippe Heim, currently Chief Financial Officer, will be in charge of international retail banking activities.
