    "text": "PHOENIX, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: LOPE), a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers over 225 graduate and undergraduate degree programs and certificates across nine colleges both online and on ground at its over 275 acre campus in Phoenix, Arizona, today announced financial results for the 2018.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nNet revenue increased 11.1% to $275.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $248.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. End-of-period enrollment increased 9.6% to 91,378 at March 31, 2018, from 83,352 at March 31, 2017, as ground enrollment increased 9.6% to 17,386 at March 31, 2018, from 15,857 at March 31, 2017 and online enrollment increased 9.6% to 73,992 at March 31, 2018, from 67,495 at March 31, 2017. Operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $90.1 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $76.6 million for the same period in 2017. The operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 32.7%, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2017. The tax rate in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 18.8% compared to 26.5% in the same period in 2017. The lower effective tax rate year over year is a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective January 1, 2018. Additionally, the University continues to benefit from the adoption of the share-based compensation standard, which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or settled in the consolidated income statement. Excess tax benefits recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $5.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the restricted awards vest, our stock price on the date an option is exercised, and the quantity of options exercised. Net income increased 31.8% to $73.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $55.9 million for the same period in 2017. Diluted net income per share was $1.52 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.16 for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.2% to $108.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $92.9 million for the same period in 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe University financed its operating activities and capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily through cash provided by operating activities. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $334.8 million and $242.7 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Our restricted cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $72.8 million and $94.5 million, respectively. In December 2012, we entered into a new credit agreement, which increased our term loan to $100 million with a maturity date of December 2019. Indebtedness under the term loan is secured by our assets and is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $119.0 million as compared to $109.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in cash generated from operating activities between the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased net income and the timing of income tax and employee related payments as well as changes in other working capital such as accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue and student deposits.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $38.5 million and $48.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the purchase of short-term investments and capital expenditures. Purchases of short-term investments net of proceeds of these investments was $3.2 million and $19.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures were $35.2 million and $21.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the three-month period for 2018, capital expenditures primarily consisted of ground campus building projects such as the construction of two additional residence halls, an additional classroom building and parking garage to support our growing traditional student enrollment, as well as purchases of computer equipment, other internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. Included in off-site development for 2018 is $0.2 million we spent on the student services building that is in close proximity to our ground traditional campus. During the three-month period for 2017, capital expenditures primarily consisted of ground campus building projects such as the construction of an additional dormitory to support our growing traditional student enrollment, land acquisitions adjacent to our campus, as well as purchases of computer equipment, other internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. Included in off-site development for 2017 is $7.9 million we spent on the building and parking garage in close proximity to our ground traditional campus. Employees that work in two leased office buildings in the Phoenix area were relocated to this new building by the end of 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $12.8 million and $33.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the three-month period for 2018, $11.5 million was used to purchase common shares withheld in lieu of income taxes resulting from the vesting of restricted share awards and $0.5 million was used to purchase treasury stock in accordance with the University's share repurchase program, and principal payments on notes payable and capital leases totaled $1.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.9 million. During the three-month period for 2017, $25.0 million was used to repay the revolving line of credit, $9.5 million was used to purchase common shares withheld in lieu of income taxes resulting from restricted share awards and principal payments on notes payable and capital leases totaled $1.7 million, which amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.1 million.\n2018 Outlook\nQ2 2018: Net revenue of $235.0 million; Target Operating Margin 23.2%; Diluted EPS of $0.85 using 48.6 million diluted shares; student counts of 80,900\nQ3 2018: Net revenue of $254.0 million; Target Operating Margin 24.9%; Diluted EPS of $0.98 using 48.7 million diluted shares; student counts of 98,400\nQ4 2018: Net revenue of $291.0 million; Target Operating Margin 33.0%; Diluted EPS of $1.47 using 48.9 million diluted shares; student counts of 97,100\nFull Year 2018: Net revenue of $1,055.7 million; Target Operating Margin 28.8%; Diluted EPS of $4.82 using 48.7 million diluted shares\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of resources.

We present Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. We also make certain compensation decisions based, in part, on our operating performance, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, and our loan agreement requires us to comply with covenants that include performance metrics substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA. All of the adjustments made in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA are adjustments to items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. Management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period and does not consider the items for which we make adjustments (as listed above) to be reflective of our core performance.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA allows us to compare our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense, including the impact of write-offs of deferred financing costs when companies refinance their indebtedness), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), the book amortization of intangibles (affecting relative amortization expense), and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of performance.\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments described above. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool in that, among other things it does not reflect:\ncash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements; interest expense, or the cash required to replace assets that are being depreciated or amortized; and the impact on our reported results of earnings or charges resulting from the items for which we make adjustments to our EBITDA, as described above and set forth in the table below.\nIn addition, other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and only use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$ 73,681\n$ 55,912\nPlus: interest expense\n346\n580\nLess: interest income and other\n(981)\n(2)\nPlus: income tax expense\n17,046\n20,138\nPlus: depreciation and amortization\n13,873\n13,193\nEBITDA\n103,965\n89,821\nPlus: royalty to former owner\n74\n74\nPlus: fixed asset impairments\n-\n122\nPlus: transaction expenses\n487\n-\nPlus: estimated litigation and regulatory reserves\n3\n-\nPlus: share-based compensation\n3,469\n2,931\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 107,998\n$ 92,948\nGRAND CANYON EDUCATION, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nASSETS:\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except par value)\n2018\n2017\nCurrent assets\n(Unaudited)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 242,846\n$ 153,474\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n72,816\n94,534\nInvestments\n91,910\n89,271\nAccounts receivable, net\n9,469\n10,908\nIncome tax receivable\n1,329\n2,086\nOther current assets\n16,994\n24,589\nTotal current assets\n435,364\n374,862\nProperty and equipment, net\n950,156\n922,284\nPrepaid royalties\n2,689\n2,763\nGoodwill\n2,941\n2,941\nOther assets\n833\n723\nTotal assets\n$ 1,391,983\n$ 1,303,573\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$ 36,100\n$ 29,139\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n25,013\n23,173\nAccrued liabilities\n26,571\n20,757\nIncome taxes payable\n30,234\n16,182\nStudent deposits\n72,948\n95,298\nDeferred revenue\n64,130\n46,895\nCurrent portion of notes payable\n6,670\n6,691\nTotal current liabilities\n261,666\n238,135\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n1,131\n1,200\nDeferred income taxes, noncurrent\n19,900\n18,362\nNotes payable, less current portion\n58,274\n59,925\nTotal liabilities\n340,971\n317,622\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' equity\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, 10,000 shares authorized;
