    "text": "FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Freedom Bank of Virginia (OTCQX: FDVA), (the “Bank” or “Freedom”), today reported net income of $308,207, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018.\nHighlights for the First Quarter:\nNet income was $308,207, or $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018; Total assets were $511.2 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $21.9 million or 4.1% from December 31, 2017; Loans receivable declined by $10.9 million from December 31, 2017, as the Bank systematically reduced exposure to non-owner occupied Commercial Real Estate loans; Deposits decreased by $21.5 million during the quarter or 4.62% to $444.5 million at March 31, 2018, with most of the reduction occurring in time deposits. The decline in time deposits was in listed deposits which decreased by $6.6 million or 43.1% during the first quarter and in other time deposits that the Bank elected not to retain for relationship reasons; Asset quality remained strong with the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at 0.13% as of March 31, 2018, compared to a ratio of 0.17% as of December 31, 2017; Capital ratios were strong during the first quarter, and above regulatory minimums for well-capitalized banks, with increases in the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, the Tier 1 Capital ratio (based on risk weighted assets), and the Total Capital ratio, compared to December 31, 2017.\nCEO Craig Underhill said, “In the first quarter, the Bank implemented a strategy to bolster its senior management team through the addition of experienced community bank professionals who will help us to enhance core deposit generation and business banking capabilities, and position us for stronger growth.”\nTotal Revenue\nInterest income was $5.66 million in the first quarter of 2018, while interest expense was $1.32 million during the same period. Net interest income (before a provision for loan losses) was $4.34 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Bank had a reduction in loans during the quarter, primarily in the area of commercial real estate (“CRE”), as part of an effort to systematically reduce the risk in the loan portfolio and reduce exposure to non-owner occupied CRE loans. The Bank also made some changes to its Prime Money Market Product, designed to reduce sensitivity of those deposit rates to the Prime rate.\nNon-interest income in the first quarter was $680,394 and total revenue (comprising net interest income and non-interest income) was $5.02 million during the same period. Most of the Bank’s non-interest income is obtained from its mortgage operations. Mortgage revenue was adversely impacted by a tighter inventory of homes in Northern Virginia, which reduced the number of loan applications.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.63 million. Expenses during the first quarter were impacted by higher fees incurred for professional services, as well as additional investments in software and control infrastructure. We expect the fees for professional services to decline over the course of 2018.\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality continued to be strong: non-accrual loans were $557,347 or 0.14% of total loans as of March 31, 2018, compared to $666,125 or 0.17% of total loans as of December 31, 2017 and troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) were $97,895 or 0.02% of total loans as of March 31, 2018, compared to $220,068 or 0.06% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. On March 31, 2018 and on December 31, 2017, there were no loans that were more than 90 days past due that were not on non-accrual and there were no OREO assets on the balance sheet. Total non-performing assets (defined as the sum of loans greater than 90 days past due, non-accrual loans, TDR’s and OREO) were $655,242 or 0.13% of total assets as of March 31, 2018, compared to $886,193 or 0.17% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) was $4.51 million or 1.14% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.56 million or 1.12% of total loans at December 31, 2017.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $511.2 million, compared to $533.1 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $21.9 million during the quarter. Changes in major asset categories were as follows:\nCash and due from banks, Federal Funds sold and interest bearing balances with other banks decreased by $4.97 million compared to December 31, 2017, while available-for-sale securities balances decreased by $2.92 million compared to December 31, 2017, as the Bank reduced exposure to wholesale time deposits. Additionally, total loans declined by $10.9 million as the Bank systematically reduced its exposure to CRE loans during the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities at March 31, 2018 were $456.3 million, a decrease of $21.5 million compared to December 31, 2017. Deposits declined by $21.5 million during the first quarter of 2018 to $444.5 million as of March 31, 2018. Demand deposits decreased slightly by $837,311, savings deposits were flat, while time deposits declined by $20.7 million. The decrease in time deposits resulted from the Bank’s decision to pay off higher cost time deposits at maturity, including $6.6 million of listed deposits. The reduction in deposits during the quarter was related to the Bank’s decision to reduce the risk in the funding base.\nStockholders’ Equity and Capital\nStockholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 was $54.8 million, compared to $55.3 million at December 31, 2017. Additional paid in capital at March 31, 2018 was $53.3 million compared to $53.2 million at December 31, 2017. Accumulated other comprehensive income declined by $806,969 during the quarter, as a result of increased unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, stemming from higher interest rates. The Bank does not intend to sell these securities and expects to hold them to maturity and therefore does not consider any of the securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The book value of the Bank’s common stock at March 31, 2018 was $8.40 per share versus $8.47 per share at December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, all of the Bank’s capital ratios were well above regulatory minimum capital ratios for well capitalized banks. The Bank’s capital ratios as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Total Capital Ratio 14.99% 14.41% Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.87% 13.32% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.87% 13.32% Leverage Ratio 10.64% 10.19% About Freedom Bank\nFreedom Bank is a community-oriented bank with locations in Fairfax, Reston, Chantilly and Vienna, Virginia.
