We had good jump.”\nThe Knights, whose hometown of Sin City stands in stark contrast to the humble streets of Canada’s Winnipeg, are playing with house money after becoming the third expansion team in NHL history to make the playoffs in its first season.\nThe Knights swept the Los Angeles Kings and dispatched the San Jose Sharks in six games to book their ticket to the third round, where they will hope the spectacular play of goalie Marc-Andre Fleury will help quiet the speedy Jets.\n“They’re a fast team and they have a lot of offense for sure,” Vegas forward Jonathan Marchessault said, according to the Las Vegas Sun.\n“They have unbelievable players on that roster and it will definitely be a tough task.” Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by John O'Brien",
