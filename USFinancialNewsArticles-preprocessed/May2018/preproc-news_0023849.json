(NYSE: TIER), a Dallas-based real estate investment trust that specializes in owning and operating best-in-class office properties in select U.S. markets, today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRecognized net income of $0.17 per diluted common share Reported Funds from Operations (FFO) attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted common share Reported FFO, Excluding Certain Items, attributable to common stockholders of $0.40 per diluted common share Recognized Same Store Cash NOI Growth of 3.8% over first quarter 2017 Increased occupancy by 30 basis points to 89.4%\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results,” stated Scott W. Fordham, Chief Executive Officer of TIER REIT. “During the quarter, we exited Baltimore with our sale of 500 East Pratt, we reduced our presence in Houston with the sale of Loop Central, and we downsized our portfolio in Fort Worth with the sale of Centreport Office Center. The capital from these sales was then recycled into our target submarkets, including our acquisition of Domain Point, which represents a strategic 9.5 acre, two-building expansion of The Domain in Austin, as well as the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Domain 8. Today, we own approximately 1.2 million square feet of existing office space in The Domain, which represents over 75% of the total competitive space, and it’s nearly 100% leased to some of today’s top employers and technology firms with a weighted-average lease life approaching eight years.”\n“We announced today that we are furthering The Domain’s status as Austin’s second downtown with our recent commencement of Domain 12, a 320,000 square foot office building expected to deliver in fourth quarter 2019,” continued Mr. Fordham. “With an office micromarket that is short on supply, and a substantial prospective tenant pipeline in excess of 1.3 million square feet, including letters of intent for 170,000 square feet, we believe Domain 12 will continue The Domain’s success and be a key value creation driver for TIER REIT and our stockholders.”\nMr. Fordham continued, “Domain 12 will be the newest and tallest office tower within The Domain and adjacent to our Domain 11 development that topped out last month. Together, we expect these Class AA office buildings to redefine the north Austin skyline and elevate the standards of quality, beauty and sustainability within The Domain.”\nMr. Fordham added, “With positive improvement expected in same store NOI and year end occupancy, we have increased our 2018 guidance to a range between $1.49 and $1.54 per diluted share of FFO, excluding certain items.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net income attributable to common stockholders was $8.4 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, as compared to net income of $98.2 million, or $2.04 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Nareit-defined FFO attributable to common stockholders was $9.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share, as compared to $18.3 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, FFO attributable to common stockholders, excluding certain items, was $19.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, as compared to $19.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nProperty Results\nOur occupancy at March 31, 2018, was 89.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we leased 68,000 square feet, which included 56,000 square feet of renewals, 1,000 square feet of expansions, and 11,000 square feet of new leasing.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we provided rent abatements of approximately $3.9 million to tenants at One & Two Eldridge Place and Three Eldridge Place (collectively known as the “Eldridge Properties”), located in Houston, Texas, as a result of Hurricane Harvey. These rent abatements were offset by approximately $3.3 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received during the quarter and approximately $0.2 million of estimated saved expenses. We anticipate we will receive remaining business interruption insurance proceeds in subsequent quarters.\nReal Estate Activity\nOn January 4, 2018, we acquired a 96.5% initial economic interest in Domain Point. We own a 90% interest in the entity that owns Domain Point. Domain Point is located in Austin, Texas, adjacent to our other Domain office properties and includes two buildings with 240,000 rentable square feet (combined).\nOn February 13, 2018, we sold our 500 East Pratt property for a contract sales price of $60.0 million. 500 East Pratt is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and contains 280,000 rentable square feet.\nOn February 22, 2018, we sold our Centreport Office Center property for a contract sales price of $12.7 million. Centreport Office Center is located in Fort Worth, Texas, and contains 133,000 rentable square feet.\nOn March 27, 2018, we sold our Loop Central property for a contract sales price of $73.0 million. Loop Central is located in Houston, Texas, and contains 575,000 rentable square feet.\nOn March 30, 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in our Domain 8 property for a contract purchase price of $92.8 million, which includes the assumption of $44.9 million of mortgage debt. Domain 8 is located in Austin, Texas, and contains 291,000 rentable square feet.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we announced today that we have commenced development of Domain 12, a 320,000 square foot office building in Austin, Texas. We anticipate delivery by fourth quarter 2019, and will provide periodic leasing updates as construction progresses.\nCapital Markets Activity\nOn January 18, 2018, we amended our existing multi-bank unsecured credit facility. The amendment provides for an increase in total unsecured borrowings under the credit facility from $860 million to $900 million, with the ability to further increase total borrowings by up to an additional $300 million in the aggregate subject to certain requirements. The revolving line of credit was increased to $325 million and the maturity date was extended from December 2018 to January 2022, with the option to extend by one additional year subject to certain conditions and our payment of an extension fee. The amendment also extended the maturity date of the $300 million term loan from December 2019 to January 2025, and had no change to the June 2022 maturity date of the remaining $275 million term loan.\nOn February 7, 2018, our board of directors authorized a distribution of $0.18 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, that was paid on March 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on May 4, 2018, our board of directors authorized a distribution of $0.18 per share of common stock for the second quarter of 2018, payable on June 29, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nWe have revised our 2018 outlook to reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions such as acquisition and disposition activity, rental rates, occupancy levels, operating and general and administrative expenses, weighted average diluted shares outstanding, and interest rates.\nOur original and revised 2018 outlook and assumptions are as follows:\n2018 Outlook Original Revised Projected net loss per basic & diluted common share ($0.15) - ($0.08) ($0.29) - ($0.24) Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization $1.92 $2.02 Gain on remeasurement of investment in unconsolidated entities - ($0.23) Gain on sale of depreciable real estate ($0.55) ($0.25) Projected FFO per diluted common share $1.22 - $1.29 $1.25 - $1.30 Adjustments: Reversal of Fifth Third Center default interest $0.05 $0.05 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1 $0.18\n$0.19 Projected FFO, excluding certain items, per diluted common share $1.45 - $1.52 $1.49 - $1.54 Assumptions used in 2018 outlook above: Dispositions $145mm - $270mm $145mm - $270mm Strategic acquisitions $75mm - $175mm $164mm Same store cash NOI growth 6.5% - 7.5% 7.5% - 8.5% Same store NOI growth 0.5% - 1.5% 1.0% - 2.0% Straight line rent and lease incentive revenue $5.5mm - $6.5mm $5.0mm - $6.0mm Above- and below-market rent amortization $5.5mm - $6.5mm $5.5mm - $6.5mm General & administrative expenses, excluding certain items $21.0mm - $22.0mm $21.0mm - $22.0mm Year-end occupancy 88.5% - 90.5% 89.5% - 91.5% Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 48.5mm 48.5mm 1 Represents the loss from write-off of deferred financing costs upon recast of our credit facility on January 18, 2018\nSupplemental Information\nA copy of our supplemental information regarding our financial results and operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, is available on our Investor Relations website at www.tierreit.com/ir , or by contacting our Investor Relations department by email at ir@tierreit.com .\nUpcoming Events\nWe are scheduled to participate in the annual REITweek investor conference in New York from June 5 through June 7, 2018, sponsored by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit).

These rent abatements were offset by approximately $3.3 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received during the quarter and approximately $0.2 million of estimated saved expenses. We anticipate we will receive remaining business interruption insurance proceeds in subsequent quarters. (1) Interest rate swaps are adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income. However, because our interest rate swaps do not have a LIBOR floor while the hedged debt is subject to a LIBOR floor, the portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps attributable to this mismatch is reclassified to interest rate hedge ineffectiveness expense. We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2018, that eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness expense. (2) We have a non-recourse loan in default which subjects us to incur default interest at a rate that is 500 basis points higher than the stated interest rate. Although there can be no assurance, we anticipate that when this property is sold or when ownership of this property is conveyed to the lender, this default interest will be forgiven.
