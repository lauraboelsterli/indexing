A Fortis hospital building is pictured in New Delhi, India, March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi /Files\nIHH’s latest proposal includes an immediate equity infusion at 175 rupees ($2.63) per share and a subsequent equity infusion at a per share price not exceeding 175 rupees, the company said in a statement.\nLast week, IHH tweaked an earlier bid and offered to immediately infuse 6.50 billion rupees under the binding portion of the proposal and subsequently invest up to 33.50 billion rupees under the non-binding part of the proposal.
