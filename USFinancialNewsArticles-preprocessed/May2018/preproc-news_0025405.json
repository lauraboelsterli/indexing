    "text": "* HK->Shanghai Connect daily quota used 4.2 pct, Shanghai->HK daily quota used -1.2 pct\n* HSI +1.0 pct, HSCE +0.9 pct\nSHANGHAI, May 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished higher on Friday, in line with regional markets, as softer U.S. inflation numbers eased global worries of faster rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, boosting appetite for equities.\n** The Hang Seng index rose 1.0 percent, to 31,122.06, while the China Enterprises Index gained 0.9 percent, to 12,345.30 points.\n** The Hang Seng Index ended the week 4 percent higher, its best performance since mid-February.\n** The index measuring price differences between dual-listed companies in Shanghai and Hong Kong stood at 122.39. A value above 100 indicates Shanghai shares are pricing at a premium to shares in the same company trading in Hong Kong, and vice versa. ** The three biggest gainers in the Hang Seng Index were Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd up 3.7 percent, Swire Pacific Ltd gaining 3 percent and AIA Group Ltd up by 2.4 percent. ** The three biggest decliners in the Hang Seng Index were Sunny Optical Technology Group Co which fell 0.7 percent, MTR Corp Ltd which lost 0.6 percent and BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd down by 0.5 percent.
