This increase is mainly due to rate increases, new programs, and increased interactions with agents.\nPersonal Lines Operations: Gross premiums written increased 0.1% and net premiums written decreased 9.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in net premiums written was primarily due to additional premiums being ceded due to the Property Catastrophe Quota Share Treaty that became effective on April 15, 2017.\nReinsurance Operations: Gross premiums written and net premiums written both decreased 34.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to the cancellation of a treaty.\nNote: Tables Follow\nGLOBAL INDEMNITY LIMITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited) (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31, 2018 2017 Gross premiums written $ 124,247 $ 123,751 Net premiums written $ 107,870 $ 111,506 Net premiums earned $ 108,002 $ 113,126 Net investment income 11,404 8,644 Net realized investment gains (losses) (316 ) 775 Other income 554 1,368 Total revenues 119,644 123,913 Net losses and loss adjustment expenses 56,072 62,561 Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 45,003 46,551 Corporate and other operating expenses 9,260 3,054 Interest expense 4,861 2,467 Income before income taxes 4,448 9,280 Income tax benefit (1,253 ) (3,002 ) Net income $ 5,701 $ 12,282 Weighted average shares outstanding–basic 14,055 17,316 Weighted average shares outstanding–diluted 14,286 17,646 Net income per share – basic $ 0.41 $ 0.71 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.40 $ 0.70 Combined ratio analysis: (1) Loss ratio 51.9 % 55.3 % Expense ratio 41.7 % 41.1 % Combined ratio 93.6 % 96.4 % (1) The loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio are GAAP financial measures that are generally viewed in the insurance industry as indicators of underwriting profitability.
