    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Segall Bryant & Hamill, LLC, an independent investment management firm based in Chicago, Illinois, announced today that it has finalized its acquisition of Denver Investments. The combined entity will be named Segall Bryant & Hamill LLC (“SBH”) and will have close to $20 billion in assets under management.*\n“This acquisition brings together two culturally-aligned organizations that were like mirror images of each other,” said Philip L. Hildebrandt, SBH’s chief executive officer. “We believe that clients will have the opportunity to benefit from our deeper investment teams, broader investment offerings, an expanded geographical presence, and our enhanced client service and distribution capabilities.”\nBoth firms have strong institutional and wealth management businesses, in addition to well-established mutual fund platforms. The Westcore Funds—which were advised by Denver Investments—will become part of the SBH mutual fund family. With the added funds, SBH now offers a total of 18 mutual funds across 14 asset classes.\n“This is an exciting moment in our firm’s history, but this acquisition is not about us,” said Mr. Hildebrandt. “We firmly believe that this combination will help us serve our clients better and lead to continued long-lasting relationships.”\nRBC Capital Markets served as exclusive financial advisor to Denver Investments. Goodwin Proctor acted as legal counsel to Segall Bryant & Hamill. Morgan Lewis acted as legal counsel to Denver Investments.
