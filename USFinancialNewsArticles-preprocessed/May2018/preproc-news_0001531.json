    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet income was $350 million compared to $92 million in the prior year period and $287 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $405 million compared to $260 million in the prior year period and $360 million in the prior quarter. Diluted income per share was $1.11 compared to $0.31 in the prior year period and $1.00 in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted income per share was $0.96 compared to $0.45 in the prior year period and $0.76 in the prior quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $111 million. Free cash flow generation was $56 million. Balance sheet remains strong with a net leverage of 1.3x. Completed share repurchases of approximately $103 million through April 19, 2018, and approximately $347 million remains on the existing share repurchase authorization. Expanded the Polyurethanes downstream business with the acquisition of Demilec, a leading North American polyurethane spray foam producer, which was completed on April 23, 2018.\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2018\n2017\n2017\nRevenues\n$2,295\n$1,932\n$ 2,203\nNet income\n$ 350\n$ 92\n$ 287\nAdjusted net income (1)\n$ 237\n$ 110\n$ 186\nDiluted income per share\n$ 1.11\n$ 0.31\n$ 1.00\nAdjusted diluted income per share (1)\n$ 0.96\n$ 0.45\n$ 0.76\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$ 405\n$ 260\n$ 360\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nfrom continuing operations\n$ 111\n$ 70\n$ 304\nFree cash flow (3)\n$ 56\n$ 23\n$ 190\nSee end of press release for footnote explanations\nHuntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN) today reported first quarter 2018 results with revenues of $2,295 million, net income of $350 million and adjusted EBITDA of $405 million.\nPeter R. Huntsman, Chairman, President and CEO, commented:\n\"We have started 2018 fully engaged in executing the priorities that we have outlined to our shareholders. Our core business continues to perform well. All of our divisions improved over the previous year and we continue to expect all divisions will finish this year stronger than last year. Our continued focus on free cash flow produced cash generation well ahead of last year and puts us fully on pace to achieve our 2018 target of $450-$650 million.\n\"As we announced in the previous quarter, we have initiated a share buyback program. Through April 19, 2018, we spent $103 million on buybacks at an average price of $29.45 per share. We also announced the closing of the Demilec acquisition. This acquisition will provide further downstream growth while generating stronger margins and stability. We will continue to pursue the prudent deployment of capital to create further shareholder value.\"\nSegment Analysis for 1Q18 Compared to 1Q17\nPolyurethanes\nThe increase in revenues in our Polyurethanes segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was due to higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes. MDI average selling prices increased in response to continued strong market conditions. MTBE average selling prices increased primarily as a result of higher pricing for high octane gasoline. MDI sales volumes increased due to increased demand across most major markets. MTBE sales volumes increased due to increased demand for MTBE. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher MDI margins as well as higher MTBE margins.\nPerformance Products\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Products segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was due to higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes. Average selling prices increased primarily due to strong market conditions across several of our derivatives businesses and in response to higher raw material costs. Sales volumes increased in our amines, maleic anhydride and ethylene glycol businesses. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher volumes and margins.\nAdvanced Materials\nThe increase in revenues in our Advanced Materials segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 was due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Average selling prices increased largely in response to higher raw material costs and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar against major international currencies. Sales volumes increased across most markets in our core specialty business but were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our wind market. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased due to higher specialty sales volumes and lower fixed costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.\nTextile Effects\nThe increase in revenues in our Textile Effects segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Sales volumes increased in textile chemicals, particularly in our Asia and South America regions. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to product mix effect, partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar against major international currencies. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher sales volumes, lower fixed costs and certain credits during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCorporate, LIFO and other\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, segment adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other for Huntsman Corporation was a loss of $43 million which was flat with the prior year period 2017.\nHeld for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nOur former Pigments and Additives segment, now known as Venator, is classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and treated as discontinued operations on our income statement. Please refer to the Form 8-K we filed on October 31, 2017 with certain restated historical financial data. Huntsman currently owns 53% of Venator's outstanding shares.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Outstanding Debt\nDuring the quarter we generated adjusted free cash flow of $56 million compared to $23 million a year ago. As of March 31, 2018, we had $1,249 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity compared to $1,247 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we spent $55 million on capital expenditures compared to $51 million in the same period of 2017. We expect to spend approximately $325 million on capital expenditures in 2018.\nThrough April 19, 2018, we have spent approximately $103 million to repurchase approximately 3.5 million shares. We currently have approximately $347 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\nOn April 23, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Demilec. We funded the purchase price of $350 million, plus customary working capital adjustments, with available liquidity.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $53 million compared to $19 million during the same period in 2017. In the first quarter 2018, our adjusted effective tax rate was 19%. Our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 20% - 22%. We expect our long-term adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 23% - 25%.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nWe will hold a conference call to discuss our first quarter 2018 financial results on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET.\nCall-in numbers for the conference call:\nU.S. participants\n(888) 713 â€“ 4213\nInternational participants\n(617) 213 - 4865\nPasscode\n755 496 16#\nIn order to facilitate the registration process, you may use the following link to pre-register for the conference call.

We provide adjusted net income because we feel it provides meaningful insight for the investment community into the performance of our business. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. Additional information with respect to our use of each of these financial measures follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is computed by eliminating the following from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax; (b) interest; (c) income taxes; (d) depreciation and amortization; (e) acquisition and integration expenses; (f) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (g) noncontrolling interest of discontinued operations (h) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (i) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (j) expenses associated with merger; (k) certain legal and other settlements and related expenses (credits) (l) net plant incident costs (credits); (m) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses (gains); and (n) restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs (credits). The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) is set forth in Table 4 above.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share are computed by eliminating the after tax impact of the following items from net income (loss: (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest; (b) acquisition and integration expenses, purchase accounting adjustments; (c) impact of certain foreign tax credit elections; (d) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (e) discount amortization on settlement financing associated with the terminated merger; (f) loss (gain) on disposition of businesses/assets; (g) loss on early extinguishment of debt; (h) expenses associated with the merger; (i) certain legal and other settlements and related expenses (credits); (j) net plant incident costs (credits); (k) noncontrolling interest of discontinued operations; (l) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses (gains); and (m) restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs (credits). The income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under GAAP. The reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to net income (loss) is set forth in Table 4 above.\n(2)\nPro forma adjusted to exclude the sale of our European differentiated surfactants business to Innospec on December 30, 2016 as if it had occurred at the beginning of the relevant period.\n(3)\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate the Company's liquidity, (b) to evaluate strategic investments, (c) to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (d) to evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow provided by operating activities less cash flow used in investing activities, excluding acquisition/disposition activities and non-recurring separation costs. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the Company's condensed consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\n(4)\nDuring the third quarter of 2017 we separated our Pigments and Additives division through an Initial Public Offering of Venator Materials PLC; Additionally, during the first quarter 2010 we closed our Australian styrenics operations. Results from these associated businesses are treated as discontinued operations.\nAbout Huntsman:\nHuntsman Corporation is a publicly traded global manufacturer and marketer of differentiated and specialty chemicals with 2017 revenues more than $8 billion.
