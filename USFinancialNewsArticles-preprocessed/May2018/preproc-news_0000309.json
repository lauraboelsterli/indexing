    "text": "TORONTO, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Beleave Inc. (\" Beleave \" or the \" Company \") (CSE: BE; OTCQX: BLEVF) is pleased to announce initial projections for the sale of medical cannabis. The Company is currently operating out of its 14,500 sq. ft. facility in Hamilton, ON with its additional 80,000 sq. ft. greenhouse expansion well underway and expected to come online by the beginning of the third quarter.\n\"Our growers continue to improve yields on a per square foot basis with current yields now north of 80 grams per square foot per cycle,\" commented Beleave CEO Andrew Wnek. \"With five to six cycles planned per year we are confident that we will be able to exceed initial production estimates at our indoor facility.\"\nThe company will have 65,000 sq. ft. of dedicated flowering space once its expansion is complete and is projected to yield 26,000 kilograms of dried cannabis annually. To insure the highest level of productivity a full workflow study has been conducted to make its expansion project even more efficient. (Note - Estimates based off of the Company's current yields).\nOver the course of the last four weeks the Company obtained its sales license from Health Canada, closed a $5,000,000 above market private placement and announced the acquisition of Medi-Green, a clinic network of 4,000 patients that at average prescription sizes could yield sales of between 2,900 and 4,400 kilograms in annual sales from its initial three locations alone. Beleave's wholly owned Medi-Green plans to expand to 9 locations by the end to the calendar year.\n\"We are excited by these significant and positive recent developments and are unaware of anything that would have negatively affected the share price on the back of this news,\" continued Wnek, \"The company is well funded to move forward and will continue to strategically execute its strategy across all verticals.\"\nAbout Beleave\nBeleave Inc. is a biotech company and Beleave's wholly-owned subsidiary Beleave Kannabis Corp. (formerly First Access Medical Inc.) is a licensed producer pursuant to the ACMPR. Beleave's purpose-built facility is located in Hamilton, Ontario.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities law (\"forward-looking statements\").
