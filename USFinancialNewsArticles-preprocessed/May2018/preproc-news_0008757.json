    "text": "DALLAS, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Naya Ventures announced today that Don Goin, a former CIO for Capital One and Santander Consumer USA has joined the Naya platform as an EIR. Don's deep domain knowledge in financial services augments Naya's capabilities as a leading venture capital fund doing early-stage B2B investments in AI, IoT, and Blockchain. The EIR program at Naya serves to provide business leaders with a platform to source investments, support portfolio companies through engaging in an executive role, provide thought-leadership, and to potentially start their own company.\nDon is a veteran CIO and digital leader, having held CIO positions in banking and financial services over the past 15 years. Most recently, he was CIO of Santander Consumer USA, CIO of Capital One Auto Financing and Digital Operations Officer for Capital One Financial Services.

When I first met Don, I was extremely impressed with his ability to understand technology and business from a multi-faceted viewpoint. Don's experience in both startups and large corporations is a big asset for our platform and portfolio companies. We are keen to make this a successful start for both Don and Naya,\" said Dayakar Puskoor, Founder and Managing Director at Naya Ventures.\nAbout Naya Ventures\nFounded in 2011, Naya Ventures invests in early stage B2B companies where its product development expertise, emerging market channel relationships and go-to-market strategies can efficiently increase enterprise value.
