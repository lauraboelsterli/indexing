    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) said on Wednesday it had paid 284 million euros ($330 million) for a 5 percent stake in Greek telecoms operator OTE ( OTEr.AT ), raising its holding to 45 percent.\nFILE PHOTO: A Deutsche Telekom logo is seen at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman The transaction, announced earlier by the Greek privatisation agency, had been expected after a tender attracted no bids and Deutsche Telekom was invited to exercise its right of first refusal to buy the stake.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Ludwig Burger\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
