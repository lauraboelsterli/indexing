    "text": "Acquisition combines tailored financial software with flexible financing to establish a nationwide leader in patient financial engagement\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AccessOne , a leading provider of patient financing options designed to help patients manage their healthcare costs, today announced it has closed its previously announced acquisition of HealthFirst Financial , a leading software-enabled service provider of patient financing programs to healthcare organizations. With the close of this acquisition, AccessOne is now positioned for nationwide expansion, bringing flexible financing options to all U.S. patients and ensuring they get the care that they need, when they need it regardless of financial circumstance.\n“For over a decade, Atrium Health has partnered with AccessOne to create multiple positive payment programs for all patients in our community,” explains Steve Burr, senior vice president of patient financial services at Atrium Health (previously Carolinas Healthcare System). “It was important to us to help the people who need it the most. Over 30,000 of our patients are enrolled in our flexible patient financing program, which bolsters our patient satisfaction and reduces bad debt.”\nWith this acquisition, AccessOne strengthens its position as the clear growth and innovation leader in our industry. AccessOne is among the largest and most experienced national platforms for tailored patient financing solutions in healthcare.\n“We are committed to improving the well-being of our communities and a key component is affordable patient financing,” said Kym Clift, Vice President, Revenue Cycle at Samaritan Health Services. \"AccessOne and HealthFirst Financial coming together means our patients can select from more affordable options that work best for them and their families.\"\nPatients are struggling with the affordability of healthcare and are looking for consumer-friendly pathways to pay their obligation. In combination with HealthFirst, AccessOne now reaches over 200 hospitals nationwide and offers the widest array of patient financing options available in the industry. All patients are accepted, with no negative outcomes for the patient.\n“Our team has over 100 years of combined health system operating experience, beginning with our founder, Dr. Russell Salton. That perspective has led us to build technology and products that look much different from the industry. By adding HealthFirst, we have become the clear market leader in growth and innovation on a national basis, allowing us to tailor programs to the strategic requirements of health systems operating in unique marketplaces,” said Mark Spinner, chief executive officer of AccessOne.\nOregon-based HealthFirst extends AccessOne’s offices to the West Coast and Midwest, while the AccessOne headquarters will remain in Charlotte, NC. Terms of the acquisition will not be disclosed. HealthFirst was advised by Marion Financial Corp. and Armstrong Teasdale LLP, while AccessOne was advised by Womble Bond Dickinson LLP.\nLearn more about AccessOne’s comprehensive and flexible solutions for providers and patients at www.accessonemedcard.com .\nAbout AccessOne\nAccessOne is a leading provider of flexible, co-branded patient financing solutions.
