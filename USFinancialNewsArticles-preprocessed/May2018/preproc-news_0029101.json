FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Chelsea - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - April 19, 2018 Burnley's Johann Berg Gudmundsson in action with Chelsea's Victor Moses REUTERS/Andrew Yates\nThe 27-year-old Iceland international made 34 league appearances this season, scoring twice and assisting eight goals to help Burnley secure a seventh-placed finish and qualify for next season’s Europa League.\n“This season has been a good season for myself and the team and being rewarded with a new contract is a great thing,” Gudmundsson told the club website.\n“It’s something I wanted to do. I want to stay here. I feel comfortable here and my family likes it here, so I definitely wanted to sign a new contract.\n“It’s a good thing to sign it before the World Cup, just to get everything out of the way and now I can concentrate on the last game and the World Cup.”\nGudmundsson becomes the sixth first-team player to sign a new deal at Burnley this season, joining Nick Pope, James Tarkowski, Ashley Barnes, Kevin Long and Stephen Ward.\nSean Dyche’s Burnley host 12th-placed Bournemouth in the final league game of the season on Sunday.
