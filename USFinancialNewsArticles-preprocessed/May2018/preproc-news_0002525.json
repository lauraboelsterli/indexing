The Company successfully managed through the previously disclosed weather-related production issue at its Hopewell, Va. facility (\"1Q18 weather-related event\") and generated improved cash flow.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nSales down 5% versus prior year, including 8% volume decline as a result of the 1Q18 weather-related event, 2% favorable impact of market-based pricing, and 1% higher raw material pass-through pricing 1Q18 weather-related event resulted in an approximately $30 million unfavorable impact to pre-tax income, as previously disclosed, including the unfavorable impact of fixed cost absorption, maintenance expense and incremental raw material costs, in addition to lost sales Net Income of $11.6 million, a decrease of $15.7 million versus the prior year EBITDA of $30.8 million, a decrease of $26.3 million versus the prior year Cash Flow from Operations of $44.1 million, an increase of $12.9 million versus the prior year Free Cash Flow of $13.4 million, an increase of $15.4 million versus the prior year\n“This quarter's results again demonstrate our ability to navigate a dynamic environment and highlight the resiliency of our organization. We successfully managed weather-related temporary production challenges, maintained our focus on safe operations and generated higher free cash flow. We also captured the benefit of improved market-based pricing this quarter, supported by a continued favorable supply and demand environment for our product lines overall,” said Erin Kane, president and CEO of AdvanSix.\nSummary first quarter 2018 financial results for the Company are included below:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\n($ in Thousands, Except Earnings Per Share) 1Q 2018 1Q 2017 Sales $359,238 $376,704 Net Income 11,593 27,293 Earnings Per Share (Diluted) $0.37 $0.88 EBITDA (1) 30,790 57,076 EBITDA Margin % (1) 8.6% 15.2% Cash Flow from Operations 44,067 31,206 Free Cash Flow (1)(2) 13,354 (2,008) (1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” included in this press release for non-GAAP reconciliations\n(2)\nNet cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures\nSales volume in the quarter decreased 8% versus the prior year due to the unfavorable impact from the 1Q18 weather-related event. Pricing overall increased 3% versus the prior year, including a 1% favorable impact from raw material pass-through pricing driven by increases in benzene and propylene (inputs to cumene which is a key feedstock to our products) costs. Market-based pricing was favorable by 2% compared to the prior year with improved industry supply and demand dynamics in our nylon and chemical intermediates product lines.\nSales by product line represented the following approximate percentage of our total sales:\n1Q 2018 1Q 2017 Nylon 28% 29% Caprolactam 18% 21% Ammonium Sulfate Fertilizers 19% 18% Chemical Intermediates 35% 32% EBITDA of $30.8 million in the quarter decreased $26.3 million from EBITDA of $57.1 million in the prior year primarily due to the approximately $30 million unfavorable impact of the 1Q18 weather-related event, partially offset by favorable market-based pricing.\nCash flow from operations of $44.1 million in the quarter increased $12.9 million versus the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income and a reduction of deferred taxes. Capital expenditures of $30.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.5 million versus the prior year.\nOutlook\nCurrent favorable nylon industry conditions expected to continue; Late start to North America planting season impacts timing of fertilizer application Full year 2018 planned plant turnarounds expected to be consistent with historical levels in total ($30 to $35 million pre-tax income impact) Capital Expenditures expected to be $110 to $120 million for the full year 2018, including $20 to $30 million incremental investment toward high-return growth and cost savings project pipeline Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $75 million of its common stock as part of its capital deployment strategy\n“We continue to position the Company for strong operational and financial performance for years to come. We are focused on delivering strong results for the remainder of 2018, while increasing our investment in high-return growth and cost savings projects for sustained long-term performance. Additionally, our first share repurchase authorization demonstrates confidence in our continued cash flow generation and our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders,” added Kane.\nConference Call Information\nAdvanSix will discuss its results during its investor conference call today starting at 9:00 a.m. ET.
