    "text": "DALLAS and MUMBAI, India, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyOnMobile, Inc. (OTCQB: MOMT) reminds its right holders to contact their financial advisor in regards to the timing and procedures for exercising your subscription rights, as all broker dealers have different cut off dates and times for processing subscriptions in advance of June 6 th .\n\"We are excited to offer our shareholders the opportunity to protect and even increase their ownership during the current subscription period which expires on June 6th. If the offering is successful, we expect to meet the requirements for a listing on the Nasdaq, which is a condition to closing the offering, which means, at closing, investors will receive newly issued and freely tradable shares in a Nasdaq listed company. If we are unsuccessful in uplisting to Nasdaq, the funds will be returned to investors,\" remarked Harold Montgomery.\nAs a reminder, this right offering allows its shareholders the opportunity to maintain or increase their respective ownership in the company by exercising their subscription rights for $6 per share.
