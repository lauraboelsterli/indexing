    "text": "WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Street Properties Corp. (the “Company”, “FSP”, “we” or “our”) (NYSE American: FSP), a real estate investment trust (REIT), announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nGeorge J. Carter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented as follows:\n“For the first quarter of 2018, FSP’s Funds from Operations or FFO totaled approximately $26.4 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO for the same period totaled approximately $16.9 million or $0.16 per share. Dividends declared for the first quarter of 2018 were $9.7 million or $0.09 per share. Potential leasing activity is strong within our property portfolio, continuing the trends we saw in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. We anticipate higher leased percentages in the portfolio as 2018 continues. The energy influenced markets of Houston and Denver continue to improve with the upward trend of oil prices and are showing more potential leasing activity than the last several years. A number of our larger tenants are approaching us with early lease renewal requests and we would expect to see many of these transactions completed this year and next.”\nHighlights\nFFO was $26.4 million or $0.25 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. We had Net Income of $1.4 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) was $0.16 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nLeasing Update\nOur directly owned real estate portfolio of 34 properties totaling approximately 9.8 million square feet was approximately 88.5% leased as of March 31, 2018, which was a 1.2% decrease compared to December 31, 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we leased approximately 109,000 square feet, of which approximately 25,000 square feet was with new tenants. Second quarter 2018 leasing activity to date includes approximately 500,000 square feet of potential leases out for execution, more than 100,000 square feet of which would be new leases and expansions. Weighted average annualized GAAP rent per square foot was approximately $29.05 as of March 31, 2018, compared to $28.87 as of December 31, 2017, $27.92 as of December 31, 2016, $26.93 as of December 31, 2015, and $26.04 as of December 31, 2014. We believe that the increase is attributable to the enhanced quality of our real estate portfolio and value creation derived from our recent acquisitions, dispositions and leasing. Our project at 801 Marquette Avenue provides a contemporary, forward-looking experience in a vintage warehouse style office with modern systems and market leading amenities in the heart of the Minneapolis CBD. The redevelopment of 801 Marquette, which is approximately 127,268 square feet, was completed in 2017. Subsequent to quarter end, we signed a lease with a tenant for approximately 18,000 square feet on the first floor with anticipated occupancy in December 2018 and we also signed a lease with an operator for a full service café located in our Atrium with anticipated operations commencing this summer. Our project continues to see great activity and our team has led approximately 50 prospect tours representing in excess of 1.7 million square feet across all industries. We expect 801 Marquette to be substantially leased by year end and stabilized in the third quarter of 2019.\nAcquisition and Disposition Update\nWe do not anticipate making new acquisitions at this time but continue to monitor all prospective investment opportunities in our core markets. We do not expect any significant disposition activity within our directly-owned portfolio as we begin the second quarter of 2018. We anticipate some potential disposition activity within our managed portfolio during 2018.\nDividend Update\nOn April 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $0.09 per share of common stock that will be paid on May 10, 2018 to stockholders of record on April 20, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO, AFFO and Sequential Same Store NOI and our definitions of FFO, AFFO and Sequential Same Store NOI can be found on Supplementary Schedules H and I.\nReal Estate Update\nSupplementary schedules provide property information for the Company’s owned real estate portfolio and for two non-consolidated REITs in which the Company holds preferred stock interests as of March 31, 2018.

Earnings Release\nSupplementary Schedule H\nReconciliation and Definitions of Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”)\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO is shown below and a definition of FFO and AFFO is provided on Supplementary Schedule I. Management believes FFO and AFFO are used broadly throughout the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry as measurements of performance. The Company has included the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and notes that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. The Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO or AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define FFO or AFFO differently.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to FFO and AFFO: Three Months Ended March 31, (In thousands, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net income $ 1,425 $ 4,480 (Gain) on sale of properties and properties held for sale, less applicable income tax — (2,289 ) GAAP loss from non-consolidated REITs 105 397 FFO from non-consolidated REITs 884 791 Depreciation & amortization 23,950 25,163 NAREIT FFO 26,364 28,542 Hedge ineffectiveness — (22 ) Acquisition costs of new properties — 8 Funds From Operations (FFO) $ 26,364 $ 28,528 Funds From Operations (FFO) $ 26,364 $ 28,528 Reverse FFO from non-consolidated REITs (884 ) (791 ) Distributions from non-consolidated REITs 355 346 Amortization of deferred financing costs 711 606 Straight-line rent 40 (1,082 ) Tenant improvements (6,777 ) (6,474 ) Leasing commissions (1,021 ) (1,579 ) Non-investment capex (1,858 ) (1,670 ) Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $ 16,930 $ 17,884 Per Share Data EPS $ 0.01 $ 0.04 FFO $ 0.25 $ 0.27 AFFO $ 0.16 $ 0.17 Weighted average shares (basic and diluted) 107,231 107,231 Funds From Operations (“FFO”)\nThe Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders. The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness and acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized, plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs.\nOther real estate companies and NAREIT may define this term in a different manner. We have included the NAREIT FFO as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nWe believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income or loss and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”)\nThe Company also evaluates performance based on Adjusted Funds From Operations, which we refer to as AFFO. The Company defines AFFO as (1) FFO, (2) excluding our proportionate share of FFO and including distributions received, from non-consolidated REITs, (3) excluding the effect of straight-line rent, (4) plus deferred financing costs and (5) less recurring capital expenditures that are generally for maintenance of properties, which we call non-investment capex or are second generation capital expenditures. Second generation costs include re-tenanting space after a tenant vacates, which include tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nWe exclude development/redevelopment activities, capital expenditures planned at acquisition and costs to reposition a property. We also exclude first generation leasing costs, which are generally to fill vacant space in properties we acquire or were planned for at acquisition.\nAFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. Other real estate companies may define this term in a different manner. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, AFFO should be examined in connection with net income or loss and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.\nFranklin Street Properties Corp. Earnings Release\nSupplementary Schedule I\nReconciliation and Definition of Sequential Same Store results to property Net Operating Income (NOI) and Net Income (Loss)\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”)\nThe Company provides property performance based on Net Operating Income, which we refer to as NOI. Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income or loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in the periods presented, which we call Sequential Same Store. The comparative Sequential Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude properties that are non-operating, being developed or redeveloped, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees. NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company’s liquidity or its ability to make distributions. The calculations of NOI and Sequential Same Store are shown in the following table:\nRentable Square Feet Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Inc % (in thousands) or RSF 31-Mar-18 31-Dec-17 (Dec) Change Region East 1,007 $ 3,991 $ 3,917 $ 74 1.9 % MidWest 1,549 6,257 4,940 1,317 26.7 % South 4,597 15,431 16,168 (737 ) (4.6 ) % West 2,608 10,958 11,352 (394 ) (3.5 ) % Same Store 9,761 36,637 36,377 260 0.7 % Acquisitions — — — — — % NOI* from the continuing portfolio 9,761 36,637 36,377 260 0.7 % Dispositions, Non-Operating, Development or Redevelopment - 79 (77 ) 156 0.4 % NOI* 9,761 $ 36,716 $ 36,300 $ 416 1.1 % Sequential Same Store $ 36,637 $ 36,377 $ 260 0.7 % Less Nonrecurring Items in NOI* (a) 761 914 (153 ) 0.5 % Comparative Sequential Same Store $ 35,876 $ 35,463 $ 413 1.2 %\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Reconciliation to Net income 31-Mar-18 31-Dec-17 Net income (loss) $ 1,425 $ (4,932 ) Add (deduct): Loss on sale of properties and property held for sale, less applicable income taxes — 21 Hedge ineffectiveness — 2,096 Management fee income (746 ) (756 ) 24,035 25,659 Amortization of above/below market leases (85 ) (90 ) General and administrative 3,432 3,665 Interest expense 9,486 8,657 Interest income (1,120 ) (1,133 ) Equity in losses of non-consolidated REITs 105 2,885 Non-property specific items, net 184 228 NOI* $ 36,716 $ 36,300 (a) Nonrecurring Items in NOI include proceeds from bankruptcies, lease termination fees or other significant nonrecurring income or expenses, which may affect comparability.\n*Excludes NOI from investments in and interest income from secured loans to non-consolidated REITs.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006814/en/\nFranklin Street Properties Corp.\nGeorgia Touma, 877-686-9496\nSource: Franklin Street Properties Corp.",
