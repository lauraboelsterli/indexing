Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen via REUTERS/File Photo\nShareholders of the Nordic region’s biggest bank approved the move in March. It is aimed at cutting the costs of complying with Swedish regulations and placing it under the supervision of the European Central Bank.\nBut while Finns have celebrated Nordea’s move, regulators note that it also makes Finland the smallest country in the world to host a bank classed as systemically important.\nNordea’s headquarters, due to move by October, will come with a balance sheet of around 600 billion euros ($710 billion) which is close to three times Finland’s annual economic output.
