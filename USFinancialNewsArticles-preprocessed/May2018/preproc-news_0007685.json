Net income attributable to common units was $105 million for first quarter 2018, a decrease of $6 million compared to $111 million for first quarter 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities was $166 million for the first quarter 2018, an increase of $10 million compared to $156 million for first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2018 was $257 million, an increase of $36 million compared to $221 million for first quarter 2017. DCF for first quarter 2018 was $196 million, an increase of $25 million compared to $171 million for first quarter 2017.\nFor first quarter 2018, DCF exceeded declared distributions to common unitholders by $58 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.42x.\nFor additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nMANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE\n\"Enable is on track for another great year in 2018,” said Enable Midstream President and CEO Rod Sailor. “The first quarter marked our ninth consecutive quarter of per-day natural gas gathered volume growth. This growth was driven by continued activity and improved well performance in the Ark-La-Tex and Anadarko Basins.”\n\"We are excited to see the outstanding results achieved by our producer-customers on our footprint, which further validates Enable’s investments in our core gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets, including the Wildcat, CaSE and Muskogee projects, all of which remain on schedule for completion this year. As a result of our expectation for continued strong business performance this year, we have increased our 2018 outlook for several of our key financial measures.”\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring first quarter 2018, per-day natural gas gathered volumes grew for the ninth consecutive quarter as a result of strong rig activity across Enable's footprint. As of April 25, 2018, there were 40 rigs across Enable's footprint that were drilling wells expected to be connected to Enable's gathering systems. Twenty-six of those rigs were in the Anadarko Basin, nine were in the Ark-La-Tex Basin, three were in the Arkoma Basin and two were in the Williston Basin.\nDue to continued producer activity and strong well performance, natural gas gathered volumes on one of the Haynesville gathering systems in the Ark-La-Tex Basin are forecast to exceed minimum volume commitment levels for the current annual measurement period. Enable was also awarded two long-term, fee-based natural gas gathering and processing contracts for multi-well, infill projects in the highly active liquids-rich windows of the SCOOP.\nIn 2018, Enable has contracted or extended over 300,000 Dth/d of capacity on the Enable Gas Transmission, LLC (EGT) system and 75,000 Dth/d of capacity on the Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission (EOIT) system. Enable continues to negotiate with potential shippers on the previously announced Line CP open season and plans to provide an update on the project by the partnership's second quarter 2018 earnings release. Intrastate transportation deliveries also increased in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the continued supply growth in the Anadarko Basin.\nEnable's previously announced Wildcat, CaSE and Muskogee projects remain on schedule. Project Wildcat, a 400 million cubic feet per day rich natural gas takeaway solution from the Anadarko Basin to North Texas, is expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The CaSE project, a 205,000 Dth/d firm natural gas transportation solution for growing Anadarko Basin production, is expected to be fully in service by the fourth quarter of 2018. The Muskogee project, a 20-year, 228,000 Dth/d firm transportation service agreement with Oklahoma Gas and Electric on the EOIT system, is expected to commence service in late 2018.\nOn March 15, 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced that it would revise its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs to no longer allow pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. Enable and multiple peers and industry associations have filed requests for clarification and, if necessary, rehearing of FERC’s revised policy statement. The policy change should not impact Enable's natural gas gathering and processing business, market-based rates, committed rates, negotiated rates and certain discounted rates. For cost-of-service rates, income taxes are just one component of the cost-of-service calculation, and Enable strives to ensure that FERC-regulated assets earn a fair return reflective of historical investments and current contracted capacity and expense levels.\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS\nOn May 1, 2018, the board of directors of Enable’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.318 per unit on all outstanding common units for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The distribution is unchanged from the previous quarter. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.318 per unit on all outstanding common units will be paid on May 29, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2018.\nThe board also declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.625 on all Series A Preferred Units for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The quarterly cash distribution of $0.625 on all Series A Preferred Units outstanding will be paid on May 15, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2018.\nKEY OPERATING STATISTICS\nNatural gas gathered volumes were 4.28 trillion British thermal units per day (TBtu/d) for first quarter 2018, an increase of 30 percent compared to 3.29 TBtu/d for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, partially offset by lower gathered volumes in the Arkoma Basin.\nNatural gas processed volumes were 2.22 TBtu/d for first quarter 2018, an increase of 19 percent compared to 1.87 TBtu/d for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins.\nNGLs produced were 110.29 MBbl/d for first quarter 2018, an increase of 38 percent compared to 79.76 MBbl/d for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher natural gas processed volumes and higher plant recoveries.\nCrude oil gathered volumes were 24.83 MBbl/d for first quarter 2018, an increase of 17 percent compared to 21.18 MBbl/d for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the Bear Den system and the commissioning of multi-well pads on the Bear Den and Nesson systems.\nInterstate transportation firm contracted capacity was 6.05 Bcf/d for first quarter 2018, a decrease of 16 percent compared to 7.23 Bcf/d for first quarter 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower contracted firm transportation volumes between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana.\nIntrastate transportation average deliveries were 1.97 TBtu/d for first quarter 2018, an increase of 7 percent compared to 1.84 TBtu/d for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily related to increased supply in the Anadarko Basin.\nFIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nRevenues were $748 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $82 million compared to $666 million for first quarter 2017. Revenues included $122 million of intercompany eliminations for first quarter 2018 and $119 million of intercompany eliminations for first quarter 2017.\nGathering and processing segment revenues were $591 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $100 million compared to $491 million for first quarter 2017. The increase in gathering and processing segment revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues from NGL sales resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in natural gas gathering revenues due to higher fees and gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in processing service revenues resulting from higher processed volumes primarily under fixed fee processing arrangements, an increase in revenues from natural gas sales due to higher gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins as well as higher average natural gas prices and an increase in crude oil and water gathering revenues due to an increase in gathered volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to the adoption of ASC 606 (a newly effective revenue recognition standard) and a decrease in revenues from changes in the fair value of natural gas, condensate and NGL derivatives. Transportation and storage segment revenues were $279 million for first quarter 2018, a decrease of $15 million compared to $294 million for first quarter 2017. The decrease in transportation and storage segment revenues was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives and a decrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana, due to contract expirations in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by an increase from volume-dependent transportation revenues primarily due to an increase in commodity fees from new contracts and an increase in off-system transportation due to increases in volumes at higher rates, an increase in revenues from natural gas sales associated with higher sales volumes and higher average sales prices, an increase in revenues from other firm contracted capacity due to new intrastate contracts, an increase due to higher realized gains on natural gas derivatives and an increase in revenues from NGL sales due to an increase in prices and volumes.\nGross margin was $373 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $15 million compared to $358 million for first quarter 2017.\nGathering and processing segment gross margin was $233 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $28 million compared to $205 million for first quarter 2017. The increase in gathering and processing segment gross margin was primarily due to an increase in processing margins resulting from higher average NGL prices and higher processed volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, an increase in gathering margin due to increased gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins, and an increase in crude and water gathering margins as a result of an increase in gathered volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin from changes in the fair value of natural gas, condensate and NGL derivatives. Transportation and storage segment gross margin was $140 million for first quarter 2018, a decrease of $14 million compared to $154 million for first quarter 2017. The decrease in transportation and storage segment gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin from changes in the fair value of natural gas derivatives, a decrease in firm transportation services between Carthage, Texas, and Perryville, Louisiana, due to contract expirations in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease in storage primarily due to storage field losses and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment in the first quarter of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in system management activities, an increase in volume-dependent transportation margins primarily due to an increase in commodity fees from new contracts and an increase in off-system transportation due to increases in volumes at higher rates, an increase in other firm contracted capacity due to new intrastate contracts and an increase in realized gains on natural gas derivatives.\nOperation and maintenance and general and administrative expenses were $121 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $7 million compared to $114 million for first quarter 2017. The increase in operation and maintenance and general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll-related costs, compressor rental expenses due to increased compression activity and an increase in materials and supplies and contract services costs. These increases were partially offset by an increase in capitalized overhead costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $96 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $8 million compared to $88 million for first quarter 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the Align Midstream, LLC acquisition and additional assets placed in service.\nTaxes other than income tax were $17 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $1 million compared to $16 million for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily a result of higher accrued ad valorem taxes due to additional assets placed in service.\nInterest expense was $33 million for first quarter 2018, an increase of $6 million compared to $27 million for first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of debt outstanding and higher interest rates on outstanding debt as a result of a long-term debt issuance in March 2017 the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of amounts outstanding under Enable's revolving credit facility.\nEnable’s net income attributable to limited partners and net income attributable to common units for first quarter 2018 includes no net impact from derivative activity, compared to a $21 million gain on derivative activity for first quarter 2017, resulting in a decrease in net income of $21 million. The decrease of $21 million is comprised of a decrease related to the change in fair value of derivatives of $26 million and an increase in realized gain on derivatives of $5 million. Additional details on derivative instruments and hedging activities can be found in Enable’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nCapital expenditures were $190 million for first quarter 2018, compared to $61 million for first quarter 2017. Expansion capital expenditures were $176 million for first quarter 2018, compared to $47 million for first quarter 2017. Maintenance capital expenditures were $14 million for first quarter 2018 and 2017.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nEnable has updated its 2018 outlook for current commodity price, volume, capital spending and financing expectations.\n$ in millions, except volume numbers and ratios\n2018 Outlook\nOperational\nNatural gas gathered volumes (TBtu/d) 4.1 - 4.8 Anadarko 2.0 - 2.3 Arkoma 0.5 - 0.6 Ark-La-Tex 1.6 -1.9 Natural gas processed volumes (TBtu/d) 2.3 - 2.8 Anadarko 1.9 - 2.2 Arkoma 0.1 - 0.2 Ark-La-Tex 0.3 - 0.4 Crude Oil – Gathered volumes (MBbl/d) 28.0 - 34.0 Interstate firm contracted capacity (Bcf/d) 5.6 - 6.0 Financial\nNet Income Attributable to Common Units $375 - $445 Interest expense, net of interest income $145 - $160 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $975 - $1,050 Series A Preferred Unit distributions 2 $36 Adjusted interest expense 1 $150 - $165 Maintenance capital expenditures $95 - $125 DCF 1 $675 - $735 Distribution coverage ratio 3 1.20x - 1.35x Total Debt / Adjusted EBITDA +/- 4.0x (1) Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted interest expense and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to the nearest GAAP financial measures in this press release (2) Includes the fourth quarter 2018 distribution that will be paid in the first quarter 2019 (3) A non-GAAP measure calculated as distributable cash flow divided by distributions related to common units $ in millions\n2018 Outlook\nExpansion Capital\nGathering and Processing $355 - $465 Transportation and Storage $120 - $160 Total Expansion Capital $475 - $625 The partnership's updated 2018 outlook is based on the following price assumptions:\nPrices\n2018 Outlook\nNatural Gas – Henry Hub ($/MMBtu) $2.75 - $3.05 NGLs – Mont Belvieu, Texas ($/gal) 1 $0.58 - $0.66 NGLs – Conway, Kansas ($/gal) 1 $0.53 - $0.61 Crude Oil – WTI ($/Bbl) $58.00 - $66.00 (1) NGL composite based on assumed composition of 45%, 30%, 10%, 5% and 10% for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline, respectively EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nA conference call discussing first quarter results is scheduled today at 10 a.m. Eastern.

For more information, visit http://www.enablemidstream.com .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nEnable has included the non-GAAP financial measures Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio in this press release based on information in its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nGross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio are supplemental financial measures that management and external users of Enable’s financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies may use, to assess:\nEnable’s operating performance as compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis; The ability of Enable’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its partners; Enable’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and The viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nThis press release includes a reconciliation of Gross margin to total revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to net income attributable to limited partners, Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and Adjusted interest expense to interest expense, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as applicable, for each of the periods indicated. Distribution coverage ratio is a financial performance measure used by management to reflect the relationship between Enable’s financial operating performance and cash distributions. Enable believes that the presentation of Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio provides information useful to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations. Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, total revenue, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Additionally, because Gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted interest expense, DCF and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies in Enable’s industry, its definitions of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the information in this press release may contain .

This includes changes to accounts receivable, accounts payable and other changes in non-current assets and liabilities.
