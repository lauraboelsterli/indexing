    "text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Smart Employee Benefits Inc. (“SEB” or the “Company”) (TSXV:SEB) today reported its financial results for the three-month period ending February 28, 2018.\nThree months ended February 28 2018 2017 Revenue $ 25,510,434 $ 23,147,959 Cost of revenues 18,527,677 19,427,565 Gross Margin 6,982,757 3,720,394 Gross Margin as a % of Revenue 27.4 % 16.1 % Operating costs 6,567,698 3,202,834 Professional fees 156,439 458,107 Adjusted EBITDA 258,620 59,453 Share based compensation 49,826 54,873 Transaction costs - 160,105 EBITDA 208,794 (155,525 ) Interest and financing fees 608,262 913,715 Depreciation and amortization 1,149,195 1,133,045 Income tax 1,764 634 Net loss $ (1,550,427 ) $ (2,202,919 ) CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE\nThe first quarter is typically the slowest quarter for SEB, largely due to the Christmas holidays and a shorter billing period in February. There are approximately ten less billing days than other quarters which translates to a 15% to 20% reduction in normalized revenue. There is also an impact on SEB’s profitability as a result of approximately 45% of SEB’s workforce being employee based and their costs prevail even on non-billable days. SEB is transitioning more and more business to “Managed Services” type business which will reduce the impact of fewer billing days. Growth in the Benefits Processing business will also reduce this seasonal impact. However, year over year, the results have been positive and within our expectations. We expect strong performance throughout the remainder of the year, with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter, typical of past years.\nAll comparisons (except where noted) are between Q1 of Fiscal 2018 and Q1 of Fiscal 2017.\nConsolidated revenue was $25.5M for the quarter versus $23.1M for the same quarter in the previous year. The $2.4M increase is attributable to the benefits processing business acquired April 2017 from Aon. The Technology Division was relatively flat quarter over quarter. Gross Margin was $7.0M for the quarter, up from $3.7M the same quarter the previous year. Over 80% of the increase is attributed to the growth in the benefits business from the Aon transaction. Adjusted EBITDA (as described in the MD&A for the quarter) was $258.6K for the quarter, versus $59.5K the previous quarter. EBITDA (as described in the MD&A for the quarter) was $208.8K versus a negative $155.5K the previous year, an improvement of $364.3K. The only adjustment in Q1/18 to Adjusted EBITDA was non-cash share-based compensation of $49.8K. Interest, Financing and Transaction Costs were $608.3K for the quarter, versus $1.074M the previous year. The $22.5M of debt refinancing with the Bank of Montreal (April 2017) and the paydown of debt significantly reduced interest costs by over $2.0M, annually. Consolidated loss for the period was $1.6M in Q1/18 versus $2.2M for Q1/17. Contributing factors to the improvement include a reduction in professional fees of $302K and a reduction of $305K in interest and financing costs, partly as a result of the refinancing which occurred in April, 2017. Non-cash expenses included in the loss for the quarter were approximately $1.2M.=\nDIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE • The Technology Division revenue was relatively flat to the same quarter last year at $23.1M for the quarter. Operating income was $958K for the quarter compared to $941K the previous year’s first quarter. The first quarter had over $120M of new contract wins and renewals. Contracts (Backlog, Option Year, Renewal) remain over $450M. • The Benefits Division revenue was $3.3M for the quarter vs $0.5M the previous year. The Aon Transaction together with the new products platform sales and several cross selling initiatives is expected to significantly increase these revenues in the coming months. The operating loss for the quarter was $276K vs $507K for the same quarter the previous year. Since the Aon transaction closed in April, 2017, 18 contracts were renewed of which 6 were in Q1/18; 2 net new clients also went live in Q1/18. Contract Backlog remains over $60.0M. Significant expense was incurred during the quarter in transitioning existing clients to the FlexPlus environment from the various legacy environments acquired from Aon. By November, 2018 we expect less than 10% of our clients will be operating on legacy environments. This is expected to result in hundreds of thousands of dollars of annual cost savings. Additional costs were incurred in new client implementations. Several new client implementations are in process. These transition and implementation costs are typically recovered over the life of the contracts. Development initiatives, in the form of new functionalities and new modules, were also ongoing during the quarter. • Corporate total costs were $474K in Q1 F2018 versus $589K in Q1 F2017.\nTRAILING TWELVE MONTHS (“TTM”) COMPARISONS\nTTM\nFISCAL YEAR FISCAL YEAR FEB 28/18 NOV 30/17 NOV 30/16 Revenue $108,645,312 $106,282,838 $97,227,776 Gross Margin 30,213,091 26,950,729 18,908,694 Adjusted EBITDA 3,221,128 3,021,987 2,080,129 EBITDA $918,135 $553,842 $(503,550) Revenue, on TTM basis, increased over the fiscal years 2017 and 2016 by $2.4M and $11.4M, respectively. At a minimum, the $2.4M increase in the first quarter is expected to prevail quarterly throughout the year. Additionally, during the quarter over $150M of contracts were signed, of which approximately $70M were new multi-year contracts and the remainder were renewals, the majority starting in the third quarter.\nGross Margins for the TTMs are $30.2M vs $27.0M for fiscal 2017 and $18.9M for fiscal 2016. SEB has a very scalable fixed cost structure and has reached the point where over 60 percent of the growth in gross margin dollars are forecast to go to EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the TTM was $3.2M vs $3.0M for fiscal 207 and $2.1M for fiscal 2016. Continued growth is expected during the year.\nEBITDA for the TTM grew to $918K from $554K in fiscal 2017 and a loss of $504K in fiscal 2016. The primary difference between Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA is one-time costs. In 2017, the majority of the one-time costs were associated with the costs of transitioning the Aon infrastructure from Aon to SEB. In the first quarter, the only adjustment was non-cash share compensation (i.e. option valuations).\nPREFERRED SHARE FINANCING\nOn February 28, 2018 SEB closed a private placement with a major Canadian Investment Fund, pursuant to which the Company received $3,000,000 in gross proceeds. The Company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Paradigm Consulting Group Inc. (“Paradigm”), issued 3,000,000 preferred shares (“Preferred Shares”) at a price of $1.00 each. The Preferred Shares are entitled to a quarterly 8% cumulative dividend and a bonus equal to 20% of the gain in enterprise value of Paradigm, payable at the maturity date of May 31, 2023. Each Preferred Share (at its issue price) is exchangeable into one Common Share of SEB at $0.45 per Common Share until November 30, 2019 and at $0.50 per Common Share at any time after November 30, 2019 until November 30, 2022.\nCONVERTIBLE NOTES FINANCING\nPost the quarter, SEB finalized the terms of a Convertible Note financing for $650,000 for a two-year term, ending April 25, 2020. The interest terms are 5% per annum with a conversion over the term at $0.50 per SEB common share. This financing was an extension of an existing Vendor Take Back facility issued on an acquisition.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\nJohn McKimm, President/CEO/CIO of SEB, states:\n“SEB has progressed significantly year over year. Our Technology Division maintains a solid base of business with multiple years of healthy EBITDA and significant growth expected in fiscal 2018. Our Benefits Processing business has gained solid traction with the Aon transaction in April, 2017. Our “One Processing Environment” technology environment for health benefits manages over 90% of all processing associated with a benefits transaction and integrates additional automated solution modules including Voluntary Products, Disability Management, Health & Wellness, Employee Discount Programs and Human Resource Solutions. Our “White Label Channel Partners” go to market strategy is also gaining strong traction. We have more than a dozen Joint Venture negotiations in progress. For our “Channel Partners”, we turn “Cost Centres to Profit Centres” as their back-office technology partners. This strategy is unique in the marketplace. During the period since November 2017, on a consolidated basis, we have finalized over $150M of contracts, of which approximately $70M is new business and the remainder renewals of multi-year contracts. We have, since 2016, removed over $5M of cost structure through integration and consolidation of business processes, infrastructure costs and financing costs. Our debt has been significantly reduced during the year, with the majority of our debt being with a major Canadian bank and over 80% of the remainder being insiders. Our Contracts (Backlog, Option Year Renewals) are maintaining a base of over $500M. SEB is well positioned for strong organic growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings over the next three years with annual revenue under contract of over $100M per annum.”\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nDate/Time: Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 11:30AM ET.\nCanada & USA Toll Free Dial In: 1-800-319-4610\nToronto Toll Dial In: 1-416-915-3239\nCallers should dial in 5-10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time and simply ask to join the call.\nWebcast Link: access at http://services.choruscall.ca/links/sebq120180502.html\nConference Call Replay Numbers:\nCanada & USA Toll Free: 1-855-669-9658 Code: 2247 followed by the # sign Replay Duration: Available for one week until end of day May 9, 2018 .\nABOUT SEB\nSEB is a Business Process Automation and Outsourcing Technology Company providing software, solutions and services to a national and global client base.
