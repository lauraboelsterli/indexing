    "text": "PARIS, May 3 (Reuters) - Luxury handbag specialist Hermes on Thursday reported a pick-up in the pace of sales in the first quarter, boosted like peers by strong appetite from Chinese shoppers and brisk business in the United States.\nThe maker of $10,000-plus Birkin bags said revenue rose 3 percent to 1.39 billion euros ($1.67 billion) for the January to March period.\nSales were up 11 percent at constant exchange rates, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for growth of around 9 percent.\nCurrency swings, and particularly a strong euro, had a 104 million euros negative effect on sales in the period, Hermes said in a statement.\n“This was a strong start,” Chief Executive Axel Dumas told journalists, adding that the drag from currency fluctuations should ease later in the year.\n$1 = 0.8345 euros Reporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur ",
