    "text": "May 12, 2018 / 10:53 AM / Updated 9 minutes ago DC United coach Olsen confirms Rooney interest Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - DC United coach Ben Olsen has confirmed the club’s interest in signing Everton’s Wayne Rooney but added any deal to take the English striker to Major League Soccer had yet to be completed. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - FA Cup Third Round - Liverpool vs Everton - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - January 5, 2018 Everton's Wayne Rooney during the warm up before the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine/File Photo\nFormer England captain Rooney has been subject to intense speculation over the last few days, with multiple British media reports saying that a deal had been agreed “in principle” for him to move to the U.S.\n“Certainly the deal is not done but obviously there is some interest from our end,” Olsen told American website TMZ on Friday.\nRooney, who rejoined his boyhood club Everton from Manchester United in July last year, scored 11 goals in the first half of the campaign but has failed to nail down a starting place under manager Sam Allardyce.\nAllardyce said on Friday that Rooney has not requested to leave the Merseyside club but he would be “comfortable” if any player wanted to move on.\nThe 32-year-old Rooney will have an opportunity to complete a move to DC United when the MLS mid-season transfer window opens on July 10.
