(the ‘Company’) (NASDAQ:INTL), a diversified global financial services organization providing execution, risk management and advisory services, market intelligence and clearing services across asset classes and markets around the world, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSean M.

The table below also presents adjusted income before tax, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted return on average stockholders’ equity, which are non-GAAP measures. The “adjusted” non-GAAP amounts reflect each item after removing the impacts of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) and the bad debt on physical coal, net of incentive recapture for the last six fiscal quarters. Management believes that presenting our results excluding Tax Reform and the bad debt on physical coal, net of incentive recapture is meaningful, as it increases the comparability of period-to-period results.\nThree Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 As reported, GAAP: Income (loss) before tax $ 29.5 $ 18.6 $ (22.5) $ 15.0 $ 14.3 $ 8.4 Income tax expense (6.8) (25.5) (1.1) (2.3) (3.3) (2.1) Net (loss) income $ 22.7 $ (6.9) $ (23.6) $ 12.7 $ 11.0 $ 6.3 Diluted (loss) earnings per share $ 1.18 $ (0.37) $ (1.27) $ 0.66 $ 0.58 $ 0.34 Return (loss) on average stockholders’ equity 19.9% (6.2)% (20.5)% 10.9% 9.8% 5.8% Adjusted (non-GAAP) (a): Adjusted income before tax $ 29.5 $ 19.6 $ 20.2 $ 15.0 $ 14.3 $ 8.4 Adjusted income tax expense (7.6) (4.6) (4.4) (2.3) (3.3) (2.1) Adjusted net income $ 21.9 $ 15.0 $ 15.8 $ 12.7 $ 11.0 $ 6.3 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.15 $ 0.78 $ 0.83 $ 0.66 $ 0.58 $ 0.34 Adjusted return on average stockholders’ equity 17.0% 12.1% 13.2% 10.9% 9.8% 5.8% (a) Adjusted income before tax, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted return on average stockholders’ equity are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP amounts listed above is provided in Appendix A.\nInterest Income/Expense\nOverall interest income increased $10.2 million to $27.9 million in the second quarter, as a result of an increase in short term interest rates, as well as increased activity in our domestic institutional fixed income and securities lending businesses. Average customer equity in the Financial Ag & Energy and Exchange-traded Futures & Options components of our Commercial Hedging and Clearing and Execution Services (“CES”) segments was $2.1 billion, increasing 3% in the second quarter compared to the prior year, which combined with an increase in short-term interest rates resulted in an aggregate $3.3 million increase in interest income in these businesses. Our domestic institutional fixed income business had an increase in interest income of $2.3 million in the second quarter over the prior year. In addition, interest income increased $3.7 million from securities lending started up during fiscal 2017 in our Equity Market-Making business.\nWe currently maintain U.S. Treasury bills, interest earning cash deposits with banks, clearing organizations and counterparties as part of our interest rate management strategy.\nInterest expense increased 90% to $19.0 million in the second quarter compared to $10.0 million in the prior year. The increase in expense is primarily related to the trading activities of our institutional dealer in fixed income securities, which resulted in higher interest expense of $4.3 million. Also, an increase in short-term rates resulted in higher costs in our Exchange-traded Futures & Options component, as well as higher costs related to our securities lending business started up during fiscal 2017 in our Equity Market-Making business. Additionally, higher average borrowings outstanding on the credit facility available for our physical commodity financing resulted in increased expense.\nNon-interest Expenses and Key Operating Metrics\nThe following table reflects a breakout of total non-interest expenses by variable and non-variable components, which is used by management in evaluating our non-interest expenses, for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 % Change 2018 2017 % Change Variable compensation and benefits $ 46.2 $ 36.2 28% $ 83.1 $ 70.7 18% Transaction-based clearing expenses 50.7 33.7 50% 87.6 67.3 30% Introducing broker commissions 36.2 28.2 28% 67.3 56.9 18% Total variable expenses 133.1 98.1 36% 238.0 194.9 22% Fixed compensation and benefits 42.0 40.4 4% 82.3 76.5 8% Other fixed expenses 36.4 31.7 15% 69.8 64.5 8% Bad debts 0.2 1.3 (85)% 1.3 3.8 (66)% Total non-variable expenses 78.6 73.4 7% 153.4 144.8 6% Total non-interest expenses $ 211.7 $ 171.5 23% $ 391.4 $ 339.7 15% The following table reflects key operating metrics used by management in evaluating our product lines, for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change 2018 2017 % Change Volumes and Other Data: Exchange-traded -

These services span virtually all traded commodity markets, with the largest concentrations in agricultural and energy commodities (consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, sugar, cotton, and food service) and base metals products listed on the LME.\nOperating revenues increased 25% to a record $78.3 million in the second quarter compared to $62.7 million in the prior year. Exchange-traded revenues increased 18%, to $41.1 million in the second quarter, resulting primarily from an increase in agricultural market revenues driven by an increase in both volatility and underlying prices, particularly in the domestic grain markets. In addition, agricultural exchange-traded revenues benefited from increased activity from customers in both food service and dairy markets as well as soft commodities which were both driven by increased market volatility. Energy and renewable fuels customer volumes more than doubled versus the prior year as a result of increased activity from institutional customers in both our domestic and London offices. Uncertainty surrounding the effect of potential U.S. tariff’s on global metals markets drove volatility and activity in our LME metals business in the second quarter. Finally, reflected in the ‘Other” category above we saw an increase in exchange-traded revenues from omnibus relationships introduced by our commercial hedging employees in the second quarter. Overall exchange-traded contract volumes increased 23%, however the rate per contract declined 3% versus the prior year to $5.52, with the decline primarily as a result of the increase in activity from institutional customers and omnibus relationships which have a lower rate per contract than our commercial business.\nOTC revenues increased 34%, to $28.0 million in the second quarter, driven by both a 17% increase in OTC volumes and a 16% increase in the average rate per contract compared to the prior year. These increases were driven by increases in agricultural commodities, primarily with Brazilian grain customers as well as increased activity in food service, dairy and cotton. These increases were offset by lower interest rate swap activity as well to a lesser extent lower energy and renewable fuels revenues.\nConsulting, management, and account fees increased 11% compared to the prior year, while interest income, increased 50%, to $5.1 million compared to the prior year. The increase in interest income was primarily driven by an increase in short-term rates, as average customer equity declined 5% versus the prior year to $892.3 million in the second quarter.\nSegment income increased to $27.6 million in the second quarter compared to $18.7 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in operating revenues and a $1.5 million decline in bad debt expense. The prior year period included $1.3 million bad debt expense in our LME metals business, while the current period includes a $0.2 million recovery on a previously recorded bad debt. This decline was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in non-variable compensation and benefits. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 42% compared to 41% in the prior year, primarily as the result of an increase in transaction-based clearing expenses due to product mix.\nGlobal Payments\nOur Global Payments segment provides global payment solutions to banks and commercial businesses as well as charities, non-governmental organizations and government organizations. We offer payments services in more than 175 countries and 140 currencies, which we believe is more than any other payments solution provider, and provide competitive and transparent pricing.\nOperating revenues increased 9% to $23.4 million in the second quarter compared to $21.5 million in the prior year. The volume of payments made was flat with the prior year period while the average revenue per trade increased by 9% as compared to the prior year period. Similar to the first quarter of 2018, the volume of payments declined and the average revenue per trade increased as compared to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, as certain commercial customers who had previously transacted their individual high volume but low value payments through our platform, opened their own bank accounts in certain countries to which we had made payments into on their behalf. However, we still made the foreign currency funding payments into their accounts on an aggregated basis in these countries. Ultimately we were able to capture higher operating revenues as compared to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 and the number of payments made were reduced which drove an increase in the average revenue per trade. Operating revenues declined $1.2 million versus the immediately preceding first quarter of 2018 as the first quarter of our fiscal year benefits from strong transactional volumes from our non-governmental charitable organizations during the holiday season.\nSegment income increased 15% to $13.5 million in the second quarter compared to $11.7 million in the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from the increase in operating revenues, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in non-variable direct expenses versus the prior year period, primarily driven by higher non-variable compensation and trade system costs. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues were decreased to 25% in the second quarter as compared to 28% in the prior year, primarily as a result of a decrease in introducing broker commissions.\nSecurities\nIn our Securities segment, we provide value-added solutions that facilitate cross border trading in the equity markets as well as act as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, including U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agency, Agency Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities to a customer base including asset managers, commercial bank trust and investment departments, broker-dealers, and insurance companies. In addition, we also originate, structure and place debt instruments in the international and domestic capital markets as well as operate an asset management business in Argentina.\nOperating revenues increased 46% to $55.5 million in the second quarter compared to $37.9 million in the prior year.\nOperating revenues in our Securities segment are comprised of activities in four product lines, Equity Market-Making, Debt Trading, Investment Banking and Asset Management. Operating revenues in Equity Market-Making increased 81% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Gross dollar volume traded increased 35% driven by increased market volatility, the on-boarding of new customers and an increase in market share, while the average revenue per $1,000 traded increased 17% versus the prior year. Equity Market-Making operating revenues include the trading profits we earn before the related expense deduction for ADR conversion fees. These ADR fees are included in the consolidated income statements as ‘transaction-based clearing expenses’.\nOperating revenues in Debt Trading increased, $4.4 million or 22% in the second quarter compared to the prior year, driven by increases in our domestic institutional fixed income business as well as in our Argentina and municipal securities businesses. Asset Management operating revenues increased 5% in the second quarter as compared to the prior year, despite a 14% decline in average assets under management to $469.8 million in the second quarter compared to $548.9 million in the prior year.\nSegment income increased 9% to $12.8 million in the second quarter compared to $11.7 million in the prior year. This was driven by the increase in operating revenues, which was partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in transaction-based clearing fees in Equity Market-Making as well as a $8.2 million increase in interest expense, driven by both increases in short term interest rates in our Debt Trading business and an increase in securities lending activities. Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 39% in the second quarter compared to 36% in the prior year, primarily as the result of an increase in transaction-based clearing expenses.\nPhysical Commodities\nIn our Physical Commodities segment, we provide a full range of trading and hedging capabilities, including OTC products, to select producers, consumers and investors in precious metals. Additionally, we act as principal to facilitate financing, structured pricing and logistics services to clients across the commodity complex, including energy commodities, grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products.\nOperating revenues for Physical Commodities increased 38% to $15.5 million in the second quarter compared to $11.2 million in the prior year.\nPrecious Metals operating revenues increased 53% to $8.9 million in the second quarter compared to $5.8 million in the prior year as a result of a 102% increase in the number of ounces traded, which was partially offset by a 24% decline in the average revenue per ounce traded as compared to the prior year. Second quarter operating revenues include a $1.3 million reversal of a first quarter 2018 unrealized loss on derivative positions held against precious metals inventory carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value in our non-broker dealer subsidiaries.\nOperating revenues in Physical Ag & Energy increased 22% to $6.6 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. The increase in operating revenues is primarily due to business expansion in our U.S. subsidiary FCStone Merchant Services, LLC, highlighted by an increase in physical cotton transactions in the current period.\nSegment income increased 44% to $5.6 million in the second quarter compared to $3.9 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in operating revenues, which was partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in non-variable compensation and benefits, a $0.2 million increase in professional fees incurred related to our exit of our physical coal business and a $0.5 million increase in bad debt expense. The increase in bad debt expense related to a $0.7 million bad debt in our Precious Metals business which was partially offset by a $0.2 million recovery of previously recorded bad debt expense in our Physical Ag & Energy business.\nClearing and Execution Services\nOur CES segment provides competitive and efficient clearing and execution in all major futures and securities exchanges globally as well as prime brokerage in all major foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. Following our acquisition of the Sterne Agee correspondent securities clearing business, we are an independent full-service provider to introducing broker-dealers (“IBD’s”) of clearing, custody, research, syndicated and security-based lending products and services, including a proprietary technology platform which offers seamless connectivity to ensure a positive customer experience through the clearing and settlement process. Also as part of this transaction, we acquired Sterne Agee’s independent wealth management business which offers a comprehensive product suite to retail customers nationwide.\nOperating revenues increased 37% to $88.0 million in the second quarter compared to $64.2 million in the prior year.\nOperating revenues in our Exchange-traded Futures & Options business increased 77% to a record $49.6 million in the second quarter compared to $28.0 million in the prior year as a result of a 51% increase in exchange-traded volumes and a 21% increase in the average rate per contract compared to the prior year period. In addition, interest income in the Exchange-traded Futures & Options business increased $1.8 million to $3.9 million in the second quarter primarily as a result of an increase in short-term rates and a 10% increase in average customer equity to $1.2 billion.\nOperating revenues in our FX Prime Brokerage increased 16% compared to the prior year to $5.0 million in the second quarter, despite a 28% decline in foreign exchange volumes, as market volatility drove a widening of spreads in this business.\nCorrespondent Clearing operating revenues declined 1% as compared to the prior year to $6.8 million in the second quarter, while operating revenues in Independent Wealth Management increased 2% versus the prior year to $18.8 million. Included within these operating revenues, Correspondent Clearing and Independent Wealth Management businesses had interest income of $1.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Operating revenues in Derivative Voice Brokerage increased 20% to $7.8 million in the second quarter as compared to the prior year.\nSegment income increased to $12.7 million in the second quarter compared to $7.9 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the increase in operating revenues. Segment income in the second quarter includes a $0.9 million quarterly charge to compensation and benefits per the terms of the acquisition of the Derivative Voice Brokerage business which will continue to be expensed through the end of fiscal 2018 based upon the employees’ continued employment. Variable expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of operating revenues were 71% in the second quarter compared to 69% in the prior year.\nConference Call & Web Cast\nA conference call will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.
