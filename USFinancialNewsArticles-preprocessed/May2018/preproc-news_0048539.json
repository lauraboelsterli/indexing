They are going to want to be back in the market.”\n“Technology, industrials, energy, financials, consumer discretionary are going to benefit today. You may include areas of the market that are involved in trade with China, I think that’s what’s going to help.”\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.21 percent gain. Apple, which counts China as major growth market, rose 1.4 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.\nThe industrial sector gained 1.20 percent, led by a 2.4 percent jump in Boeing, which sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers. Caterpillar gained 2.3 percent.\nAt 9:54 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 277.12 points, or 1.12 percent, at 24,992.21, the S&P 500 was up 20.17 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,733.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 66.85 points, or 0.91 percent, at 7,421.19.\nThe biggest Dow gainer was General Electric, which rose 2.1 percent after the company said it would merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec in an $11.1 billion deal. Wabtec jumped about 5 percent to a near three-year high.\nStill, not all U.S. business leaders were happy to see the trade spat ratcheting down, with some saying it would be difficult for Washington to rebuild momentum to address what they see as troubling Chinese policies.\nHowever, the United States delaying implementing tariffs on Chinese imports hit steel stocks. AK Steel and U.S. Steel Corp each fell more than 3 percent.\nChipmakers, whose major clients include Chinese companies, also posted broad gains, supported by Micron lifting current-quarter forecast.\nMicron surged 4.4 percent, while Intel gained 2.3 percent. All members of the Philadelphia chip index were higher, with the index gaining 1.81 percent.\nShares of regional bank MB Financial jumped 13.9 percent after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy the smaller rival in a $4.7 billion deal. Shares of Fifth Third fell 7.1 percent, the most on the S&P.\nThe S&P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 109 new highs and 10 new lows.
