    "text": "DUBAI, May 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has cut eight positions within its equities research team in Dubai, as it moves to close the unit as part of a global scaling back of equities business, sources familiar with the matter said.\nA Dubai-based spokesman for the bank declined to comment.\nThe sources declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.\nDeutsche pledged last week to cut at least 7,000 jobs under a restructuring.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
