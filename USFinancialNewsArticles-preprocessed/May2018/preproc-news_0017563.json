That could put at risk the approval of the budget law and recent data has eroded confidence in the country’s economic recovery.”\nOther Southern European government bond yields — which move inversely to price — were also higher by 4-5 bps.\nYields in broader euro zone bond markets were also higher as strong German data soothed concerns over the euro zone’s largest economy and increased expectations the ECB will withdraw stimulus as planned.\nGerman industrial output rose more than expected in March, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that factories in Europe’s largest economy ended the first quarter on a strong footing after two disappointing months.\nSeparate data published by the Federal Statistics Office showed exports rose 1.7 percent in March while imports fell 0.9 percent.\n“After weak German industrial orders yesterday, today’s numbers look much better and point towards decent GDP growth in Germany,” said Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield was up 3 bps at 0.56 percent, also pushed up by broad optimism across global markets.\nOil prices remained in focus, falling some 3 percent in late trade after having hit new multi-year highs this week on concerns about the fate of Iran’s nuclear deal.\nThe euro meanwhile fell below $1.19 to its weakest level since late December.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe, Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
