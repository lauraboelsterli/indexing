The Company’s method of calculating TCE is consistent with industry standards and is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses) by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage and are paid by the charterer under a time charter contract, as well as commissions. TCE revenues, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues from the Company’s vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, because it assists the Company’s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. TCE is also a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Please see below for a reconciliation of TCE rates to voyage revenues.\n(6) Daily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days net of laid-up days for the relevant time period.\nDrybulk, Tanker and Gas Carrier Segments Summary Operating Data (unaudited) - continued\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for TCE rate, which is expressed in U.S. Dollars, and voyage days)\nDrybulk Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Voyage revenues $ 8,488 $ 22,533 Voyage expenses (1,916 ) (1,698 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ 6,572 $ 20,835 Total voyage days for fleet 1,170 1,890 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ 5,617 $ 11,024\nTanker Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Voyage revenues $ - $ 11,229 Voyage expenses - (4,034 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ - $ 7,195 Total voyage days for fleet - 360 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ - $ 19,986\nGas Carrier Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Voyage revenues $ - $ 10,293 Voyage expenses - (408 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ - $ 9,885 Total voyage days for fleet - 350 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ - $ 28,243 DryShips Inc.\nFinancial Statements\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Expressed in Thousands of U.S. Dollars\nexcept for share and per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 REVENUES: Voyage revenues $ 11,808 $ 44,055 11,808 44,055 EXPENSES: Voyage expenses 2,234 6,140 Vessel operating expenses 8,154 18,100 Depreciation 812 6,818 General and administrative expenses 8,713 7,169 Other, net (12 ) (18 ) Operating income/(loss) (8,093 ) 5,846 OTHER INCOME / (EXPENSES): Interest and finance costs, net of interest income (2,439 ) (4,890 ) Other, net (175 ) (183 ) Total other expenses, net (2,614 ) (5,073 ) Net income/(loss) (10,707 ) 773 Net income/(loss) attributable to DryShips Inc.\n$ (10,707 )\n$ 773 Net income/(loss) attributable to DryShips Inc. common stockholders (10,707 ) 773 Earnings/(Losses) per common share, basic and diluted (1) $ (168.69 ) $ 0.01 Weighted average number of shares, basic and diluted (1) 63,470 103,682,222 (1) Share and per share data for 2017 give effect to cumulative 1-for-980 reverse stock splits between April 11, 2017 and July 21, 2017.\nDryShips Inc.\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Expressed in Thousands of U.S. Dollars) December 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 ASSETS Cash, cash equivalents, including restricted cash (current and non-current) $ 30,226 $ 88,177 Other current and non-current assets 123,713 90,108 Advances for vessels under construction 31,898 - Vessels, net 749,088 819,366 Total assets 934,925 997,651 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Total debt 216,969 295,998 Total other liabilities 10,920 8,782 Total stockholders’ equity 707,036 692,871 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 934,925 $ 997,651 SHARE COUNT DATA Common stock issued 104,274,708 104,274,708 Less: Treasury stock - (2,816,445) Common stock issued and outstanding 104,274,708 101,458,263 Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-cash items as described below.
