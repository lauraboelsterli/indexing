    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 6:16 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Icahn, Deason want at least $40 per share for Xerox Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason would consider a bid for Xerox Corp XNX.N of $40 (29.50 pounds) per share, or a split with Fujifilm ( 4901.T ) that left the company independent, to resolve an ongoing proxy fight, they said in a letter on Monday. Billionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York, U.S. on February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe letter comes after Xerox on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ), just hours after the printer and copier maker announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place.\nXerox was not immediately available to comment on the letter.
