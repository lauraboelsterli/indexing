Our strategy going forward is to continue on our path to return the company to profitable operations. It has not been an easy path toward attaining this goal. Our business transformation journey requires a careful balancing of priorities, beginning with the challenges associated with reducing expenses while delivering modest revenue growth.

Non-GAAP measures are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the tables below.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to TIS’ GAAP results provided in the attached financial statements for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, and the other periods presented, and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The tables below reconcile each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. TIS’ management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding TIS’ performance by excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of TIS’ core business operating results. TIS’ management believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing TIS’ performance in addition to the GAAP results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons to TIS’ historical performance and its competitors’ operating results. TIS includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nTIS Investors Contact:\nJames Carbonara\nPartner, Hayden IR\njames@haydenir.com (646) 755-7412\nAbout Top Image Systems\nTop Image Systems™ (TIS™) Ltd. is a global innovator of on-premise and cloud-based applications that optimize content-driven business processes such as procure to pay operations , remittance processing , integrated receivables, customer response management and more.
