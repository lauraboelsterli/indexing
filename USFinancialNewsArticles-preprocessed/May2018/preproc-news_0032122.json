Rugby Union - Premiership - Wasps v Northampton Saints - Ricoh Arena, Coventry, Britain - April 29, 2018 Wasps' Danny Cipriani waves to the fans after the match Action Images/Andrew Boyers\nThe 30-year-old has played a key role in Wasps’ qualification for the Premiership semi-finals and his form has led to a recall to the England squad after a three-year absence.\nCipriani will look to stake a claim for a place in England’s 2019 World Cup squad on next month’s tour of South Africa.\n\"Having spoken in depth with (Gloucester director of rugby) David Humphreys and (head coach) Johan Ackermann, the future they have planned for the club is enticing and one that I very much want to be part of,\" Cipriani told Gloucester's website www.gloucesterrugby.co.uk .\n“It’s the most exciting move of my career to date.”\nCipriani, who has won 14 caps for England, will hope to end his time at Wasps on a high by helping them reach the Premiership final.
