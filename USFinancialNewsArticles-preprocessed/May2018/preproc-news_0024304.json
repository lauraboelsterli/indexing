    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (NYSE: GPMT) announced today the closing of GPMT 2018-FL1, an $826 million collateralized loan obligation (\"CLO\"), which financed 25 existing GPMT first mortgage loan investments. The CLO has an initial advance rate of approximately 80% and a weighted average interest rate at issuance of LIBOR + 1.27%. Proceeds from the CLO issuance were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balances on the company’s financing facilities and will also be used to fund new loan investments.\nJack Taylor, Chief Executive Officer of Granite Point Mortgage Trust, said, “The closing of our inaugural $826 million CLO transaction is a major milestone for our Company and a significant additional step in executing our strategy of diversifying our financing sources and reducing our cost of funds. This transaction attractively finances about a third of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2018, while providing matched-term, non-recourse and non-mark-to-market funding. It also allows us more flexibility as we continue to manage our balance sheet and provides us more capacity to grow.”\nWells Fargo Securities acted as sole structuring agent, co-lead manager and joint bookrunner.
