    "text": "ROSEMONT, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE: USFD), one of the largest foodservice distributors in the United States, today announced results for first quarter fiscal 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal case volume decreased 2.3%; independent restaurant case volume increased 4.3% Net sales increased 0.6% to $5.8 billion Gross profit of $992 million increased 0.1% Income before income taxes increased $28 million to $63 million Net income of $67 million increased $40 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2% to $224 million Diluted EPS of $0.31; Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.35\nCEO Perspective\n“During the first quarter we saw solid growth with independent restaurants and expanded Gross profit per case by $0.19, our highest quarterly per case growth rate in recent history. Execution on our gross profit and operating expense initiatives drove 4.2% Adjusted EBITDA growth despite headwinds from weather and inbound freight costs,” said Chairman and CEO Pietro Satriano. “Our outlook for independent restaurants and the overall industry remains strong and we are well positioned to deliver on another successful year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal case volume decreased 2.3% from the prior year with organic case volume declining 3.2%. Independent restaurant case volume increased 4.3%, of which 2.7% was organic growth. The decrease in total case volume was driven primarily by the planned exits of select chain customers and adverse weather conditions throughout the quarter.\nNet sales of $5.8 billion increased 0.6% from the prior year, primarily driven by inflation in the beef, produce, dairy and grocery categories which was partially offset by a decline in case volume. Sales from acquisitions completed during the last four fiscal quarters increased Net sales by approximately 1.4%.\nGross profit of $992 million increased $1 million, or 0.1% from the prior year, driven by margin expansion initiatives which were partially offset by higher inbound freight costs, a decline in case volume and an increase in the year-over-year LIFO reserve expense. Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 17.0%. Adjusted Gross profit was $1.0 billion, a 1.0% increase from prior year, driven by margin expansion initiatives which were partially offset by higher inbound freight costs and a decline in case volume. Adjusted Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 17.4%.\nOperating expenses were $889 million, a decrease of 2.8% from the prior year. Operating expenses benefitted from lower amortization expense resulting from the full amortization of an intangible asset as well as ongoing efforts to reduce operating expenses. Adjusted Operating expenses for the quarter were $789 million, a 0.4% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by higher wage costs.\nIncome before income taxes was $63 million, a $28 million increase from the prior year.\nNet income for the quarter was $67 million, up $40 million from $27 million in the prior year, as a result of the Gross profit and Operating expense factors discussed above as well as a $13 million year-over-year tax benefit driven primarily by discrete tax items. Adjusted EBITDA of $224 million increased $9 million, or 4.2% compared to prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.31 and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.35.\nCash Flow and Capital Transactions\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $192 million, an increase of $70 million from the prior year related to improvements in working capital and better business performance. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $57 million, a decrease of $13 million from prior year, due to the timing of projects in the 2018 fiscal year and payments in the first quarter fiscal 2017 for assets acquired late in the fourth quarter fiscal 2016.\nNet Debt at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, a decrease of $94 million versus the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2017. The ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3x at the end of the quarter, down from 3.4x at the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2017.\nOutlook for Fiscal Year 2018\nFor fiscal year 2018 the company now expects total case volume growth of approximately 1% and Net sales growth of approximately 3%. All other fiscal year 2018 guidance numbers announced on February 15, 2018, remain unchanged including Adjusted EBITDA growth of 6-8% and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.00-$2.10.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nUS Foods first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call will be broadcast live via the internet on May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CDT.

These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “target,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “forecast,” “mission,” “strive,” “goal,” or similar expressions and are based upon various assumptions and our experience in the industry, as well as historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments. However, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and there are a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: cost inflation/deflation and commodity volatility; competition; reliance on third-party suppliers; interruption of product supply or increases in product costs; our substantial indebtedness and restrictions placed upon us under our debt agreements; potential interest rate increases; customer retention and changes in our relationships with group purchasing organizations; our ability to achieve increased sales to independent restaurants; successful consummation and integration of acquisitions; realization of the expected benefits from our cost savings initiatives; fuel shortages or volatility in fuel costs; industry and general economic factors affecting consumer confidence and buying and eating habits; product liability claims; our reputation in the industry; labor relations and continued access to qualified labor; pricing and cost structures; environmental, occupational health and safety, and food safety compliance; government laws and regulations, and potential changes in existing laws or regulations; technology disruptions and our ability to implement new technologies; cybersecurity incidents; management of retirement benefits and pension liabilities; business disruptions caused by extreme weather conditions; litigation risk; adequate protection of our brand/trade names; and risks associated with intellectual property including potential infringement.\nFor a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2018. The forward-looking statements contained in this release speak only as of the date of this release. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Operating expenses, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures regarding our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use Adjusted Gross profit and Adjusted Operating expenses to focus on period-over-period changes in our business and believe this information is helpful to investors. Adjusted Gross profit is Gross profit adjusted to remove the impact of the LIFO inventory reserve changes. Adjusted Operating expenses are Operating expenses adjusted to exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance, as well other items noted in our debt agreements.\nWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. EBITDA is Net income, plus Interest expense-net, Income tax (benefit)/provision, and Depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for 1) Restructuring charges and Tangible asset impairments; 2) Share-based compensation expense; 3) the non-cash impact of LIFO reserve adjustments; 4) Business transformation costs; and 5) other gains, losses, or charges as specified in our debt agreements.\nWe use Net Debt to review the liquidity of our operations. Net Debt is defined as total debt net of total Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash remaining on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. We believe that Net Debt is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Net Debt is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Cash Flows Provided by Operations or Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities.\nWe believe that Adjusted Net income is a useful measure of operating performance for both management and investors because it excludes items that are not reflective of our core operating performance and provides an additional view of our operating performance including depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and Income taxes on a consistent basis from period to period. Adjusted Net income is Net income excluding such items as Restructuring benefits and charges, tangible asset impairments, Share-based compensation expense, the non-cash impacts of LIFO reserve adjustments, Business transformation costs (costs associated with the redesign of systems and processes), and other items, and adjusted for the tax effect of the exclusions and discrete tax items. We believe that Adjusted Net income is used by investors, analysts, and other interested parties to facilitate period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity as to how factors and trends impact our operating performance.\nWe use Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Diluted Earnings per Share, by excluding the same items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to investors because the measurement excludes amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. We also believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to investors because these metrics are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in our industry.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors as they assist in highlighting trends, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (d) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures, and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used in connection with certain covenants and restricted activities under our debt agreements. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nWe caution readers that our definitions of Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Operating expenses, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted Diluted EPS may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures used by other companies. Definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the schedules attached to this press release. We have not, however, provided a reconciliation of our full fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook because we are not able to accurately estimate all the adjustments on a forward-looking basis and such items could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results as a result of their variability.\nUS FOODS HOLDING CORP.
