    "text": "President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was considering a pardon for celebrity chef and television personality Martha Stewart , as well as commuting the sentence of disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\nThe president told reporters about his thinking while on a flight to Texas. The president earlier in the day announced that he would pardon conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza .\nNuccio DiNuzzo | Chicago Tribune | MCT | Getty Images Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich prepares to deliver a statement on his last full day of freedom at his Chicago home on Wednesday, March 14, 2012. Stewart, who was convicted of multiple felony charges in 2004, was prosecuted by former FBI Director James Comey , and served five months in federal prison. Comey was fired by Trump last year and has since become an outspoken critic of his administration.\nTrump has shared mixed opinions about Stewart in the past.\nIn a 2006 letter to Stewart, the president blamed her for the poor ratings of NBC's \"The Apprentice: Martha Stewart,\" a spinoff of Trump's \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\nThe next month, he said of Stewart: \"She's a wonderful woman.\"\nYears later, in a 2013 tweet, Trump wrote: \"She looks terrific, better than ever, any guy would be lucky to be with her.\"\nI watched @ todayshow this AM re: @ MarthaStewart & dating. She looks terrific, better than ever, any guy would be lucky to be with her.\nPatrick Fitzgerald, a personal friend of James Comey, oversaw the prosecution of Blagojevich on public corruption charges in 2011. Fitzgerald joined Comey's legal team following the former FBI director's firing last year.\nBlagojevich is in the sixth year of a 14-year sentence in Colorado prison. The Illinois Democrat was found guilty of attempting to trade the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama for money or favors.\nBlagojevich also has a connection to Trump's \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" appearing on she show in Spring 2010.\nRepresentatives for Stewart and Blagojevich did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
