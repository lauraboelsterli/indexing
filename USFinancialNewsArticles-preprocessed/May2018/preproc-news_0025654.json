The Company's adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance excludes any non-operating or non-recurring expenses that may materialize during fiscal 2018. The Company is not providing GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the potential occurrence of one or more non-operating, one-time expenses, which the Company does not believe it can reliably predict.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call today at 2:30 p.m. MST (4:30 p.m. EST).

Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We define Non-GAAP Net Income as GAAP net income less certain tax adjusted non-recurring one-time expenses incurred during the period and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by weighted-average shares outstanding.\nWe are presenting Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share because management believes that they provide additional ways to view our operations when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income, which we believe provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share are presented solely as supplemental disclosure because: (i) we believe these measures are a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business without the effect of these items; (ii) we believe that investors will find this data useful in assessing shareholder value; and (iii) we use Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share internally as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors. The use of Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share has limitations and you should not consider these measures in isolation from or as an alternative to the relevant GAAP measure of net income prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\nThe tables set forth below present Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures to Net Income and Earnings per Share, our most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestor Relations Contacts:\nScott Van Winkle\nManaging Director, ICR\n(617) 956-6736\nscott.vanwinkle@icrinc.com\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited) (In thousands, except per share data) March 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 ASSETS Current assets 13,952 $ 11,458 Accounts receivable 1,329 1,334 Income tax receivable 280 913 Inventory, net 15,816 16,575 Prepaid expenses and deposits 7,852 5,266 39,229 35,546 Property and equipment, net 5,660 3,127 Intangible assets, net 1,148 1,247 Long-term deferred income tax asset 3,593 4,087 Other long-term assets 1,299 1,242 TOTAL ASSETS $ 50,929 $ 45,249 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 4,629 $ 4,850 Commissions payable 7,372 6,837 Income tax payable 72 215 Other accrued expenses 11,617 9,453 Current portion of long-term debt 2,000 2,000 Total current liabilities 25,690 23,355 Long-term debt Principal amount 4,000 5,500 Less: unamortized discount and deferred offering costs (35 ) (60 ) Long-term debt, net of unamortized discount and deferred offering costs 3,965 5,440 Other long-term liabilities 1,972 1,927 Total liabilities 31,627 30,722 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity Preferred stock — par value $0.0001 and $0.001 per share, 5,000 and 50,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding — — Common stock — par value $0.0001 and $0.001 per share, 40,000 and 250,000 shares authorized and 14,307 and 14,232 issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively 1 14 Additional paid-in capital 123,955 121,599 Accumulated deficit (104,723 ) (106,992 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 69 (94 ) Total stockholders’ equity 19,302 14,527 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $ 50,929 $ 45,249\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Revenue, net $ 50,562 $ 45,007 $ 149,171 $ 148,848 Cost of sales 8,921 8,233 26,778 24,565 Gross profit 41,641 36,774 122,393 124,283 Operating expenses: Commissions and incentives 24,320 22,843 71,124 72,679 Selling, general and administrative 15,023 13,708 45,246 48,695 Total operating expenses 39,343 36,551 116,370 121,374 Operating income 2,298 223 6,023 2,909 Other expense: Interest expense (92 ) (131 ) (357 ) (406 ) Other income (expense), net 27 (32 ) (120 ) (353 ) Total other expense (65 ) (163 ) (477 ) (759 ) Income before income taxes 2,233 60 5,546 2,150 Income tax (expense) benefit (598 ) 1 (2,777 ) (626 ) Net income $ 1,635 $ 61 $ 2,769 $ 1,524 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ — $ 0.20 $ 0.11 Diluted $ 0.12 $ — $ 0.20 $ 0.11 Weighted-average shares outstanding: Basic 14,006 13,915 13,975 13,858 Diluted 14,178 14,105 14,136 14,122\nLIFEVANTAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Revenue by Region (unaudited) Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In thousands) Americas $ 38,026 75 % $ 34,379 76 % $ 111,092 74 % $ 112,127 75 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 12,536 25 % 10,628 24 % 38,079 26 % 36,721 25 % Total $ 50,562 100 % $ 45,007 100 % $ 149,171 100 % $ 148,848 100 % Active Independent Distributors (1) (unaudited) As of March 31, 2018 2017 Americas 45,000 71 % 46,000 73 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 18,000 29 % 17,000 27 % Total 63,000 100 % 63,000 100 % Active Preferred Customers (2) (unaudited) As of March 31, 2018 2017 Americas 89,000 81 % 89,000 80 % Asia/Pacific & Europe 21,000 19 % 22,000 20 % Total 110,000 100 % 111,000 100 % (1) Active Independent Distributors have purchased product in the prior three months for retail or personal consumption.
