    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Reuters) - South Africaâ€™s Barloworld Limited on Tuesday said it expected its half year profit to rise by as much as 20 percent boosted by its Southern African and Russian equipment businesses.\nIt expects headline earnings per share (HEPS) for continuing operations for the six months to 31 March of 440 to 480 cents, up from 400 cents a year earlier.\nHEPS strips out certain once-off items and is the main profit measure used in South Africa.\nBarloworld said last month it would sell its underperforming Iberian equipment business.\nReporting by Patricia Aruo; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
