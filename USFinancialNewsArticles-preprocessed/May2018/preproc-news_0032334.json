FILE PHOTO: A Thomson Reuters logo is pictured on a building during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland January 25, 2018. Picture taken January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\nThomson Reuters told clients on Tuesday that it had applied to the Irish central bank for a licence. It will be used to cover the derivatives business — the largest in Europe — which trades more than $300 billion a day, the FT said.\nThe business is part of the trading operations being bought by private equity group Blackstone.\nThomson Reuters, controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News.
