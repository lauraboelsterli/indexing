The Company also reported the appointment of Franz Walt to the position of Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Walt has 30 years' experience in leadership roles at two of the largest and most influential global healthcare companies, Siemens Healthineers and Roche.\nFranz Walt, Chief Executive Officer of Quotient said “In my capacity as full time CEO I am very pleased to report our progress with respect to European field trials for the initial blood grouping (IH) microarray which began earlier this month. The concordance phase of the field trial is ongoing. Based on our daily discordance analysis thus far we remain confident in the likely outcome of this phase of the trial and reaffirm our plan to report final concordance data in June. Mr. Walt added, “The MosaiQ platform has the potential to deliver substantial savings to our customers by providing ‘walk away’ automation and standardized testing workflows while affordably permitting the comprehensive characterization of all units of donated blood.”\nMosaiQ Platform\nMosaiQ, Quotient's next-generation platform is designed to deliver fast, comprehensive antigen typing, antibody detection and disease screening results, using a single low volume sample in a high throughput automated format. MosaiQ represents a transformative and highly disruptive unified testing platform for transfusion diagnostics. Feasibility has also been demonstrated with respect to the detection of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) using the MosaiQ platform. Through MosaiQ, Quotient expects to deliver substantial value to donor testing laboratories worldwide by providing affordable, routine comprehensive characterization and screening of blood products, on a single automated instrument platform designed to radically reduce labor costs and complexity associated with existing practice.\nRegulatory and Commercial Milestones\nEuropean Regulatory Approval – Quotient expects to file for European regulatory approvals for our initial MosaiQ IH microarray in the second half of calendar 2018 and for the initial Serological Disease Screening (SDS) microarray in the first half of calendar 2019 European Commercialization – Quotient has already received invitations to participate in tenders once MosaiQ has obtained European approval for the initial IH microarray IH Microarray Ongoing Development – Quotient plans for the expansion of the IH antigen testing menu during the second half of calendar 2018 U.S. Field Trials – Quotient expect to commence U.S. field trials with the expanded antigen testing menu in the first half of calendar 2019 U.S. Regulatory Approval – Quotient expects to file for U.S. and European regulatory approval for the expanded IH microarray in the second half of calendar 2019\nFranz Walt commented “Having achieved the milestone of starting the European field trial and based on everything we have learned so far, we have slightly modified our time lines for the completion of our second blood typing microarray which is planned to include antibodies for the detection of up to an additional 13 clinically significant antigens. This microarray will be the product that we expect to take into U.S. field trials in the first half of 2019.”\nFiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\n“The conventional reagent business generated record results in terms of revenue and profitability during fiscal 2018, with product revenues growing 18.8% year-over-year,” said Franz Walt. “Quotient generated gross profit of 58.7% and 930 basis points of gross margin improvement on product sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We are targeting a continuation of solid growth and profitability for this business in the coming fiscal year.”\nKey revenue and profit results are summarized below (expressed in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenue: Product sales —OEM Customers $ 4,275 $ 3,356 $ 16,900 $ 14,216 Product sales — direct customers and distributors 1,849 1,370 7,013 5,911 Other revenues 13 800 819 2,100 Total revenue $ 6,137 $ 5,526 $ 24,732 $ 22,227 Product sales from standing orders (%) 77 % 81 % 75 % 76 % Gross profit $ 3,609 $ 3,136 $ 14,261 $ 11,383 Gross profit as a % of total revenue 58.8 % 56.7 % 57.7 % 51.2 % Gross margin on product sales (%) 58.7 % 49.4 % 56.2 % 46.1 % Operating (loss) $ (17,927 ) $ (17,739 ) $ (69,988 ) $ (74,059 ) Capital expenditures totaled $21.6 million in fiscal 2018 (“FY18”), compared with $20.2 million in fiscal 2017 (“FY17”), reflecting continued investment in the Eysins, Switzerland manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment for MosaiQ consumables, along with expenditures related to the construction of our new conventional reagent manufacturing facility near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nQuotient ended 4QFY18 with $ 25.8 million in cash and other short-term investments, $85.0 million of long-term debt and $5.0 million in an offsetting long term restricted cash reserve account. Quotient’s near-term funding plans include the expected issuance of an additional $36 million aggregate principal amount of its 12% senior secured notes upon the publication of European field trial results for the MosaiQ IH microarray reflecting concordance with predicate technologies of at least 99% for antigen typing and 95% for antibody detection and up to $49 million from the exercise of warrants issued in October 2017 with an exercise price of $5.80 per share.\nOutlook for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2019\nTotal product sales in the range of $25 to $26 million compared to product sales in FY18 of $23.9 million. Other revenue (product development fees) of approximately $1.5 million are also expected to be earned during the year. Forecast other revenue assumes the receipt of milestone payments contingent upon achievement of regulatory approval for certain products under development. The receipt of these milestone payments involves risks and uncertainties\nOperating loss in the range of $50 to $60 million including non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and stock compensation totaling approximately $15 million.\nCapital expenditures in the range of $5 to $10 million.\nProduct sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (“FY19”) are expected to be within the range of $6.7 to $7.3 million, compared with $6.2 million for the first quarter of FY18.\nQuarterly product sales can fluctuate depending upon the shipment cycles for red blood cell based products, which account for approximately two-thirds of current product sales. These products typically experience 13 shipment cycles per year, equating to three shipments of each product per quarter, except for one quarter per year when four shipments occur. The timing of shipment of bulk antisera products to OEM customers may also move revenues from quarter to quarter. Some seasonality in demand is also experienced around holiday periods in both Europe and the United States. As a result of these factors, Quotient expects to continue to see seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variations in product sales. The timing of product development fees included in other revenues is mostly dependent upon the achievement of pre-negotiated project milestones.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that Quotient will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has incurred net losses from operations in each year since it commenced operations in 2007 and had an accumulated deficit of $275.6 million as of March 31, 2018. The Company expects to include disclosure within its Annual Form 10-K in respect of certain conditions concerning the Company’s overall liquidity position that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, which the Company’s auditors will also reference in their report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nConference Call\nQuotient will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 29 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its fourth quarter fiscal 2018 financial results. Participants may access the call by dialing 1-877-407-0784 in the U.S. or 1-201-689-8560 outside the U.S. The conference call will be webcast live on the Company’s website at www.quotientbd.com .\nA replay of this conference call will be available through June 6 by dialing 1-844-512-2921 in the U.S. or 1-412-317-6671 outside the U.S. The replay access code is 13679376.\nAbout Quotient Limited\nQuotient is a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets.
