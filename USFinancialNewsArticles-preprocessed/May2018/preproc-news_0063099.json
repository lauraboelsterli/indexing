    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli will move slowly in trying to form a technocratic government in order to give parties time to try to agree on a more “political” administration, a source close President Sergio Mattarella said.\nMattarella gave Cottarelli a mandate on Monday to form a government, but the former International Monetary Fund official has not yet come up with a cabinet team and all the main political parties have said they will not back him in parliament.\nAt the same time, parties have called for fresh elections while negotiating over a possible coalition deal to end almost three months of political deadlock accompanied by market turmoil.\nMattarella and Cottarelli met on Wednesday and “decided together not to rush things (to favor) a possible political government,” the source said.\nReporting by Massimiliano Di Giorgio, writing by Gavin Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
