    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe , founder of The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC , announces that a federal class action lawsuit has been filed against Myriad Genetics (“Myriad” or “Company”) (NasdaqGS: MYGN) and several officers and directors for acts taken during the period of August 13, 2014 and March 12, 2018 (the “Class Period”).\nBased upon the allegations in the class action, the firm is investigating additional legal claims against the officers and Board of Directors of Myriad. If you are an affected Myriad shareholder and want to learn more about the lawsuit or join the action, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or call toll free at (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nIn the complaint, the defendants are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants’ misrepresented and/or failed to disclose during the Class Period that: (i) Myriad was submitting false or otherwise improper claims for payment under Medicare and Medicaid for the company’s hereditary cancer testing; (ii) the foregoing conduct would foreseeably subject Myriad to heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement action; (iii) Myriad’s revenues from its hereditary cancer testing were in part the product of improper conduct and unlikely to be sustainable; and (iv) as a result, Myriad’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn March 12, 2018, Myriad disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, in connection with “an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted for payment under Medicare and Medicaid,” specifically relating to Myriad’s hereditary cancer testing. The subpoena covers a time period from January 1, 2014 through the date of the subpoena’s issuance. When this news was revealed to the market, the Company’s stock dropped significantly.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180517005729/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC",
