The trade balance was in surplus for the previous two months.\nThe yield for the government bond due 2026 was barely changed, up 1 basis point to 8.540.\nStocks ended lower, extending the losing streak to the third straight session in line with emerging markets peers as investors fret over Italy’s political crisis.\nThe benchmark JSE Top-40 index fell 0.7 percent to 49,287 and the broader All-share index was off 0.6 percent to 55,601.\nAmong movers, Gold Fields lost 2.4 percent as the price of bullion faltered. On the upside, Spar and Nampak gained 2.3 percent and 2.9 percent, boosted stronger earnings reports. (Reporting by Patricia Aruo and Tiisetso Motsoeneng Editing by Alison Williams)",
