    "text": "The U.S. government needs to do more to support start-ups to secure its future as a technological innovator, former Cisco CEO John Chambers said Thursday.\n\"We're the only country in the world that not only does not have a digitization program, but we don't have a start-up program,\" Chambers said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\nDespite a president who supports business growth, the government has actually created a hostile environment for start-ups, said Chambers, who is now a venture capitalist.\n\"The key thing from the government â€” make it simple to start a start-up and easy to go public. It's unbelievably difficult in this country,\" he added.\nHe also pushed for widespread changes in a broken education system.\n\"For start-ups to work, you have to change the education system, which we all know is broken,\" he said. \"When I pop into class in France and start to tell them what artificial intelligence is, they are already teaching that class.\"\nA few major tech companies like Spotify and Dropbox have gone public this year, but Chambers said that isn't enough.\nChambers' venture capital firm, JC2 Ventures, currently has a portfolio of nine start-ups listed on its website. He said he plans to invest in more.",
