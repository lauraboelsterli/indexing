FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Leicester City v Arsenal - King Power Stadium, Leicester, Britain - May 9, 2018 Arsenal players appeal after Henrikh Mkhitaryan brought down Leicester City's Demarai Gray in the area leading to a penalty Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nThe incident occurred in the 75th minute of the game, when Leicester were awarded a penalty following a foul on Demarai Gray and Arsenal’s players surrounded referee Graham Scott to protest against the decision.\nArsenal were charged with “failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion,” according to a statement on the FA twitter account @FAspokesperson.\nJamie Vardy tucked home the spot-kick to put Leicester 2-1 up on the night, before Riyad Mahrez added gloss to the scoreline with a late solo effort.\nArsenal have until 1700 GMT on Wednesday to respond to the charge.
