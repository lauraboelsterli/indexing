    "text": "0 COMMENTS Investors are warming back up to emerging market stocks, brushing off the volatility that’s been pummeling assets across developing countries lately.\nRoughly $395 million flowed into emerging-market stock funds in the week ended May 16, according to EPFR Global, after an outflow of $1.6 billion in the prior week. Investors are still wary of emerging-market debt, pulling $1.3 billion from bond funds last week and $5.3 billion over the past month.\nAs The Wall Street Journal’s Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Tuesday, the resurgence of the dollar since mid-April has stoked concerns about the ability of countries such as Argentina and Turkey to repay dollar-denominated debts, which become more expensive as the U.S. currency rises. Rising U.S. interest rates have also made it more attractive for investors to pull money from emerging markets to invest in safer U.S. government bonds.\nWhile emerging-market bonds and currencies have been hit particularly hard, stocks haven’t escaped unscathed. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which includes stocks across a variety of regions including Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, has fallen nearly 3% over the past month.\nGoing forward, investors believe stocks will be better able to handle the ripple effects of U.S. policy-tightening.\nRichard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said he’s bullish on emerging-market stocks and sees “room for equity inflows to ramp up in coming months.”\nEarnings for companies in emerging-market indexes are expected to grow by more than 20% over the next year, he said, while the recent selloff has brought down valuations. Meanwhile, rising prices for commodities such as oil should boost profits for companies in developing nations that export those products.\nEmerging-market stocks are also likely to benefit from still-robust economic growth, according to John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial. Emerging-market economies are expected to grow at a rate of 5% this year, according to LPL, compared to a rate of 2.4% for developed markets.\nTo receive our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter via email, click here .\nShare this: Morning MoneyBeat Previous Iran Balks at New U.S. Requirements for Sanctions Relief—Energy Journal Next Stocks to Watch: Boeing, GM, Netflix, Facebook, Adobe, Micron, Lowe's, J.C.
