    "text": "1749 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Justice Department asked its internal watchdog to examine if there was any impropriety in the counterintelligence investigation of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, after the president demanded Sunday that the department investigate the motives behind the inquiry.\nEarlier Sunday, in one of a series of tweets targeting the probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump wrote: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!”\nMr. Trump was referring to a man who approached at least two Trump campaign aides in 2016 in connection with the counterintelligence investigation into the campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over that investigation last May when he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\nThe Wall Street Journal has identified the suspected informant as Stefan Halper, an American who was a foreign policy scholar at the University of Cambridge until 2015. Mr. Halper couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.\nThe Journal made no agreements to withhold his name from publication and is one of several media outlets identifying him. Some lawmakers and law-enforcement officials have expressed concern about compromising sources for the investigation, saying it could put lives in danger, hurt investigations and damage international partnerships.\nJustice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said Sunday afternoon that the agency had asked the inspector general to expand a probe into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors obtained warrants from the nation’s secret spy court to surveil a onetime Trump campaign aide. The goal, Ms. Flores said, is to examine “whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election.”\nMr. Rosenstein said in a statement Sunday: “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.”\nThe move by the deputy attorney general to follow an extraordinary order by the president to probe an investigation into his own campaign is the latest turn in a struggle between the White House and the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has more than once considered firing Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who have survived in their roles in part by meeting the demands of the president or his supporters in Congress. Mr. Rosenstein oversees the Russia investigation.\nMr. Trump has railed against the investigation regularly in the year since it began and has stepped up his attacks in recent days. He and his lawyers have seized on reports about the informant as evidence in their view that the probe isn’t about Russia’s efforts to influence the election but rather a partisan attack leveled by a Democratic administration.\nMore\nGiuliani: Trump Should Get Details on Informant Before Interview Trump Tweets Russia Probe Getting ‘Ridiculous’ Inquiry Expands to Israeli Entrepreneur Former law-enforcement officials have said informants in a probe involving a presidential campaign should only be used for law-enforcement or foreign-intelligence purposes, not for political ends.\nThe president’s latest attacks come as his lawyers are seeking to negotiate the terms of a possible interview with Mr. Mueller, who already has indicted or secured guilty pleas from 19 individuals in the investigation, on charges including lying to investigators and tax and bank fraud.\nRelated Video When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word \"Collusion\" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Halper served in three Republican administrations, under former presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. During the Reagan administration, he served as a senior adviser to the Justice Department. He also served as an adviser to former President George H.W. Bush’s campaign, and later became a harsh critic of former President George W. Bush’s foreign policy, co-authoring a book on the subject in 2004 called “America Alone.”\nMr. Halper met with Trump campaign aides Carter Page and Sam Clovis, according to their lawyers. Mr. Page had been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence officials for years over his dealings with Russia, and Mr. Clovis has met with Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors over his involvement with a onetime campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Neither Mr. Page nor Mr. Clovis have been accused of wrongdoing.\nMr. Page confirmed the encounter, and a lawyer for Mr. Clovis said that he and Mr. Halper had only discussed China.\nPresidents typically avoid ordering the Justice Department to undertake certain investigations and usually refrain from commenting on any ongoing probes to avoid the appearance of meddling in an investigation.\nMr. Trump has made no such efforts. He has attacked the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt”—issuing seven tweets on the subject on Sunday morning alone—and has accused Mr. Mueller, a registered Republican, of having partisan motives. The special counsel is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as whether the president sought to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction, and Moscow has denied election meddling.\nThe president has repeatedly alleged wrongdoing in the Russia investigation in the past. In March 2017, he said he “just found out” that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower before the election, adding that Mr. Obama was a “bad (or sick) guy.” That assertion was widely discredited.\nThe president’s lawyers also have sought to use recent revelations about the alleged informant’s contacts with Trump campaign aides as a bargaining chip as they negotiate with Mr. Mueller’s team over the conditions of a possible interview with Mr. Trump.\nRudy Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers, on Sunday said the special counsel about a month earlier had conveyed to him “as a possibility” that the investigation into whether the president obstructed justice could be wrapped up by Sept. 1 if Mr. Trump agreed to sit for an interview. Asked whether he believed the probe would end by that timeline, Mr. Giuliani said: “We hope.”\nThe president’s legal team previously has offered a number of end points they expected for the Mueller probe. Last year, Mr. Trump’s lawyers repeatedly said they expected the probe to close by the end of 2017.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com\nAppeared in the May 21, 2018, print edition as 'Trump Demands FBI Probe.'",
