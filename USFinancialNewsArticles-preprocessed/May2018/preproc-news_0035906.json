Accordingly, the Supervisory Board of ANF Immobilier, at the recommendation of its ad hoc Committee and on the basis of the report of the independent expert, have approved unanimously the proposed parity and the merger.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to usual conditions precedent, particularly to a decision by the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) finding that there is no obligation for Icade to issue a compulsory buy-out bid for the ANF Immobilier shares on the basis of Article 236-6 of its General Regulations.\nThe sole Employee Representative Committee (Délégation Unique du Personnel) of ANF Immobilier and the Works Council of Icade, respectively, issued an unfavourable opinion and a favourable opinion regarding the proposed merger on 14 May 2018 and 16 May 2018.\nAs the merger parity offered to the shareholders of Icade and ANF Immobilier is of 3 Icade shares for 11 ANF Immobilier shares, and as Icade holds at present 90.84% of the stock of ANF Immobilier, Icade will accordingly perform, by way of consideration for the contribution resulting from the merger of ANF Immobilier, on the date for completion of the merger scheduled for 29 June 2018, an increase in its capital which will be with a face value of EUR 640,568.91 in order to raise it from EUR 112,966,652.03 to EUR 113,607,220.94, by means of creation of 420,242 new shares, representing a dilution of 0.57% of the capital of Icade.\nThe proposed merger shall be submitted for approval to the extraordinary meetings of shareholders of ANF Immobilier (as well as to a special meeting of holders of double-voting shares) and of Icade to be held on 28 June 2018 and 29 June 2018, respectively.
