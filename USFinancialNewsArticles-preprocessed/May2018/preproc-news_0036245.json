    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 12:37 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago Australia's Santos gets $10.36 billion takeover offer from Harbour Energy Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Santos Ltd ( STO.AX ) said on Friday that U.S.-based suitor Harbour Energy has made a $10.36 billion (£7.6 billion) binding offer for the company, pitched at the same price as an indicative proposal last month.\nThe bid, which would be the biggest takeover of an Australian oil and gas producer if successful, values the gas producer at $4.98 per share and follows four unsolicited approaches from Harbour.\nSantos said its independent directors would consider the revised proposal and advised shareholders to take no action at this time.\nThe latest offer includes a U.S. dollar offer of cash consideration for shareholders other than China’s ENN Ecological Holdings ( 600803.SS ) and Hony Capital, which together own 15.1 percent of the company.\nENN and Hony have been offered the opportunity to roll over their existing Santos shares into a Harbour investment vehicle and subscribe for new shares, Santos said.\nThe initial Harbour offer was valued at about A$6.50, but oil prices have risen about 17 percent since then, leading some analysts to say Harbour would need to raise its offer to A$7.00 a share to succeed.\nThe bid represents a premium of about 5 percent to Santos’ last close, based on the current Australian dollar exchange rate.\nSantos opened its books to Harbour in April after the private equity-backed firm returned with its fourth proposed offer since August.
