    "text": "PARIS, May 30 (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday that Europe will defend its own interests if the United States imposed tariffs on European aluminium and steel producers after an exemption expires on Friday.\n“We French and Europeans don’t want a trade war. But if we’re attacked, we will have to defend our interests,” Le Maire told a panel at an OECD meeting in Paris.
