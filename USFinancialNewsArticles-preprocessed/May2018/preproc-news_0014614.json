Two miners were rescued on Saturday.\nThe two rescued miners were taken to a hospital in Jastrzebie-Zdroj city in “relatively good condition” and could walk unaided, Ozon told reporters on Saturday.\nThere were about 250 people working in the mine at the time of the quake, JSW said. The missing miners were from a team of 11 that was drilling a new tunnel. Four escaped by themselves.\nThe 200-person rescue operation was earlier hampered by high levels of methane, which reached a concentration of up to 58 percent.\nA spokeswoman for JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, said earlier that the quake had damaged communications lines in the area.\nPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who reached the mine on Saturday evening, said the rescue operation was very difficult and that he hoped the remaining miners would be saved. President Andrzej Duda reached the mine on Sunday noon.\nPolish state mining supervisor WUG said the quake was of a type that can occur in coal mines after the removal of deposits builds up tensions in the rocks.
