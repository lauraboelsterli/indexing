TT News Agency/Henrik Montgomerry/via REUTERS\n“I am optimistic ... I think now things are on track for a meaningful negotiation,” he said during an interview on BBC Radio 4.\n“It’s in the interest of the North Koreans that have been dramatically impacted by the sanctions, it’s in the interest of South Korea that needs peace and security, it’s in the interest of China that was always against a nuclear North Korea but also wants a good security framework in the region, it’s in the interest of the United States because for the United States the de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula has always been a main objective.” Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Alistair Smout",
