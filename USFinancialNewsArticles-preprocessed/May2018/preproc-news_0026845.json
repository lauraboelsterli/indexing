REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\nThe company also beat revenue and profit estimates as it earned more per user.\nShares of the company were marginally up in extended trading on Thursday. They have gained about 12 percent since a blockbuster market debut on March 23, when shares ended up more than 35 percent.\nDropbox said it had 11.5 million paying subscribers at the end of March, up 23.7 percent from the year-ago quarter. That compared with analysts’ average estimate of 11.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe San Francisco-based company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, competes with Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google, Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) as well as Box Inc ( BOX.N ).\nDropbox reported average revenue per user of $114.3, beating estimates of $110.\nThe company’s quarterly loss widened to $465.5 million, largely due to IPO-related expenses.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 8 cents per share, beating estimates of 5 cents.\nTotal revenue rose 28 percent to $316.3 million, above estimates of $309.2 million.
