    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Jailed Malaysian leader Anwar Ibrahim will be released on Tuesday, the veteran politician’s daughter Nurul Izzah told Reuters on Saturday.\nFILE PHOTO - Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim speaks during an election campaign in Kuala Lumpur April 10, 2013. REUTERS/Bazuki Muhammad/File Photo Newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said this week that all efforts were being made to release Anwar, a former foe, immediately and secure a full royal pardon from the country’s monarch.\n“Yes,” Nurul said in a text message when asked to confirm whether her father was being released on Tuesday.\nAnwar was jailed in 2015 for charges of sodomy, a charge he and his supporters say was politically motivated.\nNurul added the pardon from the monarch is being sought on the grounds of “miscarriage of justice”.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; writing by Praveen Menon; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
