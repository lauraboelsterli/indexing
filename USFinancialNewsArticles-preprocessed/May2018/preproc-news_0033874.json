    "text": "RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., Cesca Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:KOOL), a market leader in automated cell processing and point-of-care, autologous cell-based therapies, today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, and provided a corporate update.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nAnnounced first two evaluation agreements with leading academic research institutions for the Company’s X-Series™ products for automated, closed system cellular processing.\nPresented two posters pertaining to the Company’s X-BACS™ and X-Wash™ cellular processing systems at the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) 2018 Annual Meeting in Montreal, Québec.\nAnnounced the release of the X-Mini™ cell selection kit for the CAR-T research market.\nFiled a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an innovation to Cesca’s CAR-TXpress™ technology, which will allow for the simultaneous purification and activation of T-cells, thereby simplifying the CAR-TXpress workflow and tangibly accelerating the CAR-T cell manufacturing process.\nInitiated entry into the contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) space with signing of an exclusive license agreement with China-based IncoCell Tianjin Ltd. for CAR-T related CDMO services covering the Asia Pacific region.\nLaunched the second-generation AXP ® II system for advanced cord blood and peripheral blood processing.\n“Since our acquisition of SynGen in July of last year, we have made substantial progress advancing our novel CAR-TXpress solution, and related X-Series kits, toward commercialization,” said Dr. Chris Xu, chief executive officer of Cesca. “Notably, we introduced our first X-Series kit, the X-Mini, which targets the large and growing CAR-T research market, and subsequently entered into our first evaluation agreements with two leading academic research institutions focused on cell therapies. In addition, we continued to execute on our strategy to become a diversified CAR-T service provider with the signing of the CDMO agreement with IncoCell, the first of several CDMO collaborations that we are pursuing in key markets, including the U.S. Finally, we bolstered our intellectual property estate with the filing of an additional patent that further differentiates our proprietary CAR-TXpress workflow. We remain very optimistic about the numerous opportunities within the rapidly-emerging immuno-oncology field and are positioning the Company to respond to unmet market needs. Our goal is to maintain our current momentum, and we believe we have set the stage for 2018 to be a truly transformational year for our company.”\nFinancial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nNet revenue. Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1.9 million compared to $3.3 million for the comparable period in 2017. The decline was driven by decreased AXP disposable sales in China.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $352,000, or 19.0% of net revenue, compared to $1.4 million, or 42.0% of net revenue for the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was primarily due to decreased overhead absorption and higher costs as a result of the merger with SynGen, which was completed in July 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $325,000 compared to $335,000 for the comparable period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1.0 million, compared to $567,000 for the comparable period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to additional headcount and expenses relating to the ongoing development of the Company’s X-Series products and CAR-TXpress platform.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2.2 million compared to $2.6 million for the comparable period in 2017. The decrease was driven by a reduction in legal expenses due to the settlement of the SynGen litigation.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3.0 million, or ($0.27) per share, based on approximately 11.1 million weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss of $2.1 million, or ($0.21) per share, based on approximately 9.9 million weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCesca will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 4:30 p.m. EDT (1:30 p.m. PDT).
