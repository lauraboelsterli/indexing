    "text": "51 COMMENTS The Trump administration’s campaign to reduce trade imbalances with China highlights a gulf between the world’s two largest economies over import duties on everything from aircraft to electric toothbrushes.\nSenior White House economics officials visited Beijing this month to kick off negotiations in the trade dispute, in which the U.S. is pressuring China to reduce its bilateral trade surplus by $100 billion a year. Vice Premier Liu He is expected to arrive in Washington to pursue talks Tuesday, coinciding with the first of three days of U.S. hearings for companies affected by tariffs on Chinese imports.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center left, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, to his right, leave their Beijing hotel May 4 for trade discussions with Chinese officials. Photo: Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press Among the American officials’ demands was for China to reduce tariffs on non-strategic imports to levels no higher than corresponding products in the U.S.\nThe U.S.’s concern reflects China’s anomalous rise in the global economy. Governments and economists accept that developing economies tend to have higher tariffs than the developed world. But China’s heft, rapid growth, and industrial policies have brought its tariff asymmetries into focus—handing the U.S. a means to reduce a glaring trade deficit , along with leverage over other sore spots , like China’s attempts to gain advantage in global technology.\nChina joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and its tariffs fell about 60% from 1996 to 2005. They have since hovered some three times higher than U.S. levels.\nThe average American tariff in recent years, under most-favored-nation terms, was around 3.7%—compared with China’s at about 10%, according to the WTO. The MFN rule, which aims to create fairness in global trade, is when one country extends to another a tariff level no higher than what it has made available to any other nation.\nA Wall Street Journal review of comparable tariffs found Beijing has lots of room to whittle down tariffs on key products to U.S. levels.\nChina maintains its highest tariffs on agricultural imports, including a 65% duty on corn beyond an annual state-controlled quota of 7.2 million metric tons. Washington, meanwhile, charges no duty on corn imports. Beijing is vowing to slap on another 25% on corn, retaliation for President Donald Trump’s tariff threats against Chinese goods.\nAmerican soybean exports, another Farm Belt target facing retaliation by Beijing, enjoy relatively low Chinese tariffs of 3%—but likely not for long. Beijing has said it will add 25% to that tariff, and is trying to line up alternative soybean suppliers. The U.S.—China’s second-largest supplier after Brazil— charges no tariffs.\nChina also maintains MFN tariffs ranging from 6% to 30% on electrical appliances, part of a long-standing strategy to boost domestic production. But via temporary duties and provisions, Beijing offers lower rates on such products as a way to satisfy rising local demand.\nThe U.S. imposes relatively low rates of about 3% on such goods.\nNot all goods have such a wide disparity. The U.S. tends to impose relatively high tariffs of between 10% and 29% on both men’s and women’s clothing, the legacy of a powerful textile lobby. China’s are a comparable 10% to 25%.\nBoth countries charge a 25% tariff on pickup trucks.\nThe U.S. also has industries it shields—like peanuts, the mainstay of an important farming voter bloc stretching across much of the southeastern U.S.\nIn China’s case, “import tariffs have long been used either as an import substitution device, or to stem off demand for luxury goods,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia economist for investment bank Natixis.\nWine draws a 65% tariff under China’s MTN terms, though Beijing has slashed this to 14% as an annually-reviewed temporary duty.\nWine lovers in the U.S. enjoy it tariff-free.\nThe beverage has emerged as a potential casualty of the trade standoff as Beijing proposes to add 15% to the tariff rate. Whether it should is another question.\n“Will China ever be competitive on the same scale as Californian or Australian wine makers? There’s a question mark over whether they have the right climate,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist for investment manager AMP Capital. “Maintaining those high tariffs can help you industrialize, but it doesn’t help you work out what you’re good at and what you’re not.”\nTariffs on cars are among those China has signaled a willingness to reduce. Mr. Trump uses automobiles as an example of discrepancies in how the countries tax imports.\n“The word that I want to use is reciprocal,” Mr. Trump said in March. “When they charge 25% for a car to go in, and we charge 2% for their car to come into the U.S., that’s not good.”\nStill, Chinese concession here would likely be a front to shield other areas of its economy, like advanced technology, according to analysts.\nThe bilateral talks are likely to be stacked with negotiating decoys. Case in point: China, which maintains 5% tariffs on imports of airplanes with an unladen weight of 15 to 45 metric tons, has threatened to add an additional 25%.\nThat doesn’t mean Boeing Co. should worry yet : Such tariffs would only impact a piece of its output. The category includes both a single-aisle Boeing 737 already being phased out, and the smallest type of its replacement 737 Max, which has only a handful of orders from Chinese customers. These orders account for about 5% of Boeing’s 737 backlog.\nBoeing said in November that it has a deal to supply China with 300 planes, valued at $37 billion, though it was unclear if they are all new orders. Boeing didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe long haul ahead is likely to be fractious for officials on both sides of the negotiating table.\n“I think Trump’s ultimate negotiation is really about China literally becoming more of a market economy,” Ms. Garcia said. Even if Beijing reduces its tariffs, concerns over technology transfer and other issues are “going to put the U.S. in a confrontation mode with China for years.”\nPresident Trump says China is forcing U.S. companies to transfer their technology secrets to China.
