    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 11:24 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Soccer-Japan, Qatar get invites to 2019 Copa America in Brazil Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - The 2019 Copa America in Brazil will feature 10 teams from South America plus invited guests Japan and Qatar, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said on Friday.\nSeveral nations have had special invitations since 1993, including Japan who played at the 1999 tournament in Paraguay.\nThe guests usually come the neighbouring North and Central America and the Caribbean confederation so the inclusion of Qatar, the Gulf nation hosting the 2022 World Cup, is new.\nCONMEBOL said the presence of the two non-Latin nations is due to the “great interest of the Asian Football Confederation in participating in CONMEBOL tournaments and to the South American Football Confederation’s commitment to developing football around the world.”\nThe Copa America, which started in 1916, is world’s oldest international soccer tournament. Next year’s hosts Brazil have not won the trophy since 2007. Reporting by Andrew Downie; editing by Ken Ferris",
