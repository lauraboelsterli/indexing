    "text": "PITTSBURGH, CNX Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNXM) (\"CNXM\" or the \"Partnership\") today reported financial and operational results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (1) .\nFirst Quarter Results\nHighlights of first quarter 2018 results attributable to the Partnership as compared to the first quarter of 2017 include:\nNet Income Attributable to General and Limited Partner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream Partners LP of $27.8 million as compared to $30.1 million Net cash provided by operating activities of $41.9 million as compared to $34.2 million Adjusted EBITDA (2) of $34.8 million as compared to $35.2 million Distributable cash flow (DCF) (2) of $29.2 million as compared to $30.3 million Cash distribution coverage (2) of 1.29x on an as-declared basis\n\"Our first quarter financial and operating results were in line with expectations,\" commented Nicholas J. DeIuliis, CEO of CNX Midstream GP LLC (the \"General Partner\"). \"We continue to deliver strong operational execution that is driving our organic base program, which in combination with yesterday's executed strategic transaction, is resulting in five plus years of de-risked 15% distribution growth. Coupling this de-risked distribution growth with a significant roster of drops that are getting larger over time; a strong balance sheet; an economically aligned sponsor with a rich asset base; and pipes that are in the best part of the Appalachian basin, you can see why we are so excited for the future of this great company.\"\nOperations\nDuring the quarter, the Partnership turned-in-line (TIL) 12 wells in DevCo I, compared to 10 wells in the first quarter of 2017, which included two wells in DevCo I and eight wells in DevCo III.\nAlso during the quarter, CNXM continued to see cost reductions, in a period which historically is a higher cost period typically driven by seasonal conditions. The company continues to implement several changes that are driving costs lower, and these efforts resulted in the lowest realized costs in a first quarter since the company's initial public offering (IPO) for both total dollars spent and on a per unit basis. During the quarter, operating expenses, excluding electrically-powered compression, attributable to CNXM were $6.5 million or $0.068 per MMBtu, compared to $7.1 million or $0.075 per MMBtu for the first quarter of 2017.\nLeveraging the remote-control capabilities of the company's supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), CNXM continues to optimize facility and pipeline staffing levels and coverage, along with methanol usage. CNXM is also now fully utilizing 100% of the company's compression and has realigned workforce incentives with company financial goals.\nStrategic Transaction with CNX and HG Energy\nCNXM also announced today a strategic transaction in connection with its sponsor, CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) (\"CNX\"), which closed yesterday on an exchange transaction with HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (\"HG\"). The transaction includes the amendment of CNXM's gas gathering agreements with both HG and CNX.\nThis transaction strengthens CNXM's asset portfolio and outlook, resulting in the following:\nExtends de-risked 15% distribution growth to 2022, from 2020, based solely on minimum well commitments (\"MWCs\") and minimum volume commitments (\"MVCs\"). Extends 15% distribution growth target to 2023 from 2022. Provides for the additional dedication of 16,100 Utica acres in DevCo I by CNX in Southwest Pennsylvania (SWPA) and Central Pennsylvania (CPA) in exchange for the release from dedication of approximately 18,000 HG net acres, the majority of which are in less developed, lower return DevCo's II and III. Increases MWCs by 52 wells. This brings CNXM's total well commitments to 192 wells for the next 5 years. Receives a 20\" high-pressure pipeline into DevCo I, which expands CNXM's business services and customer base with a fee-based pipeline into Markwest's Majorsville processing facility. This pipeline provides additional diversification to CNXM's portfolio of customers by adding third-party revenues that will add up to $4 million in annual EBITDA. Initial service for this growth project will begin in the second quarter of 2018. Receives approximately $2 million in cash. Enhancement of both risk profile and growth trajectory should positively impact credit ratings and cost of capital, further supporting CNXM's ability to continue to grow its business.\nIn exchange for the incremental Utica acreage dedication, MWCs, and high-pressure pipeline with third-party revenue, CNXM has agreed to relinquish its 5% interest in the midstream assets of DevCo II and the Moundsville midstream assets located in DevCo III. CNX and CNXM have also released from dedication approximately 275,000 acres in DevCo's II and III, in which CNXM has a 5% interest, or approximately 14,000 net acres, and in which CNX has a 95% interest, or approximately 261,000 net acres. Most of these previously dedicated acres were located in DevCo II across Lewis, Upshur, Harrison, Taylor, and Barbour counties, West Virginia. The amendment to the gathering agreement with HG also provides for the release from dedication of approximately 4,200 scattered acres located in DevCo I. HG continues to be a significant customer of CNXM, which will continue to gather HG's existing production in DevCo I as well as potential new wells on acreage that is within the revised acreage commitment boundary. The transaction includes an amended gas gathering agreement with HG in the DevCo I area, providing CNXM more control over the DevCo I expansion and operating strategy.\nNicholas J. DeIuliis, CEO of CNXM commented: \"This transaction delivers an array of benefits for CNXM. The deal further de-risks CNXM's planned 15% distribution growth through 2022 based solely on additional MWCs; it extends the 15% distribution growth target to six years, through 2023; it increases expected future distributable cash flow above MWCs based off of sponsor projected activity set; it adds 16,100 dedicated Utica acres in SWPA and CPA; and it provides incremental third-party revenue, with upside potential. Perhaps most importantly, the transaction ensures that midstream capital is focused on the highest IRR opportunities. In summary, this transaction has further aligned the interests of CNXM and its sole sponsor, CNX, as both entities are now able to prioritize development of the core stacked pay assets through capital allocation that is accretive to unitholders.\"\nThe transaction was approved by the CNXM's Board of Directors' Conflicts Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee was advised by Evercore on financial matters and Baker Botts L.L.P. on legal matters.\nLatham & Watkins LLP served as the legal advisor and CIBC Capital Markets served as the financial advisor to CNX.\nKirkland & Ellis LLP served as the legal advisor to HG.\nNote: CNXM is unable to provide a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected operating income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of certain income statement items.\nCNXM is reaffirming full-year 2018 guidance in the table below:\n2018 Outlook\n($ in millions)\n2018E\nThroughput (MMcfe/d)\n1,150\n-\n1,240\nCapital Expenditures\n$80\n-\n$90\nEBITDA\n$150\n-\n$165\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$120\n-\n$135\nDistributable Coverage\n1.2x\n-\n1.4x\nLP Distribution Growth Target\n15%\nQuarterly Distribution\nAs previously announced, the Board of Directors of the General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3245 per unit with respect to the first quarter of 2018. The distribution payment will be made on May 15, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2018. The distribution, which equates to an annual rate of $1.298 per unit, represents an increase of 3.6% over the prior quarter and an increase of 15% over the distribution paid with respect to the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital Investment and Resources\nCNX Midstream's allocated first quarter 2018 share of investment in expansion projects was $9.9 million. Total expansion capital investment at the three development companies in which CNX Midstream holds controlling interests was $11.3 million. CNX Midstream's respective share of maintenance capital expenditures for the three development companies for first quarter 2018 was $4.0 million. Maintenance capital expenditures in the aggregate for the development companies in which CNX Midstream holds controlling interests totaled $4.6 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, CNX Midstream had outstanding borrowings of $20 million under its $600 million revolving credit facility.\nFirst Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call\nA conference call and webcast, during which management will discuss first quarter 2018 financial and operational results, is scheduled for May 3, 2018 at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Prepared remarks by members of management will be followed by a question and answer period. Interested parties may listen via webcast at www.cnxmidstream.com . Participants who would like to ask questions may join the conference by phone by dialing 888-349-0097 (international 412-902-0126) five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time (reference the CNX Midstream call). An on-demand replay of the webcast will also be available at www.cnxmidstream.com shortly after the conclusion of the conference call. A telephonic replay will be available through May 10, 2018 by dialing 877-344-7529 (international: 412-317-0088) and using the conference playback number 10119147.\n(1)\nUnless otherwise indicated, the reporting measures included in this news release reflect the unallocated total activity of the three development companies that have been jointly owned by the Partnership and CNX Gathering LLC (\"CNX Gathering\") since completion of the Partnership's initial public offering (\"IPO\") in September 2014. Effective November 16, 2016, the Partnership acquired the remaining 25% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems, which brought its controlling interest in that system to 100%. The Partnership's current financial interests in the development companies are: 100% in the Anchor Systems, 5% in the Growth Systems, and 5% in the Additional Systems. Because the Partnership owns a controlling interest in each of the three development companies, it fully consolidates their financial results. CNX Gathering is an entity 100% owned by CNX Resources Corporation that owns noncontrolling interests in two of the Partnership's development companies.\n(2)\nAdjusted EBITDA and DCF are not measures that are recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP reporting measures appear in the financial tables which follow.\n* * * * *\nCNX Midstream Partners is a growth-oriented master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires gathering and other midstream energy assets to service natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides information that is useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less net noncontrolling interest, cash interest paid and maintenance capital expenditures, each net to the Partnership. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nDistributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:\nthe ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions to our unitholders; and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of distributable cash flow in this release provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures that other companies may use.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nNet Income\n$\n33,705\n$\n33,240\nDepreciation expense\n5,856\n5,671\nInterest expense\n2,489\n1,038\nEBITDA\n42,050\n39,949\nNon-cash unit-based compensation expense\n579\n283\nLoss on asset sales\n2,755\n673\nAdjusted EBITDA\n45,384\n40,905\nLess:\nNet noncontrolling interest\n5,858\n3,173\nDepreciation expense attributable to noncontrolling interest\n1,665\n1,830\nOther expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n436\n82\nLoss on asset sales attributable to noncontrolling interest\n2,617\n639\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to General and Limited Partner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream Partners LP\n$\n34,808\n$\n35,181\nLess: cash interest paid, net\n2,015\n1,000\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures, net of reimbursements\n3,583\n3,881\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n29,210\n$\n30,300\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n41,867\n$\n34,176\nInterest expense\n2,489\n1,038\nLoss on asset sales\n2,755\n673\nOther, including changes in working capital\n(1,727)\n5,018\nAdjusted EBITDA\n45,384\n40,905\nLess:\nNet noncontrolling interest\n5,858\n3,173\nDepreciation expense attributable to noncontrolling interest\n1,665\n1,830\nOther expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n436\n82\nLoss on asset sales attributable to noncontrolling interest\n2,617\n639\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to General and Limited Partner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream Partners LP\n$\n34,808\n$\n35,181\nLess: cash interest paid, net\n2,015\n1,000\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures, net of reimbursements\n3,583\n3,881\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n29,210\n$\n30,300\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by quarter and for the most recently completed twelve month period with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are net income and net cash provided by operating activities.\n(unaudited)\nQ2 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2017\nQ1 2018\nTwelve\nMonths\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2018\nNet Income\n$\n29,752\n$\n33,468\n$\n37,602\n$\n33,705\n$\n134,527\nDepreciation expense\n5,675\n5,629\n5,717\n5,856\n22,877\nInterest expense\n1,124\n1,197\n1,201\n2,489\n6,011\nEBITDA\n36,551\n40,294\n44,520\n42,050\n163,415\nNon-cash unit-based compensation expense\n367\n249\n277\n579\n1,472\nLoss on asset sales\n3,241\n—\n—\n2,755\n5,996\nAdjusted EBITDA\n40,159\n40,543\n44,797\n45,384\n170,883\nLess:\nNet noncontrolling interest\n761\n4,554\n10,581\n5,858\n21,754\nDepreciation expense attributable to noncontrolling\ninterest\n1,833\n1,736\n1,748\n1,665\n6,982\nOther expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n112\n92\n108\n436\n748\nLoss on asset sales attributable to noncontrolling\ninterest\n3,079\n—\n—\n2,617\n5,696\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to General and Limited\nPartner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream\nPartners LP\n$\n34,374\n$\n34,161\n$\n32,360\n$\n34,808\n$\n135,703\nLess: cash interest paid, net\n1,079\n1,154\n1,154\n2,015\n5,402\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures, net of\nreimbursements\n3,715\n3,579\n3,483\n3,583\n14,360\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n29,580\n$\n29,428\n$\n27,723\n$\n29,210\n$\n115,941\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n42,258\n$\n38,203\n$\n40,913\n$\n41,867\n$\n163,241\nInterest expense\n1,124\n1,197\n1,201\n2,489\n6,011\nLoss on asset sales\n3,241\n—\n—\n2,755\n5,996\nOther, including changes in working capital\n(6,464)\n1,143\n2,683\n(1,727)\n(4,365)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n40,159\n40,543\n44,797\n45,384\n170,883\nLess:\nNet noncontrolling interest\n761\n4,554\n10,581\n5,858\n21,754\nDepreciation expense attributable to noncontrolling\ninterest\n1,833\n1,736\n1,748\n1,665\n6,982\nOther expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n112\n92\n108\n436\n748\nLoss on asset sales attributable to noncontrolling\ninterest\n3,079\n—\n—\n2,617\n5,696\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to General and Limited\nPartner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream\nPartners LP\n$\n34,374\n$\n34,161\n$\n32,360\n$\n34,808\n$\n135,703\nLess: cash interest paid, net\n1,079\n1,154\n1,154\n2,015\n5,402\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures, net of\nreimbursements\n3,715\n3,579\n3,483\n3,583\n14,360\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n29,580\n$\n29,428\n$\n27,723\n$\n29,210\n$\n115,941\nDistributions Declared\n$\n19,698\n$\n20,573\n$\n21,489\n$\n22,699\n$\n84,459\nDistribution Coverage Ratio -

The following projections represent the approximate midpoint of the announced full year 2018 expected guidance ranges of adjusted EBITDA ($150-$165 million) and full year distributable cash flow ($120-$135 million) attributable to the Partnership. CNX Midstream's financial guidance is based on numerous assumptions about future events and conditions and, therefore, could vary materially from actual results. These estimates are meant to provide guidance only and are subject to revision for acquisitions or operating environment changes.\n(unaudited) (in millions)\nForecast 2018 Estimate\nNet Income\n$\n132\nDepreciation expense\n24\nInterest expense\n22\nEBITDA\n178\nNon-cash unit-based compensation expense\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA\n179\nLess:\nNet noncontrolling interest\n13\nDepreciation and other expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest\n6\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to General and Limited Partner Ownership Interest in CNX Midstream\nPartners LP\n$\n160\nLess: cash interest paid, net\n22\nLess: maintenance capital expenditures, net of reimbursements\n13\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n125\nThe Partnership is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities or provide the related reconciliation of projected net cash provided by operating activities to projected distributable cash flow, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of the Partnership's cash receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred, and the Partnership is unable to project these timing differences with any reasonable degree of accuracy.\nDevelopment Companies Jointly Owned by CNX Gathering LLC and CNX Midstream Partners LP\nOperating Income Summary, Selected Operating Statistics and Capital Investment\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nDevelopment Company\nAnchor\nGrowth\nAdditional\nTOTAL(*)\nIncome Summary\nRevenue\n$\n56,190\n$\n1,904\n$\n5,775\n$\n63,869\nExpenses\n23,047\n1,711\n5,406\n30,164\nNet Income\n$\n33,143\n$\n193\n$\n369\n$\n33,705\nOperating Statistics - Gathered Volumes\nDry gas (BBtu/d)\n636\n44\n23\n703\nWet gas (BBtu/d)\n546\n4\n160\n710\nCondensate (MMcfe/d)\n5\n—\n21\n26\nTotal Gathered Volumes\n1,187\n48\n204\n1,439\nCapital Investment\nMaintenance capital\n$\n3,939\n$\n176\n$\n526\n$\n4,641\nExpansion capital\n9,849\n(98)\n1,580\n11,331\nTotal Capital Investment\n$\n13,788\n$\n78\n$\n2,106\n$\n15,972\nCapital Investment Net to CNX Midstream Partners LP\nMaintenance capital\n$\n3,939\n$\n9\n$\n26\n$\n3,974\nExpansion capital\n9,849\n(5)\n79\n9,923\nTotal Capital Investment Net to CNX Midstream\nPartners LP\n$\n13,788\n$\n4\n$\n105\n$\n13,897\n(*) On March 16, 2018, the Partnership, through its 100% interest in the Anchor Systems, consummated the Shirley-Penns Acquisition.
