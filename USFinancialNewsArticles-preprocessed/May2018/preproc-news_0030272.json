(NASDAQ:XELB) (“Xcel” or the “Company”), a consumer products company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRobert W. D'Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xcel commented, “I am delighted by our positive first quarter results. We are beginning to see positive momentum building in our business across all channels of distribution.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.8 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 4% over the prior year quarter. The improvement in first quarter revenues resulted from commencement of the wholesale and e-commerce jewelry business and a 45% increase in revenues from the company’s apparel and accessories department store business.\nGAAP net income was approximately $0.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, an increase of $0.9 million or $0.05 per basic and diluted share from the prior year quarter, representing an increase of more than 225% in GAAP net income and EPS from the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was approximately $1.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 26% and 36%, respectively, from the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $2.2 million, an increase of $0.3 million or 11% from the prior year quarter.\nSee reconciliation tables below for non-GAAP metrics. These non-GAAP metrics may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies and should only be used in conjunction with our results reported according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Any financial measure other than those prepared in accordance with GAAP should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's balance sheet at March 31, 2018, remained strong, with stockholders' equity of approximately $98.9 million, cash and cash equivalents of $8.9 million, and working capital of approximately $9.5 million. During the current quarter, the Company reduced its term debt by $1.7 million to $20.2 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call with members of the executive management team to discuss these results with additional comments and details at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, May 14, 2018.

We define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss), exclusive of stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense from discounted debt related to acquired assets, and deferred tax provision. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures do not include the tax effect of the aforementioned adjusting items, due to the nature of these items and the Company’s tax strategy.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP unaudited measure, which we define as net income before stock-based compensation, interest and finance expense, income taxes, other state and local franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nManagement uses non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to identify business trends relating to our results of operations. Management believes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are also useful because they provide supplemental information to assist investors in evaluating our financial results. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, earnings per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Given that non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures not deemed to be in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, our non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry, because other companies may calculate non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than we calculate these measures. In evaluating non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may or may not incur expenses similar to some of the adjustments in this document. Our presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA does not imply that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results, and not rely on any single financial measure.\nSource:Xcel Brands, Inc",
