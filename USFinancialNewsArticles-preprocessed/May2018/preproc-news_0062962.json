    "text": "ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE:BBW) today reported results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. Given the Company’s previously announced fiscal year-end change, all references to prior year results are based on the recast 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017.\nSharon Price John, Build-A-Bear Workshop President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “In the first quarter, as we previously shared, we expected to see a sales and profit decline versus the prior year due to adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and the recent closure of our largest, most productive store located in Anaheim, California. Separately, with a less robust movie lineup for the year, we anticipated softness in licensed product performance. And, while we expected continued traffic declines, this headwind was further exacerbated by the unexpected Toys“R”Us liquidation, which according to our analysis eroded sales in nearby locations.\nMs. John continued, “At the same time, we saw ongoing improvements in operational aspects of the business and progress in key areas of our diversification strategy. Specifically, we generated improvements in conversion along with record high levels in both dollars-per-transaction and units-per-transaction while continuing the transformation of the business from that of a traditional in-line, mall-based retailer to a multi-faceted consumer brand. In addition, sales of proprietary product increased, ecommerce business grew at a double-digit pace, and international franchise revenue benefited from our recent China expansion. We also remained focused on rebalancing our store base toward more productive formats and locations. I continue to be encouraged by the overall strategies we have in place that are designed to capitalize on the power of our iconic brand by increasing the lifetime value of our guests and adding margin-enhancing revenue streams to our Company.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (13 weeks ended May 5, 2018, compared to the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2017):\nTotal revenues were $83.2 million compared to $91.2 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter; Consolidated net retail sales were $81.4 million compared to $88.7 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter; Retail gross margin declined 340 basis points to 44.3% and included a 30 basis point increase in merchandise margin offset by occupancy deleverage driven by lower sales; Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $36.3 million, or 43.7% of total revenues, compared to $39.2 million, or 43.0% of total revenues, in the fiscal 2017 first quarter; GAAP pre-tax income decreased to $0.6 million, including an estimated $0.6 million negative pre-tax impact from adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, compared to $4.4 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter; Income tax expense was $0.3 million with an effective tax rate of 45.2%, compared to $1.8 million with an effective tax rate of 40.6% in the fiscal 2017 first quarter. Further, the first fiscal quarters of 2018 and 2017 included the recognition of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of net additional tax expense associated with vested share-based payments; and Net income was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2017 first quarter.\nStore Activity:\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company opened 2 locations, closed 4 locations and remodeled or reformatted 7 stores into a Discovery format, ending the quarter with 32% of its store base in an updated Discovery design. As of May 5, 2018, the Company operated 352 corporately-managed locations, including 294 in North America and 58 outside of North America. The Company’s international franchisees ended the quarter with 96 stores in 12 countries.\nBalance Sheet:\nAs of May 5, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $18.9 million. The Company ended the quarter with no borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Total inventory at quarter-end was $49.4 million compared to $55.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 10.5%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, capital expenditures totaled $3.0 million and depreciation and amortization were $4.1 million.\nFiscal Year Change:\nAs previously disclosed, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year-end, which previously ended on the Saturday closest to December 31, to the Saturday closest to January 31. This change was effective following the end of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year. As a result of this change, the Company is including a one fiscal month transition period, December 31, 2017 through February 3, 2018, as part of this first quarter press release.\nShare Repurchase:\nSince December 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 616,141 shares of its common stock for $5.3 million, including 528,228 shares during the transition period and 87,913 shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As of May 5, 2018, the Company had $10.0 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization that was adopted in August 2017.\nAccounting Changes Impacting Revenue Recognition:\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company adopted “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Accounting Standard Codification “Topic 606”), as required. While the majority of the Company’s revenues were not impacted by Topic 606, the timing of the recognition of breakage revenue for certain gift cards changed. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a pre-tax cumulative effect increase to retained earnings of approximately $12.3 million representing gift card breakage revenue not previously recognized that was accelerated due to Topic 606. The change will negatively impact the Company’s fiscal 2018 total revenue and pre-tax income by an estimated $3.9 million with the remaining balance of the cumulative effect adjustment predominantly impacting fiscal years 2019 and 2020.\n2018 Expectations (52 weeks ended February 2, 2019 compared to the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018):\nThe Company is providing guidance for its expectations for fiscal year 2018. On a GAAP basis, the Company currently expects:\nTotal revenue for the year to be in the range of $345 to $355 million. For the remainder of the fiscal year, the Company expects revenue to be flat to a slight increase compared to the unaudited recast fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 excluding; the balance of the negative impact of the previously mentioned accounting changes affecting second quarter through fourth quarter, and the revenue from the one extra week included in the recast 2017 fiscal year; Pre-tax income to be in the range of $8.0 million to $11.5 million. As a reminder, 2018 guidance reflects an estimated $3.9 million negative impact due to accounting changes in revenue recognition; Diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.57, using an effective tax rate of approximately 27%, excluding discrete items; Capital expenditures to be in the range of $15 to $18 million with depreciation and amortization in the range of $16 to $17 million; and To end the year with cash and cash equivalents in the range of $25 to $30 million.\nToday’s Conference Call Webcast:\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop will host a live internet webcast of its quarterly investor conference call at 9 a.m. ET today.
