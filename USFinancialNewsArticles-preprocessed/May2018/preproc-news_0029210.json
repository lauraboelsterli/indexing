Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- U.S. import prices rose less than expected in April as a decline in food costs offset the rising cost of petroleum.\nThe Labor Department said on Friday import prices rose 0.3 percent last month. Data for March was revised to show import prices falling 0.2 percent instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.5 percent in April.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average finished Thursday's session sharply higher , following weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data. The consumer price index data rose 0.2 percent last month, below analyst expectations of a 0.3 percent increase.\nThe news lifted market expectations, easing concerns about the pace of the U.S. central bank's tightening strategy.\nshow chapters Bonds and cash are starting to compete with stocks, says expert 8:43 AM ET Thu, 3 May 2018 | 03:00 Investors will be keeping a close eye on politics after President Donald Trump tweeted the date and location of the first-ever meeting between a sitting incumbent and a leader of North Korea .\nOn Thursday, Trump took to Twitter to announce that he would be meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore next month, where they would both try to make it \"a very special moment for world peace.\"",
