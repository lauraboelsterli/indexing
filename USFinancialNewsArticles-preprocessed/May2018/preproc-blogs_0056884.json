Before that, he served as acting co-CFO, senior vice president and treasurer of Time Warner Cable Inc. from 2015 to 2016, and as senior vice president and treasurer from 2008 to 2015.\nMr. Siegel’s compensation includes a base salary of $650,000, an annual bonus targeted at 75% of his salary, and a one-time restricted stock-unit grant valued at $300,000. He is also eligible to receive annual grants of long-term incentive compensation with a target value of $1.2 million commencing in 2019, according to a filing.\nFossil Group Inc. , the Richardson, Texas accessories maker, named J.M.
