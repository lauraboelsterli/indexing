    "text": "By Polina Marinova 9:31 AM EDT THE PET WARS\nGood morning, Term Sheet readers.\nHOUSEKEEPING: As a reminder, Term Sheet won’t be in your inbox on Monday because of Memorial Day. But in the meantime, feel free to tweet at me here . Have a great weekend, and see you next week!\nUP AGAINST SOFTBANK: Rover , the pet-sitting and pet-walking company, is raising $125 million in funding, along with $30 million of debt, to keep growing in the face of increasing competition. It will use the capital to expand in Europe, starting with the U.K.\nThe funding comes on the heels of the $300 million in funding that rival Wag raised from SoftBank just a few months ago. Both companies are playing with serious money now, and it appears that Rover & its lead investor T. Rowe Price are not afraid to challenge SoftBank’s kingmaker strategy.\nBoth startups are entering each other’s turf, both have a nearly identical paw logo, and both are very well-funded. In total, Rover has raised ~$311 million while Wag has raised ~$362 million.\nLike I’ve said before , money matters when competing with a SoftBank-backed startup. The pet service startup wars are heating up, and I have a hunch that SoftBank won’t put down its capital cannon just yet.\nEXCLUSIVE: Albert , a financial service startup, raised $5 million in Series A funding from investors including QED, American Express Ventures, and Portag3. This brings its total funding to approximately $7.5 million. Read the full story here.\nWEEKEND LONG-READS: If you have some time during this three-day weekend, here are 6 longform stories to add to your reading list:\n• Inside Pfizer’s Drug Supply Problem: How a much-touted acquisition by America’s biggest pharmaceutical company helped turn the country’s chronic drug shortage into a full-blown crisis.
