    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 5:02 AM / in 11 minutes METALS-London copper rises as inventories plunge; aluminium slips Reuters Staff 4 Min Read (Updates prices) BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - London copper prices rose for a second session on Thursday on falling inventories and signs of strong demand in top consumer China, while aluminium retreated for the first time in four trading days. Copper stocks MCUSTX-TOTAL in London Metal Exchange-registered warehouses dropped by another 7,950 tonnes to 285,075 tonnes, exchange data showed on Thursday. They are fallen by more than 100,000 tonnes since March 27. China imported 442,000 tonnes of unwrought copper in April, according to customs data released this week, the highest monthly total so far in 2018. \"Apart from the reduced supply of copper scrap, the strong import appetite was also attributable to an increase in smelting capacity and less than expected ... maintenance scheduled for April,\" Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau wrote in a note. Aluminium was the biggest loser among base metals, slipping by as much as 2.5 percent after a three-day rally also driven by falling LME stocks. FUNDAMENTALS * COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.8 percent at $6,866.5 a tonne, as of 0854 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange ended 0.3 percent higher at 51,070 yuan ($8,036.82) a tonne. * ALUMINIUM: London aluminium fell 1.6 percent to $2,328 a tonne. The metal's \"inability to crack the $2375-85 resistance and a lack of fresh headline-generated buying arguably leaves us vulnerable to a drift lower again\", broker Marex Spectron wrote in a note. Recent price movements have been driven by U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal. * RUSAL: Japan's UACJ Corp said on Wednesday it was suspending aluminium buying from Rusal because of U.S. economic sanctions on the producer, but the company has found alternative supplies from others. * GRAPHITE: Australian-listed Syrah Resources is targeting the market for electric vehicle batteries with its Balama graphite mine in Mozambique, which started production in November. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian stocks rose on Thursday, with energy shares leading the way as crude oil prices bolted higher after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a nuclear deal with Iran.
