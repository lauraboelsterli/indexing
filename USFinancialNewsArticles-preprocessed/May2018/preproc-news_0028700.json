    "text": "DUNN, N.C., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Select Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:SLCT), the holding company for Select Bank & Trust Company, today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $1.9 million and basic earnings per share of $0.14 and diluted earnings per share of $0.13, compared to net income of $2.1 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the comparative quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSelect Bancorp, Inc. had a solid quarter of earnings comparing quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year results, which reflect the acquisition of Premara Financial, Inc. (“Premara”), by the Company in December 2017. The acquisition of Premara and its subsidiary, Carolina Premier Bank, significantly expanded the Company’s market penetration into the Charlotte/Rock Hill area and upstate South Carolina. Included in the Company’s net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, are net, after-tax merger/acquisition related expenses of $1.4 million associated with the acquisition of Premara. In addition, due to reduced tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company experienced a decrease of approximately $280,000 of income tax expense for the first quarter of 2018, which is reflected in the Company’s reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nTotal assets, deposits, and total gross loans for the Company as of March 31, 2018 were $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion, and $978.3 million, respectively, compared to total assets of $879.6 million, total deposits of $713.1 million, and total loans of $706.8 million as of the same date in 2017. The acquisition of Premara in December 2017 resulted in increases of $278.8 million in total assets, $198.4 million in gross loans and $226.3 million in deposits.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, return on average assets was 0.64% and return on average equity was 5.61%, compared to 1.00% and 8.10%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Non-performing loans increased to $8.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $7.0 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans equaled 0.85% of loans at March 31, 2018, increasing from 0.71% of loans at December 31, 2017. Foreclosed real estate equaled $1.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, net charge-offs were $18,000, or 0.01% of average loans, compared to net charge offs of $94,000, or 0.05% of average loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $8.8 million, or 0.90% of total loans, as compared to $9.0 million, or 0.92% of total loans, at March 31, 2018.\nNet interest margin was 4.45% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 4.14% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our emphasis during the first quarter of 2018 was the integration of Carolina Premier Bank, including the Charlotte/Rock Hill and upstate South Carolina markets, integration of Carolina Premier’s operations, and conversion of their loan and deposit accounts in our core processing system. We also focused on the organic growth of our new mortgage operations headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. We incurred acquisition/integration expenses primarily related to the termination of Carolina Premier’s core processing system that accounted for approximately $1.7 million of our expected pre-tax acquisition costs, which reduced our earnings in the first quarter,” stated William L. Hedgepeth II, president and CEO of the Company. “We believe most of the expenses of the acquisition are behind us. In addition, the reduction in the corporate tax rate positively impacted our operating performance for the first quarter of 2018 and is expected to benefit the bottom line in the quarters to come.”\n“In the second quarter of 2018, we intend to increase our focus on leveraging our resources, gleaning efficiencies, and utilizing the seasoned staff in our new footprint. Our aim is to increase our market share in the communities we serve through a diversification of products and services and our involvement in the regions we serve. As we have stated, it has been our goal for some time to expand,” Hedgepeth continued. “We believe 2018 is a year for continued growth and expansion. We are continuing to leverage our resources in our established communities, which is reflected in the growth from our new Wilmington office plus the increase in mortgage originations. The growth complements the portfolio of products and services our customers demand from their local community bank.”\nSelect Bank & Trust has 18 branch offices in these North Carolina communities: Dunn, Burlington, Charlotte, Clinton, Elizabeth City, Fayetteville, Goldsboro, Greenville, Leland, Lillington, Lumberton, Morehead City, Raleigh, Washington, and Wilmington; and in the following South Carolina communities: Blacksburg, Rock Hill and Six Mile.\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nT he information as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as presented is unaudited.
