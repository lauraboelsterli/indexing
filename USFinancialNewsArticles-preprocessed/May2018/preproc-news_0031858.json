    "text": "May 13, 2018 / 7:46 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Longtime NFL coach Knox dies at 86 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nChuck Knox, a longtime NFL coach who won 186 regular-season games, died Sunday at age 86, the Seattle Seahawks confirmed.\nKnox’s granddaughter, Lee Ann, originally announced the news on Twitter.\nKnox reportedly was suffering from dementia and recently entered hospice care.\nKnox coached for the Los Angeles Rams (twice), Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks during his 22 seasons as a head coach. His regular-season record was 186-147-1 and he went 7-11 in postseason play.\nHe guided four teams to conference championship games — the Rams three times in the 1970s and the Seahawks in 1983 — but never reached a Super Bowl.\nKnox was named NFL Coach of the Year three times (1973, 1980 and 1984) and was tabbed “Ground Chuck” for his run-first offenses.\nKnox was an offensive line coach before landing the Rams’ job in 1973 and going 12-2, the first of five straight 10-win seasons with the franchise.\nHe departed after the 1977 season to take over the Buffalo Bills and he guided the team to two playoff appearances in five seasons. The sides parted ways due to contract dispute following the 1982 season.\nKnox was hired by the Seahawks and made the playoffs in four of his six seasons and his 80-63 record stands for second-most wins in franchise history behind Mike Holmgren (86-74). Knox departed following the 1991 campaign after a second losing season in a three-year span.\nKnox returned to the Rams and experienced three straight poor seasons — going 15-33 from 1992-94 — to end his NFL head-coaching career.\n—Field Level Media",
