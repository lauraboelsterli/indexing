Dr. Urbanski will report to Shawn Cross, the Company's Chief Executive Officer.\n\"I am pleased to announce the promotion of Dr. Urbanski to President and Chief Medical Officer. The combination of Ray's experience as a practicing physician and subsequently experience in industry, where he has served in key leadership positions including serving as the Chief Medical Officer of one of Pfizer's business units and as the Chief Medical Officer of Mylan. His training, depth of knowledge and experience as well as his organizational acumen has been invaluable as we prepare GT Biopharma for our next stage of growth,\" said Shawn M. Cross, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GT Biopharma. \"In addition to pushing forward our pre-clinical and clinical product candidates, Ray has played a critical role in advancing other company initiatives including recruiting experienced members to our scientific advisory board and board of directors, implementing internal processes and procedures, which are less visible but very important, as progress towards certain goals including a NASDAQ up-listing, among others. In short, I am delighted to have Ray as a senior member of our leadership team.\"\nSince joining the company in October 2017 Dr. Urbanski has been instrumental in driving key milestones and initiatives including the transitioning the first TriKE IND from the University of Minnesota to GT Biopharma while engaging the FDA in preparation for human clinical testing to begin in 2H 2018; implementing processes to expedite the identification and development of future tumor antigen targets; driving forward our Bi-specific Antibody Drug Conjugate platform which included the formation of our Antibody-Drug Conjugate Clinical Advisory Board.
