    "text": "(Reuters) - Westfield Corp ( WFD.AX ) shareholders have voted in favor of a $16 billion takeover by Unibail-Rodamco ( UNBP.AS ), the chairman of the Australian shopping mall giant said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: A Westfield Corp sign adorns the side of a building in central Sydney, Australia, December 12, 2017. REUTERS/David Gray The approval was the final hurdle for the takeover, which has already received the green signal from Unibail shareholders, boards of both companies, as well as Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board.\nChairman Frank Lowy, who also announced his retirement after 58 years with the company, said in a statement that the buyout was “supported by the vast majority of shareholders”.\nHe added that two Westfield directors, Peter Lowy and John McFarlane, would join the supervisory board of Unibail.\nUnibail, Europe’s biggest property firm, and Westfield announced the deal in December, looking to create a global leader in the retail sector that is grappling with the online shopping challenges led by Amazon.\nShares of Westfield had jumped nearly 15 percent on Dec. 13 after the deal was announced.\nWestfield shares were down 0.4 percent on Thursday, versus the broader market’s decline of 0.1 percent.\nReporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru, Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
