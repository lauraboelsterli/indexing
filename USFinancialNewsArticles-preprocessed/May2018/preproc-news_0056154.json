    "text": "ROME, May 27 (Reuters) - Italy’s far-right League leader Matteo Salvini said on Sunday that the coalition of his party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement should be able to name the ministers it wants.\nSalvini’s comments came as Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte was meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella to discuss the list of cabinet candidates the League/5-Star coalition is proposing.\nA source close to the coalition said on Sunday Mattarella had rejected the coalition’s nomination of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as Economy Minister.\n“If we have a minister who is not appreciated in Berlin it means he’s the right minister ... In Italy, Italians decide,” Salvini said.\n“In a democracy, if we are still in a democracy, there’s only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,” he said.
