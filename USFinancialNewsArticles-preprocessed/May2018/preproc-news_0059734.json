    "text": "VANCOUVER, May 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Pacton Gold Inc. (TSXV: PAC, OTC: PACXF) (the \" Company \" or \" Pacton \") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (\" LOI \") to acquire 100% of the Friendly Creek exploration license and mining leases (\" Friendly Creek \") from Gardner Mining Pty Ltd (\" Gardner Mining \"), an Australian proprietary limited exploration company and from Darren White (together, the \" Vendors \"). Five granted mining leases and one granted exploration license comprise a total of 31.36 km 2 (the \" Property \"). Friendly Creek is historically one of the richest known areas for alluvial nuggets within the Pilbara region, where a large amount of alluvial fine grained gold to multiple considerable sized nuggets have been recovered, 127 oz (in 1888) and 165 oz (in 1892) gold nuggets (source: www.mindat.org/loc-272951.html) . Note: These samples are not indicative of the mineralization hosted on the property.\nHighlights of the Transaction:\nStrategic portfolio of 5 granted mining leases and 1 granted exploration license (31.36 km 2 ). Mining leases provide the potential for immediate large scale bulk sampling of mineralization, with existing on site infrastructure including operational camp facility. Alluvial, eluvial and bedrock mining historical gold workings extend over a 10 km strike . Directly adjacent to key exploration properties controlled by Novo Resources Corp. and Kairos Minerals Ltd. Access to the extensive regional knowledge and technical expertise provided by the Gardner Mining Team. Gardner is comprised of corporate finance executives, geologists, prospectors, and mining executives with strategic relationships to the local communities in which it operates.\n\"The acquisition of the Friendly Creek Project, with granted mining leases, clearly places Pacton with a strategic advantage ahead of our peers in creating the opportunity to rapidly conduct large scale bulk sampling programs. The historical discovery of large gold nuggets at Friendly Creek in Western Australia, and an identified mineralised strike length of 10 km, is compelling to justify an upcoming intensive exploration program,\" commented Alec Pismiris, Interim President and CEO of Pacton Gold. \"We look forward to working closely with the Gardner team, as we continue to focus on understanding the true potential of our strategic portfolio holdings and as we look to complete additional accretive acquisitions.\"\nAbout Gardner Mining Team\nThe director, management and associated consultants of Gardner Mining have extensive local operating history within the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The team is comprised of corporate finance executives, geologists, prospectors and mining executives, and has extensive ties to the local communities where it operates. Gardner Mining will work closely with Pacton as required to maximize the ongoing development of their existing project portfolio and to identify further value accretionary opportunities.\nFor location map of the Property, please see: http://www.pactongold.com/Pacton-Location-Map.jpg .\nInitial exploration activities planned to be undertaken include:\nComprehensive review of historical mining and exploration activities conducted on the Property. Acquisition and interpretation of high resolution airborne imagery to refine the palao drainage interpretation. Mapping of regolith, project geology and structural controls relating to mineralization. Infill and extensional geochemical sampling targeting gold. Metal detecting and small scale dry blowing to identify the presence of surficial gold nuggets.\nLOI Terms\nUnder the terms of the LOI, which will be formalized by a definitive agreement among the parties, the Company will purchase a 100% ownership interest in Friendly Creek by paying the Vendors a total of CDN$25,000 and issuing to the Vendors 2,500,000 common shares of Pacton.\nThis transaction is subject to the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nAbout Pacton Gold\nPacton Gold (PAC: TSXV; PACXF: US) is a well-financed Canadian junior with key strategic partners focused on the exploration and development of conglomerate-hosted gold properties located in the district-scale Pilbara gold rush in Western Australia. The Company recently raised approximately $5.5 million, currently controls the third largest conglomerate-hosted gold property portfolio totaling 2,227 km 2 , and continues to aggressively review additional accretive acquisitions.\nThe technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Peter Caldbick, P.Geo., a director of the Company and a Qualified Person pursuant to National Instrument 43-101.
