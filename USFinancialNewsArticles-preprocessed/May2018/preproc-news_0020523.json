    "text": "HOLON, Israel, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sapiens International Corporation , (NASDAQ: SPNS) (TASE: SPNS), a leading global provider of software solutions for the insurance industry, and a member of the Formula Group (NASDAQ: FORTY) (TASE: FORTY), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nRevenue totaled $71.0 million an increase of 25.6% compared to last year.\nNon-GAAP revenue increased 25.7% from the same period in the prior year to $71.1 million. Operating income totaled $4.7 million, up from ($1.6) million last year. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $8.9 million, up from $1.7 million the same period in the prior year. Operating margin of 6.6%, compared to negative margin last year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5%, compared to 3.0% last year. Net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $2.8 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Sapiens' shareholders totaled $6.3 million, compared to $1.2 in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $61.7 million.\n\"In the first quarter we advanced the execution of our long-term strategy to be a leading provider of insurance software solutions and services around the globe. Last year we improved our competitive position through both organic product and solution development, and acquisitions in focused growth markets, particularly in Europe and North America. Now that we are fully integrated, we are realizing deal synergies, and maximizing our acquired talent. We are well positioned to help our customers capitalize on current and future insurance trends, namely digitalization, data analytics, and legacy transformation,\" said Roni Al-Dor, president and CEO, Sapiens.\n\"Revenues were above the high end of our guidance range in the first quarter, and we improved profitability year-over-year. The first quarter Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% was above our guidance of 10%,\" concluded Roni Al-Dor. \"We remain on track to improve operating margins throughout 2018 and reiterate our 2018 Non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 12% to 13% with revenue in the range of $280-$285 million (on a non-GAAP basis).\"\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast on May 7, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (4:30 p.m. in Israel) to review and discuss Sapiens' results.\nPlease call the following numbers (at least 10 minutes before the scheduled time) to participate:\nNorth America (toll-free): + 1-888-407-2553; International: +972-3-918-0610; UK: 0-800-917-5108\nThe live webcast of the call can be viewed on Sapiens' website at: http://www.sapiens.com/investors/presentations-and-webcast/\nIf you are unable to join live, a replay of the call will be accessible until May 15, 2018, as follows:\nNorth America: 1-888-782-4291; International: +972-3-925-5918\nA recorded version of the webcast will also be available via the Sapiens website, for three months at the same location.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income attributed to Sapiens shareholders, and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share.\nSapiens believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Sapiens' financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to the Company's board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures consist of GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude: Valuation adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, amortization of intangible assets, capitalization of software development, stock-based compensation, compensation related to acquisition and acquisition-related costs, restructuring and cost reduction costs, loss on sales of Marketable Securities and tax adjustment regarding non-GAAP adjustments, as well as the impact of one-time adjustment to our deferred taxes as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job act 2017.\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation, or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations, as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\nTo compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. Sapiens urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables of this release.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net profit, adjusted for valuation adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized of software development costs, compensation expenses related to acquisition and acquisition-related costs, restructuring and cost reduction costs, financial expense (income), provision for income taxes and other income (expenses). These amounts are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business.\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of its operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non-cash and non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the operations that the Company believes, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nAbout Sapiens\nSapiens International Corporation is a leading global provider of software solutions for the insurance industry, with a 30-year track record of delivering to more than 400 organizations.
