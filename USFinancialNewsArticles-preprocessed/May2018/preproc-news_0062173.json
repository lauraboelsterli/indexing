    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Builders Capital Mortgage Corp. (TSX VENTURE:BCF) (Builders Capital or the company) today released financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The three-month period represents the first quarter of Builders Capital’s 2018 fiscal year.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nConsistent with the company’s targeted distribution, dividends paid to Class A public shareholders in the quarter were $0.1973 per share, or 8% of the original $10.00 issue price. First quarter mortgage revenue of $0.8 million was up 3.4% year-over-year and represented an annualized 12.8% of gross share capital, calculated on the weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to 13.7% of gross share capital in Q1 2017. Operating expenses (excluding interest and funds set aside for potential loan losses) were within expectations at 10.7% of revenues. At quarter-end, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio was a conservative 17.0%. Earnings exceeded the amount required to pay planned Class A Non-Voting Share dividends by a healthy 1.7 time s.\n“Our topline results strengthened in the first quarter, with revenue up 3.4% compared to the same period last year,” said Sandy Loutitt, President of Builders Capital. “However, our earnings continued to be negatively affected by a block of unproductive inventory assets resulting from foreclosures. I am pleased to report that subsequent to the quarter-end, we entered into contracts for the sale of two of these properties, which have a combined value of $1.2 million. Closing dates are set for the second quarter of this year.”\nThe company was also successful in increasing its mortgage portfolio by $1.0 million or 3.7% in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a number of financing initiatives completed last year. These included raising $2.6 million in new capital, increasing the available limit on its line of credit by $1 million, and securing a $1.3 million loan against property held for resale.\n“The funds raised during 2017 have since been invested in profitable mortgages, which going forward, will help to mitigate the negative impact that any remaining unproductive assets have on earnings. In the interim, our share structure continues to work as intended, with Class A shareholders once again receiving their full, planned quarterly dividend in the first quarter of this year,” added Mr. Loutitt.\nGoing forward, market forecasters predict a continued gradual recovery for Alberta’s economy following the province’s lengthy recession and the outlook is generally favourable for all three of the company’s key geographic markets: Alberta, BC and Saskatchewan. Builders Capital remains well positioned to continue sourcing high-quality lending opportunities that appropriately balance risk while maintaining attractive returns for shareholders.\nQ1 2018 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n$\nThree months ended March 31,\n2017\n$ Revenues 828,979 801,765 Total comprehensive income 575,892 626,712 Total assets 30,060,233 24,503,762 Shareholders’ equity 25,679,439 23,017,258 Basic and diluted earnings per share 0.21 0.27 Cash dividends declared 583,522 638,626 Cash dividends declared per Class A share 0.1973 0.1973 Cash dividends declared per Class B share 0.1763 0.3119 Mortgage Portfolio $25,605,572 $24,693,285 A more detailed discussion of the company’s financial results can be found in Builders Capital’s First Quarter 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which will be posted along with unaudited interim condensed financial statements for the quarter on the company’s website ( www.builderscapital.ca ) and SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) on May 30, 2018.\nAbout Builders Capital\nBuilders Capital is a mortgage lender providing short-term course of construction financing to builders of residential, wood-frame properties in Western Canada. The company was formed on March 28, 2013 but did not commence active operations until December 12, 2013, on the closing of its initial public offering, following which it acquired a portfolio of mortgages from two predecessor companies.\nBuilders Capital’s investment objective is to generate attractive returns, relative to risk, in order to provide stable and steady distributions to shareholders while remaining focused on capital preservation and staying within the criteria mandated for mortgage investment corporations, as defined in the Income Tax Act .\nAs an MIC, Builders Capital is not subject to income tax provided that it distributes all of its taxable income as dividends to shareholders within 90 days of its December 31 st year-end. Such dividends are generally treated by shareholders as interest income, so that each shareholder is in the same tax position as if their proportionate share of mortgage investments made by the company had been made directly by the shareholder.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including statements with respect to management’s beliefs, estimates and intentions, and similar statements concerning anticipated future events, results, circumstances, performance or expectations that are not historical facts.
