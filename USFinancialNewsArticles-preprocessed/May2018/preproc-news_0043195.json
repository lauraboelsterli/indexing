    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 2:30 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Egypt aim to overturn decades of World Cup disappointment Simon Jennings 3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Egypt’s dominance of African football has long been at odds with the country’s dire underachievement at the World Cup but the “Pharaohs” head to Russia with the chance of putting right decades of crushing disappointment. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - International Friendly - Egypt vs Greece - Stadion Letzigrund, Zurich, Switzerland - March 27, 2018 Egypt coach Hector Cuper before the match REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nThe soccer-mad country has won the African Nations Cup seven times but has qualified for only two previous World Cups — in 1934 and 1990.\nOn both occasions Egypt bowed out without winning a game but under the guidance of Argentine Hector Cuper they have the ability to go deep in this year’s tournament.\nThe pace and finishing skills of forward Mohamed Salah are a lethal asset and a group including Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and hosts Russia gives Egypt a good chance of making the knockout stages for the first time.\nEgypt are ranked 46th in the world, above Russia and Saudi Arabia, and should finish second in Group A behind Uruguay but will probably face title contenders Spain or Portugal in the last 16.\nCuper’s team came through the third round of World Cup qualifying with four wins, a draw and one defeat, using a game plan based on a strong defensive foundation.\nThe 62-year-old, who twice took Valencia to the Champions League final, has developed a team capable of soaking up pressure and using Salah’s pace to launch devastating counter-attacks.\nThe Argentine’s tactics have divided opinion, with many fans craving more attacking adventure, but Egypt’s run to last year’s African Nations Cup final showed how effective they are at tournaments.
