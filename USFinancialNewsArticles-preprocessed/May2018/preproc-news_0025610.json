    "text": "24 COMMENTS Though a judge won’t rule until June, the government’s sad performance in the courtroom further indicated why the lawsuit blocking the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner was a bureaucratic cluster-phenomenon that should never have been brought.\nMakan Delrahim, the new antitrust chief, inherited an Obama Justice Department staff leaning toward approving the deal with heavy Comcast -style conditions. President Trump blurted out during the campaign that the deal should be blocked altogether. Mr. Delrahim himself, in academic life, had dogmatized that Comcast-style solutions were too “regulatory.”\nIf he had not thrown some kind of objection at the AT&T deal, he would have been seen contradicting himself, his staff and his president in his first big decision. Conspicuously missing here is any sense that bureaucrats need better reasons before interfering with Americans going about their business. One lawyer even told me a case should be filed because, you know, it would be interesting to hear what a court said. Indeed, a perfect cap to this lusterless proceeding was the recent news that AT&T hired New York taxi entrepreneur and fixer Michael Cohen to explain the Trump administration to it.\nIn the pending merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, our myrmidons have a chance to do better. Will they?\nUnfortunately they start from the preconception that everything good that has happened in the wireless market since 2011 happened because Team Obama blocked a merger of T-Mobile and AT&T. This is the post hoc fallacy in spades.\nIn fact, Sprint, the nation’s fourth carrier, had already attracted the attention of the serial disrupter from Japan, Masayoshi Son. Not far-seeing bureaucrats but the growing importance of broadband video is what pushed wireless, with the now-thwarted T-Mobile landing the first punch, to adopt all-you-can-eat pricing as the new industry proto-standard.\nAn idée fixe ever since has been that the country “needs” four national wireless carriers. What the country really needs is robust competition in pricing and innovation, but not so many players that customers are forced to pay for redundant cell towers and inefficient spectrum use.\nThe government is also habituated to treating resellers, or so-called virtual mobile network operators, as a nonfactor. This is wrongheaded.\nThese resellers, including TracFone, with 25 million clients, exist because they create value that the four majors can’t create for themselves. Especially notable are Google, Republic Wireless and the cable giants Comcast and Charter, whose offerings let the Big Four get paid for services that mostly bypass their networks in favor of Wi-Fi.\nThe government likes to assume Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile can pull the plug on the resellers anytime they want, but the opposite is true. The Big Four need the traffic; in the case of their cable customers, they also need access to cable’s extensive wired network to support their future rollout of 5G “small cells.”\nThe evaporating distinction between fixed and wireless is just one consequence. Network operators also worry about being reduced to commodity suppliers for companies with more appealing brands, such as Apple , Amazon, Facebook and Google, which could offer ad-supported connectivity in a package along with their other attractive services.\nAsk yourself why AT&T is buying Time Warner’s antiquated TV properties in the first place, or why Comcast is scrambling after those of Fox. So they have something to offer when supplying network access no longer is enough.\nSo desperate are regulators to keep doing what they’ve been doing, however, they overlook all this. The emerging commodification of connectivity is behind all the deals we’ve been seeing. It is the single factor underlying the rise of Netflix . Disney is beside itself trying to figure out how to adapt to such a world. Yet some regulators actually insist their jobs require them to ignore predictable but still nascent changes in the marketplace—i.e., produce bad policy. (This is essentially the government’s argument in the AT&T case.)\nAlas, we can’t expect much from our antitrust agencies, which long ago proved themselves to be bureaucratic nuthouses committed to finding reasons to inject themselves in ways that purely disserve the American people and economy.\nThat’s why, in many minds, the outcome of the AT&T case has become an important bellwether. Brian Roberts of Comcast, for one, is reportedly holding back his Fox bid pending a favorable ruling. So what began as a parochial attempt by a new antitrust chief to minimize his embarrassment has become, somewhat idiotically, a test of whether the new Trump administration will support the 5G economy or entrap it in molasses.\nAppeared in the May 12, 2018, print edition.",
