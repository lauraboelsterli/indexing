(“Dyadic”) (OTCQX:DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving and applying its proprietary C1 gene expression platform to speed up the development and production of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales, announced its financial results for the 2018.\n“Based on the encouraging data we generated to date in our research programs, we are seeing increased interest in our C1 Gene Expression Platform and gaining traction in our business development efforts,” said Mark Emalfarb, President and CEO of Dyadic. “We continue to see additional positive data that we anticipate will expedite our entering into a number of further, but just as important, additional research collaborations throughout the remainder of the year.”\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nEntered into three research collaborations, including Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. and the Israel Institute for Biological Research. Data generated from research collaborations with two top-tier pharmaceutical companies continues to show encouraging results on FC-Fusion proteins and monoclonal antibody productivity and manufacturing process development. Reached productivity levels as high as 1.71 grams per liter per day for monoclonal antibodies and 1.31 grams per liter per day for FC-Fusion proteins. Achieved positive results in our initial glycoengineering modifications of C1 strains, moving ahead with our research programs to develop C1 strains that produce mAbs with mammalian-like glycosylation. In March 2018, the Board approved a proposal to vote on a reverse stock split at the annual shareholder meeting to be held on June 6, 2018. Barry Buckland, Ph.D., a recognized industry thought leader, including 29 years at Merck, joined the Board of Directors in January 2018. Promoted to Chief Accounting Officer, Ping W. Rawson, who has replaced Tom Dubinski, our former Chief Financial Officer, to serve as the Company's principal financial officer and assume responsibility for finance, tax and treasury.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.6 million compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2017. The carrying value of investment-grade securities, including interest receivable as of March 31, 2018, was approximately $43.1 million compared to $43.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nResearch and development revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased to approximately $184,000 compared to $122,000 for the same period a year ago. Cost of research and development revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased to approximately $147,000 compared to $122,000 for the same period a year ago. The increases in revenue and cost of research and development revenue are attributable to new research collaborations in 2018.\nProvision for contract losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0 compared to approximately $211,000 for the same period a year ago. The provision for contract losses recorded in 2017 was associated with the Company's extended involvement in the ZAPI program and another research collaboration completed in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased to approximately $577,000 compared to $320,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase principally reflects the costs of additional internal research activities with third-party contract research organizations and personnel related costs.\nResearch and development expenses - related party, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased to approximately $393,000 compared to $0 for the same period a year ago. The increase reflects the research and development costs associated with the Company’s R&D Agreements with BDI, which started in July 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased to approximately $1,293,000 compared to $1,790,000 for the same period a year ago. The decrease principally reflects reductions in legal and litigation costs of approximately $561,000 and share-based compensation expenses related to stock options granted in 2018 of approximately $92,000, offset by separation costs associated with our former CFO of approximately $97,000, increase in business development costs of approximately $55,000, and other increases of approximately $4,000.\nForeign currency exchange loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was approximately $5,000 compared to a gain of $28,000 for the same period a year ago. The change represents the currency fluctuation of the Euro in comparison to U.S. dollar.\nInterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased to approximately $186,000 compared to $116,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase in interest income reflects the higher yield on the Company’s investment grade securities, which are classified as held-to-maturity.\nNet loss for the 2018, was approximately $(2.0) million, or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the receipt of a litigation settlement of approximately $4.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, there were approximately 28.1 million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 10.9 million shares held in treasury, after the Company purchased 267,000 shares at a weighted average price of $1.40 per share in open market transactions in the first quarter of 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nDyadic management will host a conference call today, Thursday, May 10, 2018 , at 5:00 p.m. to discuss the financial results for the 2018.

The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars/biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of these technologies in development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers and, hopefully, improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.\nPlease visit Dyadic’s website at www.dyadic.com for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic’s plans for its biopharmaceutical business.\nDyadic trades on the OTCQX tier of the OTC marketplace.
