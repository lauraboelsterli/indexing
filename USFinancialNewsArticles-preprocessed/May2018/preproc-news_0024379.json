    "text": "DALLAS, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Builders FirstSource, Inc. (Nasdaq:BLDR) today reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCommenting on first quarter results, CEO Chad Crow remarked, “I am pleased to report we had a strong start to the year, expanding our year over year sales per day by 12.7 percent in the first quarter. We have once again demonstrated our ability to deliver robust sales and EBITDA growth in a volatile market while executing on our strategic priorities and investing in our future. We continued our investments in manufacturing capacity and talent to drive enhanced growth in margin-accretive products and markets, as well as implementing our operational excellence plans, which are included in our longer term strategy to generate significant EBITDA and cash flow.”\nPeter Jackson, CFO, added, “Our team rapidly responded to the operational challenges caused by lumber and lumber sheet goods inflation during the current quarter, delivering strong operating results by focusing on disciplined cost and margin management. Commodity inflation generally benefits our business in the long term, but can cause short term margin pressure when prices rise quickly. We are seeing the benefits in EBITDA from higher lumber prices on a year over year basis. As commodity prices stabilize, we expect to further benefit from the higher prices, enhancing our go forward profitability.”\nThe Company has provided supplemental non-GAAP financial information of the consolidated company which is adjusted to exclude one-time integration, facility closure, one-time refinancing, revaluation of deferred taxes, and other costs (“Adjusted”). As the information below includes non-GAAP financial information, please refer to the accompanying financial schedules for non-GAAP reconciliations to their GAAP equivalents.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the first quarter were $1.7 billion, a sales increase of 10.9 percent over net sales for the first quarter of 2017, despite the impacts of weather-related facility closures on the Company’s sales. The Company had one fewer sales day in the first quarter of 2018 than the first quarter of 2017. Sales per day grew 12.7 percent in the quarter, which was benefited by approximately 9.6 percent from the impact of commodity lumber price inflation on our sales and 3.1 percent from sales volume growth. Sales volume per day, excluding commodity inflation, grew approximately 3.8 percent in the single family homebuilding end market and 2.8 percent in the repair and remodeling/other end market, offset by expected declines in multi-family. Additionally, value added products sales per day grew by 9.8 percent, including 8.9 percent in our windows, doors, and millwork category and 10.7 percent in manufactured products.\nGross Margin\nGross margin of $411.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $34.9 million over the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin percentage was 24.2 percent, a decrease of 30 basis points from 24.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017, but flat sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017. Our gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the impact of commodity price inflation relative to our short-term customer pricing commitments. Although rapid commodity inflation can cause short term gross margin percentage compression as prices are rising, higher commodity prices generally benefit the Company’s gross profit and EBITDA in the long term.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A in the first quarter of 2018 was $358.9 million, or 21.1 percent of sales, a decrease of 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales was driven by cost leverage and continued cost management. These were partially offset by investments the Company made in growth initiatives of $4.6 million (including sales associates, new locations and operational excellence projects start-up costs). Additionally, there was a $4.2 million one-time decrease in insurance and benefits expense in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect this variance to repeat the balance of the year.\nInterest Expense\nGAAP interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $26.7 million compared to $36.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net interest expense in 2017 included $2.4 million of cost associated with the amendment of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. The year over year reduction is largely as a result of a series of transactions the Company executed in 2017 to lower go forward interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAlthough the Company did not pay federal cash taxes, GAAP income tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 million compared to income tax expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Income\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $27.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net income of $12.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The year over year increase of $15.5 million, or 128 percent, was primarily driven by the Company’s sales growth, ongoing cost management, and lower interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFirst quarter Adjusted EBITDA grew $6.5 million, or 8.6 percent, to $82.6 million compared to $76.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The year over year improvement was largely driven by sales increases and cost management, partially offset by the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin, investments the Company made in growth initiatives of $4.6 million, and a one-time decrease in insurance and benefits costs in the first quarter of 2017 totaling $4.2 million.\nCapital Structure, Leverage, and Liquidity Information:\nAdjusted EBITDA, on a trailing 12 month basis, was $425.4 million and net debt was $1,949.2 million as of March 31, 2018. Despite the impact of lumber inflation on working capital, the Company’s leverage ratio of 4.6x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA was down from 5.0x as of March 31, 2017, enabled by a net debt reduction and Adjusted EBITDA growth. We expect to reduce our leverage ratio to 3.5x or below by year end. Due to seasonal working capital needs, net cash used in operations and investing was $197.9 million. We expect to generate $170-190 million in cash from operations and investing in 2018, in line with the Company’s full year cash flow guidance, reaping the benefits of lower cash interest as a result of our refinancing transaction executed in 2017. Liquidity at December 31, 2018 was $321.9 million, which consisted of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand.\nPlease refer to the accompanying financial schedules for more information.\nOutlook\nConcluding, Mr. Crow added, “I remain confident in the outlook for Builders FirstSource and our expanding opportunities for growth. We believe demand in the housing industry remains on a solid trajectory. Our national footprint, strong customer relationships, end market diversity, and ongoing focus on investments in growth initiatives position us to capitalize on the opportunities the market provides. As always, we are committed to creating meaningful value for our shareholders through the Company’s identified initiatives and capitalizing on ongoing market growth. Thank you to all of our associates for their hard work and once again delivering such strong results. I look forward to building on what was a very successful quarter, and continuing to expand our share and profitability.”\nConference Call\nBuilders FirstSource will host a conference call Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (CT) and will simultaneously broadcast it live over the Internet.
