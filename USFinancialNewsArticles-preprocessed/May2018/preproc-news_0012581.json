    "text": "DENVER, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SM Energy Company (\"SM Energy\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SM) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018. Highlights include:\nNew wells outperforming expectations . 19 new RockStar wells reached peak 30-day IP rates that averaged 1,440 Boe/d per well (88% oil) Production exceeded guidance range . 113 MBoe/d average production, 42% oil. Midland Basin production was up 18% sequentially and 100% year-over-year Rapid margin expansion . $23.10 per Boe operating margin (pre-hedge) was the highest in 14 quarters, up 30% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year Strong earnings . Net income was $317.4 million; EPS was $2.81 and adjusted EPS was $0.07, per diluted common share; net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) was $140.1 million and adjusted EBITDAX was $210.2 million (adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP measures; see below for additional information) Significant reduction in net debt . $792 million in closed or pending asset sales year-to-date core up portfolio\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Jay Ottoson comments: \"New well results are positive across the board, continuing to demonstrate the quality of our Midland Basin assets and our excellent track record for strong operational execution. First quarter successes in reducing net debt and driving margin expansion underscore our long-term objectives to reduce leverage and drive a competitively high rate of cash flow growth.\"\nSUMMARY WELL RESULTS\nResults from new RockStar wells (18 of 19 have 10,000 foot laterals) that have reached their 30-day peak IP rates include:\n13 Wolfcamp A wells had average peak 30-day IP rates of approximately 1,500 Boe/d per well (89% oil) 4 Wolfcamp B wells had average peak 30-day IP rates of approximately 1,250 Boe/d per well (84% oil) 2 Lower Spraberry wells had average peak 30-day IP rates of approximately 1,485 Boe/d per well (87% oil), among the Company's strongest Lower Spraberry wells to date\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nProduction of 10.14 MMBoe (112.7 MBoe/d) exceeded the Company's guidance range, reflecting strong performance from new wells in the Midland Basin, partially offset by reduced production in the Eagle Ford related to third party pipeline downtime. $37.76/Boe average realized price (before the effects of realized hedges) and $23.10/Boe operating margin are the highest since late 2014. Margin expansion is primarily the result of a higher percentage of oil in the production mix, as the Company continues its portfolio transition and focuses its development program on its highest return assets, as well as higher benchmark pricing for oil and NGLs. LOE of $4.95/Boe was lower than the Company's expectations due to higher volumes and the timing of well workovers and roadwork\nFirst quarter of 2018 net income was $317.4 million or $2.81 per diluted common share, up from $74.4 million or $0.67 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017. Net income includes a $385.4 million gain on divestiture activity, following the sale of the majority of the Company's Powder River Basin assets for $500 million. Net income also includes a net derivative loss of $7.5 million, which includes $24.5 million in realized hedge losses.\nFirst quarter of 2018 net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) was $140.1 million.\nAdjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share and adjusted EBITDAX are non-GAAP measures. Please reference the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this release.\nFirst quarter of 2018 adjusted net income was $8.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted common share, up from a net loss of ($19.6) million, or ($0.18) per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017. The calculation of adjusted net loss excludes non-recurring items and items difficult to estimate, in order to present results that can be more consistently compared with prior periods and peer results. Specifically, first quarter adjustments remove the net gain on divestitures, non-cash derivative losses and abandonment and impairment charges.\nFirst quarter of 2018 adjusted EBITDAX was $210.2 million, up from $172.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Increased adjusted EBITDAX was primarily driven by a 68% increase in the operating margin compared with the prior year, partially offset by a 16% decline in production due to asset divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAX includes an accrual of $0.8 million to other expense that was a non-recurring charge.\nFINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY\nAt March 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance on the Company's long-term debt included $2.8 billion in senior notes plus $172.5 million in senior convertible notes, with zero drawn on the Company's senior secured credit facility. At quarter-end, the Company had a cash balance of $643.3 million, providing for net debt of $2.3 billion. The Company's undrawn credit facility plus cash on hand provided $1.6 billion in liquidity.\nPro forma for the expected sales of the Company's North Dakota and Texas assets for $292.3 million, net debt at quarter-end would have been $2.0 billion.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the lenders on the Company's credit facility increased the borrowing base to $1.4 billion and aggregate lender commitments to $1.0 billion.\nCOMMODITY DERIVATIVES\nFor the last nine months of 2018, the Company currently has commodity derivatives in place for approximately 85% of expected oil production and 65% of expected gas production (NGLs are hedged by product). Additionally, the Company has Midland-Cushing basis hedges in place for approximately 70% of expected Permian oil production for the remainder of 2018 at just over $1.00 per Bbl.\nSCHEDULE FOR FIRST QUARTER REPORTING\nThis release is accompanied by an investor presentation and pre-recorded call with transcript all posted to the Company's website.

obligation liability accretion expense, exploration expense, property abandonment and impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative gains and losses net of settlements, gains and losses on divestitures, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, and certain other items. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that we present because we believe it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Agreement based on adjusted EBITDAX ratios. In addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or other profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable to similar metrics of other companies. Our credit facility provides a material source of liquidity for us. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, if we failed to comply with the covenants that establish a maximum permitted ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDAX and a minimum permitted ratio of adjusted EBITDAX to interest, we would be in default, an event that would prevent us from borrowing under our credit facility and would therefore materially limit our sources of liquidity. In addition, if we are in default under our credit facility and are unable to obtain a waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under that facility and under the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes and Senior Convertible Notes would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for default.\n(2) Interest income is included within the other non-operating income (expense), net line item on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(3) Stock-based compensation expense is a component of exploration expense and general and administrative expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Therefore, the exploration line items shown in the reconciliation above will vary from the amount shown on the Company's accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the component of stock-based compensation expense recorded to exploration expense.\n(4) Certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation on the condensed consolidated financial statements due to accounting standards updates.\nSM ENERGY COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (UNAUDITED)\nMarch 31, 2018\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n317,401\n$\n74,434\nNet derivative (gain) loss\n7,529\n(114,774)\nDerivative settlement gain (loss)\n(24,528)\n7\nNet gain on divestiture activity\n(385,369)\n(37,463)\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties\n5,625\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n35\nOther, net (1)\n807\n4,986\nTax effect of adjustments (2)\n86,710\n53,142\nAdjusted net income (loss) (Non-GAAP) (3)\n$\n8,175\n$\n(19,633)\nDiluted net income per common share (GAAP)\n$\n2.81\n$\n0.67\nNet derivative (gain) loss\n0.07\n(1.03)\nDerivative settlement gain (loss)\n(0.22)\n—\nNet gain on divestiture activity\n(3.41)\n(0.34)\nAbandonment and impairment of unproved properties\n0.05\n—\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\nOther, net (1)\n0.01\n0.04\nTax effect of adjustments (2)\n0.76\n0.48\nAdjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share (Non-GAAP) (4)\n$\n0.07\n$\n(0.18)\nBasic weighted-average common shares outstanding (GAAP)\n111,696\n111,258\nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding (GAAP)\n112,879\n111,329\nNote: Amounts may not calculate due to rounding.\n(1) For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the adjustment is related to bad debt expense and an accrual for a non-recurring matter. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, the adjustment is related to impairment of materials inventory and the change in the Net Profits Plan liability. These items are included in other operating expenses on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(2) The tax effect of adjustments is calculated using a tax rate of 21.9% and 36.1% for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively. These rates approximate the Company's statutory tax rate for the respective periods, as adjusted for ordinary permanent differences.\n(3) Adjusted net income (loss) excludes certain items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results. Items excluded generally are non-recurring items or are items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. These items include non-cash and other adjustments, such as derivative gains and losses net of settlements, impairments, net (gain) loss on divestiture activity, materials inventory loss, and gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. The non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income (loss) is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of SM Energy's fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net income (loss) is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash provided by operating activities, or other income, profitability, cash flow, or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP. Since adjusted net income (loss) excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted net income (loss) amounts presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n(4) For periods where the Company reports adjusted net loss, basic weighted-average common shares outstanding are used in the calculation of adjusted net loss per diluted common share.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sm-energy-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300642322.html\nSOURCE SM Energy Company",
