    "text": "54 COMMENTS The family of Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17-year-old suspected of killing 10 people and wounding 10 more in a shooting at a Texas high school, said they were “shocked and confused” by his alleged actions and were cooperating with authorities.\nIn a statement released Saturday, the family said they were searching for answers as to why the teenager might have gone on the shooting rampage Friday in the small town of Santa Fe, southeast of Houston. And they said the description of the massacre, in which authorities say he burst into an art class, armed with his father’s shotgun and revolver, and began firing on classmates, didn’t fit with the person they know.\n“While we remain mostly in the dark about the specifics of yesterday’s tragedy, what we have learned from media reports seems incompatible with the boy we love,” the family said.\nRelated\nTexas Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Exchange Student, Substitute Teachers Texas School-Shooting Suspect Showed Few Red Flags Ten Killed in Texas School Shooting In the statement, the family said they were “gratified by the public comments made by other Santa Fe High School students that show Dimitri as we know him: a smart, quiet, sweet boy.”\nThe family thanked first responders and offered condolences to the victims of the attack.\nNicholas Poehl, a lawyer retained by the family, said Mr. Pagourtzis was being kept in solitary confinement at the Galveston County Jail, where he is being held without bond, and is on a suicide watch.\nMr. Poehl said he had visited Mr. Pagourtzis Friday and Saturday and said his client was “mostly in shock right now.”\nHe said Mr. Pagourtzis had no prior criminal history and described him as an “honor roll student, played sports…a good, great kid.”\nInvestigators were still trying on Saturday to piece together a motive for the shooting rampage. Mr. Poehl said the teen came from a large, extended family who had been left reeling by Friday’s events.\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com",
