(the “Company”, “Marcus & Millichap”, “MMI”) (NYSE: MMI), a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues increased by 13.9% to $174.5 million compared to a 6.7% decline in the first quarter of 2017. Net income increased by 50.1%. Net income when adjusted for the new tax law increased by 24.7%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 22.3%. Private Client Market segment brokerage commissions and transactions increased by 6.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Transaction growth indicates further market share gains in a flat to moderately positive market sales based on preliminary reports. Middle Market and Larger Transaction Market segments combined brokerage commissions and transactions increased by 44.3% and 36.5%, respectively.\nHessam Nadji, President and CEO stated, “We are pleased that our expanded client out-reach, increased business development activities and investments in the Marcus & Millichap platform generated strong first quarter results.” Mr. Nadji continued, “Over the past year, our team demonstrated agility and expertise in helping clients navigate heightened market volatility, culminating in revenue growth of nearly 14% in the first quarter. Our brokerage revenue showed healthy growth in all market segments, including a 6.3% increase in private client revenue. We believe we took additional share in the first quarter, since market sales were flat to modestly higher due to higher interest rates and persistent bid/ask spread.” Mr. Nadji added, “Looking forward, clarity on various aspects of the new tax law should gradually manifest in transactions as investors view the new tax law as favorable toward commercial real estate. This, coupled with steady job growth and still-healthy fundamentals, should counter higher interest rates. Marcus & Millichap is well positioned to deliver best in class service to our clients, grow share and revenues; albeit at a more tempered pace given the sequential improvements we achieved last year starting in the second quarter. Our balance sheet provides strength in the event of an unexpected market disruption and flexibility for strategic acquisitions as we continue to create long-term shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $174.5 million compared to $153.2 million for the same period in the prior year, increasing by $21.3 million, or 13.9%. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the increase in real estate brokerage commissions, which increased by 16.0% to $162.5 million. This increase in brokerage commissions was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and number of transactions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates due to a higher proportion of transactions from the Larger Transaction Market segment, which generate lower commission rates. The increase in brokerage commissions were partially offset by a slight decrease in financing fees and other revenues.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 12.6% to $151.1 million compared to $134.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a 13.4% increase in cost of services, which are primarily variable commissions paid to the Company’s investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs in connection with our financing activities. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues decreased by 30 basis points to 58.2% compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 11.2% to $48.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher costs associated with (i) sales operations support and promotional marketing expenses; (ii) compensation related costs, including salaries and related benefits and management performance compensation; (iii) stock-based compensation expense and (iv) expansion of existing offices.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $18.0 million, or $0.46 per common share (basic and diluted), compared to net income of $12.0 million, or $0.31 per common share (basic and diluted) for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 22.3% to $27.4 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $22.4 million for the same period in the prior year. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 1,769 investment sales and financing professionals.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe believe that the Company is positioned to continue to gain market share by leveraging a number of factors, including our leading national brand predominantly within our Private Client Market segment and specialty groups, experienced management team, infrastructure investments and proprietary technology. The size and fragmentation of the Private Client Market segment, in particular, continues to offer long-term growth opportunities with the top ten brokerage firms making up only 25.2% market share. This market segment consistently accounts for over 80% of commercial property sales transactions and over 60% of the commission pool. The Company’s growth plan also includes further expansion into various specialty property types such as hospitality, self-storage, seniors housing and the Larger Transaction Market segment, as well as expansion of its financing division, Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation.\nKey factors likely to influence the Company’s business in 2018 include:\nVolatility in market sales and investor sentiment driven by: Slowdown in market sales in the short- to mid-term in view of a maturing cycle, rising interest rates, bid-ask spread gap between buyers and sellers and economic trends. Possible boost to investor sentiment and sales activity based on Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulatory easing and proposed economic initiatives which are expected to increase real estate demand. Experienced agents’ larger share of revenue production in a more challenging market environment resulting in a higher average commission payout. Volatility in the Company’s Middle and Larger Transaction Market segments. The potential for merger and acquisition activity and subsequent integration.\nIn addition, the reduction of MMI’s effective corporate tax rate to the 25.5%-26.5% range from nearly 40% in prior years as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may also affect the Company’s business in 2018. These factors, in addition to the business’s typical transaction closing date variability, highlight the importance of viewing the Company’s business through a long-term, at least annual, perspective.\nConference Call Details\nMarcus & Millichap will host a conference call today to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time/5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in its business operations to evaluate the performance of its business, develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets, among other things. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company finds Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, the Company does not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also considers its U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 18,011 $ 12,000 Adjustments: Interest income and other (1) (1,228 ) (625 ) Interest expense 360 382 Provision for income taxes (2) 6,302 7,502 Depreciation and amortization expense 1,375 1,297 Stock-based compensation 2,613 1,866 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 27,433 $ 22,422 (1)\nOther for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 includes net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities, available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. (2)\nProvision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was calculated using a revised 21% U.S. federal corporate tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. (3)\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to higher total revenues and a lower proportion of operating expenses compared to revenues. Tax Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation\nDue to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company calculated tax adjusted net income using the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 25.92%. The adjustment was made to illustrate what the growth rate would have been had the effective income tax rate been the same in both periods. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to tax adjusted net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nChange\n2018 2017 Percentage Income before provision for income taxes $ 24,313 $ 19,502 24.7 % Provision for income taxes (6,302 ) (7,502 ) (16.0 ) Net income $ 18,011 $ 12,000 50.1 % Income before provision for income taxes $ 24,313 $ 19,502 24.7 % Provision for income taxes (1) (6,302 ) (5,055 ) (24.7 ) Tax adjusted net income (1) $ 18,011 $ 14,447 24.7 % (1)\nProvision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was calculated using the effective income tax rate of 25.92% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
