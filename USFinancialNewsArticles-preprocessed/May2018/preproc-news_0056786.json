    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland voted by a landslide to liberalize its highly restrictive abortion laws as 66 percent of the electorate backed a referendum, official results showed on Saturday.\nPeople celebrate the result of yesterday's referendum on liberalizing abortion law, in Dublin, Ireland, May 26, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi Voters in the once deeply Catholic nation were asked if they wished to scrap a prohibition that was enshrined in the constitution by referendum 35 years ago, and partly lifted in 2013 only for cases where the motherâ€™s life was in danger.\nOver 64 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot, one of the highest ever for a referendum.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
