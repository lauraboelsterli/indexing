GOBankingRates Aluminum surges due to tariff uncertainties Aluminum was up 3.23% Thursday morning as US and Chinese trade officials are headed into talks in Beijing. The metal has been spiking on the back of tariff uncertainties on multiple fronts. Some are worried the meetings could make tensions even worse, possibly advancing the hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs that the world's largest economies have threatened on one another. According to analysts, the tariff uncertainties will likely keep propping aluminum prices up for the next few months.

They have lost more than a quarter of their value since touching a high of $389.61 in September, mainly due to reports of bottlenecks around production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to Tesla's profitability.\nThe call came after Tesla forecast lower capital spending for the year and reiterated it would turn a profit in the second half of the year.\nBut Musk was also bullish on the pace of some of its more expensive projects, promising he would make a decision on the construction of a new Model Y factory by the fourth quarter and announce the location of a Chinese Gigafactory soon.\nHe also pledged to cut costs by rationalizing the number of third-party contractors Tesla is using.\nThat \"has really gotten out of control,\" Musk said. \"So we're going to scrub the barnacles on that front. You've got barnacles on barnacles. So there's going to be a lot of barnacle removal.\"\nNEGATIVE CASHFLOW\nTesla has consistently fallen short of its promises on car production and Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi pointed to two occasions in 2015 and 2016 when executives promised the company would not need to raise funds in a year before having to do so.\nThe company has raised capital each year since its initial public offering in 2010 and issued debt twice in 2017.\nTesla's free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.\nThe company plans to reach its weekly goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars in two months, after revising the target several times.\nTesla's use of robots to assemble Model 3s has led to more complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged last month.\n\"We believe that Tesla is essentially learning how to become a manufacturing company on the fly,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.\n\"Investor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes.\"\n",
