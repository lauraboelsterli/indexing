    "text": "0 COMMENTS Activist investor Carl Icahn is suing AmTrust Financial Services Inc., AFSI -0.36% a firm in which he owns a 9.4% stake, over the company’s deal to go private.\nMr. Icahn said in a statement Monday that the $2.7 billion agreement to take AmTrust private—which was announced a few months ago —“is happening at the wrong price and at the wrong time.”\n“The going-private transaction is an opportunistic attempt to take control of a company at historic lows, right before a period of expected recovery and possible earnings growth,” Icahn Capital LP said in a news release.\nIcahn Capital is suing the workers’ compensation insurance company along with board members George and Leah Karfunkel and Chief Executive Officer Barry Zyskind. AmTrust has agreed to be taken private by both the Zyskind and Karfunkel families, as well as a Stone Point Capital unit.\nRepresentatives for Stone Point and the families weren’t immediately available for comment.\nRelated\nIcahn, Corvex Push for Sale of Energen—Potentially to Themselves Icahn Capital also said Monday that the Zyskind and Karfunkel families and the company “have manipulated the record date, which could result in a shareholder vote that severely tilts the playing field to advantage” those families “while blatantly disadvantaging the public shareholders.” Last week, the firm called on AmTrust’s board to set a new record date and push back the shareholder vote.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating AmTrust for almost five years, the company disclosed earlier this month. The regulator is looking at AmTrust’s accounting practices, among other things. AmTrust has said the investigation is ongoing. The Wall Street Journal had previously reported the SEC had been investigating the company’s accounting.\nShares of AmTrust rose 2.7% to $14.14 early afternoon on Monday. In the past year, they have climbed 17%.\nThe litigation from Mr. Icahn comes shortly after he and another activist investor, Darwin Deason, successfully beat back a merger deal between Xerox Corp. and Fujifilm Holdings Corp. , in part because of a lawsuit Mr. Deason filed to block the deal.\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com",
