    "text": "LAS VEGAS, NV, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Her Imports (OTCQB: HHER), a leading retailer of human hair extensions and related beauty products, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Revenue for the quarter totaled $3.3 million with income from operations of $125,742.\nBarry Hall, Chief Executive Officer of Her Imports, stated, “During the first quarter of 2018 we continued to face the same challenges experienced by most retailers in the U.S. However, despite a significant drop in revenues when compared to the same quarter in 2017 we were able to maintain our gross margins and still achieve operating profitability.” Hall added, “It is important to note that at the beginning of the quarter we converted to a new cloud-based eCommerce platform from a server-based eCommerce platform. This change allows the Company to optimize its mobile marketing efforts. Because of the change, the Company incurred a one-time charge of $384,075 from the write-off the previous platform and a prepaid maintenance agreement associated with it.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Highlights:\nLaunch a new cloud-based eCommerce platform. Used our new platform to reach our customers using mobile marketing using SMS messaging and social platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat. Developed “mini-CRMs” that interface with our on-line shopping cart and are customized based on the marketing promotion.\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter 2018:\nRevenue totaled $3.3 million for the first quarter 2018, as compared to $4.4 million, a decrease of 24.1%, primarily attributable to retail location closings that took place during 2017. Gross margin remained steady at approximately 51% for the quarter. Income from operations was $125,742 in first quarter of 2018 versus $648,329 for the same quarter in 2017. Incurred a one-time expense of $384,075 related to the write-off of the Company’s old eCommerce platform. Net loss attributable to the Company was $268,844 for the first quarter of 2018, compared income of $647,512 for the same quarter in 2017.\nAbout Her Imports:\nHer Imports sells human hair extensions and related hair-care and beauty products at retail locations throughout the U.S. and on our Website, www.herimports.com .
