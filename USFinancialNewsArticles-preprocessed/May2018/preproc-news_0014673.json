(NYSE:VSH), one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components, today announced its results for the fiscal .\nRevenues for the fiscal were $716.8 million, compared to $673.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $604.8 million for the fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2017. Net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal were $62.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to Vishay stockholders of $177.7 million, or $(1.23) per share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, and net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders of $36.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2017.\nAs summarized on the attached reconciliation schedule, all periods presented include items affecting comparability. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude these items net of tax and the unusual tax items, were $0.40, $0.37, and $0.28 for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and April 1, 2017, respectively.\nCommenting on the results for the first quarter 2018, Dr. Gerald Paul, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “In the first quarter, Vishay continued to enjoy excellent business conditions in virtually all markets; especially, Vishay’s key markets of automotive and industrial show unbroken strength. The present favorable market conditions neither represent a spike of demand by a few applications like in 2000 nor a recovery from a general crisis like in 2010. We trust in an accelerated growth trend of our markets—in particular, the automotive and industrial end markets—for the years to come. We prepare ourselves by continuing to expand manufacturing capacities for our constrained key product lines while remaining careful in adding operational fixed costs.”\nCommenting on the outlook Dr. Paul stated, “For the second quarter we guide for revenues of $740 to $780 million and gross margins of 28.5% to 29.5% at the exchange rates for the first quarter.”\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted several new accounting standards, including ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" and related guidance; ASU 2016-01, \"Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities;\" and ASU 2017-07, \"Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\" Where required by the applicable new standards, prior periods have been recast to retrospectively reflect the impact of the standards. Recast statements of operations for each quarter of 2017, and the full years 2017 and 2016, are included in the financial tables in this press release. The impact of these new accounting standards on income (loss) before taxes was not material, though the new standards impacted various individual line items, which slightly changed historical gross margin and operating margin calculations. More detailed discussion of the impact of these new accounting standards will be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q when it is filed.\nA conference call to discuss Vishay’s first quarter financial results is scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET. The dial-in number for the conference call is 877-589-6174 (+1 706-643-1406 if calling from outside the United States or Canada) and the conference ID is 1357089.\nThere will be a replay of the conference call from 12:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 through 11:59 p.m. ET on Tuesday, May 15, 2018. The telephone number for the replay is 800-585-8367 (+1 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 if calling from outside the United States or Canada) and the access code is 1357089.\nA live audio webcast of the conference call and a PDF copy of the press release and the quarterly presentation will be accessible directly from the Investor Relations section of the Vishay website at http://ir.vishay.com .\nAbout Vishay\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc., a Fortune 1000 Company listed on the NYSE (VSH), is one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors (diodes, MOSFETs, and infrared optoelectronics) and passive electronic components (resistors, inductors, and capacitors). These components are used in virtually all types of electronic devices and equipment, in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer, telecommunications, military, aerospace, power supplies, and medical markets. Vishay’s product innovations, successful acquisition strategy, and \"one-stop shop\" service have made it a global industry leader. Vishay can be found on the Internet at www.vishay.com .\nThis press release includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including adjusted net earnings; adjusted earnings per share; adjusted operating margin; free cash; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); adjusted EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA margin; which are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP measures supplement our GAAP measures of performance or liquidity and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin do not have uniform definitions. These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that such measures are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company. Although the terms \"free cash\" and \"EBITDA\" are not defined in GAAP, the measures are derived using various line items measured in accordance with GAAP. Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding the Company's intrinsic operations. Reconciling items to calculate adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA represent those same items used in computing adjusted net earnings, as relevant. Furthermore, the presented calculation of adjusted EBITDA is substantially similar to, but not identical to, a measure used in the calculation of financial ratios required for covenant compliance under Vishay's revolving credit facility. These reconciling items are indicated on the accompanying reconciliation schedules and are more fully described in the Company's financial statements presented in its annual report on Form 10-K and its quarterly reports presented on Forms 10-Q.\nStatements contained herein that relate to the Company's future performance, including statements with respect to forecasted revenues, margins, manufacturing capacities, customer confidence, anticipated growth areas for the company, global growth markets generally and the performance of the economy in general, are forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"will be,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" or other similar words or expressions often identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations only, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to materially differ include: general business and economic conditions; delays or difficulties in implementing our cost reduction strategies; delays or difficulties in expanding our manufacturing capacities; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; uncertainty related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; competition and technological changes in our industries; difficulties in new product development; difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, consummating a transaction on terms which we consider acceptable, and integration and performance of acquired businesses; changes in applicable domestic and foreign tax regulations and uncertainty regarding the same; changes in applicable accounting standards and other factors affecting our operations that are set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nContact:\nVishay Intertechnology, Inc.\nPeter Henrici\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Communications\n+1-610-644-1300\nVISHAY INTERTECHNOLOGY, INC.\nSummary of Operations\n(Unaudited -
