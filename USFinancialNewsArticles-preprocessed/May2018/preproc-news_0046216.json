    "text": "FRANKFURT, May 18 (Reuters) - The RAG Foundation, a German public sector trust, bought a 4.5 percent stake in property lender Deutsche Pfandbriefbank from Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in a placement earlier this week, according to a filing by Pfandbriefbank (PBB).\nState-owned HRE had placed around 22 million shares in PBB with institutional investors on Tuesday, raising around 287 million euros ($339 million) and cutting its stake in PBB to 3.5 percent from 20 percent.\nIt said at the time that a long-term institutional German investor snapped up 4.5 percent of PBBâ€™s stock but did not name the buyer. ($1 = 0.8463 euros) (Reporting by Maria Sheahan Editing by Tom Sims)\n ",
