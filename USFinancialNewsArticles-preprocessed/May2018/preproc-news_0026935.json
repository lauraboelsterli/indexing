(Nasdaq:NATR), a leading natural health and wellness company engaged in the manufacture and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“We continued to generate good consolidated year over year growth, driven by Synergy Asia Pacific, NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe and a moderated rate of growth in NSP China. We have also seen sales stabilize in NSP Americas over the last few quarters following the disruption from last April’s ERP implementation,” commented Gregory L. Probert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite growth in NSP China, we did encounter some weakness during the first quarter that may continue over the coming quarters. The challenge relates to maintaining engagement of distributor leadership during these early stages of the Company’s development in China. Given we are still in the first year operating with a direct selling license, our China business is dependent upon the level of activity of a limited number of distributor leaders. While we have recently had success attracting additional leaders, we need to continue broadening the leadership ranks to create more consistency in activity levels and volume from quarter to quarter. We remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity in China despite our expectation for limited or even elusive sequential volume growth in the near-term.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet Sales by Operating Segment Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2018 Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2017 Percent\nChange Impact of\nCurrency\nExchange\nPercent\nChange\nExcluding\nImpact of\nCurrency NSP Americas: NSP North America $ 35,605 $ 38,046 (6.4 )% $ 128 (6.8 )% NSP Latin America 6,267 6,599 (5.0 )% 128 (7.0 )% 41,872 44,645\n(6.2 )% 256 (6.8 )% NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 9,551 8,446 13.1 % 236 10.3 % Synergy WorldWide: Synergy Asia Pacific 23,707 18,781 26.2 % 1,531 18.1 % Synergy Europe 5,656 5,925 (4.5 )% 754 (17.3 )% Synergy North America 2,454 2,607 5.9 % — (5.9 )% 31,817 27,313 16.5 % 2,285 8.1 % NSP China 4,102 2,694 52.3 % 264 42.5 % $ 87,342 $ 83,098 5.1 % $ 3,041 1.4 %\nNet sales of $87.3 million increased 5.1 percent compared to $83.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a local currency basis, net sales increased 1.4 percent compared to 2017. Growth was primarily related to continued growth in Synergy Asia Pacific, NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe and NSP China, offset by a $2.8 million decline in nets sales in NSP Americas. Net sales were also positively impacted by $3.0 million of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nGross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 74.0 percent from 73.9 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The modest increase in gross margin as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in market mix.\nVolume incentives, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 35.9 percent from 34.9 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in volume incentives as a percent of net sales is primarily due to changes in promotional activity and market mix, including growth in markets where volume incentives as a percentage of net sales are higher, partially offset by growth in NSP China where sales commissions to independent service providers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by approximately $2.1 million to $32.4 million for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in SG&A is primarily related to increased depreciation related to the Company’s Oracle ERP system implemented in April 2017. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 37.1 percent, compared to 36.5 percent for the same period in 2017.\nOperating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $0.9 million or 1.0 percent as a percentage of net sales, as compared to operating income of $2.1 million or 2.5 percent as a percentage of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.\nOther income, net, in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $0.7 million compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The effective income tax rate was 79.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 44.0 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income available to common shareholders was $0.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, compared to $2.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, in 2017. The net loss attributable to NSP China was $0.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million, compared to $4.3 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from continuing operations before taxes, depreciation, amortization and other income/loss adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the attached financial tables.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.8 million provided by operating activities for the prior year period. Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company ended the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $42.3 million.\nActive Distributors and Customers by Segment (1)\n2018 2017 Distributors\n& Customers Managers Distributors\n& Customers Managers NSP Americas 107,700 6,500 123,500 7,300 NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 69,100 3,500 64,700 3,100 Synergy WorldWide 47,300 3,700 46,100 4,500 Total 224,100 13,700 234,300 14,900 (1) Active Distributors and customers include Nature’s Sunshine Products’ independent Distributors and customers who have purchased products directly from the Company for resale and/or personal consumption during the previous three months ended as of the date indicated.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the Company’s objectives, plans, strategies and financial results. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) that address activities, events or developments that the Company intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are often characterized by terminology such as “believe,” “hope,” “may,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy” and similar expressions, and are based on assumptions and assessments made by management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the following.\nchanges in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, applicable to direct selling or the nutritional supplement industry may prohibit or restrict the Company's ability to sell its products in some markets or require the Company to make changes to its business model in some markets; extensive government regulations to which the Company's products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject; legal challenges to the Company's direct selling program or to the classification of its independent distributors; effect of complex legal and regulatory requirements, particularly in China and South Korea; impact of anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; its ability to attract and retain independent distributors; the loss of one or more key independent distributors who have a significant sales network; the full implementation of its joint venture for operations in China with Fosun Industrial Co., Ltd.; registration of products for sale in China, or difficulty or increased cost of importing products into China; cyber security threats and exposure to data loss; reliance on information technology infrastructure; the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates; liabilities and obligations arising from improper activity by its independent distributors; its relationship with, and its inability to control the actions of, its independent distributors, and other third parties with whom it does business; changes to its independent distributor compensation plans; geopolitical issues and conflicts; negative consequences resulting from difficult economic conditions, including the availability of liquidity or the willingness of its customers to purchase products; risks associated with the manufacturing of the Company's products; uncertainties relating to the application of transfer pricing, duties, value-added taxes, and other tax regulations, and changes thereto; changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; availability and integrity of raw materials; the competitive nature of its business and the nutritional supplement industry; negative publicity related to its products, ingredients, or direct selling organization and the nutritional supplement industry; product liability claims; the sufficiency of trademarks and other intellectual property rights; and reliance on third-parties to distribute its products and provide support services to independent distributors.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are more fully detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports filed on Forms 10-Q.\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in or incorporated by reference into this press release. Except as is required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning Adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Management utilizes the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of its operations and believes that this measure is a useful indicator of the Company’s ability to fund its business. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nIn addition, the Company believes presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of its foreign operations from period to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOther companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine Products’ performance in relation to other companies. The Company has included a reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attached financial tables.\nNATURE’S SUNSHINE PRODUCTS, INC.
