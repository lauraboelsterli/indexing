Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Sevilla vs Real Madrid - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - May 9, 2018 Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos REUTERS/Jon Nazca\nFrench forward Wissam Ben Yedder put Sevilla in front in the 26th minute after racing in behind Ramos while Miguel Layun doubled the home side’s lead on the stroke of halftime, knocking into an empty net from close range.\nFormer Sevilla defender Ramos struck the crossbar from the spot in the 58th minute and then put through his own net to stretch the home side’s advantage to three goals in the 84th as he tried to cut out a cross from Gabriel Mercado.\nReal striker Borja Mayoral headed a goal back in the 87th and Ramos scored from his second attempt from the penalty spot deep in stoppage-time.\nZidane made eight changes to his side after Sunday’s gruelling 2-2 draw at arch rivals Barcelona, only retaining Ramos, French striker Karim Benzema and midfielder Casemiro. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Sevilla vs Real Madrid - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - May 9, 2018 Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos warms up before the match REUTERS/Jon Nazca\nToni Kroos, Luka Modric, Marcelo and top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo all remained in the Spanish capital to stay fresh for the Champions League final against Liverpool in Kiev on May 26.\n“I picked a team that could have won the game comfortably, I don’t have any regrets about the players I picked,” Zidane told reporters.\n“It’s a shame for the players who play less often but I can’t blame them, they did everything possible.” Slideshow (3 Images)\nMadrid are third in the standings on 72 points and missed out on the chance to move level with city rivals Atletico, who are second on 75.\nChampions Barcelona stretched their heavy lead over Atletico to 15 points after thrashing Villarreal 5-1 at home on Wednesday.\nSevilla, meanwhile, continued their resurgence since Italian coach Vincenzo Montella was sacked, picking up their second win from two games under stand-in manager Joaquin Caparros.\nThey climbed two points above Getafe into seventh place, the final Europa League qualification spot, with two games left of the campaign.\nSevilla can clinch seventh if they win at fierce city rivals Real Betis on Saturday and Getafe fail to beat second-placed Atletico Madrid.\n“We’ve talked to the players a lot as a group and individuals, we’ve told them they are very good and they’re used to playing in finals and we told them today was like a final,” said veteran coach Caparros, who is in his second spell in charge of Sevilla.
