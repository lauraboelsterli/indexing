    "text": "May 18, 2018 / 9:53 AM / Updated an hour ago Leader of Hong Kong independence movement found guilty of rioting Venus Wu 1 Min Read\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court on Friday found the most prominent leader of the Chinese-ruled territory’s independence movement, Edward Leung, guilty on one charge of rioting, a verdict that carries a maximum sentence of 12 years’ jail. FILE PHOTO: Hong Kong Indigenous member Edward Leung speaks after being disqualified from running in the Legislative Council elections in Hong Kong, China, August 2, 2016. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo\nThe jury did not find him guilty of inciting a riot and failed to reach a majority decision on a second rioting charge.\nThe closely watched case concerned a 2016 Lunar New Year overnight protest that turned violent when masked activists pelted bricks and burned trash cans to vent anger at what they saw as China’s encroachment of Hong Kong’s culture and autonomy. Slideshow (3 Images)\nAbout 130 people, mostly police, were injured.\nThe prosecution argued that Leung played a leading role to incite what they called a riot, but Leung said he was only trying to support hawkers selling street food and protect the people on scene when police used force.\nHong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
