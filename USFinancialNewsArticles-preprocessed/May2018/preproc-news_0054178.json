A passenger jet flies past the setting sun in Shanghai September 17, 2013. REUTERS/Aly Song\nChina’s civil aviation administration last month sent letters requesting airlines remove references on their websites or in other material that suggests Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are part of countries independent from China, in a move described by the White House as “Orwellian nonsense.”\nThe letters were dated April 25 and airlines were given 30 days to comply, indicating a deadline of May 25.\n26 airlines have asked for more time to comply due to technical issues, the aviation regulator said in a statement, while some airlines had promised to comply by July 25.\nAustralian airline Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) on Thursday said it had been given more time by the Chinese authorities.\nAirlines such as Air Canada ( AC.TO ), Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and British Airways ( ICAG.L ) have made changes to their website descriptions, according to Reuters’ checks. The Taiwanese foreign ministry last week asked Air Canada for a “speedy correction” after the carrier made changes. Reporting by Meg Shen; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle",
