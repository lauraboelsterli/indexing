We believe that these arms sales are immoral, and are confident that the Court of Appeal will agree that they are unlawful.”\nMore than 10,000 people have died since Saudi Arabia’s Western-backed alliance began its campaign to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government, launching thousands of air strikes to defeat the armed Houthi movement, which controls the area and much of northern Yemen.\nErrant strikes have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets. Two weeks ago, air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 20 people attending a wedding in a village in northwestern Yemen.\nThe United Nations says food shortages caused by the warring parties blocking supplies has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The conflict has displaced more than 2 million people and triggered a cholera epidemic that has infected about 1 million people.\nUK exports to Saudi Arabia have provided billions of pounds of revenue for the British arms trade, but opposition has grown as the conflict and resulting humanitarian crisis in Yemen worsened.\nPrime Minister Theresa May has defended British arms exports to Saudi Arabia, saying all such sales were strictly regulated, that Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict was backed by the U.N. Security Council and her government supported it.\nThe issue has provoked heated debate in parliament, with the main opposition Labour party saying arms export licences should be suspended and that Britain must be held partly responsible for civilian casualties in Yemen.\n“It cannot be right that the government is colluding in what the United Nations says is evidence of war crimes,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told parliament in March.
