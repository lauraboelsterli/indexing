    "text": "SAO PAULO, May 24 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Anfavea automakers association said on Thursday that all production lines in the country would halt work on Friday because of a nationwide truckers’ strike that has paralyzed many sectors in Latin America’s largest economy.\nIn an emailed statement, Anfavea did not indicate when the auto industry, which accounts for roughly one-fourth of Brazil’s industrial gross domestic product, would resume production.
