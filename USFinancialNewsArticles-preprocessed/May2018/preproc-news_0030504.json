    "text": "* Telstra at near 7-year low\n* NAB hits 1-1/2 year low, trades ex-div\n* Fletcher hits highest in 12 weeks on being retained in MSCI\nBy Susan Mathew\nMay 15 (Reuters) - Australian shares were lower on Tuesday as one of its major banks went ex-dividend, while phone giant Telstra extended losses after issuing a profit warning the previous day.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index was 21.8 points, or 0.4 percent, lower at 6,114.2 by 0232 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.3 percent on Monday.\nNational Australia Bank was the biggest drag on the index, down 3 percent, as its traded ex-dividend while the other three of the ‘Big 4’ were among the biggest boost to the index, up between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent.\nThe finiancial sector, especially the banks, have been under intense pressure recently after a powerful inquiry revealed widespread misconduct.\nShares of Telstra extended losses and hit their lowest in nearly 7 years, down as much as 3.6 percent, after it said its expects fiscal 2018 earnings to be at the lower end of guidance. The firm warned that challenges may continue into 2019 as competition rises with the roll out of National Broadband Network.\nMining giants BHP and Rio Tinto remained buoyed supported by strength in the underlying commodities, mainly iron ore.\nSeparately, minutes of RBA’s May meeting showed that it saw little reason to lift interest rates as inflation remained below target and likely to remain subdued in the face of sluggish wage growth.\nDamien Hennessy, co-founder of Heuristic Investment Systems expects some modest improvement in wages growth from the last quarter’s number, but nothing that will change RBA’s outlook the for cash rate.\n“In an environment where bond yields here are remaining low and cash rates to remain on hold, its not an altogether bad backdrop for the Australian equity market.”\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was up 0.1 percent, or 11.46 points at a record-high 8,724.69.\nFletcher Building led gains, rising 4.1 percent to its highest in over 2-1/2-months. MSCI’s semi-annual review showed that Fletcher will remain part of the MSCI main index.\nRyman Healthcare scaled a record high, rising 2.5 percent.\nFor more individual stocks activity click on\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru;additional reporting by Shanima A Editing by Shri Navaratnam\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
