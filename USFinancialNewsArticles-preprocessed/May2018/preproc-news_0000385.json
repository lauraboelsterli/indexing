REUTERS/Edgar Su Cobalt, which uses technology similar to blockchain, will be used by SGX to streamline foreign exchange transactions, the joint statement said.\n“We look forward to seeing Cobalt continue to gain traction in the global post-trade FX market” said Michael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX.\nSGX last month posted its highest profit in a decade thanks to strong performance in derivatives and securities for the quarter to March 31.\nSGX, a global listing hub for real estate investment trusts and business trusts, is also launching dual-class shares this year.\nReporting by Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
