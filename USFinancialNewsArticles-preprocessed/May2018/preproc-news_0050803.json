Flags of Taiwan (2nd-R) and Burkina Faso (R) are seen inside the Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei, Taiwan May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nTaiwan now has only one diplomatic ally left in Africa – the tiny kingdom of Swaziland - and formal relations with just 18 countries worldwide, many of them poor nations in Central America and the Pacific like Belize and Nauru.\nThe Burkinabe foreign ministry’s statement made no direct mention of China, but said “the evolution of the world and the socio-economic challenges of our country and region push us to reconsider our position”.\nSpeaking at a hastily arranged news conference in Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan would not engage in “dollar diplomacy” and denounced Beijing’s methods.\n“China toys with dollar diplomacy and promises huge sums of money to entice many countries to build relations,” Tsai said.\n“I want to emphasise again that China’s pressure will only lead to Taiwan’s ties with its partners in the international community getting closer. We will not cower at all.”\nTaiwan has accused China of luring its friends away with offers of generous aid packages. China denies this, and says Taiwan is a part of China with no right to formal diplomatic ties with any other country.\nSpeaking shortly before the president, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said he had offered his resignation to her.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nWu said that Taiwan cannot compete with China’s financial resources.\n“I along with our country’s people feel sad, angry and regretful,” he said.\n“China grabbing our allies and giving us pressure in the diplomatic space will not shrink the distance across the (Taiwan) strait and will not let cross-strait relations walk on a peaceful, friendly path.”\nThe finance ministry said it would immediately end its aid programmes in Burkina and that Taiwan would close its embassy there.\nChina’s foreign ministry said in a brief statement it welcomed Burkina to “join in China-Africa friendly cooperation as soon as possible”.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu GROWING HOSTILITY\nTaiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue.\nChina’s hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai’s election as president in 2016, as Beijing fears she wishes to push for the island’s formal independence, a red line for China. She says she wants to maintain the status quo.\nChina is Africa’s largest trade partner, with massive investments in mining, construction and banking, though it has been less active to date in Burkina.\nChina is hosting a summit of African leaders in September in Beijing, where it will likely offer new pledges of aid and preferential loans.\nIn March, China said it was in the best interests of Taiwan’s allies to recognise an “irresistible trend” and ditch Taipei in favour of “one China” ruled by Beijing.\nBurkina is the fourth country to cut ties with Taiwan since Tsai came to office, following the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe and Panama.\nThe Vatican is possibly next, as the Holy See and China edge closer to an accord on the appointment of bishops there.\nTaiwan says the Republic of China, its official name, is a sovereign country with the right to develop relations with other countries.\nSome countries have switched back and forth between Beijing and Taipei several times.\nThis is the second time Burkina has cut ties with Taiwan. It last did so in 1973, before resuming relations with Taipei in 1994.
