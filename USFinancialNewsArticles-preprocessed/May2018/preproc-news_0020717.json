    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ero Copper Corp. (TSX:ERO) (“Ero” or the “Company”) today is pleased to announce its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Management will host a conference call tomorrow, Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 11:30 a.m. Eastern to discuss the results. Dial in details for the call can be found near the end of this news release.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFirst quarter copper production of 4,845 tonnes of copper,\nFirst quarter C1 Cash Costs * of $1.63 per pound of copper produced;\nGenerated $7.1 million in EBITDA * (Adjusted EBITDA * of $6.2 million) during the three month period ended March 31, 2018;\nNet loss attributable to owners of the Company of $4.1 million ($0.05 per share on a diluted basis) during the three month period ended March 31, 2018;\nEnded the first quarter with cash position of $29.3 million; and,\nReiterated full year production, capital and operating cost guidance for 2018.\n“Our operational results from the first quarter of 2018 were in line with our expectations. At the Pilar underground mine we were pleased to see quarter-on-quarter increases in production volumes and grade. Additionally, we made significant headway during the quarter on our programs to continue optimizing and improving production including the near-completion of a maintenance facility, fuel station and shotcrete batch plant in the lower levels of the mine. These improvements should translate into benefits in subsequent quarters from an underground mining cost and productivity perspective.\nOpen pit production was lower quarter-on-quarter as waste stripping at the Surubim Mine, previously envisioned to occur during the fourth quarter of 2017, was deferred into the first quarter of 2018 due to the longer than anticipated mine life at the Suҫuarana Mine.\nAt Vermelhos, our newest mine, underground development has continued to outpace forecast development rates with 961 meters of total development completed during the quarter. Underground infrastructure has now been completed to the first four production levels of the main Vermelhos ore body and those levels are now being prepared for gallery development. While we are maintaining our outlook for start-up of Vermelhos in the fourth quarter of 2018, we are focused on several opportunities to further advance this timeline.\nOn exploration, we remain very excited about several near-term opportunities we are evaluating at the Pilar Mine, the Surubim Mine in the central portion of the Valley as well as at the Vermelhos Mine. As we are nearing the conclusion of resource upgrade programs that were prioritized early this year, our exploration programs are beginning to focus on new target areas in and around each of the mining operations. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also commenced our district-wide airborne geophysical survey designed to target high-grade mineralization throughout the Curaçá Valley. Data processing commenced contemporaneously with the start of the program and we hope to begin prioritizing new regional targets in the coming months.” commented David Strang, President & CEO of Ero Copper.\n* EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and C1 Cash Cost of copper produced (per lb) are non-IFRS measures – see the Notes section of this press release for a discussion on non-IFRS Measures\nOPERATIONS, EXPLORATION & CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS\nMining & Milling Operations – in line with expectations\nQuarter-on-quarter increases in underground tonnes and grade mined totalling 229.8 thousand tonnes (“kt”) grading 2.14% copper compared to 225.0kt grading 2.03% copper mined underground during the fourth quarter of 2017;\nDuring first quarter 2018, 316.1 kt of ore was processed at an average grade of 1.76% copper resulting in 4,845 tonnes of copper production after metallurgical recoveries that averaged 87.3% over the period;\n4,096 tonnes of copper in concentrate sold during the quarter.\nVermelhos Mine Development – advancing towards first production\nDuring the first quarter, total development of 961 meters completed, including 240 meters of primary ramp development, 549 meters of secondary development and 172 meters of auxiliary ramp development accessing the UG1 production area. Additionally, 266 meters of total raise bore drilling was completed during the quarter;\nTotal development completed since project commencement of 2,678 meters, including 1,081 meters of primary ramp development.\nExploration Activities – new discoveries in the making\nPilar District\nExploration activities continue to be focused on the new discovery within the North Extension, testing for up-dip extensions of the P1P2W mining area, and extensions to the Deepening. All Pilar exploration targets are within or adjacent to existing Pilar underground mine infrastructure. Currently seven underground and one surface drill rigs are operating at Pilar.\nSurubim District\nDrilling activities are focused on evaluating new target areas adjacent to the Surubim open pit mine. Currently four exploration drill rigs are operating within the District.\nVermelhos District\nWith infill drilling largely completed, drilling has shifted focus towards the exploration of new targets as well as down-dip extensions of the main Vermelhos ore bodies to the north and up-dip extensions of the main Vermelhos ore bodies to the south. The copper oxide exploration program also remains ongoing. Currently five exploration drill rigs are operating at Vermelhos.\nRegional Programs\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company commenced its 24,000 line-kilometer regional airborne geophysical survey. The survey is expected to take approximately four months to complete. Data processing commenced contemporaneously with the start of the program.\nCorporate Highlights – long term concentrate sales agreement in place\nThe Company entered into a long-term concentrate sales agreement (evergreen agreement renewed annually with minimum term of five calendar years) with Paranapanema S.A. (“Paranapanema”).\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n3 months\nended\nMarch 31,2018 3 months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 3 months\nended\nMarch 31, 2017 [1] Operating Highlights (MCSA Operations) Ore Processed (tonnes) 316,126 452,371 275,740 Grade (% Cu) 1.76 1.36 1.40 Cu Production (tonnes) 4,845 5,334 3,355 Cu Production (lbs) 10,681,781 11,759,857 7,395,876 Concentrate Grade (% Cu) 34.7 35.2 35.3 Recovery (%) 87.3 86.9 86.9 Concentrate Sales (tonnes) 11,672 15,577 6,847 Cu Sold in Concentrate (tonnes) 4,096 5,448 2,145 Cu Sold in Concentrate (lbs) 9,030,124 12,010,770 4,728,910 C1 Cash cost of copper produced (per lb) [2]\n1.63\n1.54\n1.79 Financial Highlights ($millions, except per share amounts) Revenues $ 28.2 $ 37.8 $ 12.1 Gross profit (loss) $ 5.0 $ 5.8 ($ 2.8\n) EBITDA [2, 3] $ 7.1 $ 31.4 $ 4.3 Adjusted EBITDA [2] $ 6.2 $ 12.0 ($ 1.6\n) Cash flow from (used in) operations $ 0.7 $ 11.2 ($ 1.5\n) Net income (loss) attributable to owners of the Company ($ 4.1 ) $ 19.5 ($ 4.9\n) Net income (loss) per share attributable to owners of the Company - Basic $ (0.05 ) $ 0.28 $ (0.12 ) - Diluted $ (0.05 ) $ 0.24 $ (0.12 ) Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 27.1 $ 51.1 $ 32.4 Working Capital (Deficit) [2] $ 22.2 $ 42.6 ($ 117.0\n) Net Debt [2] ($ 110.7 ) ($ 85.9\n) ($ 134.9\n) Footnotes\n[1] ERO was incorporated on May 16, 2016.

Cash cost guidance for 2018 assumes a USD:BRL foreign exchange rate of 3.20, gold price of US$1,250 per ounce and silver price of US$17.50 per ounce. C1 Cash Cost guidance for 2018 has been updated to include treatment and refining charges (“TC/RCs”), offsite transportation costs and certain tax benefits that are passed through to customers on invoicing. These adjustments were not included in prior C1 Cash Cost disclosure.\nCapital Expenditures:\nThe Company’s capital expenditure guidance for 2018 reflect the acceleration of the Vermelhos mine and a significant expansion of the Company’s 2017 exploration programs. Additional investments in the Pilar underground mine and supporting infrastructure are being made during 2018 in preparation for a longer mine life than previously envisioned.\n($US millions) 2018 Pilar Mine 39.0 Vermelhos 36.0 Exploration & Drilling [1] 20.0 Boa Esperanҫa 1.0 Capital Expenditure Guidance 96.0 Footnotes:\n[1] Exploration & drilling capital expenditure guidance is dependent, in part, on future exploration success and subject to further review and revision\nNOTES\nNon-IFRS measures\nFinancial results of the Company are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company utilizes certain non-IFRS measures, including C1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb), EBITDA, net debt and working capital, which are not measures recognized under IFRS. The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nC1 Cash Cost of copper produced (per lb.)\nC1 Cash cost of copper produced (per lb) is the sum of production costs, net of capital expenditure development costs and by-product credits, divided by the copper pounds produced. C1 cash costs reported by the Company include treatment, refining charges offsite costs, and certain tax credits relating to sales invoiced to the Company’s Brazilian customer on sales. By-product credits are calculated based on actual precious metal sales (net of treatment costs) during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. C1 cash cost of copper produced per pound is a non-IFRS measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance of the Company’s operating mining unit, and is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in addition to IFRS measures.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes further adjustments for non-recurring items and items not indicative to the future operating performance of the Company. The Company believes EBIDTA and adjusted EBIDTA are appropriate supplemental measures of debt service capacity and performance of its operations.\nAdjusted EBIDTA is calculated by removing the following income statement items:\nGain on debt settlement\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\nWorking capital\nWorking capital is determined based on current assets and current liabilities as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company uses working capital as a measure of the Company’s short-term financial health and operating efficiency.\nNet Debt\nNet debt is determined based on cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and loans and borrowings as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s ability to pay down its debt.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 11:30am Eastern time (8:30am Pacific time) to discuss these results.\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018 Time: 11:30 am Eastern time (8:30 am Pacific time) Dial in: North America: 1-800-319-4610, International: +1-604-638-5340\nplease dial in 5-10 minutes prior and ask to join the call Replay North America: 1-800-319-6413, International: +1-604-638-9010 Replay Passcode: 2259 This release should be read in conjunction with the complete audited consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 available on the Company’s website www.erocopper.com\nABOUT ERO COPPER CORP\nEro Copper Corp, headquartered in Vancouver, B.C., is focused on copper production growth from the Vale do Curaçá Property, located in Bahia, Brazil.
