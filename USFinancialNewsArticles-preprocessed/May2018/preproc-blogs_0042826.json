Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. JP Morgan Chase & Co. demonstrated a prototype of its blockchain-based platform for capital markets, called Dromaius, on Wednesday at the Consensus 2018 conference, CIO Journal’s Sara Castellanos reports . “We think the technology has the potential to be transformative,” said Christine Moy, executive director and head of J.P. Morgan’s Blockchain Center of Excellence. (See below for much more on blockchain and the Consensus event.)\nJ.P. Morgan joins other banks including Banco Santander S.A. that are experimenting with how blockchain-based platforms could be used for capital markets, where huge sums of money, a variety of stakeholders and lots of coordination are involved.\nJ.P. Morgan and Santander are among a consortium of banks and tech giants that last year formed the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a nonprofit foundation that aims to connect enterprises with experts in the blockchain-based Ethereum network. Ms. Moy and her team of about 15 will work over the next year to overcome some of the challenges associated with deploying the platform. “The technology is still in the early stages,” she said.\nBLOCKCHAIN + CRYPTOCURRENCY\nCrypto enthusiasts take Manhattan… Throughout this week’s Consensus 2018 cryptocurrency conference in New York there was a healthy dose of glitz and sense that this was the dot-com boom from the late 1990s all over again, the Journal’s Alizon Sider and Ben Eisen report . One booth hocked “crypto jewelry,” including an $8,700 gold Super Bowl-size ring with the bitcoin logo. Outside, three Lamborghinis hugged the curb, a symbol for those who made big money in bitcoin.\n…with an exception for Wall Street. Eight months after the first report that Goldman Sachs Group was planning a bitcoin trading desk, most other New York banks are resisting the idea of trading cryptocurrency. The Journal’s Paul Vigna has the story .\nYou’ve been Howey-d! Give props to the Securities and Exhange Commission for ‘coining’ the perfect cryptocurrency name: HoweyCoins. Interested? A trip to the slickly-designed website conjurs a white paper, celebrity pics and promises of 1 percent daily returns. But users who click to buy the coins are presented with a warning that it’s all fake, Bloomberg reports . The SEC has been warnings investors that many token sales may be violating securities laws.\nEUROPE\nZuckerberg to appear before EU Parliament. Facebook Inc. ‘s CEO will meet with top European lawmakers in Brussels next week to discuss the social network’s handling of its users’ personal information, and its potential impact on European elections, the WSJ’s Natalia Drozdiak and Sam Schechner report . The hearing won’t be open to the public, an EU official said. The big question: Will EU politicians demonstrate more tech savviness than their peers in the U.S. Congress ?\nIreland takes center stage in GDPR. With the country serving as European headquarters for some of the largest U.S. tech companies, its tiny data protection office is set to play an influential role as Europe’s sweeping new privacy rules go into effect May 25. The New York Times profiles data protection commissioner Helen Dixon.\nFun fact. “Her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That’s roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes.”\nMORE TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nSenate votes to reinstate Obama-era net neutrality rules. The measure, adopted by 52 to 47, still faces long odds of passage in the House and many Republicans believe President Donald Trump would veto the reinstatement measure if it ever reached his desk, says the WSJ’s John D. McKinnon . Nevertheless the debate is sure to continue for months, in part because Democrats view it as good politics as well as good policy.\nBig tech investing more in business than non-tech peers. Facebook and Alphabet Inc. both spent 23% of revenues last quarter on capital expenditures, the FT reports .\nChinese accelerators grow in Silicon Valley. As the U.S. government cracks down on the transfer of homegrown technology to China, there’s a growing China-focused accelerator scene in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of the incubators are focused on bringing U.S. startup tech back to China, Reuters reports .\nFormer employee of Cambridge Analytica contacted by FBI. Chris Wylie, who previously revealed that the company improperly harvested data from millions of Facebook users, said Wednesday that he had been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Journal’s Julie Bykowicz has more .\nAmazon adopts ‘Rooney Rule.’ The company announced Monday that it would require any pool of potential board members to include minority and female candidates, the San Jose Mercury News reports . The practice, initiated by the National Football League for coaching and managment jobs, has been adopted by other tech firms as well.\nApple considers northern Virgina. Local officials say Apple Inc. is interested in four million square feet in the region with room for 20,000 people, the Washington Post reports . “That amount of space is nearly two-thirds the size of the Pentagon and about half what Amazon is seeking for its second headquarters,” the Post reports. And speaking of Amazon.com Inc ., three locations in the region are among the 20 finanlists in Amazon.com’s second headquarters search.\nWhen the CEO bans phones at meetings. Employees wear smartwatches, as happened at Brown, Parker & DeMarinis Advertising after Chief Executive Jason Brown issued the edict. The WSJ’s John Simons looks at the struggle between work productivity and the urge to fiddle with phones.\nFEMA CIO reassigned. NextGov reports that Adrian Gardner has been reassigned to a post in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Caribbean division after reports of outstanding IT management issues by the agency’s inspector general. Deputy CIO Patsy Garnett will step in as acting CIO.\nDisabled gamers get a new controller from Microsoft. Microsoft Corp . is making its first videogame controller designed for people with disabilities. The Journal’s Sarah E. Needleman calls the move the latest in a growing number of industry efforts to accommodate players who face challenges seeing, hearing and directing the on-screen action.\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nA Senate committee backed U.S. intelligence’s finding that Moscow attempted to boost Donald Trump ’s presidential campaign. (WSJ)\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that a lack of integrity and ethics among America’s leaders is putting freedom and democracy at risk. (WSJ)\nAmerican women are having children at the lowest rate on record, with the number of babies born in the U.S. last year dropping to a 30-year low . (WSJ)\nA new financial disclosure from President Donald Trump acknowledged that he reimbursed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 payment to an adult-film star just before the 2016 election.
