    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adtalem Global Education (NYSE: ATGE), a leading global education provider, today reported academic, operating and financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended March 31, 2018, including enrollment results at Adtalem Education Brazil, Carrington College, Chamberlain University, and DeVry University/Keller Graduate School of Management.\n“Our ongoing portfolio transformation positions the organization for sustainable long-term growth in our medical and healthcare, professional education and technology and business verticals,” said Lisa Wardell, president and CEO of Adtalem Global Education. “Driven by our student-centric culture, we are focused on delivering superior outcomes and achieving academic excellence across our portfolio of institutions. The underlying economics of our organization continue to improve and our financial position remains strong, supporting our ability to invest in growth initiatives and consistently return capital to our fellow owners.”\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nSelected financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nRevenue of $342.2 million increased 2.9 percent compared to the prior year Net income was $39.3 million compared to $39.9 million in the prior year; net income from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $44.9 million, compared to $37.9 million in the prior year Diluted earnings per share was $0.63, compared to $0.62 in the prior year; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items was $0.72, compared to $0.59 in the prior year Operating cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 was $183.3 million, compared to $169.8 million in the prior year Cash and cash equivalents were $265.3 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $208.8 million as of March 31, 2017. Outstanding bank borrowings were $120.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 Approximately 393,500 shares of common stock were repurchased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 Subsequent to quarter end, on April 13, 2018, Adtalem refinanced its existing $400 million revolving credit agreement by entering into a new $300 million revolving credit and $300 million term loan facility. Proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the existing credit facility balance. In association with the new facility, Adtalem received long-term credit ratings of Ba3 from Moody’s and BB+ from Standard and Poor’s.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Adtalem signed an agreement to transfer ownership of DeVry University to Cogswell Education LLC. The agreement is subject to certain terms and conditions to be met during the transition process, including regulatory and accreditor approval, and the transaction is anticipated to be completed in early fiscal year 2019. As a result of this transaction, DeVry University has been classified as a discontinued operation. Adtalem recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million in the third quarter.\nSegment Highlights\nMedical and Healthcare Segment\nThird quarter segment revenue of $220.1 million increased 5.7 percent compared to the prior year. Chamberlain revenue in the quarter increased 2.9 percent from the prior year to $128.5 million, with increases in new student enrollment of 4.3 percent and total student enrollment of 4.5 percent in the March 2018 session compared to the same term last year. Revenue in the quarter for the medical and veterinary schools increased 10.0 percent from the prior year to $91.6 million, with increases in new student enrollment of 11.5 percent and total student enrollment of 1.3 percent in the January 2018 semester compared to the same term last year. The medical schools, which include American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) and Ross University School of Medicine (RUSM), experienced a shift in revenue from the first half of the fiscal year to the third quarter caused by the delayed September 2017 semester start due to disruption caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Third quarter operating income for the segment was $60.3 million, representing an increase of 20.2 percent from the prior year.\nProfessional Education\nThird quarter segment revenue increased 5.7 percent to $31.5 million compared to the prior year, driven by revenue growth from Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), which was partially offset by a decline in revenue at Becker Professional Education. Segment operating income for the third quarter was $2.4 million, compared to $2.6 million in the prior year.\nTechnology and Business\nThird quarter segment revenue decreased 4.5 percent to $59.0 million compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 0.4 percent. Revenue was impacted in the quarter by process delays in Brazilian public loan programs which impacted student enrollment. New student enrollment was up 3.7 percent for the March session and total enrollment was down 4.9 percent compared to the same term last year. Segment operating loss for the third quarter was $103,000 compared to income of $5.4 million in the prior year.\nUS Traditional Postsecondary\nThird quarter segment revenue declined 4.2 percent to $32.1 million compared to the prior year. An operating loss of $251,000 was reported in the third quarter compared to an operating loss of $3.1 million in the prior year.\nAdtalem Outlook\nFiscal 2018 fourth quarter revenue is expected to increase 1 to 2 percent compared to the prior year. Revenue growth within the Medical and Healthcare and Professional Education segments is expected to be partially offset by decreases in revenue within the Technology and Business and US Traditional Postsecondary segments. Fourth quarter operating costs before special items are expected to be flat to up 1 percent compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter expenses may be impacted by the timing of insurance proceeds for the reimbursement of hurricane-related expenses.\nFiscal 2018 full year revenue is expected to increase 1 to 2 percent compared to the prior year and earnings growth from continuing operations before special items is expected to be 10 to 12 percent compared to the prior year. Full year capital spending is expected to be in the $60 to $65 million range, excluding hurricane-related spending. The effective income tax rate on continuing operations for the fiscal year is expected to be 14 to 16 percent, before special items. Adtalem’s outlook excludes potential charges related to restructuring plans and the pending sale of DeVry University.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAdtalem will hold a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings on Thursday, May 3, at 4 p.m. CT (5 p.m. ET).

During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017, Adtalem recorded special items related to the following: (i) Restructuring charges related to severance for workforce reductions and real estate consolidations at the administrative support operations of the medical and veterinary schools, Carrington and Adtalem's home office in order to align its cost structure with enrollments; and (ii) Charges related to regulatory settlement agreements. In addition, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the operating results of DeVry University are reclassified as discontinued operations for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2017. The following tables illustrate the effects of the discontinued operations and special items on Adtalem’s operating income and net income. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of operating income and net income excluding the discontinued operations and special items provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Adtalem’s ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the special nature of discontinued operations, restructuring charges and regulatory settlements. Adtalem uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its management and budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Adtalem’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
