    "text": "Margin Expansion In All Businesses\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Reduced\nReaffirms Full Year Guidance\nMILWAUKEE, May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jason Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:JASN) (NASDAQ:JASNW) (“Jason” or the “Company”) today reported results for first quarter 2018.\nKey financial results for the first quarter 2018 versus the year ago period include:\nNet sales of $167.3 million decreased 4.5 percent and included a negative 5.3 percent impact from the divestiture and planned exit of non-core businesses and a positive 2.9 percent from foreign currency translation. Operating income of $7.3 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, increased from 4.3 percent of net sales on improved operational results. Net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.09 diluted loss per share, increased $0.3 million and $0.04 per share. Diluted loss per share was impacted $0.04 per share by the redemption premium on the conversion of preferred stock into common stock. Free cash flow was $0.2 million, an increase of $0.7 million, due to higher cash flows generated by operations.\nOn an adjusted basis, first quarter 2018 results versus the year ago period include:\nAdjusted EBITDA of $19.7 million, or 11.8 percent of net sales, increased $1.2 million and improved from 10.6 percent of net sales, driven by margin expansion from pricing and improved operational efficiencies. Adjusted Net Income of $0.7 million, or $0.02 Adjusted Earnings Per Share, improved $0.01 per share.\n“Our industrial segments, Finishing and Components, delivered organic growth of 1.5 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively, which was in-line with expectations” said Brian Kobylinski, chief executive officer of Jason. “Continued focus on profitable growth and operational improvement initiatives drove margin expansion for the fifth consecutive quarter, with all four businesses contributing to our 150 basis point gross margin improvement. This improvement drove an additional one quarter turn reduction in our net leverage which is now 5.3 times.”\nHighlights during the quarter include:\nTotal Cost Reduction and Margin Expansion program savings were $0.3 million in the first quarter with a total of $20 million since the inception of the program. Actions taken and announced to-date are expected to achieve $24 million in annual run-rate cost savings.\nCompleted the exit of a facility in Libertyville, IL, previously announced as part of the Cost Reduction and Margin Expansion program.\nInitiated move of Acoustics Richmond, IN facility into other existing facilities; project expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter.\nAchieved organic growth of 6.0 percent in Components and 1.5 percent in Finishing. Organic growth was achieved through strong industrial markets and targeted growth initiatives, while exiting low margin business and products.\nKey financial results within the segments for the first quarter 2018 versus the year ago period include:\nFinishing net sales of $54.0 million increased $4.5 million, or 9.1 percent, including a positive foreign currency translation impact of 8.9 percent and a negative 1.3 percent impact from the exit of a non-core market in Brazil. Organic sales increased 1.5 percent and were impacted by pricing and higher volumes in industrial end markets, partially offset by strategic decisions to exit low-margin business and products. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.8 million, or 14.4 percent of net sales, an increase of $0.7 million from 14.3 percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased on improved pricing and savings resulting from the cost reduction program.\nComponents net sales of $22.4 million increased $1.3 million, or 6.0 percent due to pricing and higher volumes in the rail market. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 million, or 13.7 percent of net sales, an increase of $0.4 million from 12.9 percent of net sales, with margins positively impacted by increased pricing and higher volumes.\nSeating net sales of $47.0 million decreased $0.3 million, or 0.7 percent, including a positive foreign currency translation impact of 0.9 percent. Organic sales decreased 1.6 percent on lower volumes in the motorcycle market and a delayed start to the spring turf care season, partially offset by volume growth in heavy industry. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 million, or 12.6 percent of net sales, an increase of $0.4 million from 11.7 percent of net sales, with margins positively impacted by continuous improvement initiatives and pricing.\nAcoustics net sales of $43.8 million decreased $13.4 million, or 23.4 percent, including a negative 15.3 percent impact from the divestiture of the Acoustics European operations. Organic sales decreased 8.1 percent due to lower overall North American vehicle demand and a shift from cars to light truck vehicles. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 million, or 13.2 percent of net sales, an improvement from 11.7 percent of net sales in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased on improved material efficiencies and continuous improvement projects, partially offset by higher raw material costs.\nCorporate expenses of $2.9 million decreased $0.6 million on lower third-party professional fees and lower health care costs.\nOther Information:\nNet debt to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve-month basis was 5.3x as of the end of the first quarter, a decrease from 5.5x as of the end of 2017. Total liquidity as of the end of the first quarter was $95.0 million, comprised of $48.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $47.0 million of availability on revolving loan facilities globally.\nIn the first quarter the Company completed a transaction in which the Company exchanged 1,395,640 shares of common stock for 12,136 shares of 8.0% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. The shares of Preferred Stock exchanged had an aggregate liquidation preference of $12.1 million, representing 24.4% of the Company’s outstanding Preferred Stock. With the completion of the exchange transaction, the Company has 27,362,021 common shares issued and outstanding, and 37,529 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\n2018 Guidance:\n“We met our expectations in the first quarter and remain on track to deliver our commitments for the full year. Our team is gaining traction with operational performance improving, commercial activities increasing and customer relationships trending positively. We remain focused on EBITDA growth, cash generation and leverage reduction.”\nFor the full year 2018, Jason reaffirms guidance of net sales in the range of $600 to $615 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $66 to $70 million, and free cash flow of $13 to $17 million, resulting in an implied net debt to Adjusted EBITDA range of 5.3 to 4.9 times.\nConference Call:\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter results today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “plan,” “guidance,” and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements include projected financial information. Such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the Company’s businesses are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the level of demand for the Company’s products; competition in the Company’s markets; the Company’s ability to grow and manage growth profitably; the Company’s ability to access additional capital; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties identified in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such may be amended or supplemented by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you review and consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nNon-GAAP and Other Company Information\nIncluded in this press release are certain non-GAAP financial measures designed to complement the financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America because management believes such measures are useful to investors. Because the Company’s calculations of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, you should be careful when comparing the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. In this earnings release, we disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures, and we reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin - The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, excluding the impact of operational restructuring charges and non-cash or non-operational losses or gains, including goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, integration and other operational restructuring charges, transactional legal fees, other professional fees, purchase accounting adjustments, and non-cash share based compensation expense. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a more clear picture of the Company’s operating results by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. The Company uses this metric to facilitate a comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to analyze the factors and trends affecting its segments. The Company’s internal plans, budgets and forecasts use Adjusted EBITDA as a key metric and the Company uses this measure to evaluate its operating performance and segment operating performance and to determine the level of incentive compensation paid to its employees.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - The Company defines Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) as net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of operational restructuring charges and non-cash or non-operational losses or gains, including goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, integration and other operational restructuring charges, transactional legal fees, other professional fees, purchase accounting adjustments, and non-cash share based compensation expense, net of their income tax impact. The tax rates used to calculate adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are based on a transaction specific basis. Adjusted earnings per share includes the impact of share based compensation to the extent it is dilutive in each period. Adjusted earnings per share includes the impact to Jason Industries common shares upon conversion of JPHI Holdings Inc. rollover shares and conversion of preferred stock. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing the Company’s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA - The Company defines Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA as current and long-term debt plus debt discounts less cash and cash equivalents, divided by pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as reported plus Adjusted EBITDA of acquisitions prior to the date of the acquisition during the trailing twelve months. Management believes that Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing the Company’s financial leverage.\nFree Cash Flow - The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash flows from operating activities (as defined by GAAP) less capital expenditures and cash dividends on preferred stock. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful in assessing our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for strategic capital decisions.\nIn addition to these non-GAAP financial measures, we also use the term “organic sales” to refer to GAAP net sales from existing operations excluding (i) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, (ii) sales from divested businesses or exited non-core businesses, and (iii) the impact of foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in results (excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and exited non-core businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in results (excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and exited non-core businesses) after applying current period average foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term “organic sales growth” to refer to the measure of comparing current period organic sales with the corresponding prior year period organic sales.\nContact Information\nInvestor Relations:\nRachel Zabkowicz\ninvestors@jasoninc.com\n414.277.2007\nJason Industries, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 30,\n2018 March 31,\n2017 Net sales $ 167,254 $ 175,193 Cost of goods sold 131,582 140,584 Gross profit 35,672 34,609 Selling and administrative expenses 27,524 26,656 Loss (gain) on disposals of property, plant and equipment -
