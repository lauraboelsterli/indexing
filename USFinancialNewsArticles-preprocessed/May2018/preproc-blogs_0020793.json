    "text": "0 COMMENTS Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Monday’s session. Stock movements reflect premarket trading.\nBerkshire Hathaway —Up 0.6% : Warren Buffett tried to reassure shareholders at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Saturday that the conglomerate’s success would continue once he is no longer at the helm. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Buffett’s deputies are increasingly calling the shots at the company.\nStarbucks —Up 2.5% : Food giant Nestlé is taking over the Starbucks retail marketing and sales business, agreeing to pay more than $7 billion for the rights to sell the chain’s coffee, tea and food products in grocery stores and other outlets globally.\nApple —Up 0.8% : The iPhone maker’s stock set a new all-time high for the first time in nearly two months Friday and has risen in seven of the last eight sessions. Apple shares are up 13% over that period.\nMondelez International —Down less than 0.1% : The food giant late Sunday agreed to acquire cookie maker Tate’s Bake Shop for about $500 million, as it seeks to address changing consumer tastes.\nWells Fargo & Co.—Up 1.3% : Wells Fargo said it reached a $480 million preliminary settlement agreement in a securities fraud class-action suit. Additionally, Mr. Buffett said he has no plans to sell his stake in the bank despite its recent issues.\nNvidia —Up 1.9% : The Wall Street Journal reported that China is poised to announce a new fund of about 300 billion yuan—$47.4 billion—to spur development of its semiconductor industry as it seeks to close the technology gap with the U.S. and other rivals. That could put pressure on Nvidia and other chip makers.\nExxon Mobil —Up 1.4% : U.S. crude oil prices have risen to their highest level since 2014 and pierced $70 a barrel Monday with a 1.4% rise, benefiting energy firms such as Exxon.\nBlackstone Group L.P .—Down 0.3% : Blackstone said it has agreed to acquire commercial real estate asset management firm Gramercy Property Trust in a cash deal valued at $7.6 billion. Gramercy Property Trust shares added 16%.\nTyson Foods —Down 0.9% : The meat company posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profits and sales and said it plans to cut about 550 jobs as part of financial restructuring.\nSysco —Up 0.5% : Sysco said sales and profits rose more than Wall Street expected in the most recent quarter, and the food products distributor said it remains on target with its three-year plan.\nAthenahealth —Up 22% to $153.49 : CNBC reported that Paul Singer‘s Elliott Management Corp. plans to make an all-cash offer for athenahealth of $155 to $160 a share.\nPetMed Express —Up 3.1% : The online pet pharmacy topped quarterly earnings expectations and said its average order value was higher than it was in the year-earlier quarter.\nThis is an expanded version of the “Stocks to Watch” section of our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter.
