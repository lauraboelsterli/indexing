    "text": "ST PETERSBURG, Russia, May 25 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that a Russian army missile did not bring down Malaysia Airlines Flight over eastern Ukraine in 2014, rebuffing Dutch investigators who concluded that a Russian missile system was used in the attack.\nThe Netherlands said on Friday that it held the Russian state responsible and a Dutch cabinet statement said a “possible” next step would be presenting the case to an international court, adding Australia shared its assessment of Russia’s role.\nPutin, when asked at an economic forum in St Petersburg whether a Russian army missile was involved, said: “Of course not”.\nPutin said that Moscow could not fully trust Dutch findings about the incident because Moscow had not been involved in the investigation.
