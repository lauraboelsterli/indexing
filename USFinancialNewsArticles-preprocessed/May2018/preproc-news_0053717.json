    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning,\nDown From the Summit The Journal reports today that in the weeks since North and South Korea’s historic agreement to cease all hostile acts against each other, Pyongyang escalated cyberattacks on Seoul . The latest wave of hacking shows how the Kim Jong Un regime extended a longstanding pattern of aggressive behavior toward South Korea despite publicly pledging warmer relations as it prepared for a summit with President Trump. The U.S. called off the summit Thursday in response to new threats from Pyongyang. The decision shifts the U.S. approach to North Korea away from a rapprochement and back to a campaign of military and economic pressure . North Korea said it is still willing to meet with Mr. Trump. The planned meeting hit the rocks because neither side fully understood what the other was saying in the run-up, The Journal’s Gerald F. Seib writes .\nThe New Rules As Europe’s new privacy law takes effect, the focus has been on expected battles with technology giants such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. But the law’s impact is far broader . The new General Data Protection Regulation is forcing hundreds of thousands of companies—multinationals such as Mastercard and insurer Allianz, but also small manufacturers and even restaurants—to change how they gather and handle information about Europeans, even if the companies have no physical footprint in Europe. Companies are unlikely to be blindsided by harsh penalties . But sanctions for violations are likely to come soon, the European Union’s top privacy regulator warned. Our Europe tech correspondent Sam Schechner has answers to some common questions about the deadline.\nUber Fail The Uber self-driving car involved in a fatal crash in Arizona wasn’t set to stop in an emergency or alert the driver, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report Thursday. The Uber vehicle identified an object on the road six seconds before impact and didn’t determine the need for emergency braking until nearly five seconds later. The March crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world. It also illustrates the challenges Uber has faced in developing software that can detect hazards on the road and respond appropriately, as the ride-hailing company chases rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo and GM’s Cruise Automation.\nLow-Cost Pond-Hopping For great-value flights to Europe’s top cities this summer, look to some new players on the trans-Atlantic scene. Conventional wisdom maintains that if you haven’t booked your summer vacation by May 1, you’ll either need to pay a fortune for flights or invest in an inflatable pool for the backyard. But thrifty procrastinators, take heart: This is no normal year. With newcomers duking it out over the Atlantic, air deals to some of Europe’s most popular destinations are still lurking, just not in the usual places. Air Italy and Primera Air are teasing bargain fares from the U.S. to Milan and London, respectively, and good-value budget airlines are expanding their reach.\nToday’s Video ‘Gerrymander’ or ‘Garymander’? If you’re going to gerrymander, at least say it right. Elbridge Gerry, the New England politician whose political map inspired a cartoon, pronounced his name with a hard G; his descendants say it’s time the public started doing so, too .\nTOP STORIES U.S. Roger Stone Sought Information on Clinton From Assange, Emails Show\nHarvey Weinstein to Surrender in New York Sex-Crimes Case\nWORLD Trump Identifies His Trade Weapon of Choice, to the Dismay of Congress\nVenezuela’s Maduro Sworn In for Second Term in Rushed Inauguration\nBUSINESS Amazon Alexa-Powered Device Recorded and Shared User’s Conversation Without Permission\nVisa, Mastercard Push for One-Click Ordering.

How much are they going to rely on it? We’re walking into a trap, if we don’t know. ’\n—Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in an interview Thursday , on the FBI’s sending a confidential informant to talk with Trump campaign aides during the 2016 race, which is now factoring into whether the president will agree to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller. The president’s legal team nearly reached a deal in January. Today’s Question Going back to our story above , what are your thoughts on President Trump’s canceling the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un? Send your comments, which we may edit before publication, to 10point@wsj.com . Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on the Trump administration’s looking into new tariffs on imported vehicles , Jean Hart of Virginia shared: “At 76 years [old], I recall when we (Americans) designed and built our own cars. Having them built in other countries and importing them with high tariffs makes me think we need to build them here again. I recognize that globalism is multifaceted and complicated, but it should not get in the way of a nation being self sufficient.” Patricia Heng of Quote: : “When you look at the tremendous cost of lost jobs, factory closings [and] intellectual property stolen, [the] new tariffs on imported vehicles are ‘a drop in the bucket.’” And Daniel Brockman of California said: “The national-security fig leaf is utter nonsense. The [U.S.] retains [the] capability to build cars with or without tariffs. The tariffs will result in higher prices of cars—by approximately the amount of the tariff—for consumers….The tariffs will diminish competition among auto manufacturers in the U.S….The principal beneficiaries will be the owners of auto companies.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories.
