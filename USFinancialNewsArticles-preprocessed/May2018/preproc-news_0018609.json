    "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ:AEZS) (TSX:AEZS) today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAll Amounts are in U.S. Dollars\nRecent Key Developments\nContinue to exceed terms of licensing and assignment agreement with Strongbridge Ireland Limited in support of its Macrilen™ (macimorelin) commercial launch in the U.S. targeted for s ummer of 2018 Diligently prepare European Medicines Agency (EMA) D120 regulatory response to Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of macimorelin for anticipated submission in July 2018 Actively seeking out-licensing partners for macimorelin in Europe Expanding resources to actively assist in identifying potential marketed products in the U.S. market Financial condition and capital structure significantly improved\n-- Upfront payment of $24 million received from Strongbridge in January 2018;\n-- As of March 31, 2018, $24.5 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents;\n-- Approximately 16.4 million Common Shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues $24.7 million\nResearch and Development (“R&D\") Costs $0.8 million\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A\") Expenses $2.8 million\nSelling Expenses $1.6 million\nNet Finance Income $1.9 million\nIncome Taxes $6.9 million\nNet Income $14.4 million\nWorking Capital $19.6 million\nCommenting on recent key developments, Michael V. Ward, President and Chief Executive Officer for Aeterna Zentaris, stated, \"We ended first quarter 2018 in the strongest financial position in the past decade. Our licensing agreement of Macrilen™ (macimorelin) in the U.S. and Canada with Strongbridge demonstrates the success of our development initiatives and better positions us to monetize our rights by licensing in territories outside of the United States and Canada.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nRevenues\nLicensing revenue was $24.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to the recognition in January 2018, of the $24.0 million upfront payment received from Strongbridge for the license of Macrilen™(macimorelin) as earned revenue in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers as it is a \"right to use\" license. In addition, due to events that occurred in 2018, we consider our performance obligations under the Zoptrex™ licensing agreements to be fulfilled, therefore we recognized deferred revenues of $0.5 million relating to non-refundable upfront payments it previously received for licensing and technology transfer arrangements that it entered into with respect to the development of Zoptrex™ in various territories.\nSales commission and other were $90,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $153,000 for the same period in 2017. During 2018, we received a $90,000 termination agreement payment from our customer. In 2017, those revenues mainly resulted from our sales team exceeding pre-established unit sales baseline thresholds under our co-promotion agreement to sell Saizen®. We also generated sales commission in connection with our promotion of APIFINY®.\nOperating Expenses\nR&D costs were $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in R&D costs is mainly attributable to lower comparative third-party costs.\nAdditionally, the decrease in our R&D costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, is attributable to lower employee compensation and benefits costs, as well as lower facilities rent and maintenance costs. A substantial portion of this decrease is due to the realization of cost savings in connection with our ongoing efforts to streamline our R&D activities.\nThird-party costs attributable to Zoptrex™ and Macrilen™ (macimorelin) decreased considerably during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to March 31, 2017, mainly since we completed the clinical portion of the ZoptEC trial and the Macrilen™ (macimorelin) trial in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Third-party costs attributable to Macrilen™ (macimorelin) incurred in 2017 are related to the detailed analysis of the results as well as the preparation of the New Drug Application filing, which was submitted on June 30, 2017.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we expect that we will incur overall R&D costs of between $1.0 million and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nG&A expenses were $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily related to fees associated with the Strongbridge License Agreement.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the recording of transaction costs related to potential financing activities (not currently known or estimable), we expect that G&A expenses will range between $8.0 million and $10.0 million in 2018.\nSelling expenses were $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2017. Most of the selling expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were for the payment of fees for the execution of the Strongbridge License Agreement. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the costs were for our sales force co-promotion activities as well as our sales management team. Based on currently available information, we expect selling expenses to range between $1.8 million and $2.1 million in 2018.\nNet finance income was $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.5 million, for the same period in 2017. The increase in finance income is mainly attributable to the change in fair value of warrant liability. Such change in fair value results from the periodic \"mark-to-market\" revaluation, via the application of pricing models, of outstanding share purchase warrants. The closing price of our common shares, which, on the NASDAQ, fluctuated from $1.46 to $2.41 during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.45 to $3.65 during the same period in 2017, also had a direct impact on the change in fair value of warrant liability.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $14.4 million (or $0.88 per share), as compared to a net loss of $4.1 million (or $0.31 per share) for the same period in 2017. The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is a result of the revenue recognition of the $24.0 million upfront payment received for the Strongbridge License Agreement.\nLiquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, we had $24.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect existing cash balances and operating cash flows will provide us with adequate funds to support our current operating plan for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(Unaudited) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 $ $ ASSETS Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents 24,548 7,780 Trade and other receivables 304 221 Inventory 1,096 643 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 912 737 Total current assets 26,860 9,381 Restricted cash equivalents 388 381 Property, plant and equipment 94 101 Identifiable intangible assets 104 90 Other non-current assets 151 150 Deferred tax asset — 3,479 Goodwill 8,844 8,613 Total assets 36,441 22,195 LIABILITIES Current liabilities Payables and accrued liabilities 3,144 2,987 Provision for restructuring costs 864 2,296 Income taxes payable 3,300 — Current portion of deferred revenues — 486 Total Current liabilities 7,308 5,769 Deferred revenues — 55 Warrant liability 2,069 3,897 Employee future benefits 14,569 14,229 Provisions and other non-current liabilities 953 1,028 Total Liabilities 24,899 24,978 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT) Share capital 222,335 222,335 Other capital 88,895 88,772 Deficit (299,737 ) (314,161 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 49 271 Total Shareholders' Equity (Deficiency) 11,542 (2,783 ) Total Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity (Deficiency) 36,441 22,195 Commitments and contingencies\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Information\n(Unaudited) Three months ended March 31, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2018 2017 $ $ Revenues Sales commission and other 90 153 Licensing revenue 24,568 108 Total revenues 24,658 261 Operating expenses Research and development costs 833 2,455 General and administrative expenses 2,786 1,881 Selling expenses 1,641 1,542 Total operating expenses 5,260 5,878 Income (loss) from operations 19,398 (5,617 ) Gain due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 48 65 Change in fair value of warrant liability 1,828 1,403 Other finance income 18 18 Net finance income 1,894 1,486 Income (loss) before income taxes 21,292 (4,131 ) Income taxes (6,868 ) — Net income (loss) 14,424 (4,131 ) Other comprehensive Income (loss): Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Foreign currency translation adjustments (222 ) (133 ) Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss: Actuarial gain on defined benefit plans — 441 Comprehensive income (loss) 14,202 (3,823 ) Net income (loss) per share (basic) 0.88 (0.31 ) Net income (loss) per share (diluted) 0.87 (0.31 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 16,440,760 13,175,866 Diluted 16,493,363 13,175,866 Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time.
