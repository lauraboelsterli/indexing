Last week the currency it hit a record low of 4.9290, prompting the central bank’s emergency action.\nThe currency was also hit by a stronger dollar, which firmed against emerging market currencies\nThe central bank hiked its late liquidity window rate, the highest of the four interest rates it uses, by 3 percentage points to 16.5 percent. Investors have hammered the lira - at one point sending it down by as much as 20 percent this year - on deepening concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy.\nThe bank has for years used multiple rates to set borrowing costs, creating a complex system that economists say has made policy less predictable. Adding to their concerns, Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates” has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs to boost credit and construction.\nSimsek said overnight that he and Cetinkaya would meet 90 portfolio managers, bank executives and analysts in groups between 7 am (0600 GMT) and 10 pm in London.\n“We are making intensive efforts for Turkey’s positive decoupling with our decisive police steps, good communication and our strong long-term story,” Simsek wrote on Twitter.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year bond was at 14.16 percent, down from 14.20 percent in spot trade on Monday.\nThe main BIST 100 share index fell 1.54 percent to 104.883 points.\nReporting by Daren Butler; Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
