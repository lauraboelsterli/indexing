    "text": "Published: May 4, 2018 2:45 a.m. ET Share\nInvestment adviser had recommended voting against directors Reuters Equifax Inc. headquarters in Atlanta.\nBy AnnaMaria Andriotis\nEquifax shareholders voted to re-elect all of the company’s board members who were on the ballot, though several directors including the board’s chairman received a significant number of votes against their re-election.\nThe company announced the election tallies Thursday afternoon following its annual shareholder meeting, the first since the company disclosed its major data breach last September in which personal information on 147.9 million U.S. consumers was compromised.\nBoard chairman Mark Feidler, for whom there were several calls against re-election in the run up to the meeting, received about 64% of the votes tallied in favor of re-election with about 35.5% voting against him and a tiny share abstaining. Board member John McKinley received the second most votes against re-election, with about 64.6% voting in favor of his re-election. A third director, Mark Templeton, received 68.2% of the vote in favor of re-election.\nThe three board members were on the technology committee during the time of breach and were criticized in the run-up to the election for the breach. CtW Investment Group, an adviser to union pension funds that are invested in Equifax EFX, -0.19% , in a letter to the company’s shareholders in April advised against the re-election of the three board members, who CtW said failed to act on repeated warnings of cybersecurity issues at Equifax before its breach.",
