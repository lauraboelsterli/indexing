    "text": "Luis Severino tied his season high with 11 strikeouts in seven effective innings Wednesday night as the New York Yankees beat the Houston Astros 5-3 at Yankee Stadium.\nSeverino recorded his eighth career double-digit strikeout game, third this season and second against the Astros. He also punched out 11 on May 8 against the Boston Red Sox.\nSeverino (8-1) won his sixth straight decision in allowing a two-run home run to Max Stassi among four hits. His biggest strikeout occurred with two on in the seventh when he fanned pinch hitter George Springer on a full-count slider.\nSeverino started the game by retiring the first 11 hitters before Jose Altuve singled. He also fanned seven of the first nine hitters, throwing 103 pitches in the outing.\nSeverino joined Cleveland’s Corey Kluber as the second eight-game winner in the American League.\nDavid Robertson fanned Altuve and Carlos Correa for the final two outs of a scoreless eighth. Aroldis Chapman allowed an RBI double by Stassi in the ninth but recorded his 12th save by fanning Springer on three pitches.\nGary Sanchez hit the tiebreaking single off Dallas Keuchel in the fifth for the Yankees, who took the season series 5-2. The Yankees also won for the 17th time in their last 21 home games.\nGiancarlo Stanton drove in a run with a sacrifice fly and nearly homered in the seventh. Didi Gregorius added an RBI single, and Aaron Hicks contributed a run-scoring double.\nKeuchel (3-7) allowed four runs on seven hits in five-plus innings. Including the postseason, he is 6-5 in 11 starts against the Yankees.\nThe Yankees took a 1-0 lead when Astros center fielder Jake Marisnick made a diving catch on Stanton’s sinking liner for the first out of the first. Hicks scored on the sacrifice fly.\nThe Astros took a 2-1 lead on their second hit when Stassi hammered Severino’s 2-1 fastball and sent it beyond the left-center field fence with two outs in the fifth.\nNew York loaded the bases on a walk to Stanton in the fifth and took a 3-2 lead when Sanchez singled to right. In the sixth, the Yankees took a 4-2 lead and knocked out Keuchel when Gregorius singled by Altuve’s diving attempt at second, driving in Gleyber Torres.\nNew York made it 5-2 when left fielder Marwin Gonzalez was unable to make a diving catch and Hicks coasted in with a double, driving home Austin Romine.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
