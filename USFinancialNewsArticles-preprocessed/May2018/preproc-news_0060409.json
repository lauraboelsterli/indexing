    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 4:34 AM / Updated 11 hours ago Rugby-Jones defends England training style as injuries mount Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 31 (Reuters) - England coach Eddie Jones has responded to Bath owner Bruce Craig’s criticism of his training methods by saying that a high-intensity regimen is required to prepare players for international matches.\nBath prop Beno Obano suffered ligament and hamstring tendon damage in England’s training camp at Brighton earlier this month, taking the number of players from the Premiership club injured during Jones’ tenure to five.\nBritish media reports had quoted Craig as describing the situation as “totally unacceptable”.\n“I haven’t seen any figures to suggest they are,” Jones told BBC Radio 5 live. “No one in our staff has suggested they are but Bruce is obviously an expert on training-ground injuries, so I’ll have to be subservient to his greater knowledge.”\nWorcester centre Ben Te’o was also ruled out of England’s three-test tour of South Africa next month after sustaining a thigh muscle injury this week.\nThe latest injury further cast the spotlight on Jones’ training methods.\n“The intensity and the speed of the game is far greater in international rugby, and therefore the preparation you have to have to play test rugby has to be more intense than club rugby,” Jones added.\n“That doesn’t downgrade club rugby at all, it’s just a different level of rugby.”\nJones said there were still concerns over Billy Vunipola’s fitness despite the number eight playing in Saracens’ Premiership final win over Exeter last weekend.\nEngland face South Africa in Johannesburg (June 9), Bloemfontein (June 16) and Cape Town (June 23).
