Royal fans are seen before taking a train to see the wedding of Britain's Prince Harry to Meghan Markle, at the Waterloo Station in London, Britain, May 19, 2018. REUTERS/Matthew Childs\nThe shrine by the Pont de l’Alma, next to the River Seine and the glitzy Avenue George V, is near the spot where Diana was fatally injured in a car crash in 1997.\n“I hope they get happy. It’s one of the most important days for England,” said Maria Kuntgen, a 35-year-old tourist from Brazil, at the memorial, where people had placed photos of Harry and Meghan.\nThat view was echoed by Roksana Arakelyan, a 32-year-old tourist from Moscow.\n“They are so noble, so gorgeous,” she said.\nFrance’s main TV stations all had teams reporting live from Windsor, while Le Parisien newspaper had a photo of Harry and Meghan dominating its front page.\nParisian David Andre Azoulay, 70, said he would watch the wedding on TV, although others were less enthusiastic.\n“I am very happy for them, but personally I’m not that bothered,” Gerard Le Gall told Reuters as he bought his papers at a kiosk opposite the Diana memorial.
