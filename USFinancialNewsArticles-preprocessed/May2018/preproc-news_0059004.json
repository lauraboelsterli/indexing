I look forward to making this happen.”\nOne of the most high profile businessmen in Britain, Sorrell is repeating the tactic he used in the 1980s when he took a listed company, Wire and Plastics Products, and used it to buy some of the world’s most famous advertising agencies.\nThe news comes just over six weeks after he quit WPP, a company that employed 200,000 staff in 112 countries after he built it up through years of deal making.\nThe board had opened an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct, leading Sorrell to step down. The company has not given any details about the allegation, and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. $1 = 0.7543 pounds Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Sarah Young",
