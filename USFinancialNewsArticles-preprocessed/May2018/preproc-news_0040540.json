    "text": "RENO, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ormat Technologies Inc. (NYSE:ORA) announced today that it will restate its second, third and fourth quarter 2017 financial statements and its full-year 2017 financial statements. This decision was approved by, and with the continuing oversight of, the Company’s Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee.\nAs a result of the restatement, investors should no longer rely upon the Company's previously issued financial statements for the periods set forth above, earnings releases for these periods, and other communications relating to these financial statements. In addition, the Company is further delaying the filing of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its first quarter of 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe decision to restate these financial statements is based on the Company’s conclusion that there were errors in the income tax provision primarily relating to the Company’s valuation allowance based on the Company’s ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the U.S. prior to their expiration. Additionally, the Company netted certain deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities across different tax jurisdictions that are not permitted to be netted pursuant to United States generally accepted accounting principles. The restatement is expected to impact the “income tax (provision) benefit” line item in the Company’s statements of operations, with associated impacts to net income and earnings per share and the “deferred income taxes” line items on its balance sheet. In connection with the restatement of the full-year 2017 financial statements, the Company will also make revisions to the same line items in certain quarterly financial statements for 2016 and its full-year 2016 and 2015 financial statements.\nAlthough the Company cannot at this time estimate when it will complete the restatement and refile its restated financial statements and its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018, it is diligently pursuing completion of the restatement and intends to file the Form 10-Q as soon as reasonably practicable. Because the Company has not yet fully completed its review, the impact of the restatement described above is preliminary and subject to change.\nAs previously reported, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes. Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, continues to dedicate significant resources and efforts to improve the Company’s control environment and take steps to address the material weakness identified. These efforts are intended both to address the identified material weakness and to enhance the Company’s overall financial control environment.\nAbout Ormat Technologies\nWith over five decades of experience, Ormat Technologies, Inc. is a leading geothermal Company and the only vertically integrated Company engaged in geothermal and recovered energy generation (REG), with the objective of becoming a leading global provider of renewable energy.
