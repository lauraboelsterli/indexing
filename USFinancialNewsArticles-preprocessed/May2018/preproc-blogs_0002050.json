    "text": "Disney is making big moves in food.\nAt its annual NewFront on Tuesday — a presentation of upcoming video content for advertisers — the company introduced a new digital brand called Disney Eats. The online channel and editorial site features culinary shows and products aimed at families.\nThe move to target young families showed Disney's dedication to reach a generation of viewers who grew up watching videos on platforms like YouTube, and now are looking for content for their children on online mediums.\nshow chapters Disney dominates opening weekend box office in U.S. 20 Hours Ago | 02:25 Upcoming Disney Eats shows include seasons of \"Kitchen Little,\" which will showcase kids working with celebrity chefs, and \"Tiny Kitchen,\" with chefs creating small replicas of Disney food. Both were co-created with global entertainment company Tastemade .\nDisney Eats will be part of the Disney Digital Network, which was previously known as Maker Studios and was acquired by Disney in 2014 for $500 million.\nDisney told CNBC the food channel will uphold the same health standards that the company previously imposed on advertisers. In 2012, Disney made efforts to ensure that food products advertised on its television networks fit specific nutritional standards.\nThe new channel will also have another Tastemade food science series called \"Must Be Science,\" as well as shows with Disney online influencers that will be announced at a later date. The programs are aimed at showcasing \"co-cooking\" experiences, or parents cooking with their kids. As for other potential moneymakers, Disney will sell branded products, including kitchen utensils, bakeware and cookbooks.\nDisney also announced a relaunch of its free Oh My Disney mobile app and a podcast series. It will debut new programs for Facebook Watch, including \"Designing Disney,\" a show about designers who create Disney-inspired projects, and \"Disney Dream Job,\" a series about five children who spend a day working with Disney employees.\nAdditionally, Disney will launch more content for Marvel and Star Wars fans, including a new documentary series and fan awards within the programming.",
