    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court on Tuesday said halal slaughter is only allowed in licensed slaughterhouses, ruling that a Belgian ban on the ritualized religious slaughter by Muslims elsewhere did not infringe on freedom of religion.\nThe case was brought by a group of Muslim organizations against Belgium’s Flanders region after it banned temporary religious slaughter houses - set up during the Islamic Feast of the Sacrifice, or Eid al-Adha, which this year begins on August 21.\nThe European Court of Justice ruled the regulation on where to allow ritual slaughter aimed “to organize and manage the freedom to carry out slaughter without prior stunning for religious purposes.”\nThe limits are no different, in principal, to those applying to any slaughter of animals within the European Union, the court said in a statement.\nReporting by Megan Dollar; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
