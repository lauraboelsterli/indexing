    "text": "TORONTO, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Firm Capital Mortgage Investment Corporation (the “Corporation”) (TSX:FC) released its financial statements for the three ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1/2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nProfit of $6.43 million exceeded dividends for the quarter by $328,251 Interest and fees increased by 32% compared to the same period in 2017; Weighted average portfolio interest increased by 14 basis points to 8.23% from December 31, 2017; Cash flow from operations for the period increased 27% compared to the same period in 2017; and Profit represents an annualized return on shareholders’ equity of 9.04%.\nPROFIT\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2018, income and profit (referred to herein as “Profit”) was $6,434,989 compared to $7,026,716 reported at March 31, 2017. Special income earned in the first quarter of 2017 was unusually high as a result of the recognition of $2,737,500 of special income earned on one of the Corporation’s non-conventional investments.\nBasic weighted average profit per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $0.247, which is lower than the $0.311 per share reported for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nPORTFOLIO\nThe Corporation’s investment portfolio (the “Investment Portfolio”), as at March 31, 2018, stood at $546.2 million as compared to $555.8 million as at December 31, 2017 (net of the impairment provision of $6.00 million and $5.70 million, respectively).\nRETURN ON EQUITY\nThe Corporation continues to exceed its yield objective of producing a return on shareholders’ equity in excess of 400 basis points over the average one year Government of Canada Treasury bill yield. Profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 represents an annualized return on shareholders’ equity (based on the average of the month end shareholders’ equity in the quarter) of 9.04%, representing a return on shareholders’ equity of 744 basis points per annum over the average one year Government of Canada Treasury bill yield of 1.60%.\nPRUDENT IMPAIRMENT PROVISION\nManagement has always taken a proactive approach to loan impairment provision. This is a prudent approach to protecting the stability of dividends to shareholders in the event there are any future issues with any of the investments within the Corporation’s investment portfolio. The impairment provision was increased by $300,000 during the first quarter of 2018 to $6,000,000 and represents 1% of Corporation’s assets.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DETAILS\nDetails on the Corporation’s investment portfolio as at March 31, 2018 are as follows:\nTotal gross investment portfolio of $552,284,304, which is an 1.6% decrease from the $561,501,977 reported at December 31, 2017. Conventional first mortgages, being those first mortgages with loan-to-values less than 75%, comprise 76.1% of the total portfolio, and total conventional mortgages with loan-to-values under 75%, comprise 85.6% of the total portfolio. Approximately 79% of the portfolio matures by March 31, 2019. The average face interest rate on the portfolio increased to 8.23% per annum, as compared to 8.09% at December 31, 2017 Regionally, the mortgage investment portfolio is diversified approximately as follows: Ontario (88%), Quebec (5%), Alberta (4%), and Other (3%).\nDIVIDEND AND SHARE PURCHASE PLAN\nThe Corporation has in place a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and Share Purchase Plan that is available to its Shareholders. The DRIP allows participants to have their monthly cash dividends reinvested in additional shares. The Price paid per share is 97% (if the share price is higher than $14.10) of the weighted average trading price calculated five trading days immediately preceding each dividend date with no commission cost. Once registered with the Share Purchase Plan, participants have the right to purchase additional shares, totaling no greater than $12,000 per year and no less than $250 per month. Shareholders participating pay no commission.\nAbout the Corporation\nWhere Mortgage Deals Get Done ®\nThe Corporation, through its mortgage banker, Firm Capital Corporation, is a non-bank lender providing residential and commercial short-term bridge and conventional real estate financing, including construction, mezzanine, and equity investments.
