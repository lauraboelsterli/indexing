FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr attends the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Republican Chuck Grassley, is among those investigating Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign.\nThe June 9 meeting is a central part of the investigations, especially questions regarding who participated and why it was held.\nAmong the transcripts are interviews with Donald Trump Jr., an interpreter for Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others who attended the meeting.\nTranscripts were also released for committee investigators’ questioning of Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Moscow-based developer Ike Kaveladze, British publicist Robert Goldstone, and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.\nRussia has denied any interference. Trump, a Republican, has also said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow. Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Bill Trott",
