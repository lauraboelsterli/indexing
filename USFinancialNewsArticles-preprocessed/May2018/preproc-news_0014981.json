    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 6:16 PM / in 5 minutes Icahn, Deason want at least $40 per share for Xerox Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason would consider a bid for Xerox Corp XNX.N of at least $40 per share, or a split with Fujifilm that will leave the company independent, to resolve an ongoing proxy fight, they said in a letter on Monday. The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo\nThe letter comes after Xerox on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ), just hours after the printer and copier maker announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place.\nShares of Xerox were marginally down at $28 in afternoon trading.\nIn February, Japan’s Fujifilm said it is set to takeover Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal, combining the U.S. company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs amid declining demand for office printing.\nIcahn and Deason, who were already questioning the Fujifilm joint venture agreement, have opposed the merger since it was announced saying it dramatically undervalues Xerox.\nIn April, both Icahn and Deason, suggested alternatives to the printer maker’s proposed merger, including a plan for the U.S. company to monetize some assets.\nThe activist investors said in a letter in April, that the their plan will create total value of $54 to $64 per share compared to the approximate $28 per share in the Fujifilm deal.\nXerox did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
