    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 8:50 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Bank of England's Broadbent apologises for 'menopausal' remark Reuters Staff 2 Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent apologised on Wednesday for describing Britain’s economy as going through a “menopausal” phrase, a comment that was roundly criticised.

REUTERS/Neil Hall//File Photo\n“I’m sorry for my poor choice of language in an interview with the Telegraph yesterday and regret the offence caused,” Broadbent said in a statement.\nBroadbent had told the Telegraph that years of poor productivity and weak wage growth meant Britain was going through a “menopausal” moment.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\nThe former Goldman Sachs economist, among those tipped as a potential successor to BoE Governor Mark Carney who stands down next year, said financial experts used the phrase to describe economies that were “past their peak and no longer so potent”.

REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\nHis comments attracted derision in social media.\n“Enough of this pejorative tosh stigmatising women in their prime,” Conservative lawmaker Sarah Wollaston said on Twitter.\n“#Menopause only a problem if others try to sideline you because of ignorant prejudice.”\nRobert Peston, political editor of broadcaster ITV, said the comments were “sloppy, empirically unsound and potentially offensive”.\nIn his apology, Broadbent said he had been trying to explain the word “climacteric”, a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the nineteenth century.\n“Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders,” he said.
