    "text": "NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES OR FOR DISTRIBUTION BY ANY UNITED STATES NEWS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE\nTORONTO, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quinsam Capital Corporation (CSE:QCA) (\"Quinsam\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has entered an agreement to sell its right to a 35% equity stake in Herbiculture Inc. (“Herbiculture”) to Lineage Grow Company Ltd. (“Lineage”). Quinsam will retain its original US$655,000 loan to Herbiculture. Assuming that the agreement closes, Quinsam expects to trigger a material gain on the transaction given that it obtained the right to the equity stake at no cost in association with providing the loan.\nRoger Dent, CEO of Quinsam said “We have been very pleased with our investment in Herbiculture and we continue to have a very positive view on its outlook. The transaction with Lineage allows us to convert an illiquid asset with no carrying value into a liquid investment with a Quote: d value. At the same time, we have the opportunity to continue to participate in Herbiculture through Lineage. We expect to be one of the largest shareholders of Lineage if the transaction closes.”\nHerbiculture Overview\nHerbiculture is a fully-licensed medical marijuana dispensary which opened its doors to patients in February 2018 and has achieved sales of approximately USD$91,000 and USD$100,000 for the months of March 2018 and April 2018, respectively.\nThe dispensary is one of the few licensed medical marijuana retailers operating in the state of Maryland and is one of only two license holders permitted to operate in Maryland’s 14th Senatorial District. Herbiculture is strategically located in the epicenter of Montgomery County - the most populous county in Maryland and is situated in close proximity to two major metropolitan areas: Baltimore and Bethesda.\nTransaction Details\nPursuant to the LOI, Lineage will acquire Quinsam’s 35% equity interest in Herbiculture for total consideration of US$720,000, to be satisfied by Lineage issuing to Quinsam 3,900,000 common shares of Lineage upon closing of the transaction at a price of US$0.1846 per share. On closing, Lineage will also enter into an agreement with Herbiculture and its shareholders for Lineage to be granted a right of refusal to purchase 35% of securities offered by Herbiculture and a tag along right in case the majority shareholders of Herbiculture sell their stake.\nThe transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to, final due diligence by the respective parties, execution of a definitive acquisition agreement which shall supersede the LOI, receipt of applicable corporate approvals, and other regulatory and/or governmental approval. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed as proposed or at all.\nFMI Capital Advisory Inc. (“FMI”) is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Lineage in connection with the Transaction. Adam Szweras and Peter Bilodeau, directors of Quinsam, are principals of FMI. Peter Bilodeau, President of Quinsam, is also CEO of Lineage.\nAbout Quinsam Capital Corporation\nQuinsam is a merchant bank based in Canada that is focusing on cannabis-related investments.
