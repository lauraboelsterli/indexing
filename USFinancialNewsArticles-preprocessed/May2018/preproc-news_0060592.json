    "text": "TEL-AVIV, Israel, May 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American: ELLO) (TASE: ELLO) (\"Ellomay\" or the \"Company\") , a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe and Israel, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (\" Dorad \"), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 9.4%.\nOn May 16, 2018, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (f/k/a U. Dori Group Ltd.) (the \" Luzon Group \"), an Israeli public company that currently holds 50% of U. Dori Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (\" Dori Energy \"), which, in turn, holds 18.75% of Dorad, published certain information in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968, which included the financial statements of Dorad for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe financial results of Dorad for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Dori Energy) in its financial results for this period, which are currently expected to be published on or about June 21, 2018. In an effort to provide Ellomay's shareholders with access to Dorad's financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation of Dorad's financial results.\nDorad Financial Highlights\nDorad's unaudited revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 - approximately NIS 684.9 million. Dorad's unaudited operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 - approximately NIS 117.4 million.\nBased on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad's customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: the summer season – the months of July and August; the winter season - the months of December, January and February; and intermediate seasons – (spring and autumn), the months from March to June and from September to November. There is a higher hourly demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption per hour is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad's revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs - TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which include the winter and intermediate months of January, February and March, are not indicative of full year results.\nA translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and as of and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad's financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd., Dori Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.\nAbout Ellomay Capital Ltd.\nEllomay is an Israeli based company whose shares are registered with the NYSE American and with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the trading symbol \"ELLO\".
