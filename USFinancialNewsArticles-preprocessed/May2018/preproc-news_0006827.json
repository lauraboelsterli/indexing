    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- L&W Supply Corporation, a leading distributor of top quality building materials and specialty products in the United States, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire NexGen Building Supply. NexGen distributes drywall, ceiling systems, steel stud and other building materials, with locations in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio.\nAs a leading distributor of interior building products in the Midwest, the NexGen acquisition supports L&W Supply's overall growth strategy. “We look forward to welcoming the NexGen associates, customers and suppliers to the L&W Supply family,” said Dan Piché, L&W Supply's president. With the NexGen acquisition, L&W Supply will operate 156 locations in 35 states.\nThe transaction is L&W Supply’s largest acquisition since joining the ABC Supply family, and follows the recent and successful integrations of Wright Bros.
