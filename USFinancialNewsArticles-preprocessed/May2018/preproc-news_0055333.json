Conference on Disarmament for the next month, saying Damascus lacked credibility to preside over the body because of its use of chemical weapons. Syria's ambassador to the U.N. Hussam Aala attends as President of the Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n“We are outraged at the Syrian regime’s blatant disregard for human life, its serial violations of and contempt for its international obligations and its audaciousness in assuming the presidency of an international body committed to advancing disarmament and nonproliferation,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing. “Syria lacks the credibility to assume the presidency.” Reporting by Lesley Wroughton, writing by David Alexander, editing by Eric Walsh",
