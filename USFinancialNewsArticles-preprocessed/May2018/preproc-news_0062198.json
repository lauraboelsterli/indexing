    "text": "Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein \"another step closer to accountability.\"\nThe announcement came hours after Weinstein's lawyers said he'd decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare him and \"political pressure\" made an indictment unavoidable.\nA statement issued through a Weinstein spokesman said the 66-year-old film producer, who has denied the allegations, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself in Friday. With a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not, his request for more time was denied, the statement said.\nshow chapters Harvey Weinsteinâ€™s fall from grace in Hollywood 11:51 AM ET Fri, 25 May 2018 | 03:52 \"Finally, Mr. Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein,\" the statement said, referring to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.\nVance said in a statement that the Weinstein camp's \"recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable.\"\n\"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand,\" Vance said.\nWeinstein was charged Friday with rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York, as a grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case; the panel has been at work for weeks. Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.\nWeinstein faces rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York. Dozens more women have accused him of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.\nHe has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Tuesday that Weinstein was \"confident he's going to clear his name\" in the New York prosecution.\nBrafman called the rape allegation \"absurd,\" saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that continued after the alleged 2013 attack.\nThe woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators Weinstein confined her in a hotel room and raped her.\nThe other accuser in the case, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.\nVance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped her during a meeting.\nPolice set up a sting in which the woman recorded herself confronting Weinstein and him apologizing for his conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo , also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter.\nWATCH: The state of Harvey Weinstein's assets show chapters Looking at the state of Harvey Weinstein's assets 11:24 AM ET Fri, 25 May 2018 | 02:05",
