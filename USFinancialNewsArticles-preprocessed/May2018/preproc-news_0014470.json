(\"MIII\"), following the receipt of stockholder approval at its special meeting of stockholders held on March 21, 2018, in New York City.\nIn connection with the consummation of the merger, the combined company changed its name to \"Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc.\" (the \"Company\") and anticipates that the Company's shares of common stock and warrants will continue trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, under the new ticker symbols \"IEA\" and \"IEAWW,\" respectively, on or shortly after March 27, 2018.\nBased in Indianapolis, Indiana, IEA specializes in the design and construction of critical energy infrastructure with a focus on renewable energy projects. As previously disclosed, IEA generated revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, of $454.9 million, $16.5 million and $52.5 million, respectively.

We believe IEA has the No. 1 U.S. market share among EPCs for wind, and we are confident in our ability to continue to grow our wind energy business and leverage our expertise and relationships to deliver infrastructure solutions in other areas, including solar, traditional power generation and civil infrastructure.\"\nMIII was advised on the transaction by Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated as M&A advisor and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Jefferies LLC as equity capital markets advisors.
