(NYSE American: AINC) (the \"Company\") today reported the following results and performance measures for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Unless otherwise stated, all reported results compare the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, with the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 (see discussion below). The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nSTRATEGIC OVERVIEW\nHigh-growth, fee-based business model Diversified platform of multiple fee generators Seeks to grow in three primary areas: Expanding the existing platforms accretively and accelerating performance to earn incentive fees Starting new platforms for additional base and incentive fees Investing in or incubating strategic businesses that can achieve accelerated growth through doing business with our existing platforms and by leveraging our deep knowledge and extensive relationships within the hospitality sector Highly-aligned management team with superior long-term track record Leader in asset and investment management for the real estate & hospitality sectors\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nNet loss attributable to the Company for the quarter totaled $5.7 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.4 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $4.6 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared with $4.4 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $48.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 270% over the prior year quarter Debt placement fee revenue was $632,000 in the quarter Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $5.4 million, reflecting a growth rate of 6% over the prior year quarter At the end of the first quarter, the Company had approximately $6.3 billion of assets under management As of March 31, 2018, the Company had corporate cash of $30.8 million\nACQUISITION OF REMINGTON'S PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS\nOn April 9, 2018 the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Project Management business of privately-held Remington Holdings, L.P. (\"Remington\"). The transaction, which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018, is subject to approval by the Company's stockholders and customary closing conditions.\nRemington's Project Management business provides comprehensive and cost-effective design, development, and project management services for both Remington managed hotels as well as external partners. It provides project oversight, coordination, planning, and execution of renovation, capital expenditure or ground-up development projects. Its operations are responsible for managing and implementing substantially all capital improvements at Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) (\"Ashford Trust\" or \"Trust\") and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) (\"Braemar\"). Additionally, it has extensive experience working with many of the major hotel brands in areas of renovating, converting, developing or repositioning hotels. In 2017, Remington Project Management had revenues of approximately $29.0 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $16.3 million.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire Remington's Project Management business for a total transaction value of $203 million. The purchase price will be paid by issuing convertible preferred stock to the sellers. The newly created convertible preferred stock will have a conversion price of $140 per share (a 45% premium to the trading level at the time of the announcement) and, if converted immediately after the consummation of the transaction, would convert into 1,450,000 shares of common stock. Dividends on the convertible preferred stock are payable at an annual rate of 5.5% in the first year, 6.0% in the second year, and 6.5% in the third year and each year thereafter. Voting rights of the convertible preferred stock will be on an as-converted basis and the holders of the convertible preferred stock will have a voting limit of 25% of the Company's voting securities for five years. Upon closing of the transaction, the sellers will have the right to nominate two directors to the Company's Board of Directors. The transaction does not require a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service.\nINVESTMENT IN RED HOSPITALITY & LEISURE\nDuring the quarter, the Company acquired an approximate 80% controlling interest in RED Hospitality & Leisure for approximately $1 million in cash. RED Hospitality & Leisure is a leading provider of watersports activities and other travel & transportation services in the U.S. Virgin Islands. RED Hospitality has already begun limited ferry operations between St. Thomas and St. John and expects to capitalize on new contracts and charter business as the Virgin Islands resorts begin to reopen in the second half of this year and into early 2019. RED Hospitality generated $256,000 of revenue and $86,000 of Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter during the Company's period of ownership.\nJ&S AUDIO VISUAL UPDATE\nThe Company currently owns an 85% controlling interest in a privately held company that conducts the business of J&S Audio Visual in the United States, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic (\"J&S\"). J&S provides an integrated suite of audio visual services, including show & event services, hospitality services, creative services, and design & integration, making J&S a leading single-source solution for their clients' meeting and event needs. In the first full quarter since the Company's investment, revenue growth was 21% and Adjusted EBITDA growth was 29% as compared to the prior year period. First quarter growth was largely supported by third-party business which saw 17% growth in revenue highlighted by one of the best months in the company's history.

OpenKey is the universal, industry-standard smartphone App for keyless entry in hotel guestrooms. There have been several recent developments regarding OpenKey's growth. The company continues to expand the platform with growth from OpenKey China as well as securing an additional asset level contract with yet another hotel brand, Yotel, increasing the company's access to 15 hotel brands and portfolios. OpenKey remains the industry leader in interfaces with major lock manufacturers and has access to thousands of hotels worldwide through its exclusive deal offerings with Preferred Hotels, World Hotels and its integration with InnDependent Boutique Collection, a hotel technology platform used worldwide. The company also continues to be supported by its office in Guadalajara, Mexico which has been instrumental for growth in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia as well as independent resellers currently working in 14 different countries. In the first quarter, revenue growth was 1,176% compared to the prior year period and 71% relative to the fourth quarter of 2017.

The new loan totals $395 million and is expected to result in annual interest savings of approximately $6.8 million compared to the previous loan terms. Trust sold the SpringHill Suites Glen Allen in Glen Allen, VA for $10.9 million. Subsequent to quarter end, Trust refinanced a mortgage loan on 22 hotels with an existing outstanding balance totaling approximately $972 million. The new loan totals $985 million and is expected to result in annual interest savings of approximately $11 million compared to the previous loan terms.\nBraemar Hotels & Resorts HIGHLIGHTS\nAshford Hospitality Prime rebranded to Braemar Hotels & Resorts on April 24, 2018, further enhancing their strategy to focus on the luxury segment. Subsequent to quarter end, Braemar completed the acquisition of the 266-room Ritz-Carlton Sarasota in Sarasota, FL for $171 million. Concurrent with the completion of the acquisition, Braemar financed the hotel with a $100 million non-recourse loan.\n\"We are pleased with our operating results for the first quarter and the continued execution on our growth strategy,\" commented Monty J. Bennett, Ashford's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"During the quarter, we were pleased to have entered in to an agreement to acquire the high-margin project management division of Remington. With deep industry experience and long-term contracts in place, we believe this transaction represents a compelling opportunity for Ashford to diversify its earnings stream and, moving forward, the potential to expand business to other third-party clients. Additionally, the RED Hospitality investment will give us a foothold in the watersports and travel & hospitality services sector that we believe has enormous potential. Looking ahead, we remain committed to maximizing value for our shareholders and are well positioned to opportunistically grow our business by accretively expanding our existing REIT platforms, adding additional investment platforms and investing in other hospitality-related businesses through which we can accelerate meaningful, profitable growth.\"\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL AND SIMULCAST\nThe Company will conduct a conference call on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. ET. The number for this interactive teleconference is (719) 325-4857. A replay of the conference call will be available through Friday, May 11, 2018, by dialing (719) 457-0820 and entering the confirmation number 1067560.\nThe Company will also provide an online simulcast and rebroadcast of its first quarter 2018 earnings release conference call. The live broadcast of the Company's quarterly conference call will be available online at the Company's web site, www.ashfordinc.com on Friday, May 4, 2018, beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET. The online replay will follow shortly after the call and continue for approximately one year.\nIncluded in this press release are certain supplemental measures of performance which are not measures of operating performance under GAAP, to assist investors in evaluating the Company's historical or future financial performance. These supplemental measures include adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and Adjusted Net Income. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provide investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, among other measures, to evaluate profitability and our board of directors includes these measures in reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by subtracting or adding to net income (loss): interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, net income (loss) to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs, and other expenses. We calculate Adjusted Net Income by subtracting or adding to net income (loss): net income (loss) to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs, and other expenses. Our methodology for calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income represents cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to a) GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity nor are such measures indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs. The Company urges investors to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information as shown in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, as amended.\nAshford provides global asset management, investment management and related services to the real estate and hospitality sectors.\nFollow Chairman and CEO Monty Bennett on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MBennettAshford or @MBennettAshford.\nAshford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community.
