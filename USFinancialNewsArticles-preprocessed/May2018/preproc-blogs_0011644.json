    "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook said Friday that he's \"thrilled\" to have legendary investor Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway as a major investor in the company.\nBuffett revealed late Thursday Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares of Apple during the first quarter — pushing the stock to an all-time high Friday morning.\n\"On a personal level, I've always greatly admired Warren and have always been grateful for his insight and advice,\" Cook said in a statement.\nIf Berkshire purchased the additional stock at Apple's lowest first quarter levels, 75 million shares would ring in above $11 billion — the actual spend was likely higher since Apple only traded below $154 for a single day during the quarter.\n\"It is an unbelievable company,\" Buffett told CNBC.\nThe buy makes Berkshire the third largest Apple shareholder, behind Vanguard and BlackRock.",
