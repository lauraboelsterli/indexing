FILE PHOTO: Trams are seen in downtown Lisbon August 20, 2013. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\nIn its second reading of gross domestic product for the quarter, the National Statistics Institute (INE) also said the economy grew 2.1 percent in January-March from a year earlier, after an expansion of 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.\nNet exports had a negative contribution of 0.3 percent to the quarter-on-quarter growth and 0.4 percent in the year-on-year figure, while the positive contribution to GDP from internal demand increased.\nPortugal’s economy grew 2.7 percent in 2017, its strongest pace in 17 years, and this year the government expects a 2.3 percent expansion.
