    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - A former aide to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave highly anticipated testimony on Thursday to a parliamentary investigation into a cronyism scandal that is undermining Abe’s support, but he did not make any startling revelations.\nThe scandal, one of several that have raised questions about how long Abe can hold onto office, centers on allegations the prime minister helped a friend get permission to open a veterinary school in a special economic zone.\nOn Thursday, former Abe aide Tadao Yanase told parliament that he had indeed had dealings with the school operator, the director of which is Abe’s friend, but said neither he nor Abe had intervened to help win approval for the school.\nNihon University professor Tomoaki Iwai said Yanase’s testimony was neither a body-blow for Abe, nor would if dispel voters’ suspicions about his behavior.\n“This is a testimony well within the realm of expectations ... I don’t think voters’ distrust has been wiped out. It is unlikely his support will bounce right up,” Iwai said.\n“It’s going to trend sideways, or dip slightly.”\nYanase acknowledged for the first time that he had met officials from the educational institution called Kake Gakuen three times in the first half of 2015.\nThe institution’s director, Kotaro Kake, is an old friend of Abe’s.\nAbe has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the affair.\nYanase, now a senior official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, repeated an earlier assertion that he had not given Kake Gakuen any preferential treatment, and that Abe had never told him to do so.\nAbe is hoping to win a third term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September vote. He needs the party top job to stay on as prime minister.\nVictory in the party poll would set Abe, who took office in 2012 pledging to reboot the economy and bolster defense, on track to become Japan’s longest-serving premier.\nBut opposition lawmakers have called for him to resign.\nThe Asahi newspaper reported last month that Yanase had told authorities in 2015 that the plan for the veterinary school in a government-designated deregulation zone was a “prime ministerial matter” and they should work hard to realize it.\nYanase denied using that term.\nReporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Kiyoshi Takenaka\n ",
