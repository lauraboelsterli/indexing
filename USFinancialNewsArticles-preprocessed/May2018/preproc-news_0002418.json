    "text": "MADISON, Wis., Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31 as follows:\n2018\n2017\nUtilities and Corporate Services\n$0.45\n$0.38\nAmerican Transmission Company (ATC) Holdings\n0.03\n0.03\nNon-utility and Parent\n0.04\n0.02\nAlliant Energy Consolidated\n$0.52\n$0.43\n\"With a return to near normal temperatures, first quarter 2018 results were in-line with our expectations so we are reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance,\" said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman and CEO. \"The first quarter results reflect higher margins due to earning on our increasing rate base, while managing impacts to customers.\"\nUtilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy's Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $0.45 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018, which was $0.07 per share higher than the first quarter of 2017. The primary drivers of higher EPS were $0.07 per share higher margins resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company's (IPL) interim retail electric base rate increase implemented in April 2017, and higher retail electric and gas sales due to colder temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.\nNon-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy's Non-utility and Parent operations generated $0.04 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018, which was an improvement of $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2017. The primary driver of higher EPS is higher equity income from the wind farm in Oklahoma due to accelerated earnings as a result of Tax Reform, which is expected to reverse over time.\nDetails regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 for Alliant Energy are as follows:\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nVariance\nUtilities and Corporate Services:\nHigher margins primarily from earning on increasing rate base\n$0.09\nEstimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales\n$0.01\n($0.04)\n0.05\nHigher depreciation expense\n(0.04)\nOther\n(0.03)\nTotal Utilities and Corporate Services\n$0.07\nNon-utility and Parent:\nOther (primarily due to the timing of the impacts of Tax Reform)\n$0.02\nTotal Non-utility and Parent\n$0.02\nHigher margins primarily from earning on increasing rate base - In April 2017, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers. The request was based on a 2016 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail electric rate increase of $102 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 13, 2017. IPL recognized $23 million, or $0.07 per share, of higher electric revenues in the first quarter of 2018 due to the interim retail electric rate increase.\nIn December 2016, Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL) received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WPL to implement a retail electric rate increase effective January 1, 2017 followed by a freeze of such rates through the end of 2018. To reflect the higher margins in 2018, primarily from earning on increasing rate base, the order lowered the amortization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for electric transmission cost recovery beginning in January 2018. WPL recognized $0.02 per share of higher electric margins in the first quarter of 2018 due to lower transmission cost recovery amortization.\nTax Reform Impacts - Alliant Energy's Non-utility wind farm holding generated higher earnings in the first quarter of 2018 due to an acceleration of earnings as a result of Tax Reform which is expected to reverse over time.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nAlliant Energy is reaffirming its EPS guidance for 2018 as follows:\nUtilities and Corporate Services\n$1.92 - $2.02\nATC Holdings\n0.12 - 0.14\nNon-utility and Parent\n0.00 - 0.02\nAlliant Energy Consolidated\n$2.04 - $2.18\nDrivers for Alliant Energy's 2018 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:\nAbility of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales Normal temperatures for the remainder of the year in its utility service territories Continuing cost controls Execution of IPL's and WPL's capital expenditure and financing plans Regulatory treatment of Tax Reform benefits from utility operations Consolidated effective tax rate of 12%\nThe 2018 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, further impacts from anticipated changes to ATC LLC's authorized return on equity, future changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to review the first quarter 2018 results is scheduled for Thursday, May 3rd at 9:00 a.m. central time. Alliant Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Kampling and Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Robert Durian will host the call.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \"forecast,\" \"expect,\" \"guidance,\" or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Actual results could be materially affected by the following factors, among others:\nIPL's and WPL's ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to allow for, among other things, earning a return on rate base additions and the recovery of costs, including fuel costs, operating costs, transmission costs, environmental compliance and remediation costs, deferred expenditures, deferred tax assets, capital expenditures, and remaining costs related to electric generating units (EGUs) that may be permanently closed, earning their authorized rates of return, and the payments to their parent of expected levels of dividends; federal and state regulatory or governmental actions, including the impact of energy, tax, financial and health care legislation, and regulatory agency orders; the impact of customer- and third party-owned generation, including alternative electric suppliers, in IPL's and WPL's service territories on system reliability, operating expenses and customers' demand for electricity; the impact of energy efficiency, franchise retention and customer disconnects on sales volumes and margins; the impact that price changes may have on IPL's and WPL's customers' demand for electric, gas and steam services and their ability to pay their bills; the ability to utilize tax credits and net operating losses generated to date, and those that may be generated in the future, before they expire; the direct or indirect effects resulting from terrorist incidents, including physical attacks and cyber attacks, or responses to such incidents; the impact of penalties or third-party claims related to, or in connection with, a failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information, including associated costs to notify affected persons and to mitigate their information security concerns; employee workforce factors, including changes in key executives, ability to hire and retain employees with specialized skills, ability to create desired corporate culture, collective bargaining agreements and negotiations, work stoppages or restructurings; weather effects on results of utility operations; issues associated with environmental remediation and environmental compliance, including compliance with the Consent Decree between WPL, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Sierra Club, the Consent Decree between IPL, the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, the Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, the Clean Power Plan, future changes in environmental laws and regulations, including the EPA's regulations for carbon dioxide emissions reductions from new and existing fossil-fueled EGUs, and litigation associated with environmental requirements; the ability to defend against environmental claims brought by state and federal agencies, such as the EPA, state natural resources agencies or third parties, such as the Sierra Club, and the impact on operating expenses of defending and resolving such claims; continued access to the capital markets on competitive terms and rates, and the actions of credit rating agencies; inflation and interest rates; the impact of the economy in IPL's and WPL's service territories and the resulting impacts on sales volumes, margins and the ability to collect unpaid bills; changes in the price of delivered natural gas, purchased electricity and coal due to shifts in supply and demand caused by market conditions and regulations; disruptions in the supply and delivery of natural gas, purchased electricity and coal; changes in the price of transmission services and the ability to recover the cost of transmission services in a timely manner; developments that adversely impact the ability to implement the strategic plan; ability to obtain regulatory approval for wind projects with acceptable conditions, to acquire sufficient transmission-ready wind sites, to complete construction within the cost caps set by regulators and to meet all requirements to qualify for the full level of production tax credits; the direct or indirect effects resulting from breakdown or failure of equipment in the operation of electric and gas distribution systems, such as mechanical problems and explosions or fires, and compliance with electric and gas transmission and distribution safety regulations; issues related to the availability and operations of EGUs, including start-up risks, breakdown or failure of equipment, performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency, operator error, employee safety, transmission constraints, compliance with mandatory reliability standards and risks related to recovery of resulting incremental costs through rates; impacts that storms or natural disasters in IPL's and WPL's service territories may have on their operations and recovery of costs associated with restoration activities; any material post-closing adjustments related to any past asset divestitures, including the sales of IPL's Minnesota electric and natural gas assets, and Whiting Petroleum Corporation, which could result from, among other things, indemnification agreements, warranties, parental guarantees or litigation; Alliant Energy's ability to sustain its dividend payout ratio goal; changes to costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of pension and OPEB plans due to the market value of the assets that fund the plans, economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics; material changes in employee-related benefit and compensation costs; risks associated with operation and ownership of non-utility holdings; changes in technology that alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize Alliant Energy's, IPL's or WPL's products and services; impacts on equity income from unconsolidated investments due to further potential changes to ATC LLC's authorized return on equity; impacts of IPL's future tax benefits from Iowa rate-making practices, including deductions for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs and state depreciation, and recoverability of the associated regulatory assets from customers, when the differences reverse in future periods; the impacts of adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from changes in the tax laws; changes to the creditworthiness of counterparties with which Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy markets and fuel suppliers and transporters;

Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy's ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and non-utility and parent EPS from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.\nThis press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that are reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q.\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, all \"per share\" references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.\nALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION\nEARNINGS SUMMARY (Unaudited)\nThe
