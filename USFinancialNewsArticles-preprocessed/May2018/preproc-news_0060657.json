    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 4:21 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Goldman Sachs vice president charged with insider trading Brendan Pierson 2 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors charged a vice president at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) on Thursday with making more than $130,000 through illegal trades using inside information about companies advised by the investment bank.\nProsecutors said Woojae Jung, a 37-year old South Korean citizen, used confidential information about upcoming transactions he learned through his work for the bank, to trade in companies such as W.R. Grace & Co ( GRA.N ) and Foresight Energy LP ( FELP.N ), according to a criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.\nGoldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment. A lawyer for Jung could not immediately be identified.\nProsecutors said Jung engaged in those trades through a brokerage account in the name of a friend living in South Korea.\nThe insider trading continued until 2017, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested information from Goldman about which employees had access to confidential information about certain transactions, they said.\nFollowing that request, prosecutors said, someone called the brokerage firm whose account was used to make those illegal trades. Using the name of Jungâ€™s friend in Korea, the caller said that the account had been opened using stolen personal information, and he was concerned about the transactions in the account.\nJung is charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. He also faces related civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe SEC has accused Jung of making more than $140,000 through insider trading in 12 companies.
