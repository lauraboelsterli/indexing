    "text": "Spring Grove, Illinois, Head lice infamously cause stress, disgust, and embarrassment for millions of parents whose kids get infested each year. But thanks to the opening of a new Lice Clinics of America clinic, parents in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin no longer have to worry about treating the icky bugs themselves.\nFor Erin Hawn, a case of head lice with her fifth child was a life-changing experience. “My husband and I have four girls and one boy, and when my fifth child was three weeks old, all of us girls had head lice,” she said. “After unsuccessfully battling at home, we stumbled upon Lice Clinics of America and were all lice-free in hours. What a relief!”\n“My husband had always wanted to start a business,” Erin said. “We knew this was it. Six months later we opened our first clinic in Vernon Hills .” The Vernon Hills clinic has been so successful that the couple is opening a second one in Spring Grove.\nLice Clinics of America is the exclusive provider of lice treatment using the FDA-cleared Class I AirAllé ® medical device. clinically proven to kill live lice and more than 99 percent of eggs (nits) using carefully controlled warm air to dehydrate the lice and eggs. Most treatments take about an hour, and the service is guaranteed effective.\nThe battle against head lice has gotten more difficult in recent years as head lice have become immune to the chemical pesticides in the most popular lice products. The most recent study found that so-called “Super Lice” comprise 98 percent of head lice in most states. The pesticides used in lice products have also been linked to developmental and behavioral problems in children.\n“We’re excited to bring this fast, safe, chemical-free service to Spring Grove,” Erin said. “I want every family struggling with head lice to have the same experience I did—to leave our clinic lice-free and totally relieved.”\nLice Clinics of America – Spring Grove is located at 2503 Spring Ridge Rd Suite C1. The clinic is open seven days per week by appointment. The AirAllé device treatment comes with a 30-day guarantee when all family members are treated or screened for head lice.\nThe new clinic is one of more than 350 clinics in the Lice Clinics of America network worldwide. With clinics in more than 33 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences, Inc.\nErin Hawn Lice Clinics of America 815-581-0075 info@liceclinicsspringgrove.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America",
