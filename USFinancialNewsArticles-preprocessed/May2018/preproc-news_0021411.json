FILE PHOTO: Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - April 28, 2018 Williams' Sergey Sirotkin during practice REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili\nThe former champions had sought a review of five incidents at the April 29 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, arguing that significant and relevant new elements had emerged.\nThe stewards unanimously rejected that, however.\nSirotkin had crashed into the back of the Force India driven by Mexican Sergio Perez, who ultimately finished third in a chaotic race in Baku, on the opening lap with the Russian retiring immediately.\nThe stewards said the incident “was not similar to other first lap incidents where cars were side-by-side. The penalty was similar to other penalties for similar collisions and was consistent with the minimum grid penalties given previously.”\nWilliams had questioned the stewards’ decision in relation to other collisions.\nThey had also referenced the response to McLaren’s Fernando Alonso, who was hit on the first lap and limped back to the pits with two punctures before rejoining with a badly-damaged car and finishing seventh.\nThat was one place ahead of Williams’ Canadian teenager Lance Stroll.\nRace director Charlie Whiting, who was present in the meeting convened by teleconference, noted that Alonso returned to the pits while the Safety Car was deployed.\nHe had also taken care to avoid the racing line and keep clear of following traffic.\nThe stewards said Williams were well aware of what was going on at the time.\n“The team on the pit wall would have seen the driver of car 14 (Alonso) enter the pits, as it had to drive past them. Therefore it cannot be argued that this is a ‘new element’,” they declared.\nWilliams had also argued that a 10 second penalty imposed on Haas driver Kevin Magnussen for a collision with Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly was ‘inconsequential’.\nStewards reminded the team that, since 2013, the consequences of penalties were not taken into account.\n“In relation to other penalties, since the beginning of 2016 there have been a total of 87 incidents involving alleged ‘causing a collision’ in the Formula One Championship,” the statement noted.\n“Of these, as a result of the ‘let them race’ policy, 55 have resulted in No Further Action. Fourteen have resulted in 10 second penalties and nine have resulted in three grid position penalties for the next race.\n“Therefore the penalties imposed...were entirely consistent with previous practice and with the penalty guidelines.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond",
