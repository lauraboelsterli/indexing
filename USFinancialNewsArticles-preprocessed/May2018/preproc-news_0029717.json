    "text": "-Founder of Acerta Pharma to lead Complexa as it advances Phase 2 clinical development of lead compound CXA-10 in two orphan indications-\nBERWYN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Complexa Inc., a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the appointment of Francisco D. Salva as the company’s new Chief Executive Officer and President, effective immediately. Mr. Salva has been appointed to build on the company’s progress to date by further advancing the Phase 2 clinical development of its lead compound CXA-10 in two orphan indications, pulmonary arterial hypertension and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. He will also focus on the development of the next-generation of nitrated fatty acid compounds to support the growth of the company.\n“Francisco has a distinguished track record as a leader in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector, with a strong emphasis on finance and operations. During his tenure at Acerta Pharma, he built a company from the ground up, advanced a leading oncology product, and executed on numerous financings and industry deals,” said David Mott, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Complexa. “We look forward to Francisco leading Complexa during this critical time in our growth as we advance our lead compound CXA-10 in Phase 2 clinical development to help patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases.”\n“I am extremely excited about the potential of CXA-10 as a disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. I look forward to joining the Complexa management team, initiating the Phase 2 clinical development of CXA-10 and to finding solutions that will transform the lives of patients suffering from these diseases,” added Mr. Salva.\nMost recently, Mr. Salva served as a Founder and Vice President of Operations for Acerta Pharma B.V., where he focused on key growth initiatives culminating in a $4 billion investment by AstraZeneca for a controlling ownership interest. While at Acerta Pharma, Mr. Salva was responsible for the company’s financial and operational activities. His responsibilities included deal analysis and negotiations, investor relationships, partnership compliance and financings. Prior to Acerta, he was Senior Director of Corporate Development at Pharmacyclics. Earlier in his career, Mr. Salva spent almost a decade as a life sciences venture capitalist at CIBC Capital Partners, INVESCO Funds Group and Patricof & Co. Ventures. He began his career at Wasserstein Perella & Co. Mr. Salva holds dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in Business Economics and Philosophy from Brown University and a Master of Science degree in Economics (Economics and Philosophy specialty) from the London School of Economics and Political Science.\nAbout Complexa\nComplexa Inc. is a patient-focused, science-driven, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of compounds, nitrated fatty acids (NFAs), for the safe and effective treatment of debilitating fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. NFAs have demonstrated broad potential to be effective therapeutic agents in multiple disease indications in which oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and/or direct tissue toxicity play significant roles. This class of molecules has the potential to be disease-modifying in many disorders, given their broad activity. An experienced consortium of investors, including Andera Partners, HBM Healthcare Investments, JAFCO, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Pfizer Venture Investments have committed funding to advance a platform of NFA agents across multiple orphan disease indications. Complexa’s lead candidate, CXA-10, is currently in Phase 2 development for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). For more information, visit www.complexarx.com .\nAbout CXA-10\nCXA-10 is an oral NFA compound which impacts the fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. CXA-10 acts through key reparative, metabolic and inflammatory pathways, including upregulation of Nrf2 pathways and inhibition of Nuclear factor-kappa B and Toll-Like Receptor 4. In addition, CXA-10 increases the expression of heat shock proteins, which act as chaperones during cellular stress, and inhibits xanthine oxidoreductase to reduce oxidative stress. In five Phase 1 clinical trials, CXA-10 demonstrated target engagement at the specific doses for Phase 2, with tolerability and safety in more than 100 subjects. Importantly, CXA-10 has demonstrated impact on relevant biomarkers of CXA-10 pharmacological action as well as inhibition of key biomarkers of disease-related inflammation and fibrosis.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514005595/en/\nSam Brown Inc.\nMike Beyer, 312-961-2502\nmikebeyer@sambrown.com\nSource: Complexa Inc.",
