    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nGecina (Paris:GFC) has acquired, through a privately negotiated deal with an institutional investor, an office building with almost 5,000 sq.m and 70 parking spaces at 8 rue des Graviers in Neuilly-sur-Seine, creating a combined complex of around 20,000 sq.m with the adjacent buildings already owned by the Group. This operation was finalized based on a price of €30.5m including commissions and fees.\nThis acquisition is in line with Gecina’s strategy, aimed at further strengthening its exposure to the Paris Region’s most central sectors, where there are growing signs of a rental market upturn. The acquisition of this building, which is nearly 50% let currently, has created an office complex on Neuilly’s main road and transport link connecting La Défense to Paris’ central business district.\nMéka Brunel, Chief Executive Officer: “This acquisition is perfectly aligned with Gecina’s strategy, thanks to the quality of this building’s location and its effective fit with one of the assets already owned by the Group, aiming to further strengthen Gecina’s exposure to the Paris Region’s most central business sectors, while targeting value creation for our shareholders”.\nGecina, living the city in a different way\nGecina owns, manages and develops property holdings worth 19.6 billion euros at end-2017, with nearly 93% located in the Paris Region.

Gecina has put sustainable innovation at the heart of its strategy to create value, anticipate its customers’ expectations and invest while respecting the environment, thanks to the dedication and expertise of its staff.\nGecina is a French real estate investment trust (SIIC) listed on Euronext Paris, and is part of the SBF 120, CAC Next 20, CAC Large 60, Euronext 100, FTSE4Good, DJSI Europe and World, Stoxx Global ESG Leaders and Vigeo indices.
