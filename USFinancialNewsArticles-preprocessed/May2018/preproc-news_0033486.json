    "text": "Comments\n(Reuters Health) – A rising variety of American dad and mom are utilizing marijuana once they nonetheless have kids residing at dwelling, in response to a brand new examine that implies hashish could also be complicating efforts to restrict children’ publicity to second-hand smoke. FILE PHOTO – A person smokes marijuana throughout a rally for the legalization of marijuana in Toronto, April 20, 2010. REUTERS/Mark Blinch\nResearchers examined information collected from 169,259 U.S. adults from 2002 to 2015. During that point, the proportion of fogeys with kids at dwelling who mentioned they used hashish no less than as soon as previously month rose from 4.9 % to six.eight %.\nOver that very same interval, the proportion of fogeys with children at dwelling who smoked cigarettes declined from 27.6 % to 20.2 %, the examine additionally discovered.\n“While cigarette smoking continues to decline among parents with children living at home, use of cannabis is increasing among parents and this may as a result lead to an increase in children’s exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke,” mentioned lead examine creator Renee Goodwin of the Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy on the City University of New York.\nThe improve in hashish use seemed to be “disproportionately common among cigarette smoking parents,” Goodwin mentioned by e mail. “Therefore we may be seeing an increase in exposure to multiple types of smoke/increased amount of smoke in a growing percentage of households with this increase in cannabis use.”\nWith some types of marijuana now authorized in about 30 U.S. states, concern is mounting within the medical group that many individuals could falsely assume the drug is innocent and fail to acknowledge the potential harms to kids who breathe second-hand smoke.\n“Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of asthma and many other health risks for children,” Goodwin mentioned. “There have been tremendous public health campaigns aimed at decreasing cigarette use overall and at reducing children’s exposure to secondhand smoke from cigarettes, but no clinical or public health effort has been made to educate or inform the public about risks of secondhand cannabis smoke.”\nCannabis use was nearly 4 occasions extra widespread amongst dad and mom who additionally smoked cigarettes than amongst non-smokers, the present examine discovered.\nAmong people who smoke, the proportion of fogeys who reported utilizing hashish previously month elevated from 11 % to 17.Four % through the examine interval, researchers report in Pediatrics.\nFor non-smokers, the proportion of fogeys who used hashish previously month additionally rose, from 2.Four % to Four %.\nDaily hashish use additionally climbed through the examine interval, and was extra widespread amongst cigarette people who smoke.\nAt the identical time, the proportion of fogeys who mentioned they prevented each cigarettes and hashish additionally elevated.\nThe examine wasn’t a managed experiment designed to show whether or not or how cigarette smoking would possibly affect hashish use. Another disadvantage is that researchers relied on dad and mom to precisely recall and report any tobacco or hashish use.\nEven so, the findings underscore how legalization of hashish in lots of U.S. states could mirror and reinforce extra permissive attitudes about marijuana use, mentioned Ashley Brooks-Russell, creator of an accompanying editorial and a researcher on the Colorado School of Public Health on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n“Cannabis legalization has increased the accessibility of cannabis for adults and removed many penalties for use,” Brooks-Russell mentioned by e mail. “It is possible these laws also convey a sense the product is safe, or at least safer than it once was perceived.”\nWhen dad and mom with younger children at dwelling do select to make use of hashish, they need to take precautions to do it when kids aren’t round, Brooks-Russell suggested.\n“If parents use cannabis, not only are they potentially modeling that behavior but they are likely making cannabis products more accessible in the home which could lead to either unintentional ingestion (e.g., poisonings) among younger children, or intentional experimentation and use among older children,” Brooks-Russell mentioned.\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2GfHJI9 Pediatrics, on-line May 14, 2018.
