    "text": "May 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel a planned summit with North Korea’s leader is surprising and could heighten uncertainty that U.S. businesses have over U.S. government policy decisions, a top U.S. central bank official said on Thursday.\n“I think it’s going to be a surprise to everybody. It was a surprise to me - I didn’t know that this was even a possibility,” Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC shortly after the White House announced the decision.\n“It will have implications from a certainty-uncertainty perspective,” Bostic added. “There is just a lot that the business leaders that I talk to don’t know about where policy is going to be and where it is going to land. And I think this has the potential to add to that, in that these geo-political risks really do have implications for how business will take place.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
