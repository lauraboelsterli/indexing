French telecoms operator Iliad also won a lot, for the first time of its history.\nTwo lots were still unattributed as of Tuesday.\n“We’re well aware that what happened today will represent a turning point,” Quillot told reporters.\n“(Canal Plus) bid for each of the seven lots, and for each of these lots, it was outbid by someone who had a better offer.”\nMediapro will create a dedicated channel from scratch to broadcast the soccer matches, Quillot said.\nIt will have the right to sublicense the rights, an option that was made possible by the soccer association to “free up the minds and budgets,” he said.\nMediapro will therefore have the possibility to sign up distribution deals with telecom and satellite operators. The French unit of telecoms operator Altice might be one of them.\nCanal+ said in a statement it would consider this option. Its chief executive said it would also consider taking legal action to challenge the results.\nDebt-ridden Altice, which won the much coveted broadcasting rights for the Champions League up to 2021 in France, did not take part in this auction, Quillot said.\nThe group pledged to focus on repaying its debt last year to appease investors and has abandoned its previous strategy of offering exclusive content to its subscribers to drive growth.
