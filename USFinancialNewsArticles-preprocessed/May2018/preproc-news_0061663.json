    "text": "TORONTO, May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ether Capital Corporation (“ETHC” or the “Company”) (NEO:ETHC) announces the reporting of its financial results as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (the “First Quarter Results”). The Company’s unaudited consolidated interim financial statements, along with the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis have been filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) and may be viewed under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com .\nThe Company’s First Quarter Results relate to the period prior to completion of its reverse takeover transaction with Ethereum Capital Inc. (“Ethereum Capital”), when the Company operated as Movit Media Corp. (“Movit”). Movit had no commercial activity during the three months ended March 31, 2018, however was actively working with Ethereum Capital to complete and meet all the requirements to effect the previously announced reverse takeover transaction (the “Transaction”).\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, the Company completed the Transaction pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ethereum Capital by way of a three-cornered amalgamation. In connection with the Transaction, the Company delisted its common shares from the TSX Venture Exchange, listed its common shares for trading on the Aequitas NEO Exchange and changed its name to Ether Capital Corporation. In conjunction with the completion of the Transaction, gross proceeds of $45 million from Ethereum Capital’s private placement offering of 18,000,000 subscription receipts were released from escrow.\n“With the filing of these financial statements, the Company has now fully transitioned into Ether Capital’s business of becoming the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem,” said Som Seif, Chairman and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Ether Capital. “In addition to owning a substantial amount of Ether, the Company is pursuing a number of promising projects and opportunities which we are excited to share with investors in due course,” continued Mr. Seif.\nOn May 11, 2018, ETHC announced that it completed its initial investment in Ether, purchasing a total of 42,587 Ether tokens at an average cost of C$882 (US$687), representing approximately 90% of the Company’s total available capital.\nThe Company provides regularly updated disclosure of its Ether holdings in the investors section of its website, available at http://ethcap.co/ .\nAbout Ether Capital Corporation\nEther Capital is a Toronto-based technology company whose objective is to become the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem. Ether Capital holds Ethereum’s native utility token “Ether” as a strategic asset and will selectively invest in or acquire Ethereum-based businesses.
