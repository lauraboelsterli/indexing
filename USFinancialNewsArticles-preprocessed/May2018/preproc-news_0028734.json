These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from expectations, including, but not limited to, comScore's ability to achieve its expected strategic, financial and operational plans. For additional discussion of risk factors, please refer to comScore's respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings that comScore makes from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which are available on the SEC's website ( www.sec.gov ).\nInvestors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. comScore does not intend or undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or new information after the date of this press release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we are disclosing herein non-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, as they permit our investors to view our core business performance using the same metrics that management uses to evaluate our performance. Nevertheless, our use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Instead, you should consider these measures alongside GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income (loss), various cash flow metrics, and our other GAAP financial results.\nSet forth below are reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations should be carefully evaluated.\nCOMSCORE, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n67,266\n$\n37,859\nRestricted cash\n7,564\n7,266\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $1,779 and $1,991, respectively ($1,487 and $2,899 of accounts receivable attributable to related parties)\n70,902\n82,029\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n15,581\n15,168\nInsurance recoverable on litigation settlements\n37,232\n37,232\n198,545\n179,554\nProperty and equipment, net\n26,894\n28,893\nOther non-current assets\n8,106\n7,259\nDeferred tax assets\n4,252\n4,532\nIntangible assets, net\n151,275\n159,777\nGoodwill\n643,006\n642,424\nTotal assets\n$\n1,032,078\n$\n1,022,439\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable ($227 and $2,715 attributable to related parties)\n$\n26,223\n$\n27,889\nAccrued expenses ($1,442 and $5,857 attributable to related parties)\n68,966\n86,031\nAccrued litigation settlements\n27,447\n27,718\nOther current liabilities\n9,428\n10,485\nDeferred revenue ($2,386 and $2,755 attributable to related parties)\n96,388\n98,367\nFinancing derivatives, current\n4,100\n—\n232,552\n250,490\nFinancing derivatives\n11,020\n—\nSenior secured convertible notes\n126,246\n—\nDeferred tax liabilities\n4,259\n3,641\nAccrued litigation settlements\n90,800\n90,800\nOther non-current liabilities\n18,458\n21,016\nTotal liabilities\n483,335\n365,947\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value per share; 5,000,000 shares authorized at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017; no shares issued or outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\n—\n—\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value per share; 100,000,000 shares authorized as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017; 60,382,466 shares issued and 55,017,670 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018 and 60,053,843 shares issued and 57,289,047 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017, respectively\n60\n60\nAdditional paid-in capital\n1,414,109\n1,407,717\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(4,609)\n(6,224)\nAccumulated deficit\n(661,277)\n(609,091)\nTreasury stock, at cost, 5,364,796 and 2,764,796 shares as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively\n(199,540)\n(135,970)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n548,743\n656,492\n stockholders' equity\n$\n1,032,078\n$\n1,022,439\nCOMSCORE, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues (1)\n$\n105,919\n$\n100,861\nCost of revenues (1) (2) (3)\n47,254\n47,313\nSelling and marketing (1) (2) (3)\n25,905\n29,733\nResearch and development (1) (2) (3)\n18,716\n21,020\nGeneral and administrative (1) (2) (3)\n18,661\n17,785\nInvestigation and audit related (1)\n31,867\n17,678\nAmortization of intangible assets\n8,544\n8,735\nSettlement of litigation, net\n—\n1,533\nRestructuring\n1,257\n—\nTotal expenses from operations\n152,204\n143,797\nLoss from operations\n(46,285)\n(42,936)\nInterest expense, net (1)\n(2,905)\n(154)\nOther income, net\n77\n3,184\nLoss from foreign currency transactions\n(922)\n(20)\nLoss before income taxes\n(50,035)\n(39,926)\nIncome tax provision\n(1,415)\n(866)\nNet loss\n$\n(51,450)\n$\n(40,792)\nNet loss per common share:\nBasic\n$\n(0.93)\n$\n(0.71)\nDiluted\n(0.93)\n(0.71)\nWeighted-average number of shares used in per share calculation -
