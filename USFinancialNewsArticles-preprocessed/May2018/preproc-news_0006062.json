    "text": "Apple reported quarterly earnings and revenue on Tuesday that beat expectations, but sold fewer iPhones than expected.\nThe soft iPhone sales were still up from a year ago , and Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that customers \"chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter.\"\nShares rose as much 5 percent after hours.\nEarnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.67, adjusted, expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $61.1 billion vs. $60.82 billion expected by Thomson Reuters consensus iPhone unit sales: 52.2 million vs. 52.54 million expected by a StreetAccount estimate Fiscal Q3 revenue guidance: $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion vs. $51.61 billion expected by Thomson Reuters consensus Wall Street reads between the lines on iPhone X, China sales While Apple's iPhone shares were slightly softer than expected, the company managed to make more money than forecast with its services business, and offered Wall Street a generous $100 billion capital return program.\nThe after-hours stock rally showed Wall Street's relief, after a gloom-and-doom outlook going into the earnings report.\nApple's new approach to its flagship phone has made it harder than usual to gauge the company's success. Last fall, the company released three new flagship phones, instead of the usual two. It also released a smart speaker, the HomePod, early this year.\nThese product releases have put the company's future plans into question, bringing scrutiny to its revenue guidance for the fiscal third quarter. But the company gave sales guidance on the high end of expectations.\nThe company has also faced fierce competition in China, a massive market that has homegrown superstars like Huawei and Xiaomi. But Cook noted in the release Apple grew revenue in all of our geographic segments, with over 20 percent growth in Greater China and Japan.\nApple historically doesn't report sales of individual product generations or countries.\nStill, Apple's market capitalization remains the highest in any public market, amid optimism around tax cuts and major share buybacks.The company has announced plans to invest in advanced manufacturing in the U.S. and add a new campus. It also has ambitious plans to expand its software and services, and has expanded its reach in content, education and retail.\nApple's capital return program may have pleased investors but it left slightly less money for those new initiatives (even though Apple's cash pile is still giant.) Apple's cash on hand fell to $267.2 billion in the March 2018 quarter, the lowest total since June .\nApple also recently released a new high-end desktop and a new entry-level iPad. Apple sold 9.1 million iPads, in line with StreetAccount's 9.17 million estimate. And it sold 4.08 million Mac computers, just shy of StreetAccount's 4.14 million forecast.\nApple's EPS results have now beaten consensus 20 of the past 21 quarters .\nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
