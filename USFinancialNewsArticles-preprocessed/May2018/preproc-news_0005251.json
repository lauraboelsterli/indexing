    "text": "LAS VEGAS, May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Red Rock Resorts, Inc. (\"Red Rock Resorts,\" \"we\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:RRR) today reported financial results ended March 31, 2018. The Company has adopted FASB’s new revenue recognition standard (“ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2018. Certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASC 606, with no material impact on operating income, net income or Adjusted EBITDA (1) .\nNet revenues were $421.0 million of 2018, a decrease of 1.1%, or $4.7 million, from $425.7 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to ongoing construction disruption at Palace Station Hotel & Casino (“Palace Station”) and the Palms Casino Resort (the “Palms”) and a decrease in Native American management fees.\nNet income was $82.1 million of 2018, an increase of $36.7 million from net income of $45.4 million for the same period of 2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $13.3 million after-tax gain associated with the extinguishment of a tax receivable liability, as well as a $14.3 million after-tax positive change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $140.1 million of 2018, an increase of 2.9% from $136.2 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Las Vegas operations, partially offset by a decrease in Native American management fees.\nLas Vegas Operations\nNet revenues from Las Vegas operations were $395.2 million of 2018, a 0.2% increase from $394.2 million in the same period of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA from Las Vegas operations was $125.9 million of 2018, a 4.2% increase from $120.9 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-disrupted Las Vegas operations, partially offset by substantial construction disruption at Palace Station and the Palms.\nNative American Management\nAdjusted EBITDA from Native American operations was $22.1 million of 2018, a 5.2% decrease from $23.3 million in the same period of 2017, due to the expiration of the Gun Lake management agreement in February of 2018.\nPalace Station and Palms Redevelopment Update\nThe Palace Station redevelopment project remains on schedule and the budget remains unchanged. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $116 million in costs against that $191 million project. The Palace Station project is expected to be completed in phases by the end of 2018.\nThe Palms redevelopment project remains on schedule and the budget remains unchanged. The final elements of phase one of the project will be open later this month, with components of phase two expected to open through the second quarter of 2019, and phase three of the project expected to open by the fourth quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has incurred $152 million in costs against that $620 million project.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 were $179.2 million and total principal amount of debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $2.68 billion. The Company’s debt to Adjusted EBITDA and interest coverage ratios, were 5.0x and 4.6x, respectively.\nQuarterly Dividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per Class A common share for the second quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on June 29, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nPrior to the payment of such dividend, Station Holdco LLC (“Station Holdco”) will make a cash distribution to all unit holders of record, including the Company, of $0.10 per unit for a total distribution of approximately $11.6 million, approximately $6.9 million of which is expected to be distributed to the Company and approximately $4.7 million of which is expected to be distributed to the other unit holders of record of Station Holdco.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.
