(NASDAQ: IRWD), a commercial biotech company, today announced that, based on the vote count following the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders voted to re-elect all three of Ironwood’s director nominees: Lawrence Olanoff, M.D., Ph.D., Amy Schulman and Douglas Williams, Ph.D.\nCommenting on the results, Ironwood issued the following statement:\nOn behalf of the entire Ironwood Board of Directors and management team, we thank our shareholders for their valuable insights and support over these past several weeks. We look forward to continuing to engage with our shareholders as we seek to deliver on our 2018 goals and to execute on our intent to separate Ironwood into two focused and durable businesses each with substantial opportunity for long-term growth and value creation.\nAbout Ironwood Pharmaceuticals\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IRWD) is a commercial biotechnology company focused on creating medicines that make a difference for patients, building value for our fellow shareholders, and empowering our passionate team. We are commercializing two innovative primary care products: linaclotide, the U.S. branded prescription market leader for adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), and lesinurad, which is approved to be taken with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), or as a fixed-dose combination with allopurinol, for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout. We are also advancing a pipeline of innovative product candidates in areas of significant unmet need, including uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetic nephropathy, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, achalasia and sickle cell disease. Ironwood was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
