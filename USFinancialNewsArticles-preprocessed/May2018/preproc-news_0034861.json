    "text": "Xbox This Is How Microsoft's New Xbox Adaptive Controller Works The new Microsoft Xbox One S console is announced during the Microsoft Xbox news conference at the E3 Gaming Conference on June 13, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. Photograph by Kevork Djansezian — Getty Images By Emily Price 2:41 PM EDT\nMicrosoft is launching a new Xbox Adaptive Controller for its gaming console designed specifically to meet the needs of players with disabilities.\nGamers with disabilities have previously required custom solutions for controllers, which require a good deal of technical expertise to create and can be cost prohibitive to would-be players.\nThe Xbox Adaptive Controller has two large buttons on its face, which can be operated with hands but are also large enough for players to control them with their elbows or feet as well.\nThe rear of the adaptive controller has a row of 3.5mm ports for adding inputs and buttons to represent features on the traditional controller and to give a player a personalized experience tailored to them. For instance, a player might add on a foot pedal or other touch-sensitive switch to give the device more functionality. The Xbox Adaptive Controller welcomes more gamers to Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs.

It also has an optional power supply to accommodate add-ons, such as mouth-operated quadsticks used by quadriplegic players who can “sip and puff” to draw a significant amount of power. The controller is also compatible with Windows 10 PCs.\nThe Xbox Adaptive Controller will launch later this year for $99 and will be available through Microsoft’s digital stores.
