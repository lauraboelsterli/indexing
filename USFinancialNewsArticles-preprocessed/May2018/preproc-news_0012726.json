They were determined to find a middle ground,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, of the meetings between the French and Iranian presidents.\n\"But if the U.S. is not part of the deal, then there really is no deal,\" Yawger said.\nNetanyahu will make a televized announcement at 1:00 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) in what his office said would be a \"significant development\" regarding the nuclear agreement with Iran.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran that were lifted after a 2015 international agreement over its nuclear program.\nOil prices have risen this month to their highest since late 2014, driven by concern over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows, but analysts said the market is extremely sensitive to any developments on the nuclear deal and sanctions due to the high degree of uncertainty.\n\"Until May 12, you're not going to see any significant downward correction,\" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. \"Reimposing U.S. sanctions is not a foregone conclusion just yet.\"\nU.S. drillers added five oil rigs in the week to April 27, bringing the total count to 825, the highest since March 2015, General Electric's Baker Hughes energy services firm said.\nCrude production in the United States has hit a record 10.59 million barrels per day. <C-OUT-T-EIA>\nAnd in the latest development in the U.S. shale boom, Marathon Petroleum Corp agreed to buy rival Andeavor for more than $23 billion. The largest-ever tie-up between U.S. refiners will give the combined company a nationwide presence and increased access to growing export markets.\nThe deal gives Marathon more exposure to U.S. shale, thanks to Andeavor's existing logistics and terminal operations in Texas and North Dakota shale regions.
