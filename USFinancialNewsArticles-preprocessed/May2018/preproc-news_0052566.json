    "text": "There was no shortage of criticism aimed at the Golden State Warriors following their Game 2 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. And leading the way was Draymond Green’s mom.\nMay 16, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green (23) and guard Stephen Curry (30) play for the rebound in front of Houston Rockets center Clint Capela (15) during the second half in game two of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports And not even her own son was immune.\nThroughout the game, won by the host Rockets 127-105 to even the Western Conference finals at 1-1, Mary Babers tweeted things any fan would call out, such as “TRAP GAME!” ... “Okay they have the momentum... LETS GO DUBS!” ... and “ hits the ground.. garbage foul!”\nThen Green’s mother had some more choice words aimed at the team:\n“I could have stay in the room and watched @EMPIRE & @STAR!”\n“18-point game. Warriors are rattled. Seen this movie”\nAt one point, she tweeted that Green himself needed to get more involved or get out of the game:\n“DANG DAYDAY SHOT THE DANG BALL OR SIT DOWN!” But her most critical comments came after the game, and were aimed at her son’s teammate, Kevin Durant.\nDurant scored a game-high 38 points — and needed only 22 shots to get there. But Babers was more focused on the fact that only one other Warriors player scored in double figures (Steph Curry with 16).\nWhen someone tweeted to point out Durant had good numbers, “he took every damn shot,” Babers replied with “Straight ISO!”\nWhen someone else pointed out that Durant “took 22 shots and had 38. Sounds like a good game to me. The problem was everybody else,” she had a reply for that, as well:\n“What you talking about? It’s more to a game than shots! It left everyone else standing around never to get into position. SWING THE BALL. Pass the ball & around the 7 second mark take the shot(not at the 21 second mark). ISO ISO ISO! They beat us at our own game!,” she tweeted.\nThe good news for the Warriors is that they took care of business in Game 1, taking home-court advantage away from Houston.\nGame 3 will be Sunday at 3 p.m. ET in Oakland, Calif.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
