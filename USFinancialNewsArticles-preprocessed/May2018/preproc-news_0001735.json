    "text": "Published: May 2, 2018 5:19 p.m. ET Share\nMark Pincusâ€™s voting control reduced to about 10% from 70% Getty Images Mark Pincus, founder of Zynga, attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Idaho in 2017.\nBy Austen Hufford\nSocial and mobile-game maker Zynga Inc. is moving to a single-class stock structure, diminishing the control of its founder as other technology companies maintain systems that give insiders extra voting power.\nThe company said Wednesday that former Chief Executive Mark Pincus would convert his extra voting shares into Class A shares, reducing his voting control to about 10% from 70% previously. Pincus is also moving to become nonexecutive chairman from his executive chairman role, Zynga said. Shares in Zynga ZNGA, +3.41% rose 1.4% in after-hours trading.\nCompanies use multiple share-class structures to give founders and early investors more control when they go public, even while allowing them to partially cash out. Typically, the public has access to one type of shares while insiders hold another type that has more voting power.\nCorporate governance advocates as well as some investors and index managers have pushed back on dual-class structures. At Zynga, which made its public market debut in December 2011, Class C shares had 70 votes a share and Class B shares had seven votes a share while Class A shares had one vote a share.",
