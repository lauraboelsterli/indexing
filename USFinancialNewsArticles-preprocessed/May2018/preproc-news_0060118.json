    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) today announced that Mitul Modi has joined the firm as senior client partner and chief commercial officer in the Healthcare advisory practice. He is based in the San Francisco office.\nMr. Modi joins Korn Ferry from a global talent firm, where he built and led their Healthcare executive search practice across the Middle East. Here he was responsible for executing and delivering over 600 C-suite searches across Healthcare Providers, Pharmaceutical and Life Sciences, Healthcare Professional Services and Healthcare Regulation. Part of the leadership team that successfully navigated the business through two acquisitions, Mr. Modi was directly involved with the integration of the businesses and the subsequent building of the Healthcare go to market proposition. Mr. Modi moved to the US in March 2016 and was more recently senior vice president of Physician Solutions, the organizations’ Physician RPO offering.\nHaving worked in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and now the US, Mr. Modi brings to the firm deep expertise in the international healthcare landscape as well as helping clients define, strategize and manage complex talent initiatives. He has a strong background in change management and business leadership.\nPreviously, Mr. Modi was based in London, leading the Commerce and Industry sector for a multi-specialism recruitment company. With full P&L responsibility Mr. Modi turned around a failing business by successfully restructuring the team and re-focusing the entire go to market strategy for the UK.\nPrior to that, Mr. Modi was a founder and commercial director for a UK based specialist recruitment consultancy with offices in Manchester, Leeds and London.\n“With nearly two decades of executive search experience, Mitul is a proven business developer and accomplished thought leader. His deep expertise in building comprehensive healthcare solutions and his strategic approach will be of great benefit to our clients and the firm,” said Greg Button, President, Global Healthcare Services, Korn Ferry. “I look forward to him joining our advisory team.”\nMr. Modi earned a Bachelor of Arts, with honors, in Economics and Social Policy from the University of Manchester.\nAbout Korn Ferry\nKorn Ferry is a global organizational consulting firm.
