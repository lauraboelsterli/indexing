    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Support.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPRT), a leading provider of tech support and turnkey support center services, producer of SUPERAntiSpyware® anti-malware products, and the maker of Support.com® software, today reported unaudited financial results for its first quarter\n“The company’s continued investment during the first quarter in driving growth opportunities for the balance of the fiscal year adversely impacted our financial performance relative to the prior two quarters,” said Rick Bloom, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the company, “This investment included costs associated with recruiting and training highly-skilled tech support agents for several of our major customers, as well as continuing to re-align our market-leading Support.com software offerings with our chat and live agent capabilities.”\nMr. Bloom continued, “The investments made in the first quarter are expected to boost longer term profits and cash flow. These investments are likely to continue as long as the opportunities for growth are still present.”\n“Our growth strategy remains focused on our unique combination of highly-skilled tech support agents and market-leading Support.com software offerings, as we believe these enable us to provide high quality customer support in a very cost efficient manner,” shared Mr. Bloom.\nQ1 2018 Financial Summary\nFor the first quarter of 2018, total revenue was $16.5 million, up 16 percent compared to revenues of $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and up 1.4 percent compared to revenues of $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, we recorded a net loss for the first quarter of 2018 of $(0.8) million, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a loss of $(1.3) million, or $(0.07) per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and a loss of $(0.3) million, or $(0.02) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, we recorded a net loss in the first quarter of 2018 of $(0.4) million, or $(0.02) per share, compared to a loss of $(1.2) million, or $(0.06) per share, in the first quarter of 2017 and income of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 included $0.02 million in primarily legal expenses not associated with normal business operations. This compares with $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, both primarily legal expenses.\nKey changes in our non-GAAP net income/(loss) included the following:\nGross profit decreased by $0.7 million in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2017, and was down $0.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our gross profit margin declined by 6.8 percentage points compared with the same quarter of 2017 and was down 3.7 percentage points relative to the third quarter of 2017. The decline from the fourth quarter reflected additional recruiting and training costs as we grow business with our major customers. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $3.1 million, lower by $1.3 million (29 percent) than the $4.3 million of operating expenses in the first quarter of 2017 but higher by $0.3 million (11 percent) than the $2.8 million of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our lower operating expenses as compared with the year-ago quarter reflects the impact of our cost saving initiatives during 2017, which included operational efficiencies, tighter fiscal controls on headcount and spending, and the renegotiation of certain vendor agreements.\nNon-GAAP income/(loss) excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and a one-time tax expense. Collectively, these items impacted income/(loss) from continuing operations by $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (including $0.5 million related to a one-time tax expense on foreign earnings and profits). A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is presented in the tables below.\nBalance Sheet Information\nAt March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $47.6 million, compared to $50.8 million at March 31, 2017 and $49.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal assets as of March 31, 2018 were $62.5 million and total shareholders’ equity was $55.9 million.\nSupport.com will not host a conference call discussing the Company’s first quarter results.

Forward-looking statements include, for example, all statements relating to expected financial performance (including without limitation statements involving growth and projections of revenue, margin, profitability, income (loss) from continuing operations, income (loss) per share from continuing operations, cash usage or generation, cash balance as of any future date, capital structure and other financial items); the plans and objectives of management for future operations, customer relationships, products, services or investments; personnel matters; and future performance in economic and other terms. Such are based on current expectations that involve a number of uncertainties and risks that may cause actual events or results to those indicated by such , including, among others, our ability to retain and grow major programs, our ability to expand and diversify our customer base, our ability to market and sell our Support.com Cloud (formerly “Nexus®”) software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering, our ability to maintain and grow revenue, our ability to successfully develop new products and services, our ability to manage our workforce, our ability to operate in markets that are subject to extensive regulations, such as support for home security systems, our ability to control expenses and achieve desired margins, our dependence on a small number of customers and partners, our ability to attract, train and retain talented employees, potential intellectual property, class action or other litigation, our ability to utilize and realize the value of our net operating loss carryforwards and how they could be substantially limited or permanently impaired, given our current market capitalization and cash position, our ability to execute the cost reduction program involving the planned actions on the expected schedule, our ability to achieve the cost savings expected in connection with the cost reduction plan, the ultimate effect of any such cost reductions on our financial results, and our ability to manage the effects of the cost reduction plan on our workforce and other operations. These and other risks may be detailed from time to time in Support.com’s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and its latest Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained from www.sec.gov . Support.com assumes no obligation to update its , except as may otherwise be required by the federal securities laws.\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSupport.com excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and other, restructuring charges and tax expense on foreign earnings and profits from its GAAP results, in order to determine the non-GAAP financial measures of income (loss) from continuing operations and income (loss) from continuing operations per share, as described in A through D below. We believe that the non-GAAP measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP results, assist investors in understanding our results of operations.\nA. Stock-based compensation expense. Management excludes stock-based compensation expense when evaluating its performance from period to period because such expenses do not require cash settlement and because such expenses are not used by management to assess the performance of the Company’s business. Stock-based compensation expense was $376,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $90,000 in the first quarter of 2017 and $135,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nB. Amortization of intangible assets. The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle; therefore, management excludes acquisition-related intangible asset amortization and related charges when evaluating its operating performance. Amortization of intangible assets was zero in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10,000 in the first quarter of 2017 and zero in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nC. Tax expenses on foreign earnings and profits. Following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, Management reviewed the company’s investments in its foreign subsidiaries under ASC 740-30-25. Based on this review, the company changed its assertion regarding its investment in Support.com India Private Ltd which resulted in the company accruing $543,000 for a one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 on our previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits. No expenses were recorded in the first quarters of 2018 or 2017 related to this item.\nThe Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures have significant limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, the exclusion of the items indicated above from the non-GAAP financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by management that such items will not be incurred in subsequent periods.\nSUPPORT.COM, INC.\nGAAP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited) March 31,\n2018 (1)\nDecember 31,\n2017 Assets Current assets: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 47,571 $ 49,233 Accounts receivable, net 11,715 11,951 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 957 802 Total current assets 60,243 61,986 Property and equipment, net 1,148 1,133 Intangible assets, net 250 250 Other assets 820 984 Total assets $ 62,461 $ 64,353 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued compensation $ 2,751 $ 3,661 Other accrued liabilities 1,358 1,330 Short-term deferred revenue 1,681 2,006 Total current liabilities 5,790 6,997 Long-term deferred revenue - 13 Other long-term liabilities 749 885 Total liabilities 6,539 7,895 Stockholders' equity: Common stock 2 2 Additional paid-in-capital 268,233 267,857 Treasury stock (5,297 ) (5,297 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (2,254 ) (2,108 ) Accumulated deficit (204,762 ) (203,996 ) Total stockholders' equity 55,922 56,458 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 62,461 $ 64,353 Note 1: Amounts are subject to completion of management’s customary closing and review procedures.\nSUPPORT.COM, INC.\nGAAP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\n(1)\nDecember 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Revenue: Services $ 15,200 $ 14,926 $ 12,915 Software and other 1,322 1,366 1,375 Total revenue 16,522 16,292 14,290 Cost of revenue: Cost of services (2) 14,111 13,341 11,211 Cost of software and other (2) 55 35 94 Total cost of revenue 14,166 13,376 11,305 Gross profit 2,356 2,916 2,985 Operating expenses: Research and development (2) 711 604 923 Sales and marketing (2) 550 414 807 General and administrative (2) 2,146 1,849 2,616 Amortization of intangible assets and other - - 10 Total operating expenses 3,407 2,867 4,356 Income (loss) from operations (1,051 ) 49 (1,371 ) Interest income and other, net 205 192 133 Income (loss) before income taxes (846 ) 241 (1,238 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (80 ) 547 48 Net loss $ (766 ) $ (306 ) $ (1,286 ) Net loss per share (3) Basic $ (0.04 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.07 ) Diluted $ (0.04 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.07 ) Shares used in computing per share amounts: (3) Basic 18,720 18,720\n18,557 Diluted 18,720 18,720\n18,557 Note 2: Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Cost of revenue: Cost of services $ 21 $ 26 $ 42 Cost of software and other - 1 3 Operating expenses: Research and development 14 16 41 Sales and marketing 19 25 7 General and administrative 323 67 (3 ) Total $ 377 $ 135 $ 90 Note 3: On January 20, 2017, the Company implemented a 1-for-3 reverse stock split.

The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and other, restructuring charges and tax expense associated international earnings and profits. The Company believes that presentation of these non-GAAP items provides meaningful supplemental information to investors, when viewed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the Company’s GAAP results. However, the non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See the text of this press release for more information on non-GAAP financial measures. 2018 amounts are subject to completion of management’s customary closing and review procedures.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006548/en/\nSupport.com\nDean Morris, +1 650-556-8574\nInvestor Relations\nDean.Morris@support.com\nSource: Support.com, Inc.",
