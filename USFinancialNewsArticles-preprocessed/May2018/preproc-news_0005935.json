    "text": "NEW YORK, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KCAP Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq GS:KCAP) (the “Company”) announces its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet investment income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $2.5 million, or $0.07 per basic share, compared with approximately $3.2 million, or $0.09 per basic share in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nTaxable distributable income for the quarter was $0.06 per basic share.\nThe Company declared a first quarter shareholder distribution of $0.10 per share.\nAt March 31, 2018, the fair value of KCAP's investments totaled approximately $282 million.\nNet asset value per share of $4.85 as of March 31, 2018, compared with $4.87 at December 31, 2017.\nDayl Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of KCAP Financial, Inc., noted, “The first quarter saw us continue on the trajectory we articulated late in 2017. During the quarter, we put excess cash to work at KCAP and in our joint venture. In addition, our new Revolving Credit Facility, which closed in the first quarter, will give KCAP significant additional liquidity to continue to grow the investment portfolio.”\nOperating Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we reported total investment income of approximately $6.8 million as compared to approximately $7.8 million in the same period last year. Investment income from debt securities decreased to approximately $3.8 million from approximately $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Investment income on CLO fund securities in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $1.9 million from $3.1 million in 2017. We received a distribution from our Asset Manager Affiliates of $820,000 in the first quarter of 2018, $500,000 of which was a return of capital. The Asset Manager Affiliates distributed $650,000 in the first quarter of 2017, all of which was a return of capital.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total expenses were lower by approximately $191,000 as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense partially offset by higher professional fees.\nNet investment income 2018 and 2017 was approximately $2.5 million and $3.2 million, or $0.07 and $0.09 per basic share, respectively. Net realized and unrealized gains on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $318,000, compared to net realized and unrealized loss of approximately $2.8 million for the same period in 2017.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nThe fair value of our portfolio was approximately $282 million as of March 31, 2018. The composition of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 at cost and fair value was as follows:\nMarch 31, 2018 (unaudited) December 31, 2017 Security Type Cost/Amortized\nCost Fair Value %¹ Cost/Amortized\nCost Fair Value %¹ Short-term investments² $ 9,905,719 $ 9,905,719 4 $ 77,300,320 $ 77,300,320 26 Senior Secured Loan 56,195,353 52,989,838 18 48,337,900 44,960,146 14 Junior Secured Loan 80,066,631 75,858,237 27 62,561,913 58,941,300 19 Senior Unsecured Loan 35,777,283 35,777,283 13 12,777,283 12,777,283 4 Senior Secured Bond 1,501,366 1,490,400 1 1,502,374 1,518,750 - CLO Fund Securities 61,300,443 40,768,620 14 72,339,032 51,678,673 17 Equity Securities 10,571,007 4,478,280 2 10,571,007 4,414,684 1 Asset Manager Affiliates³ 52,091,230 38,663,000 14 52,591,230 38,849,000 12 Joint Venture 24,914,858 21,767,376 7 24,914,858 21,516,000 7 Total $ 332,323,890 $ 281,698,753 100 % $ 362,895,917 $ 311,956,156 100 % ¹ Represents percentage of total portfolio at fair value. ² Includes money market accounts and U.S. treasury bills. ³ Represents the equity investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash and money market balances of approximately $11.8 million, total assets of approximately $291 million and stockholders' equity of approximately $181 million. Our net asset value per common share was $4.85. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $104.2 million (par value) of borrowings outstanding ($100.2 million net of capitalized costs) with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.1%.\nSubject to prevailing market conditions, we intend to grow our portfolio of assets by raising additional capital, including through the prudent use of leverage available to us. As a result, we may seek to enter into new agreements with other lenders or into other financing arrangements as market conditions permit. Such financing arrangements may include a new secured and/or unsecured credit facility or the issuance of unsecured debt or preferred stock.\nDistributions\nGenerally, we seek to fund distributions to shareholders from current distributable earnings, primarily from net interest and dividend income generated by our investment portfolio and any distributions from our Asset Manager Affiliates. However, a portion of distributions paid to shareholders may be a return of capital. We announced a regular quarterly distribution of $0.10 per share 2018. The record date for this distribution was April 6, 2018 and the distribution was paid on April 27, 2018. An estimate of the tax attributes of distributions made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full year. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year.\nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of distributions in shares of our common stock, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, shareholders who have not \"opted out\" of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash. For more information regarding our distributions, please refer to our 2017 annual financial report. Please contact your broker or other financial intermediary for more information regarding the dividend reinvestment plan.\nReduction in Asset Coverage Ratio Effective March 29, 2019\nOn March 29, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”). As a result, our asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 29, 2019. However, pursuant to covenants in the indentures governing our 7.375% Notes Due 2019 and 6.125% Notes Due 2022 (together, the “Notes”), we are limited in our ability to make distributions if our asset coverage ratio is below 200% at the time we declare a distribution. As a result, despite the SBCA, we will continue to be prohibited by the indentures governing the Notes from making distributions on our common stock if our asset coverage ratio falls below 200%.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWe will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 8:00 am Eastern Time to discuss our first quarter 2018 financial results.
