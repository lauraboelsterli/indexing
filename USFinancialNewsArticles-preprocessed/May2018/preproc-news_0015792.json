GAAP net income in was $0.1 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, a decrease from the GAAP net income of $1.3 million, or $0.08 earnings per diluted share reported in the same period in 2017. Non-GAAP net income in was $0.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.2 million, or $0.14 earnings per diluted share, in the same period in 2017.\nA reconciliation and description of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables at the end of this press release.\n“PAR’s year over year quarterly revenue and profit decreases are attributed to the lapping of a large hardware project for a specific Tier 1 customer in the first quarter of 2017, which was completed in the first half of last year,” commented Dr. Donald H. Foley, PAR Technology Corporation’s President & CEO. “I note that on a sequential quarterly basis PAR’s income before provision for income taxes increased $1.8 million from a loss of $1.7 million to a gain of $0.1 million. More importantly, PAR’s Restaurant & Retail segment continues to capture significant market share in the cloud-based Point of Sales marketplace. To that end, Brink bookings in the quarter numbered 940 new sites and nearly doubled from the same period last year. PAR continues to make improvements in both our technology platforms and software products. I am also pleased to report PAR’s Government segment revenues grew nearly 13% in the quarter compared to last year and has returned to a positive revenue trajectory.”\nConference Call .\nThere will be a conference call at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern) on May 9, 2018, during which the Company’s management will discuss the financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.

However, non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, as defined in the reconciliation table above, are provided because management uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the results of the Company's continuing operations and believes this information provides investors supplemental insight into underlying business trends and operating results. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by certain non-recurring charges, including equity based compensation, acquisition related expenditures, and other non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s financial performance. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove non-recurring charges provides a useful perspective with respect to our operating results and provides supplemental information to both management and investors by removing items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated. PAR believes the adjustments provide a useful comparison.\nDuring , the Company recorded $297,000 of expenses related to the Company’s previously disclosed internal investigation into conduct at its China and Singapore offices. Additionally, $181,000 of equity based compensation charges were recorded during . The Company recognized amortization of acquired intangible assets of $241,000 related to the Company’s 2014 acquisition of Brink Software, Inc.

Lastly, the Company recognized amortization of acquired intangible assets of $241,000 related to the Company’s 2014 acquisition of Brink Software, Inc.
