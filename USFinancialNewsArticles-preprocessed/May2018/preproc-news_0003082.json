ATM Program: Sold 265,579 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $8.89 per share through our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of $2.4 million. LOC Amendment: Entered into Amendment No. 4 (the “Amendment”) to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with KeyBank as administrative agent, managing agent and lead arranger, Gladstone Management Corporation, the Company’s financial adviser, as servicer, and certain other lenders party thereto (together with the Amendment, the “Credit Facility”). Amendment No. 4 amended the Credit Facility to:\n-- Extend the revolving period from January 19, 2019 to January 15, 2021;\n-- Extend the maturity date from May 1, 2020 to April 15, 2022, at which time all principal and interest will be due and payable;\n-- Reduce the interest rate margin by 40 basis points effective immediately to 2.85% for the balance of the revolving period (January 15, 2021), after which the margin increases to 3.25% for the balance of the facility term;\n-- Change the unused commitment fee from 0.50% of the total unused commitment amount to 0.50% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is less than or equal to 50%, 0.75% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is greater than 50% but less than or equal to 65%, and 1.00% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is greater than 65%; and\n-- Increase the current commitment amount from $170 million to $190 million with the ability to expand to a total facility amount of $265 million through additional commitments of existing lenders.\nRecurring Distributions and Dividends: For each of January, February, and March 2018, paid monthly distributions to common stockholders ($0.07 per common share) and monthly dividends to preferred stockholders ($0.125 per share of the Company’s 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock).\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2018 Results:\nInterest income increased by approximately $0.3 million, or 3.1%, due to an increase in the weighted-average interest-bearing portfolio balance, slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted-average yield and a decrease in other income quarter over quarter. Total expenses increased slightly by 3.6% quarter over quarter, primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of increased borrowings outstanding quarter over quarter.\nNet Investment Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $5.6 million, or $0.21 per share, an increase of 0.6% as compared to the prior quarter.\nThe Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $9.3 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $7.2 million, or $0.27 per share, respectively. The quarter over quarter increase was primarily driven by $3.4 million in net unrealized appreciation.\nSubsequent Events: Subsequent to March 31, 2018, the following significant events occurred:\nPortfolio Activity:\n-- In April 2018, we invested $3.0 million in CHA Holdings, Inc. through secured second lien debt.\nDistributions and Dividends Declared: In April 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders and monthly dividends to preferred shareholders:\nRecord Date Payment Date Distribution\nper\nCommon Share Distribution\nper Series\n2024 Term\nPreferred Share April 20, 2018 April 30, 2018 $ 0.07 $ 0.125 May 22, 2018 May 31, 2018 0.07 0.125 June 20, 2018 June 29, 2018 0.07 0.125 Total for the Quarter $ 0.21 $ 0.375 Small Business Credit Availability Act: On April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”))) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Director’s approval, or April 10, 2019.\nComments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “The combination of interest income, net of interest expense, increasing 25% over the prior year quarter and the broad based portfolio appreciation this quarter, has lifted our return on equity to 16.3% in the current quarter and to 12.6% for the last four quarters. We continue to be well positioned to improve on our results over the balance of fiscal year 2018 as the full benefit of our recently reduced bank debt costs and the expected rise in floating rates are realized.”\nConference Call for Stockholders: The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
