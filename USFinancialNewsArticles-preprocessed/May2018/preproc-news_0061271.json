    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Never mind Russia’s state of the art World Cup stadiums, Reuters photographers have been capturing the eclectic settings of communities’ spartan goalposts and pitches.\nChildren play with a puppy near a goalpost on a football pitch in the Siberian settlement of Novosyolovo, Krasnoyarsk region, Russia, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin The sometimes ramshackle goalposts were photographed in Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, giving a glimpse of life away from the fervor of a tournament that will be watched by fans from around the world.\nYoung Russians do pull-ups from the crossbar and run around on pitches in the shadow of golden onion domes, old Soviet concrete walls and modern high-rises.\nSlideshow (11 Images) Locals also find alternative uses for the rusty, netless posts that have seen better days. One man ties his goat to the upright, children take a dog for a walk, and a man gallops past another on horseback.\nFor the photo essay, click on reut.rs/2snVfV0\nWriting by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
