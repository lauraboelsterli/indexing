    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCash and investments in marketable securities at March 31, 2018 were $333.8 million as compared to $353.2 million at December 31, 2017. This does not include the $1.0 billion upfront payment and $850.0 million share purchase proceeds received on April 3, 2018, as a result of our new Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration.\n\"Nektar begins 2018 in a very strong position with a major collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for NKTR-214 and key advancements in our immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline,\" said Howard W. Robin, President and CEO of Nektar. \"The PIVOT study of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab continues to enroll patients and we are exceptionally pleased that the preliminary data from PIVOT was accepted for an oral presentation at this year's ASCO Meeting. We initiated two new clinical studies this quarter, the first with our novel I-O combination of NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 and the second with our autoimmune disease candidate, NKTR-358. Based on positive preclinical results, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 with their TAK-659, a SYK/FLT inhibitor. Finally, in the area of pain, we plan to submit our NDA filing for NKTR-181 this month.\"\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $38.0 million as compared to $24.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was higher primarily because of the recognition of $10.0 million received from Shire for the approval of Adynovi in Europe.\nTotal operating costs and expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $124.8 million as compared to $79.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total operating costs and expenses increased primarily as a result of increased research and development (R&D) expense.\nR&D expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $99.4 million as compared to $61.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. R&D expense was higher in the first quarter 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily because of expenses for our pipeline programs, including the completion of Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181, Phase 1/2 clinical studies of NKTR-214 and NKTR-358, initiation of the Phase 1 study of NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214 and IND-enabling activities for NKTR-255.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 and increased primarily due to increased stock based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net loss was $95.8 million, or $0.60 loss per share as compared to net loss of $63.9 million, or $0.42 loss per share in the first quarter of 2017.\n2018 Business Highlights\nIn May, Nektar began dosing patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study of NKTR-358, a first-in-class regulatory T cell stimulator, designed to correct the underlying immune system dysfunction found in patients with immune disorders.\nIn April, Nektar announced a new clinical collaboration agreement with Takeda to evaluate NKTR-214 in combination with TAK-659, a dual SYK and FLT-3 inhibitor in liquid and solid tumors with the first of these studies expected to begin in the second half of 2018 in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.\nIn April, Nektar presented positive preclinical data for its immuno-oncology programs at the 2018 AACR Annual Meeting. Preclinical data presented by Nektar researchers and collaborators demonstrate how NKTR-214 synergizes with multiple modalities including TLRs, HDAC and ACT, highlighting the potential of NKTR-214 as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology.\nIn April, Nektar began dosing patients in the REVEAL Phase 1/2 study, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-262, a novel toll-like receptor agonist, in combination with NKTR-214. This novel-novel combination is designed to engage both the innate and adaptive immune response to fight cancer and may ultimately provide another option for patients with many types of advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers.\nIn February, Nektar and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a global development and commercialization agreement to evaluate the full potential of NKTR-214 plus OpdivoÂ® (nivolumab) in more than 20 indications in 9 tumor types including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder and triple negative breast cancer.\nThe company also announced upcoming presentations at the following scientific congresses during the second quarter of 2018:\nTreg Directed Therapy for Autoimmune Disorders Meeting, Boston, MA:\nPreclinical Data Presentation: \"NKTR-358: An IL-2 Pathway Agonist that Selectively Expands and Activates Regulatory T cells for the Treatment of Allergy and Autoimmune Disease\" Presenter: Jonathan Zalevsky, Ph.D., Nektar Therapeutics Session: Enhanced Treg-based therapy with the use of IL-2 Date: Wednesday, May 23, 2018, 3:40 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time\n3rd Annual Advances in Immuno-Oncology Congress, London, U.K.:\nPresentation: \"Accessing The Potential Of An Immunotherapeutic Agent\" Presenter: Jonathan Zalevsky, Ph.D., Nektar Therapeutics Session: Translational Immuno-Oncology Date: Thursday, May 24, 2018, 5:40 p.m. British Summer Time\nAmerican Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2018 Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL :\nOral Presentation: \"NKTR-214 (CD122-biased agonist) plus nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors: Preliminary phase 1/2 results of PIVOT\".

Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the potential therapeutic benefits of and future development plans for our products (including NKTRâ214, NKTR-181, NKTR-358, NKTR-262 and NKTR-255) and the timing for filing a new drug application, \"NDA\". Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results may those indicated in the forward-looking statements and you should not rely on such statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to those indicated in the forward-looking statements include: (i) clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that a clinical study could fail even after positive interim data is observed; (ii) the data package required for filing and approval of an NDA to the FDA is very uncertain and difficult to predict due to broad FDA regulatory discretion, and changing FDA regulatory guidelines; (iii) regulations concerning and controlling access to opioid-based pharmaceuticals are strict and it is difficult to predict which scheduling category will apply to NKTR-181 if regulatory approval is achieved; (iv) patents may not issue from our patent applications for our drug candidates, patents that have issued may not be enforceable, or additional intellectual property licenses from third parties may be required; and (v) certain other important risks and uncertainties set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2018. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no any forward-looking statement.\nContact:\nFor Investors:\nJennifer Ruddock of Nektar Therapeutics\n415-482-5585\nJodi Sievers of Nektar Therapeutics\n415-482-5593\nFor Media:\nDan
