Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos lifts the trophy as they celebrate winning the Champions League. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nToo many it seems, because their latest earned in Kiev with a 3-1 win over Liverpool on Saturday, will not fit alongside the other 12 in their museum at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nSpanish newspaper Marca report the club are working on creating another exhibition space so that the 13 trophies can be displayed together next week.\nMadrid had space for the trophies won in 2014 in Lisbon, 2016 in Milan and 2017 in Cardiff, but their fourth Champions League triumph in five seasons was a bridge too far.\nAfter a season during which they sustained fierce criticism for finishing 17 points behind champions Barcelona in La Liga and being eliminated by Leganes in the Kingâ€™s Cup quarter-finals, Madrid finally have a happy problem to deal with.
