It had in January estimated restructuring costs for the whole year at around 600 million.\n“Disappointingly, the weak performance of our Polish operations continued during the quarter. After a deeper review by the new management in Poland, additional project delays and cost increases were identified,” Danielsson said.\n“For the remainder of the year we expect the operations (in Poland) to stabilise, but at limited profit levels,” he said.\nOperating profit fell by 65 percent to 652 million crowns ($74 million). Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 51 percent fall to 901 million.\nDanielsson, a company veteran who shook up the management team on taking up his new job, told Reuters he did not expect to book further restructuring costs this year, and currently there was nothing to indicate the programme would need to be expanded.\n“I can’t make any guarantees for the future. But this is what we believe in now, the decisions we have made. Focus is set firmly on restoring profitability within (division) Construction,” he said in an interview.\nSkanska shares were down 4.6 percent at 0850 GMT, which means they are down around 24 percent on the year.\nIn the quarter, the company received benefits worth about 500 million crowns from claims resolutions in its U.S. civil engineering business and the effect of pension curtailments in Britain.\nOrder intake at its construction division, which makes up the bulk of the company’s sales, fell slightly more than expected to 32.9 billion crowns from 38.2 billion.\nSkanska’s higher-margin property development business, which has been increasing its contribution to group profit, said construction in the Nordics remained stable and strong, mainly driven by Sweden. $1 = 8.8294 Swedish crowns Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; editing by Jason Neely and Jane Merriman",
