    "text": "0 COMMENTS Oil prices closed lower on Friday, after wavering between gains and losses in anticipation of renewed U.S. economic sanctions on Iran.\nLight, sweet crude for June delivery settled down 21 cents, or 0.3%, at $71.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, declined 79 cents, or 1%, to $78.51 a barrel.\nPresident Donald Trump last week pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program, setting the stage to reinstate sanctions on the Islamic Republic, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nEven though the European Union has decided to stick to the accord , energy companies in the region have already started to pull back from Iran. On Wednesday, French oil giant Total SA said it would withdraw from an agreement to help develop a gas field off Iran if it wasn’t granted a waiver by the U.S. Total had signed a $1 billion deal to develop Iran’s South Pars field.\nThe decision was a concrete sign that U.S. sanctions could hinder Iran’s oil industry and further reduce global supply. Iran currently exports around 2.4 million barrels a day of crude. Analysts estimated that anywhere between 400,000 to a 1 million barrels could be at risk once sanctions are fully reinstated in six months.\nAn Iranian oil facility.

The International Energy Agency on Wednesday said commercial petroleum stocks in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries fell to the lowest level in three years , and below a closely watched five-year average metric for the first time since 2014.\nIn its monthly oil-market report, the IEA suggested the drawdown in stocks was evidence that OPEC’s coordinated efforts to cut output have succeeded in clearing up a global supply glut that had weighed on the market since late 2014.\nOPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, have been holding back crude production by around 1.8 million barrels a day since the start of last year. The agreement, which was extended in November, is set to expire at the end of 2018.\nOn Thursday, Saudi Arabia—the de facto head of OPEC and the world’s largest crude exporter— said it was in talks with other OPEC members and Russia over “recent market volatility,” amid concerns prices are rising too high.\nOil market observers will also be looking ahead to elections this weekend in Venezuela, where continuing supply outages have already helped bolster prices in recent months. “Incumbent President Nicolás Maduro is a shoo-in to win and this might provoke the wrath of Washington which is actively mulling over broad oil sanctions on Venezuela,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd.\n“Against this backdrop,” he added, “the odds are on further price upside with calls for $100 oil growing by the day.”\nGasoline futures fell 0.4% to $2.2333 a gallon and diesel futures fell 0.7% to $2.2655 a gallon.\n—Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com",
