    "text": "OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) today reported first quarter 2018 net income 1 of $46.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.8 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, during the prior quarter and net income of $33.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenues of $297.6 million during the quarter increased 1% sequentially and 4% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses of $237.7 million during the quarter increased 2% sequentially and 2% compared to the same quarter in 2017. The operating margin was 20.1% during the current quarter, compared to 21.0% and 18.5% during the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\nAssets under management ended the quarter at $80.2 billion, declining 1% compared to the prior quarter and 1% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Gross sales increased 40% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and 30% compared to the first quarter of 2017, while redemptions improved. Net outflows were $1.5 billion during the current quarter, compared to net outflows of $2.7 billion during the prior quarter and net outflows of $3.4 billion during the comparable quarter in 2017.\nBroker-dealer assets under administration ended the quarter at $56.3 billion, declining less than 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and increasing 5% compared to the same quarter in 2017. Average trailing twelve-month productivity increased to $285 thousand per advisor during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $256 thousand and $230 thousand during the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\n“Over the last 18 months, we have made solid progress in transitioning our business model to one that better positions us for the future,” said Philip J. Sanders, Chief Executive Officer of Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. “We have made headway on a number of corporate initiatives, including improving investment performance, which we know is key to our long-term success.”\nEffective January 1, 2018, we elected to change our accounting policy on how we report indirect underwriting and distribution expenses in the underwriting and distribution caption and certain expenses historically reported as general and administrative. The change in presentation of certain line items in our consolidated statements of income is intended to improve the transparency of our financial statements. Separately, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-07, “Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost”, which reclassifies net periodic pension costs, other than historical service costs, from compensation and benefits to investment and other income (loss). All reclassifications were applied retrospectively and did not affect net income.\n1 Net income represents net income attributable to Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.\nRevenues Analysis\nInvestment management fee revenues decreased $2.7 million, or 2%, sequentially as an increase in average assets under management was offset by two fewer days during the current quarter and a decrease in the effective management fee rate. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, fees increased $3.3 million, or 2%, due to higher average assets under management and an increase in the effective management fee rate. During the current quarter, the effective management fee rate was 65.8 basis points, compared to 66.5 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 65.0 basis points during the first quarter of 2017. Average assets under management were $82.4 billion during the current quarter, compared to $81.3 billion and $81.4 billion during the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively.\nUnderwriting and distribution fees increased $5.8 million, or 4%, sequentially. The increase was largely due to payments received from independent financial advisors for office space, compliance oversight and affiliation fees. Prior to 2018, the cost of these services was embedded in commissions. An increase in advisory fee revenues also contributed to the sequential increase in underwriting and distribution fees. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, revenues increased $9.2 million, or 7%, due to growth in advisory fee revenue and new revenues from independent financial advisors for office space, compliance oversight and affiliation fees, which were partly offset by lower distribution fees to third-party distributors.\nOperating Expenses Analysis\nDistribution expenses increased $6.6 million, or 6%, sequentially due primarily to higher payout rates to independent financial advisors under the new commission structure that became effective on January 1, 2018. Compared to the same quarter in 2017, costs increased $6.0 million, or 6%, due to higher commission rates for advisors, which were partly offset by lower commissions to third-party distributors.\nCompensation and benefits expenses declined $0.5 million, or less than 1%, sequentially due to a discretionary 401(k) contribution in the fourth quarter and partially offset by higher payroll taxes during the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, expenses increased $1.8 million, or 3%, primarily due to annual merit increases, which were partly offset by lower pension costs due to the prior year plan freeze.\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined $0.5 million, or 3%, sequentially due to lower business meeting and travel costs and lower usage of contractors and consultants due to the completion of various projects. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, expenses declined $2.7 million, or 12%, primarily due to a combination of lower usage of contractors and consultants, and lower business meeting and travel costs.\nTechnology expenses increased $1.4 million, or 9%, sequentially due to higher data service costs related to fund mergers and cost of service increases, as well as higher technology consulting costs. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, expenses declined $0.3 million, or 2%.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate during the current quarter was 24.6% and was lower compared to prior periods as a result of the Tax Reform Act, which lowered the statutory rate from 35% to 21%. We expect our effective tax rate to range from 23% to 25%, exclusive of the effects of share-based payments, state tax incentives, unanticipated state tax legislative changes and unanticipated fluctuations in earnings.\nAssets Under Management Three Months Ended (in millions) Mar. 31, Jun. 30, Sep. 30, Dec. 31, Mar. 31, 2017 2018 Unaffiliated 1 Beginning assets $ 30,295 $ 30,182 $ 30,307 $ 31,062 $ 31,133 Sales 2 1,799 2,080 1,790 1,577 2,245 Redemptions (3,707 ) (2,886 ) (2,486 ) (2,912 ) (2,692 ) Net exchanges 236 235 213 316 247 Net Flows (1,672 ) (571 ) (483 ) (1,019 ) (200 ) Market action 1,559 696 1,238 1,090 122 Ending assets $ 30,182 $ 30,307 $ 31,062 $ 31,133 $ 31,055 Annualized organic growth rate (22.1 )% (7.6 )% (6.4 )% (13.1 )% (2.6 )% Annualized redemption rate 50.5 % 39.2 % 33.0 % 37.9 % 35.8 % Institutional Beginning assets $ 7,904 $ 7,792 $ 7,036 $ 6,365 $ 6,289 Sales 2 142 78 68 66 552 Redemptions (727 ) (1,057 ) (1,139 ) (521 ) (604 ) Net exchanges - 6 - - - Net Flows (585 ) (973 ) (1,071 ) (455 ) (52 ) Market action 473 217 400 379 212 Ending assets $ 7,792 $ 7,036 $ 6,365 $ 6,289 $ 6,449 Annualized organic growth rate (29.6 )% (49.9 )% (60.9 )% (28.6 )% (3.3 )% Annualized redemption rate 37.2 % 58.7 % 67.3 % 32.2 % 37.8 % Broker-Dealer Beginning assets $ 42,322 $ 43,110 $ 43,084 $ 43,472 $ 43,660 Sales 2 978 1,142 1,024 1,077 1,001 Redemptions (1,871 ) (1,812 ) (2,049 ) (2,026 ) (1,958 ) Net exchanges (236 ) (241 ) (213 ) (316 ) (247 ) Net Flows (1,129 ) (911 ) (1,238 ) (1,265 ) (1,204 ) Market action 1,917 885 1,626 1,453 251 Ending assets $ 43,110 $ 43,084 $ 43,472 $ 43,660 $ 42,707 Annualized organic growth rate (10.7 )% (8.5 )% (11.5 )% (11.6 )% (11.0 )% Annualized redemption rate 15.1 % 14.7 % 16.4 % 16.1 % 15.1 % Consolidated Total Beginning assets $ 80,521 $ 81,084 $ 80,427 $ 80,899 $ 81,082 Sales 2 2,919 3,300 2,882 2,720 3,798 Redemptions (6,305 ) (5,755 ) (5,674 ) (5,459 ) (5,254 ) Net exchanges - - - - - Net Flows (3,386 ) (2,455 ) (2,792 ) (2,739 ) (1,456 ) Market action 3,949 1,798 3,264 2,922 585 Ending assets $ 81,084 $ 80,427 $ 80,899 $ 81,082 $ 80,211 Annualized organic growth rate (16.8 )% (12.1 )% (13.9 )% (13.5 )% (7.2 )% Annualized redemption rate 30.5 % 27.9 % 27.1 % 25.7 % 24.8 % 1 Unaffiliated includes National channel (home office and wholesale), Defined Contribution Investment Only \"DCIO\", Registered Investment Advisor \"RIA\" and Variable Annuity \"VA\" 2 Sales is primarily gross sales (net of sales commissions).
