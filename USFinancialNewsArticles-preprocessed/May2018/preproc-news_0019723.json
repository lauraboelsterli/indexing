    "text": "196 COMMENTS Iran could quickly ramp up its nuclear activities now that President Donald Trump has pulled out of the 2015 international agreement designed to curtail them. But experts and former officials differ over how long Tehran would need to build a bomb.\nSome, pointing to Iran’s slow past progress and independent analyses, believe Iran would need several years to produce a nuclear weapon. Others think Tehran could build one in little over a year.\nIranian officials have said they could accelerate nuclear activities and start enriching uranium within days.\nRelated Video President Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions on Tehran. He called the deal \"defective\" and said it didn't do enough to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons. Photo: Getty Images Separate from the technical question is the political one. U.S. officials have voiced skepticism that Iran would quickly return to work on a bomb.\n“Iran wasn’t racing to a weapon before the deal,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers last month. “There is no indication that I’m aware of that if the deal no longer existed that they would immediately turn to racing to create a nuclear weapon today.”\nMany observers believe Iran has incentives not to expand its nuclear activities or expel international inspectors even if the U.S. exits the deal.\nIranian officials hope to maintain trade with Europe —which is mainly supportive of the pact—and an outright return to nuclear activities would likely stop that . Attempting to relaunch its nuclear program secretly would slow Iran’s path significantly and carry major risks.\nUranium Enrichment The deal limits the level to which Iran is able to enrich uranium. %\n100\n90%\nNeeded for nuclear weapons\n80\n60\n40\n20%\nIran had enriched to this level\nprior to the deal\n20\n3.67%\nMaximum level allowed\nunder the deal for 15 years\n0\nSources: IAEA; JCPOA text; U.S. government\nIran worked on three aspects of a nuclear program—enriching uranium, obtaining plutonium and trying to acquire the know-how to build a nuclear weapon—before the 2015 deal, which lifted most international sanctions in exchange for strict but temporary limits on its program. Tehran says its nuclear program was always for peaceful purposes.\nIran had amassed a large stock of low-enriched uranium and produced nuclear fuel enriched to 20% purity. That is several steps from producing weapons-grade uranium enriched to 90% purity. Still, U.S. officials said in 2015 that Iran was just two or three months from amassing enough fuel for a bomb.\nStockpiles Under the deal, Iran was required to reduce its stores of enriched uranium. About 10,000 kg\nIran had this much\nbefore the deal took effect\n300\nMaximum allowable under deal\n109.5\nAmount documented in latest\n(February) inspection\nSources: IAEA; U.S. government\nIran was also building a plutonium reactor at Arak, in its northwest. When completed, it could have produced material for a couple of nuclear weapons annually, U.S. officials say.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency concluded in 2015 that Tehran— despite denials—pursued a concerted weaponization program until 2003 and continued some of that work until 2009.\nThe 2015 agreement was structured around restrictions to ensure Iran would need at least 12 months to gather enough nuclear fuel for a bomb.\nMost experts believe that the accord largely ensured that by removing roughly 98% of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, mothballing two-thirds of its uranium-spinning centrifuges, limiting research and development, and removing the core of the Arak reactor.\nCentrifuges The machines spin uranium to increase purity. BEFORE DEAL\nAbout 19,000\nbasic IR-1 machines installed\nAbout 1,000\nadvanced IR-2s\nNOW\nMaximum 6,104\nIR-1 machines\nSource: IAEA\n“It would take many years for Iran to have a working nuclear arsenal,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington based group that supports the deal.\nOne critic of the deal, Olli Heinonen, a former senior IAEA official who works for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, said Iran may have gathered the parts for more advanced centrifuges than Tehran had declared. That could speed the production of weapons-grade uranium and shorten the time to build a bomb. There is no evidence, however, that Iran lied to the IAEA about this additional hardware.\nExperts and former officials say Iran would need at least 18 months to reconstitute the Arak reactor, whose core was filled with concrete as a consequence of the deal.\nBreakout Time Estimated time it would take Iran to produce enough fissile material for a weapon July\n2015\n(pre-deal)\nNow\n(if deal is\nscrapped)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12 months\nSource: U.S. government\nIt’s also unclear how much Iran knows about assembling a bomb. The IAEA in 2015 concluded that Iran’s weaponization work “did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies” and knowledge of “certain relevant technical competences and capabilities.”\nThe report was controversial. The IAEA spoke to some scientists and experts but not at length. Access to key sites was limited.\nBut it’s also unclear whether Iran​ has the technical ability to reliably deliver a nuclear warhead with its existing missile technology.\nLast month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had obtained 100,000 pages of documents from a secret location in Tehran showing Iran had safeguarded its nuclear know-how. He said the material showed Tehran intended to resume its activities. Israeli leaders have vowed to stop Iran from getting the bomb.\nWhile no new information has emerged publicly from that archive, the IAEA has called out Iran for seeking to erase possibly crucial work at the sprawling military site of Parchin. The agency said in 2015 that Iran’s explanation for its activities didn’t add up.\nIran is believed to have carried out work there on high explosives—materials that detonate very quickly. Mr. Heinonen said these could have been “an important step in the design and mock-up of a nuclear weapon.”\nJeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Iran was “quite far along” on its weaponization work with access to sophisticated designs from abroad. Stopping that effort was one reason why concluding the 2015 deal made sense, he argued.\n“What we don’t know is how well they [the Iranian efforts] would work on a first test,” he said.\nSee Iran’s Main Nuclear Sites Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com",
