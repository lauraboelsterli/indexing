    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: WYN and WYND.WI) announced today its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share on its common stock, payable June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018. In addition, the Board of Directors of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: WH.WI) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock, payable June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018.
