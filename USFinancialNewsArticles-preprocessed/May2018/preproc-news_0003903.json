    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Passenger car registrations in Germany rose 8 percent in April from the same month last year to 314,055 cars, boosted by a surge in demand for sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and luxury cars, the country’s KBA vehicle authority said on Thursday.\nSUV sales jumped 30.2 percent year-on-year, taking the category’s market share to 16.4 percent. Sales of luxury cars were up 31.7 percent, but sales of compact cars down 2.6 percent.\nIn the wake of Volkswagen’s emissions scandal, sales of diesel-fuelled cars continued their decline, dropping 12.5 percent and accounting for 33.4 percent of new registrations.\nRegistrations of hybrid cars leapt 69.8 percent, but still only accounted for 3.5 percent of the market.\nWhile registrations for most German brands rose, except for Audi, sales of Tesla ( TSLA.O ) vehicles fell 46.2 percent, despite its return to a government list of cars eligible for electronic car subsidies.\nReporting by Riham Alkousaa; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur ",
