    "text": "OSLO, May 24 (Reuters) - More Norwegian company bosses expect profitability to rise in the next 12 months, but there is also an increase among those who expect a decline, a quarterly survey commissioned by the countryâ€™s central bank showed on Thursday.\nThe number of respondents expecting unchanged profitability, as measured by operating margin before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, has meanwhile declined.\nIn total, 36.9 percent of business leaders now expect an improvement, against 33.1 percent in a similar poll in February.\nMeanwhile, 36.1 percent predicted unchanged profitability, down from 42.8 percent, while 21.9 percent see a decline against 17.0 percent who did so three months ago.\nThe survey is carried out by analysis firm Epinion on behalf of the central bank.
