    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Steady economic growth in April lays a good foundation for achieving China’s full-year growth target, a spokeswoman from the country’s statistics bureau said Tuesday.\nPeople walk on a bridge near the financial district of Pudong in Shanghai November 21, 2014. REUTERS/Aly Song/Files Liu Aihua said she expects investment will maintain healthy growth but that there is less room for a boost from infrastructure investment.\nChina’s government has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, down from the actual 6.9 percent in 2017.\nReporting by Kevin Yao; Writing by Elias Glenn; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
