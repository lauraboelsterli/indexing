    "text": "CAIRO, May 23 (Reuters) - Egypt and Russia signed a 50-year agreement on Wednesday to build a sprawling industrial zone that Egypt hopes will attract up to $7 billion in investments.\nThe 5.25 million square metre (57 million square foot) industrial zone will be located east of Port Said in the new Suez Canal Economic Zone, a mega project launched by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\nThe plan aims to create an international hub for manufacturers with easy access for exporting goods to African and European markets.\nThe construction of the first phase of the Russian industrial zone is expected to cost around $190 million, according to a statement from Egypt’s trade ministry announcing the signing of the agreement.\nThe statement said the new industrial zone could attract up to $7 billion in investments, but did not say how the figure was calculated.\nTotal trade between Egypt and Russia in 2017 amounted to $6.7 billion, state news agency MENA reported in February, with Cairo’s exports to Moscow reaching $505 million.\nEgypt is on a drive to lure back investors who fled following the 2011 uprising with a slew of economic reforms and incentives the government hopes will draw fresh capital and kickstart growth.
