FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City vs Stoke City - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - May 13, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal before the match Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra\nThe 52-year-old’s contract expired at the end of the campaign and Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said the club had decided to “move in a new direction”.\nCarvalhal was appointed to succeed Paul Clement last December and oversaw an initial improvement in form, which saw Swansea rise to 13th in the table.\nBut they failed to pick up a victory in their last nine games of the season and finished third-bottom with 33 points.\n(This version of the story corrects eight to nine games in para four) Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
