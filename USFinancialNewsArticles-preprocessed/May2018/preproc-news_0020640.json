    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Namaste Technologies Inc. (“Namaste” or the “Company”) (TSXV:N) (FRANKFURT:M5BQ) (OTCMKTS:NXTTF) is pleased to announce that further to the April 5 th announcement of an LOI with 2624078 Ontario Inc., the Company has signed a Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to acquire 51% of the outstanding shares of 2624078 Ontario Inc. (“Infinite Labz”) and has agreed to finance the construction of Infinite Labz’s facility in Etobicoke, Ontario.\nInfinite Labz intends to submit an application to become a Health Canada Licensed Producer (“LP”) of medical cannabis oil, with the intention of resale to both the medical and recreational markets. Infinite Labz also intends to apply to become a Licensed Dealer (“LD”) of medical cannabis in accordance with Health Canada regulations, allowing the company to initiate research and development, import cannabis, perform analytical testing, and conduct clinical studies with medical cannabis, dried flower, and oil.\nNamaste anticipates an accelerated demand for cannabis oils and believes that a dedicated facility designed for the sole purpose of producing oils and extracts can provide the Company with a strong supply of high-margin oil products. Following completion of construction and licensing, the facility will allow Infinite Labz to produce oils and extracts at a low cost for sale to registered patients of Namaste’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cannmart Inc. (“Cannmart”), resulting in increased margins for Namaste. Inifinite Labz also plans to produce and sell oils/extracts directly to other LP’s, and participate in the recreational market by selling its products to licensed provincial distributors. The Company also intends to use its hardware experience to produce specialized pod-based vaporization systems for use with oil formulations. Namaste has established a strong brand through its existing retail channels and intends on building on that unique brand in the Cannabis oil sector through Infinite Labz.\nIf an LD license is obtained, Infinite Labz will facilitate importation of medical cannabis for testing purposes, following which an application for approval from Health Canada to import for resale purposes can be made. The LP license, in combination with the LD license would allow Infinite Labz to gain full exposure to the exciting segment of the medical cannabis industry through importation, testing, and production of cannabis oils and extracts.\nKey SPA terms:\nNamaste will provide financing, through a first priority shareholder loan, of up to $750,000 for construction of the Infinite Labz facility. Namaste’s shareholder loan will be re-paid from net profits. Namaste will acquire 51% of the outstanding shares of Infinite Labz. Infinite Labz management team has entered into consulting agreements to oversee construction of the facility and the applications for the LP and LD licences.\nManagement Commentary\nSean Dollinger, President and CEO of Namaste comments: “We are very pleased to have entered into a definitive agreement as we believe that the facility at Infinite Labz can be instrumental in allowing Namaste to participate in the recreational market. In addition, the facility would allow Namaste to control the production and distribution of cannabis oil for sale through Cannmart, as well as for resale to LP’s. We believe that having the ability to offer oil production services for smaller craft producers through Infinite Labz will add significant value moving forward as we look to develop relationships with all types of LPs that enable us to provide our patients with a broad range of cannabis products. Our hope is that these services will lead to additional opportunities with LP's who see value in working collaboratively. In addition to producing oil through the facility, Cannmart plans on providing oil filling services for pre-filled cartridges and vaporizers pods once approved by Health Canada. This facility will not only support the Company’s growth in the sale of medical cannabis but it will also ensure that we stay ahead of the curve in anticipation of federal changes to the legal cannabis industry.”\nAbout Namaste Technologies Inc.\nNamaste Technologies is a global leader in the sale of medical cannabis consumption devices.
