    "text": "BEIJING, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: SOHU) (\"Sohu Delaware\"), China's leading online media, video, search and gaming business group, today announced that at a special meeting held on May 29, 2018, Beijing time (the \"Special Meeting\"), its stockholders approved a proposal for the dissolution of Sohu Delaware (the \"Liquidation\") and adoption of a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of Sohu Delaware (the \"Plan of Liquidation\"), pursuant to which Sohu Delaware will be dissolved; all outstanding shares of the common stock of Sohu Delaware will be cancelled, and American depositary shares (the \"ADSs\") representing ordinary shares of Sohu.com Limited, a Cayman Islands company (\"Sohu Cayman\"), will be distributed to the stockholders of Sohu Delaware on a pro rata basis.\nSohu Delaware's present intention is to proceed expeditiously with the Liquidation by filing a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 31, 2018 specifying an effective time for the dissolution of Sohu Delaware on that date of 4:30 PM Eastern Time (such date and time, the \"Effective Time\"), although the Liquidation may be postponed or abandoned by Sohu Delaware's Board of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time Sohu Delaware will distribute to the stockholders of Sohu Delaware ADSs, each representing one ordinary share of Sohu Cayman, equal to the number of shares of the common stock of Sohu Delaware such stockholders held immediately prior to the Effective Time, on a share-for-shares basis.\nFrom and after the Effective Time, as previously disclosed in the proxy statement/prospectus for the Special Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2018, the business, operations, and assets of Sohu Cayman and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities will be substantially the same as the business, operations, and assets of Sohu Delaware and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Sohu Cayman will be the top-tier publicly-traded holding company of the Sohu Group instead of Sohu Delaware. The Sohu Delaware stockholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be shareholders of Sohu Cayman through ownership of the ADSs, and will have the same relative economic interest in the Sohu Group as they did immediately prior to the Liquidation.\nADSs representing Sohu Cayman ordinary shares will be listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the \"SOHU\" symbol in place of the shares of the common stock of Sohu Delaware, which will be delisted as of the Effective Time and will not trade thereafter. Sohu Delaware expects trading in the ADSs representing Sohu Cayman ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market to commence on June 1, 2018.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains certain \" \" relating to Sohu Delaware and Sohu Cayman, including statements regarding the planned completion of the Liquidation and listing and trading of ADSs representing Sohu Cayman's Ordinary Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
