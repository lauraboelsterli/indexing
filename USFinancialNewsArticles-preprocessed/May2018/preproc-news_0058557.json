    "text": "Hasbrouck Heights, NJ , May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kimberly Parry Organics, Corp. (\"KPOC\" or the \"Company\") (OTCPINK: KPOC), which had previously announced that Company will be changing its name to “KPOC Mining USA, Inc.” to better reflect the public Company’s exit from the organic cosmetics marketplace, today announced that the Company is moving forward on schedule for its plans to begin copper mining operations for its Tilama Project in Chile.\nCompany representatives have narrowed their list of potential mining operators to several operators in the Tilama Region, the site of the Company’s initial mining operations.\nCompany President Theodore Collas said: “For the moment our main objective is to get the production started and then we can grow in to a larger operation with more sites and a variety of ores. On Friday if all goes well we will have our mining contractor signed for our initial copper site, the Tilama Project.”\nAbout KCOP Mining USA, Inc.\nKPOC Mining has entered into agreements to purchase 23 copper mining sites in the Republic of Chile. Our geologists have determined that each of mining properties will be highly commercially productive. We believe that development of the first mining site will commence in the first half of 2018, and the remaining sites will be developed over a three- year period. All mining operations will be conducted by KPOC Mining Chile, our Chilean subsidiary. Chile is the world’s No. 1 exporter of copper.\nIf you have specific questions about the Company, please email us at admin@kpocmining.com &/or visit our website at www.kpocmining.com\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
