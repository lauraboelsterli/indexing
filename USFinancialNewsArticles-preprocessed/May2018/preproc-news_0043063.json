Soccer Football - Italy - Roberto Mancini Press Conference - Coverciano, Florence, Italy - May 15, 2018 New Italy coach Roberto Mancini during the press conference REUTERS/Max Rossi\nMancini, 53, was appointed on Monday and handed the daunting task of rebuilding the four-times world champions following their failure to qualify for this yearâ€™s World Cup in Russia.\nHis first games in charge are friendlies against Saudi Arabia in St Gallen, Switzerland, on May 28, then against France in Nice on June 1 and the Netherlands in Turin on June 4.\nBalotelli, who has scored 13 goals in 33 appearances, has not been selected for Italy since the last World Cup when his attitude was the subject of barely-veiled criticism from some senior players.\nAfter scoring in the 2-1 win over England, Balotelli covered the entire Italy page in a Panini album with stickers of himself and then posted it on his Facebook page. Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - AS Monaco vs OGC Nice - Stade Louis II, Monaco - January 16, 2018 Nice's Mario Balotelli reacts REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nBut a recall had been on the cards after he scored 26 goals in all competitions for Nice this season.\nBrazilian-born Chelsea defender Emerson Palmieri was one of five uncapped players named in the 30-man squad.\nCrotone midfielder Rolando Mandragora, Sassuolo forward Domenico Berardi, Atalanta defender Mattia Caldara and Torino midfielder Daniele Baselli were also given a chance to win their first caps.\nVeteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon had asked not to be called up.
