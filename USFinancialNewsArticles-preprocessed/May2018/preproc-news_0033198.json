    "text": "BAGHDAD, May 12 (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered the reopening of the nationâ€™s airspace and resumption of air traffic on Saturday, state television reported.\nThe shutdown had come into effect at midnight on Friday as a security measure ahead of the voting which started on Saturday morning. There was no significant incident reported by midday.\nIslamic State militants, who overran a third of Iraq in 2014, had threatened attacks ahead of the elections, the first since the defeat of the militants last year.
