(“IQVIA”) (NYSE: IQV) announced today the launch of an underwritten, secondary public offering of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock by certain of its existing stockholders, including affiliates of TPG Global, LLC, CPP Investment Board Private Holdings, Inc., investment funds associated with Bain Capital Investors, LLC, Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., and Dr. Dennis B. Gillings, CBE and certain of his affiliates (the “Selling Stockholders”), of which IQVIA intends to repurchase from the underwriter 2,500,000 shares (the “Repurchase”).\nIQVIA is not offering any stock in this transaction and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders in the offering.
