    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Sales of $1.7 billion, up 20% Net Income of $297 million, up 98% with EPS of $1.58, up 100% Adjusted Net Income of $266 million, up 103% with Adjusted EPS of $1.41, up 101% Adjusted EBITDA of $468 million, up 64% Completed first acquisition of ICOR International in April 2018 Repurchased approximately $400 million shares since December 1, 2017\nThe Chemours Company (Chemours) (NYSE: CC), a global chemistry company with leading market positions in fluoroproducts, chemical solutions and titanium technologies, today announced its financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nChemours President and CEO Mark Vergnano said, \"Last year's momentum has continued into 2018. We are delivering improved business performance across the company driven by preference for our Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide, continued Opteon™ refrigerant adoption, and increased demand for our fluoropolymers products. Complementing this impressive organic growth, I am pleased to announce the completion of our first acquisition,\" Vergnano continued. \"Our first targeted acquisition bolsters our refrigerant portfolio and broadens our channel access across our markets as we continue to expand our low GWP Opteon™ portfolio. At the same time, we continued to execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, repurchasing a total of approximately $400 million of shares since inception, further demonstrating our confidence in our future growth.\"\nFirst quarter net sales were $1.7 billion, a 20 percent increase from $1.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Volume growth across all three segments drove a 6 percent increase in revenue. Higher global average prices in Titanium Technologies added another 10 percent to revenue, while currency was a 4 percent benefit. First quarter net income was $297 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, versus net income of $150 million, or $0.79 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 improved 64 percent to $468 million, versus $285 million in the first quarter of 2017. This improvement was primarily driven by higher global average price for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide and broad-based volume growth across all segments, somewhat offset by higher distribution and raw material costs.\nFluoroproducts\nFluoroproducts segment sales in the first quarter were $732 million, a 12 percent increase in comparison to the prior-year quarter. Opteon™ refrigerant sales growth and continued demand for fluoropolymers drove volume increases versus last year's first quarter. Price impact was negligible versus last year's first quarter primarily due to mix, while favorable currency exposure resulted in a benefit versus the prior-year quarter. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $206 million, a 33 percent improvement versus the prior-year quarter. This was a result of increased sales growth and better plant utilization modestly offset by higher distribution expenses, water treatment costs and increased raw material costs.\nChemical Solutions\nIn the first quarter 2018, Chemical Solutions segment sales were $144 million, a 4 percent increase versus the prior-year quarter. Improved demand in comparison to last year's first quarter resulted in higher volume across the segment. Price impact was negligible in the quarter, primarily due to mix, while currency movements were favorable when compared to the previous year's first quarter. First quarter 2018 segment Adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, versus $12 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher raw material expenses, costs related to the construction of the new mining solutions facility and lower licensing income in the quarter.\nIn March, construction on the new mining solutions facility in Mexico was suspended. A civil association in Mexico filed a complaint against several local and federal authorities involved in the permitting process of Chemours' new mining solutions facility. As a result, the construction of the facility has been temporarily suspended. Chemours is working with local and federal authorities along with community leaders to address the claims in order to resume construction.\nTitanium Technologies\nTitanium Technologies segment sales in the first quarter were $854 million, a 32 percent increase versus the prior-year quarter. Global average selling prices and demand for Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide products increased in comparison to last year's first quarter, along with favorable currency movement. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $294 million, an 85 percent year-over-year increase. Results were driven by higher Ti-Pure™ titanium dioxide sales, partially offset by increased variable costs, including distribution costs and expected raw material costs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other represented a negative $43 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased $2 million versus the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily related to higher long-term compensation costs.\nThe company realized an effective tax rate of approximately 22 percent in the quarter. The company expects its effective tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be in the low-twenties on a percentage basis, reflecting the company's anticipated geographic mix of earnings and US tax reform impacts.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, gross consolidated debt was $4.2 billion. Debt, net of $1.4 billion cash, was $2.7 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.7 times on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nOn April 3, 2018, Chemours refinanced its current credit agreement, providing for a new seven-year senior secured term loan facility and a new five-year $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The term loan was issued with two tranches, a $900 million portion and a €350 million portion. In addition, the company modified certain terms and conditions of its credit agreement to allow for more operational flexibility.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter was $196 million, versus $41 million in the previous year quarter. Working capital for the quarter was a use of $192 million of cash, consistent with normal seasonal patterns.\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter 2018 were $102 million, versus $69 million in last year's first quarter, reflecting the investments in the construction of the Opteon™ refrigerants and mining solutions facilities. The company expects its capital expenditures for the full-year 2018 to be within a range of $475 to $525 million. Free Cash Flow for the first quarter was $94 million, a $122 million improvement versus the previous-year quarter of negative $28 million.\nOutlook\nVergnano remarked, \"Given our strong first quarter results and visibility into the rest of 2018, we are reiterating our expectation that earnings will be at the high end of our previously announced range. We have modified the corresponding Adjusted EPS range to reflect our lower share count. We also expect to deliver over $700 million Free Cash Flow in 2018. Our anticipated 2018 performance is indicative of the high returns we believe Chemours can deliver over the next three-years.\"\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Chemours will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 8:30 AM EDT.

non-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit costs, which represent the components of net periodic pension (income) costs excluding the service cost component; exchange (gains) losses included in other income (expense), net; restructuring, asset-related, and other charges, net; asset impairments; (gains) losses on sale of business or assets; and, other items not considered indicative of the Company's ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Chemours, adjusted for items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, except interest expense, depreciation, amortization, and certain provision for (benefit from) income tax amounts.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\nNet income attributable to Chemours\n$\n297\n$\n150\n$\n228\nNon-operating pension and other post-retirement employee benefit income\n(7)\n(8)\n(10)\nExchange gains\n—\n(5)\n—\nRestructuring, asset-related, and other charges, net\n10\n12\n26\nGain on sale of assets or businesses (1)\n(42)\n(16)\n(8)\nLegal and other charges (2)\n4\n7\n—\nAdjustments made to income taxes (3,5)\n(5)\n(10)\n(3)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes relating to reconciling items (4,5)\n9\n1\n(4)\nAdjusted Net Income\n266\n131\n229\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n—\n1\n—\nInterest expense, net\n52\n51\n54\nDepreciation and amortization\n70\n71\n69\nAll remaining provision for income taxes (5)\n80\n31\n42\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n468\n$\n285\n$\n394\n(1)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, gain on sale includes a $42 gain associated with the sale of the Company's Linden, New Jersey site.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017, gain on sale includes a $9 gain associated with the sale of the Company's land in Repauno, New Jersey that was previously deferred and realized upon meeting certain milestones, net of certain losses on other disposals.\n(2)\nIncludes litigation settlements, water treatment accruals, and other charges.\n(3)\nIncludes the removal of certain discrete income tax impacts within the Company's provision for income taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the adjustment is primarily attributable to windfall benefits on the Company's share-based payments of $5 and $10, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment is primarily attributable to a benefit for the net impact of U.S. tax reform, which amounted to $3.\n(4)\nThe income tax impacts included in this caption are determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which income or expense occurred and include both current and deferred income tax expense or benefit based on the nature of the non-GAAP financial measure.\n(5)\nThe total provision for income taxes reconciles to the amount reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Chemours Company\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Earnings per Share to GAAP Earnings per Share Reconciliation\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted Adjusted EPS accounts for the dilutive impact of stock-based compensation awards, which includes unvested restricted shares. Diluted Adjusted EPS considers the impact of potentially-dilutive securities, except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potentially-dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to Chemours\n$\n297\n$\n150\n$\n228\nAdjusted Net Income\n266\n131\n229\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding - basic\n182,069,982\n183,408,309\n185,445,024\nDilutive effect of the Company's employee compensation plans\n6,263,215\n5,741,621\n6,553,935\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding - diluted\n188,333,197\n189,149,930\n191,998,959\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n1.63\n$\n0.82\n$\n1.23\nEarnings per share - diluted\n1.58\n0.79\n1.19\nAdjusted earnings per share - basic\n1.46\n0.72\n1.23\nAdjusted earnings per share - diluted\n1.41\n0.70\n1.19\n2018 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA to 2018 Estimated GAAP Net Income Reconciliation (*)\n(Estimated)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nLow\nHigh\nNet income attributable to Chemours\n$\n985\n$\n1,080\nOther adjustments\n(45)\n(45)\nRestructuring, asset-related, and other charges, net\n35\n25\nProvision for income taxes relating to reconciling items (1)\n5\n5\nAdjusted Net Income\n980\n1,065\nInterest expense, net\n220\n220\nDepreciation and amortization\n280\n280\nAll remaining provision for income taxes\n295\n285\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,775\n$\n1,850\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic (2)\n179,000,000\n179,000,000\nDilutive effects of Chemours' employee compensation plans (2)\n6,000,000\n6,000,000\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - diluted (2)\n185,000,000\n185,000,000\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n5.50\n$\n6.03\nEarnings per share - diluted\n5.32\n5.84\nAdjusted earnings per share - basic\n5.47\n5.95\nAdjusted earnings per share - diluted\n5.30\n5.76\n(1)\nThe income tax impacts included in this caption are determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which income or expense occurred and include both current and deferred income tax expense or benefit based on the nature of the non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2)\nThe Company's estimates for the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted reflect results for the year ended December 31, 2017, which are carried forward for the projection period and updated for the estimated impacts of the Company's 2018 share repurchase and other activity on a weighted-average basis.\n(*)\nThe Company's estimates reflect its current visibility and expectations of market factors, such as, but not limited to: currency movements, titanium dioxide prices, and end-market demand.
