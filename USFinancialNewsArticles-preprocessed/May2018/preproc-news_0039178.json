    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Duos\") (OTCQB:DUOT) , a provider of advanced intelligent security and analytical technology solutions, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Operational Highlights\nAwarded multi-million-dollar contract from CN, a leading North American Class-1 transportation and logistics company (NYSE:CNI), to implement new measures targeted at preventative maintenance, improved reliability, dwell reduction and overall performance Awarded a roughly $2.8 million contract by one of the nation's largest retail chains to streamline and automate gatehouse operations across the corporation's national distribution centers to deliver significant operational efficiencies for a rapid return on investment Appointed technology entrepreneur and veteran C-Level Executive Noel A. Heiks as President and Chief Operating Officer of its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Duos Technologies, Inc. Awarded contract for a pilot program to develop inspection technology for U.S. Government Emergency Housing Program, using a first of its kind rapid deployment inspection portal that validates emergency mobile housing units manufactured for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and ensure that they comply with manufacturing specifications Completed deployment of the pilot project for New York City Transit Authority’s track intrusion detection program Continued implementation of a branch and HQ security project at a Texas bank\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased 11% to $1.1 million from $1.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in total revenue was largely the result of an increase in project revenue, offset by a decrease in maintenance, technical support and IT asset management services. The revenue increase in projects is a result of an ongoing transition to new offerings, including intelligent analytics and machine learning from the Company’s traditional legacy security-centric offerings.\nGross profit increased 18% to $477,000, or 42% of total revenue, compared to $404,000, or 39% of total revenue, for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was mainly the result of the increase in project revenues and the positive effect of new projects achieving gross margins close to historical norms. The increase was partially offset by certain accounting changes related to the implementation of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\nOperating expenses were $1.2 million compared to $1.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses, professional expenses and general and administration expenses. The decrease was offset by a less than 5% increase in salaries, wages and contract labor and research and development expenses as the Company prepares for the implementation of new projects going forward.\nNet loss totaled $743,000, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million, or $(1.21) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in net loss was primarily attributable to the non-cash charges incurred for 2017 in debt discount expense and warrant derivative loss on debt related to bridge financing, which has now been eliminated.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, the Company expects its total revenue to be at least $9.3 million, representing a 146% increase compared to $3.9 million reported in 2017. This guidance is based on numerous contracts in backlog that are already performing and scheduled to be executed during or before the 4 th quarter of this year. Additional awards are expected during the course of the year\nManagement Commentary\n“2017 served as a transition year for Duos and was also a prelude to the growth we anticipate in 2018 and beyond. We have focused on maturing our various technologies under development and are now reaching the stage where we will be able to scale exponentially within our identified target markets,” said company Chief Executive Officer Gianni Arcaini. “In addition, with our now bolstered balance sheet, we believe that Duos is in prime position, and with the necessary resources to drive substantial topline expansion both this year and beyond. With recent multi-million-dollar awards in two of our target market segments, we now not only have validation for our entries into those industries, but we have also created the foundation to achieve sustainability over the long-term. Looking ahead, we now have the visibility and confidence to provide revenue guidance for the full year of 2018 of $9.3 million, which if achieved would represent a nearly 150% increase over 2017.”\nConference Call\nDuos Technologies management will host a conference call on Thursday, May 17 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Thursday, May 17, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time)\nU.S. dial-in: (888) 419-5570\nInternational dial-in: +(617) 896-9871\nPasscode: 23287594\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
