    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 7:01 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago White House says China trade talks to resume in Washington next week Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - China’s top economic official will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks with the Trump administration, the White House said on Monday, after discussions in Beijing last week failed to produce agreement on a long list of U.S. trade demands. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He attends the news conference following the closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC), at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n“We are working on something that we think will be great for everybody,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters at a regular White House press briefing.\n“China’s top economic adviser, the vice premier (Liu He), will be coming here next week to continue the discussions with the president’s economic team,” she said.\nSanders offered no further details on arrangements for the talks.\nA seven-member U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin presented Liu and other Chinese officials with a list of demands to address allegations of intellectual property theft and other trade policies that Washington considers unfair.\nThose included slashing the U.S. trade deficit with China by $200 billion, cutting tariffs and eliminating subsidies for advanced technology, according to people familiar with the demands.\nChina requested that President Donald Trump back off his tariff threats, reassess a Commerce Department ban on U.S. firms selling components and software to Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp ( 000063.SZ ) ( 0763.HK ) and treat Chinese investments equally under U.S. security reviews.\nThe two sides failed to reach any consensus in two days of talks but agreed to continue discussions.\nTrump met with the U.S. delegation in Washington over the weekend to assess the meetings. He tweeted that China had “become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins.”\nChinese state media struck an optimistic tone over the weekend, with the English-language China Daily newspaper saying a mechanism to keep an open trade dialogue was a “positive development, despite “big differences.”\nTrump’s administration has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese import goods over allegations that Beijing misappropriates U.S. technology through joint-venture requirements, unfair technology licensing practices, outright theft and state-backed acquisitions of U.S. technology firms.\nChina denies that its policies coerce foreign firms to transfer technology to Chinese competitors. It has said its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including soybeans and aircraft, will go into effect if the U.S. duties are imposed.
