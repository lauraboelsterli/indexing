    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE American:IOR), a Dallas-based real estate investment company, today reported results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOur primary business is investing in real estate and mortgage note receivables. Land held for development or sale is our sole operating segment. The Company has invested in over 170 acres of land held for development or sale in Farmers Branch, Texas. The project, in total, is a 1,200 acre assembly of properties at the demographic center of the Dallas – Fort Worth Metroplex. Surrounded by three major highways and adjacent to current and future public transportation systems, the project is in a prime location for future growth and development.\nRevenues\nLand held subject to a sales contract is our sole operating segment. There was no income generated from this segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018, nor for the prior period ended March 31, 2017.\nExpenses\nThere were no property operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as there were no property operating expenses during the prior period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $123,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $7,000, as compared to the prior period general and administrative expenses of $130,000. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in regular audit and tax fees offset by an increase in administration expenses paid to a related party.\nAdvisory fees were $164,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $2,000, as compared to the prior period advisory fees of $162,000. Advisory fees are computed based on a gross asset fee of 0.0625% per month (0.75% per annum) of the average of the gross asset value.\nNet income fee decreased $7,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $53,000, compared to $60,000 during the prior period. The net income fee paid to our Advisor is calculated at 7.5% of net income.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income was $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of approximately $100,000 as compared to interest income of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the receivable amount owed from our Advisor.\nAbout Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc.\nIncome Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc., a Dallas-based real estate investment company, holds a portfolio of equity real estate in Texas, including undeveloped land.
