    "text": "Michael Wacha allowed two hits over 6 2/3 innings to help the St. Louis Cardinals record a 6-1 victory over the host Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday at Miller Park.\nHarrison Bader and Francisco Pena each went 3-for-4 with a homer while Matt Carpenter also went deep for the Cardinals.\nJedd Gyorko went 2-for-5 with a two-run single as St. Louis won for the third time in its past four contests.\nThe right-handed Wacha (6-1) was charged with one run while winning his sixth straight decision. He struck out three and walked four.\nMilwaukee had just three hits as it saw its four-game winning streak come to a halt. The setback was just the Brewers’ third in the past 13 games.\nRight-hander Zach Davies (2-5) gave up five runs and eight hits over five innings. He struck out four and walked three.\nWacha pitched four no-hit innings before giving up a single to Hernan Perez to start the fifth.\nHe walked Ryan Braun to open the seventh before retiring the next two batters. Eric Sogard followed with a single to left to finish Wacha’s night. Right-hander Sam Tuivailala entered and gave up Jonathan Villar’s run-scoring double to right-center field. Tuivailala ended the threat by striking out Lorenzo Cain.\nRight-hander Jordan Hicks struck out four in two perfect innings to close it out.\nBader started a four-run second-inning uprising by belting a 2-2 curveball from Davies over the wall in left-center. St. Louis followed by loading the bases before Wacha struck out for the first out of the frame.\nCarpenter walked on five pitches to force in a run and Gyorko followed with the two-run single to make it 4-0.\nCarpenter led off the fourth by depositing a 1-1 curveball from Davies over the fence in right-center to make it 5-0.\nAfter Milwaukee stopped the shutout in the seventh, Pena sent an 0-1 offering from left-hander Dan Jennings over the fence in center with two out in the eighth.\nMilwaukee shortstop Tyler Saladino departed the game in the third inning with a left ankle sprain after awkwardly touching second base during a force play. X-rays were negative, the Brewers announced.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
