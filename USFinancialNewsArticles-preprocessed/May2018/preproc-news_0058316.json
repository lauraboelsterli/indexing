    "text": "RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nKaskela Law LLC announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed against Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) (“Fluor” or the “Company”) on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired the Company’s securities between August 14, 2013 and May 3, 2018 , inclusive (the “Class Period”).\nThe shareholder class action complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and certain of its senior executive officers made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose to investors that: (i) Fluor’s bidding process for gas-fired projects was flawed; (ii) Fluor had improperly estimated gas-fired projects; (iii) as a result, Fluor would face craft productivity issues, equipment issues and other execution issues; (iv) Fluor would incur multiple charges impacting its financial results; and (v) Fluor would ultimately decide to discontinue the pursuit of the gas-fired power market.\nOn May 3, 2018, Fluor reported a quarterly net loss of $18 million ($0.13 per diluted share) and disclosed that the quarterly results “include an after-tax charge of approximately $96 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project.” Additionally, the Company reduced its 2018 earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance from $3.10 – $3.50 per diluted share down to $2.10 – $2.50 per diluted share, “due in large part to forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project.”\nFollowing this news, shares of the Company’s stock declined $13.23 per share, or over 22%, to close on May 4, 2018 at $45.76, on heavy trading volume.\nIMPORTANT DEADLINE: Investors who purchased Fluor securities during the Class Period may, no later than July 24, 2018 , seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the investor class.\nFluor investors are encouraged to contact Kaskela Law LLC (D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq.) at (484) 258 – 1585 or (888) 715 – 1740, or via www.kaskelalaw.com/case/fluor , to discuss their legal rights and options with respect to this action prior to July 24, 2018 .
