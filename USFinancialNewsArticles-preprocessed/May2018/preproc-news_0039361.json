    "text": "May 17 (Reuters) - English champions Manchester City’s record-breaking campaign earned them 149.4 million pounds ($201.7 million) from the Premier League but they were just beaten by rivals Manchester United in the earnings table.\nUnited, who finished second in the league, received 149.7 million pounds as they had two more games televised than City during the campaign.\nLiverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal were the only other clubs to earn more than 140 million pounds.\nWest Bromwich Albion, who were relegated to the Championship (second-tier) after finishing last, received 94.7 million pounds.\nThe 2017-18 campaign was the second under a 5.1 billion pound domestic TV rights deal signed in 2015, with 20 clubs splitting a total of 2.4 billion pounds in central payments.\nThe payments include broadcast and commercial income plus prize money.
