    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 3:18 PM / a few seconds ago COMAC says China-Russia widebody jet gets engine proposals from 7 suppliers Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - The China-Russia partnership building a widebody plane has received proposals from seven foreign and local companies to supply the jetâ€™s engine, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said on Wednesday.\nCOMAC and United Aircraft Corporation issued the request for a proposal to engine makers in December and had stipulated a deadline of end-May.\nThe Chinese state planemaker said in a statement on its website that it would now set up a China-Russia team to analyze the proposals and would aim to complete their evaluations before the end of the year.\nIt did not identify which companies had submitted proposals or say how many proposals there were in total. A spokesman for the company declined to provide further comment.\nRolls Royce told the state-run China Daily newspaper in April that it planned to bid.\nChina has been investing billions of dollars into developing jets to raise its profile in global aviation and to disrupt the current Boeing Co and Airbus SE duopoly.\nThe company, which sent its C919 narrowbody jet on its maiden flights last year, wants the C929 wide-body to eventually take 10 percent of a market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.
