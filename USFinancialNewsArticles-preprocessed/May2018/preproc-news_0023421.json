    "text": "Conference call at 4:30 p.m. EDT today, May 10\nWIXOM, Mich., Rockwell Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RMTI), a fully-integrated specialty pharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative products and services for the treatment of iron replacement, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis, reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nSales were $14.9 million, an increase of 2.4% over the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was $29,507, compared with $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017; gross profit from our concentrate business was offset by expenses related to our drug business. Net Loss for the first quarter of 2018 was ($6.5) million or ($0.13) per share compared to ($4.7) million or ($0.09) per share in the first quarter of 2017. Cash and investments were $28.1 million at March 31, 2018. Cash used in operating activities was $4.6 million, which included $0.5 million for a shareholder settlement in the first quarter. Net working capital was $35.8 million at March 31, 2018.\nCorporate Highlights\nThere are proposals before the U.S. Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide separate reimbursement for Triferic. Data reported from clinics using Triferic via the drug sample program continues to show favorable clinical benefits for patients and cost savings for providers. Completed the clinical equivalence study for Triferic IV infusion presentation enabling near-term FDA submission for marketing approval. Met with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and received Final Scientific Advice confirming clinical study design for European regulatory approval. Presented Triferic data at the 2018 Asia Pacific Congress of Nephrology, March 27-31 in Beijing, China. Presented Triferic data in pediatric patients and in patients on intraperitoneal dialysis at the Annual Dialysis Conference, March 3-6, in Orlando, Florida. Presented data on the pharmacokinetics of Triferic in Peritoneal Dialysis patients at the International Congress on Peritoneal Dialysis, May 5-8 in Vancouver, Canada.\nMr. Robert L. Chioini, Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell stated, “We continue to work with federal policymakers to obtain separate reimbursement for Triferic. Our work with policy makers in Washington D.C. to ensure hemodialysis patients across the U.S. will have access to new, innovative therapies like Triferic continues to move in the right direction. There has been recent emphasis on spurring innovation in the U.S. renal market by those in Washington and we have strong support from key members of Congress and from senior officials within the Administration to make our innovative therapy accessible to the estimated 500,000 hemodialysis patients in the United States. Although we cannot be certain, based on our progress to date, we believe that Triferic has the potential to be granted separate reimbursement.”\nConference Call Information\nRockwell Medical will be hosting a conference call to review its 2018 first quarter today, Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Investors are encouraged to call a few minutes in advance at (866) 548-4713, or for international callers (323) 794-2093, Conference ID #3644040. To listen to the call via webcast, please go to the Rockwell Medical IR web page: http://ir.rockwellmed.com/\nAbout Triferic\nTriferic is the only FDA approved drug indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients suffering from anemia. Via dialysate during each dialysis treatment, Triferic replaces the 5-7 mg iron loss that occurs in all patients, effectively maintaining their iron balance. Unlike IV iron products, Triferic binds iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entering the blood and it is then transported directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no anaphylaxis, addressing a significant unmet need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in ESRD patients. Please visit www.triferic.com to view the Triferic mode-of-action (MOA) video and for more information.\nAbout Rockwell Medical, Inc.\nRockwell Medical, Inc. (“Rockwell”) is a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative products and services for the treatment of iron deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis.\nRockwell’s FDA approved drug Triferic is indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients suffering from anemia. Triferic delivers iron to patients during their regular dialysis treatment, using dialysate as the delivery mechanism. Triferic has demonstrated that it safely and effectively delivers sufficient iron to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin, without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Rockwell intends to market Triferic to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market and globally.\nRockwell’s FDA approved generic drug Calcitriol is indicated for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Calcitriol (active vitamin D) injection is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. It has been shown to significantly reduce elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Reduction of PTH has been shown to result in an improvement in renal osteodystrophy. Rockwell intends to market Calcitriol to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market.\nRockwell is also an established manufacturer and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. As one of the two major suppliers in the U.S., Rockwell’s dialysis concentrate products are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient’s bloodstream. Rockwell has three U.S. manufacturing/distribution facilities.\nRockwell’s novel renal drug therapies support disease management initiatives to improve the quality of life and care of dialysis patients and are intended to deliver safe and effective therapy, while decreasing drug administration costs and improving patient convenience. Rockwell has also obtained licenses for certain dialysis related drugs which we are developing and planning to market globally.
