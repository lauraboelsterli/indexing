The Italian marque is part of the Fiat Chrysler group, whose chief executive Sergio Marchionne is also head of sportscar maker Ferrari.\nSauber team principal Frederic Vasseur said in a statement, a day after the Monaco Grand Prix, that Resta would start on July 1.\nSauber, currently ninth of 10 teams in the championship, parted company with previous technical director Joerg Zander earlier in May.
