The euro sign in front of the former headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) is reflected in a puddle during heavy rain in Frankfurt, Germany, November 20, 2017. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\nThe polls were taken by the Euromedia and Piepoli organizations for state television Rai’s “Porta a Porta” program broadcast on Wednesday night.\nThe euro has become part of the political debate ahead of snap elections expected for later this year or early in 2019.\nThe Piepoli poll showed that 72 percent wanted to stay, 23 percent wanted to leave, and five percent were undecided.\nThe Euromedia poll showed that 60 percent wanted to stay, 24 percent wanted to leave, and 16 percent were undecided.
