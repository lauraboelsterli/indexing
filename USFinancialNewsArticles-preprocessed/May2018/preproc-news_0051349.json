The intern will also produce a personalized batch of chewing gum.\nAfter completion of the internship, there is an additional bonus of one year's worth of free candy.\nThe connoisseur will also have the opportunity to interview business leaders within the company; be a part of social media strategy content development; lead ideation and planning for Chicago-based Mars Volunteer Program events; and support the global Mars Wrigley Corporate Affairs team on media relations campaigns.\nTravel is required, including trips to factory locations in key Illinois cities, like Yorkville (where Juicy fruit, Doublemint and Skittles are made); Oak Park (where Dove and Snickers are made); and Mars ice cream operation in Burr Ridge.\nApplicants must be 21 or older and, according to the job listing , \"possess the mindset of a kid in a candy shop.\"\nThe deadline is June 1.",
