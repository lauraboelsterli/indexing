    "text": "MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - Libya will return to Egypt on Monday the bodies of 20 Egyptian Christians killed in 2015 by Islamic State in its former Libyan stronghold of Sirte, a Libyan security official said.\nA member of the Coptic Orthodox clergy stands beside posters, purporting to show the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians kidnapped in Libya, during a prayer service at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City February 18, 2015. REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo The bodies were recovered in October after the area where they were buried was recaptured from the jihadist group.\nThe Coptic Christians were beheaded on a beach in February 2015 wearing orange jumpsuits, according to a video posted by Islamic State.\nTheir bodies will be flown from the western city of Misrata to Egypt, a Libyan official said, adding that there was an additional victim from Ghana. A total of 21 people were beheaded in the incident.\nIslamic State took control of Sirte in 2015 and lost the city late last year to local forces backed by U.S. air strikes.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami and Ayman Salhi; writing by Ulf Laessing; editing by John Stonestreet and Jason Neely\n ",
