The deal officially closed on April 30, 2018. RSC Chemical Solutions will continue to sell and market products under the GUNK®, LIQUID WRENCH® and TITESEAL® brands.\nThe decisions to divest the MOTOR MEDIC brand is part of RSC's broader strategy to focus more resources against the GUNK and LIQUID WRENCH branded businesses as well as its emerging RSC Bio Solutions platform, which are increasingly driving commercial opportunities beyond the automotive aftermarket.
