    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Zynex, Inc. (OTCQB: ZYXI), an innovative medical technology company specializing in the manufacture and sale of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, stroke rehabilitation, cardiac monitoring and neurological diagnostics, today announced that its board of directors approved a program to buy back an additional $2 million of the Company's common stock. The new program will commence on May 14, 2018 and is scheduled to terminate on May 13, 2019 or when the $2 million buyback limit is reached. The Company previously re-purchased 495,091 shares of its common stock under a prior buyback program from December 6, 2017 through March 6, 2018.\nIn making the announcement, Zynex President and CEO Thomas Sandgaard stated, \"We are committed to delivering shareholder value, and this buyback program authorization reflects the board's confidence in both our short-term prospects and our long term growth strategy. We believe that the current market value of our shares does not accurately reflect the underlying value of the Company and the buyback program represents an attractive opportunity to deploy capital in a way that will benefit stockholders.\"\nUnder the share buyback program, buybacks may be made from time-to-time in open market and negotiated purchases, effective immediately through the next twelve months. These buybacks will be made in compliance with the SEC's Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, available liquidity, cash flow, applicable legal requirements and other factors. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to finance the purchases with existing cash balances.\nZynex, Inc. had approximately 33.1 million shares issued and 32.6 million shares outstanding as of May 11, 2018.\nAbout Zynex\nZynex, founded in 1996, markets and sells its own design of electrotherapy medical devices used for pain management and rehabilitation; and the company's proprietary NeuroMove device designed to help recovery of stroke and spinal cord injury patients.
