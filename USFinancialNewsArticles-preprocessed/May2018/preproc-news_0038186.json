    "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Document Security Systems, Inc. (NYSE American:DSS), (“DSS”), a leader in anti-counterfeit, authentication, and diversion protection technologies whose products and solutions are used by governments, corporations and financial institutions to defeat fraud and to help ensure product authenticity, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe first quarter of 2018 was a slow quarter for our Printed Products group which negatively impacted first quarter results. While disappointing, this result was not completely unexpected since this group had its biggest quarter ever in sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. When looking at the past 6 months, revenues for the printed products group were down 1.4% from the comparable six-month period ending March 31, 2017. We continue to be very positive about our Printed Products group’s performance, with expectations that revenues will strengthen during the remainder of 2018. “Technology sales experienced significant revenue growth driven by a 172% increase in first quarter revenue from our AuthentiGuard product line,” stated Jeff Ronaldi, CEO of DSS. “Also impacting the quarter was the increase in costs associated with the expansion into the Asia Pacific market, in particular, the commencement of operations in Hong Kong, where we have begun selective sales and marketing efforts. We have also initiated a research project with the Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies to assist with the adaptation of blockchain technology for product authentication. In addition, this group has become an integral resource for the continuing software development requirements for AuthentiGuard as our customers expand their usage of the product internationally. We are very excited about the Hong Kong office and the early successes we have already realized,” added Ronaldi.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 8% to $4.4 million from $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Printed Products revenue decrease of 11% offset by increase in Technology sales by 23%.\nNet Loss during the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $406,000 ($0.02 per share), as compared to a net loss of $184,000 ($0.01 per share) during the first quarter of 2017.\nCosts and expenses for the first quarter totaled $4.7 million, a decrease of 3% from $4.9 million during the same period of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the first quarter of 2018 remained positive and was approximately $15,000 as compared to $391,000 for the first quarter of 2017, which represents a 96% decrease. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by decreases in revenue at the Company’s Printed Products divisions and costs for the expansion into Hong Kong.\nABOUT DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEMS, INC.\nFor over 15 years, Document Security Systems, Inc.

The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company’s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management, and evaluate potential acquisitions. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities. The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA loss:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change (unaudited) (unaudited) Net loss: $ (406,000 ) $ (184,000 ) 121 % Add backs: Depreciation & amortization 346,000 343,000 1 % Stock based compensation 1,000 134,000 -99 % Interest, net 46,000 58,000 -21 % Amortized debt discount 28,000 35,000 -20 % Income tax expense - 5,000 -100 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,000 $ 391,000 -96 % Adjusted EBITDA, by group (unaudited) Printed Products $ 551,000 $ 773,000 -29 % Technology (309,000 ) (79,000 ) 291 % Corporate (227,000 ) (303,000 ) -25 % 15,000 391,000 -96 %\nSource:Document Security Systems Inc.",
