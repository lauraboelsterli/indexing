    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning,\nThe China Gambit A U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arrived in China today with a list of requests for President Xi Jinping, but the Chinese leader’s economic strategy and domestic constituencies make any compromise difficult. Mr. Xi may be China’s most powerful leader in decades, but he faces a test of that strength as he tries to avert a trade war with the U.S. The Journal reports that the Trump administration is considering restricting some Chinese companies’ ability to sell telecom equipment in the U.S., which would escalate a growing feud. The affected companies likely would include Huawei and ZTE, two of the world’s leading telecommunications-equipment makers. The Pentagon is moving to halt the sale of phones made by both companies in retail outlets on U.S. military bases around the world, citing potential security threats.\nStormy’s Cash President Trump repaid his longtime attorney , Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 payment Mr. Cohen made to a former adult film star in October 2016 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said. His remarks reversed what appeared to be a long-running effort by Mr. Cohen and the White House to distance the president from the payment to Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, though Mr. Giuliani did suggest the payment was made without Mr. Trump’s knowledge at the time.\nTech Fortunes Tesla’s first-quarter results weren’t as bad as Wall Street feared. That should be of minimal consolation to its shareholders . The electric-vehicle giant burned through cash faster than analysts expected, intensifying pressure on the Silicon Valley auto maker to raise more capital, and CEO Elon Musk used the quarterly conference call to ridicule analysts’ questions . Spotify’s results hit a flat note. Shares of the music streamer took a hit after hours on Wednesday as its first earnings report as a publicly traded company met the company’s own guidance but fell short of Wall Street forecasts . The company’s own projections are little changed from the vision laid out to investors when it went public last month. Spotify will be judged mainly on its ability to maintain its rapid growth.\nSoured Marriage Elmer’s glue and Sharpie markers joined Crock-Pots and Yankee Candles in a $15 billion consumer-products megadeal. What could go wrong? A lot. Newell and Jarden, which had a combined market value of $22 billion before they joined two years ago, are now one company worth about $13 billion—one of the worst performances for a major deal since the financial crisis. The men who made the merger happen are now at odds. The combined company was supposed to have the clout to squeeze rivals, dominate store shelves and move quickly into online sales. Instead, the marriage has become a case study of the ways a deal can go bad, Journal reporter Sharon Terlep writes.\nStand in Line Apps may let you order ahead and skip the line at many food and drink retailers, but manners keep you queuing. Journal reporter Laura Stevens says a stubborn minority of app users go to the back of the line anyway—for courtesy, company or just to take a moment to relax. Line skippers sometimes “get the stink eye” because fellow patrons don’t know about the app. “I generally do not want to seem like an ass,” says Mitchell Burton, a 32-year-old Baton Rouge, La., parks and recreation worker. And Ashleigh Azzaria, a 34-year-old Palo Alto, Calif., event designer, says she typically chooses to wait in line for coffee at Starbucks despite having mobile app because “it’s my break.”\nToday’s Video Finding Common Ground President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un both say they want denuclearization, but the two define the word in different ways. Our reporter Shelby Holliday explains what each side means .\nTOP STORIES U.S. Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Cohen for Stormy Daniels Payment\nBody-Camera Footage From Las Vegas Shooting Released\nWORLD Pentagon Transfers Prisoner Out of Guantanamo in a First Under Trump\nKorean Peace Deal Wouldn’t Threaten U.S. Troop Presence, Seoul Says\nBUSINESS Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations After Data Controversy\nSprint CEO Claure to Step Aside\nMARKETS Xiaomi Picks Hong Kong for IPO; Seeks to Raise at Least $10 Billion\nFed on Course for Rate Increases\nNumber of the Day 200 The approximate number of phone calls that Amazon has made to cities that didn’t make the shortlist for its second headquarters .

Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on hotels’ switching to wall-mounted dispensers to save money and plastic, Jeanne Zielinski of Michigan weighed in: “Smart. Saving money and cutting back on plastics in landfills. To me it’s a no-brainer.” James Petroski of Ohio shared: “I can’t imagine a worse situation than showering the morning of an important meeting to discover no shampoo in the dispenser. I’m certainly not letting housekeeping in to refill it while I’m wet and wrapped in a towel. At least the small bottle is a quick visual indicator.” And Jack Finger of South Quote: : “I have almost broken my thumbnail or had to use teeth to get the top open on those plastic bottles. And, not wearing my glasses in the shower, I could not read the tiny font to determine which bottle had shampoo or conditioner or body wash. For these reasons I fully support the change.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories. Technically, “10-point” referred to the size of the typeface. The type is smaller now but the name lives on.\nSign up here for a curated weekly tour of WSJ’s unique take on the sports world including news, smart features, data and Jason Gay.\nThe 10-Point In Your Inbox CLICK HERE to sign up for this briefing by email.",
