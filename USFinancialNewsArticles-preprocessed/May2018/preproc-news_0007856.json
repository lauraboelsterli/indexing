    "text": "Carlsberg's first-quarter sales fell 5 percent, weighed by a negative currency impact and lower volumes in the key Russian market where its market share continued to decline, the Danish\nbrewer said on Tuesday.\nFirst-quarter sales came in at 12.70 billion crowns ($2.06 billion), below the 12.89 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nThe company, which did not disclose earnings figures, said it still expected mid single-digit organic growth in operating profit this year.",
