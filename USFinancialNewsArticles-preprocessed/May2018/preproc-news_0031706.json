    "text": "MUMBAI, May 15 (Reuters) - Indian bonds and the rupee currency weakened to multi-month lows in early trade on Tuesday, as global crude oil prices inched up and the local inflation print came in higher than expected.\nThe 10-year benchmark bond yield rose 7 basis points to 7.90 percent on Tuesday, its highest since Aug. 25 2015, while the Indian rupee fell to 67.76 against the dollar, its weakest since Jan. 31, 2017 from its previous close of 67.50.\nMarkets are likely to remain volatile during the day ahead of Karnataka state election results due in a few hours.\nFor consumer inflation story, see: (Reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Abhirup Roy; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
