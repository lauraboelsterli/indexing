    "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqis voted on Saturday in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, a poll which could affect the balance of power in the Middle East.\nHere is how the new government will be formed, according to the Iraqi constitution, which specifies a 90-day process:\n*The Independent High Election Commission will announce the election results on Monday.\n*President Fouad Masoum will call the newly-elected parliament into session within 15 days of the announcement.\n*Lawmakers will elect a parliamentary Speaker and two deputies by an absolute majority within their first session.\n*Parliament will elect a new president by a two-thirds majority within 30 days of its first session.\n*The new president will within 15 days formally task the largest parliamentary bloc’s nominee with forming a government.\n*The prime minister-designate has 30 days to put together a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval.\n*Parliament must approve the government programme and each individual minister in separate absolute majority votes.\nIf the prime minister-designate fails to put together a governing coalition after 30 days, or if parliament rejects the prime minister-designate’s proposed cabinet, the president must nominate another candidate within 15 days.\nReporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ",
