    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s two largest parties, the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, both appeared to reject a call by President Sergio Mattarella to form a “neutral government”, saying early elections were preferable.\n“There is no time to lose, there is no space for technocrat government,” League leader Matteo Salvini said in a statement.\n5-Star’s parliamentary party leader Danilo Toninelli told state television Rai: “The only way to get a serious government is to return to the polls.”\nThe League and 5-Star have failed to agree on forming a coalition between themselves after an inconclusive election on March 4, but they have enough votes together in parliament to block any other government from taking office.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Toby Chopra\nOur ",
