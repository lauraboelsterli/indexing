    "text": "Reported record 1Q sales of $379 million, up 9% Organic sales growth + 4%, foreign exchange + 5% Record 1Q operating margin of 11.6%; up 130 bps on GAAP basis, up 50 bps on an adjusted basis Record 1Q EPS of $0.82, up 30% on GAAP basis, up 26% on adjusted basis\nNORTH ANDOVER, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: WTS) today announced results 2018.\n“Strong top-line growth along with productivity initiatives, drove record first quarter sales, operating margin and EPS,” commented Chief Executive Officer Robert J. Pagano Jr. “As anticipated, sales momentum from the second half of 2017 continued into the first quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing net debt by $50 million as a result of cash repatriation. Overall, the first quarter was in line with our expectations and puts us in a good position to achieve our 2018 outlook.”\nSales for the first quarter were $379 million, up 9% as compared to the same period last year. First quarter net income per diluted share (EPS) on both a GAAP and adjusted basis was $0.82, as compared to $0.63 on a GAAP basis and $0.65 on an adjusted basis for the prior-year period. EPS for the first quarter improved due to volume, productivity, a lower effective tax rate and favorable foreign exchange. A summary of first quarter results is as follows:\nFirst Quarter Earnings Summary (In millions, except per share information) 2018 2017 % Change Sales $ 378.5 $ 347.2 9.0 % Net income 28.2 21.7 30.0 % Diluted earnings per share $ 0.82 $ 0.63 30.2 % Special items (1) - 0.02 Adjusted earnings per share (1) $ 0.82 $ 0.65 26.2 % (1) Special items and adjusted earnings per share represent non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items please see the tables attached to this press release.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nOrganic sales were up 4% compared to the first quarter last year; adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points. Regionally: Americas: Organic sales increased 5% with broad growth in plumbing, drains, boiler and water quality products. Adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points, as benefits from higher volume, pricing and productivity were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, growth investments and increased commodity and transportation costs. Europe: Organic sales were up 2% driven by continued strength in our drains business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points driven by increased volume and productivity, offset in part by unfavorable product mix, higher commodity costs and incremental investments. APMEA: Organic sales increased 3%, which included a 5% headwind for planned product rationalization. Our product rationalization efforts represent the exit of low-margin, non-core products. Stronger sales in Korea, New Zealand, the Middle East, and China’s commercial valves offset continued softness in China’s heating market. Adjusted operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume and favorable product mix. For the first quarter of 2018, operating cash outflow was $26 million and net capital expenditures were $7 million, resulting in free cash outflow of $33 million. In the comparable period last year, operating cash outflow was $9 million, net capital expenditures were $6 million and free cash outflow was $15 million. Free cash outflow increased primarily due to incremental working capital outlays. The first quarter is a seasonally slow cash flow period and we expect continued improvement in free cash flow as the year progresses. The Company repatriated $71 million in cash during the first quarter, of which $60 million was used to reduce outstanding revolving debt. The Company repurchased approximately 80,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $6.2 million during the first quarter.\nFor a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items and a statement regarding the usefulness of these measures to investors and management in evaluating our operating performance, please see the tables attached to this press release.\nWatts Water Technologies, Inc. will hold a live webcast of its conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. EDT. This press release and the live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.wattswater.com . Following the webcast, an archived version of the call will be available at the same address until May 4, 2019.\nThe Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at the Company’s executive offices located at 815 Chestnut Street, North Andover, Massachusetts.\nWatts Water Technologies, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is a world leader in the manufacture of innovative products to control the efficiency, safety, and quality of water within residential, commercial, and institutional applications.

We believe that these financial measures enhance the overall understanding of our historical financial performance and give insight into our future prospects. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share eliminate certain expenses incurred and gains recognized in the periods presented that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, deployment costs, acquisition related costs, and the related income tax impacts on these items, and other tax adjustments. Management then utilizes these adjusted financial measures to assess the run-rate of the Company’s operations against those of comparable periods. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures from period-over-period comparisons. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, and allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Free cash outflow and the net debt to capitalization ratio, which are adjusted to exclude certain cash inflows and outlays, and include only certain balance sheet accounts from the comparable GAAP measures, are an indication of our performance in cash flow generation and also provide an indication of the Company's relative balance sheet leverage to other industrial manufacturing companies. The cash conversion rate of free cash outflow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. These non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our cash flow generation and our capitalization structure. In addition, free cash outflow is used as a criterion to measure and pay certain compensation-based incentives. For these reasons, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures can be useful to investors, potential investors and others. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTABLE 1 RECONCILIATION OF GAAP \"AS REPORTED\" TO THE \"ADJUSTED\" NON-GAAP EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR SPECIAL ITEMS (Amounts in millions, except per share information) (Unaudited) CONSOLIDATED RESULTS First Quarter Ended April 1, April 2, 2018 2017 Net sales $ 378.5 $ 347.2 Operating income - as reported $ 43.9 $ 35.7 Operating margin % 11.6 % 10.3 % Adjustments for special items: Acquisition costs - 0.2 Restructuring - 0.5 Americas, APMEA & Europe transformation costs - 2.0 Total adjustments for special items $ - $ 2.7 Operating income - as adjusted $ 43.9 $ 38.4 Adjusted operating margin % 11.6 % 11.1 % Net income - as reported $ 28.2 $ 21.7 Adjustments for special items - tax affected: Acquisition costs - 0.1 Restructuring - 0.4 Americas, APMEA & Europe transformation costs - 1.3 Tax adjustments - (1.2 ) Total Adjustments for special items - tax affected $ - $ 0.6 Net income - as adjusted $ 28.2 $ 22.3 Diluted earnings per share - as reported $ 0.82 0.63 Adjustments for special items - 0.02 Diluted earnings per share - as adjusted $ 0.82 $ 0.65 TABLE 2 SEGMENT INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP \"AS REPORTED\" TO THE \"ADJUSTED\" NON-GAAP EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR SPECIAL ITEMS (Amounts in millions) (Unaudited) First Quarter Ended First Quarter Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Americas Europe APMEA Corporate Total Americas Europe APMEA Corporate Total Net sales $ 241.1 123.0 14.4 - 378.5 $ 228.7 104.9 13.6 - 347.2 Operating income (loss) - as reported $ 36.4 14.9 1.4 (8.8 ) 43.9 $ 31.1 12.4 1.0 (8.8 ) 35.7 Operating margin % 15.1 % 12.1 % 9.4 % 11.6 % 13.6 % 11.8 % 7.4 % 10.3 % Adjustments for special items $ - - - - - $ 2.5 0.2 - - 2.7 Operating income (loss) - as adjusted $ 36.4 14.9 1.4 (8.8 ) 43.9 $ 33.6 12.6 1.0 (8.8 ) 38.4 Adjusted operating margin % 15.1 % 12.1 % 9.4 % 11.6 % 14.7 % 12.0 % 7.4 % 11.1 % TABLE 3 SEGMENT INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NET SALES TO ORGANIC SALES (Unaudited) First Quarter Ended Americas Europe APMEA Total Reported net sales April 1, 2018 $ 241.1 $ 123.0 $ 14.4 $ 378.5 Reported net sales April 2, 2017 228.7 104.9 13.6 347.2 Dollar change $ 12.4 $ 18.1 $ 0.8 $ 31.3 Net sales % increase 5.4 % 17.3 % 5.9 % 9.0 % Increase due to foreign exchange -0.3 % -15.2 % -3.3 % -4.9 % Organic sales increase 5.1 % 2.1 % 2.6 % 4.1 % TABLE 4 RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATIONS TO FREE CASH OUTFLOW (Amounts in millions) (Unaudited) First Quarter Ended April 1, April 2, 2018 2017 Net cash used in operations - as reported $ (26.1 ) $ (9.1 ) Less: additions to property, plant, and equipment (7.3 ) (5.8 ) Free cash outflow $ (33.4 ) $ (14.9 ) Net income - as reported $ 28.2 $ 21.7 Cash conversion rate of free cash outflow to net income -118.4 % -68.7 % TABLE 5 RECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT PORTION) TO NET DEBT AND NET DEBT TO CAPITALIZATION RATIO (Amounts in millions) (Unaudited) April 1, December 31, 2018 2017 Current portion of long-term debt $ 22.5 $ 22.5 Plus: Long-term debt, net of current portion 424.1 474.6 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (184.7 ) (280.2 ) Net debt $ 261.9 $ 216.9 Net debt $ 261.9 $ 216.9 Plus: Total stockholders' equity 855.8 829.0 Capitalization $ 1,117.7 $ 1,045.9 Net debt to capitalization ratio 23.4 % 20.7 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006655/en/\nWatts Water Technologies, Inc.\nTimothy M.
