The view along the Long Walk as spectators gather ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Windsor castle in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018.

It’s one of the most important days for England,” said Maria Kuntgen, a 35-year-old tourist from Brazil, at the memorial, where people had placed photos of Harry and Meghan.\nThat view was echoed by Roksana Arakelyan, a 32-year-old tourist from Moscow.\n“They are so noble, so gorgeous,” she said.\nFrance’s main TV stations all had teams reporting live from Windsor, while Le Parisien newspaper had a photo of Harry and Meghan dominating its front page.\nParisian David Andre Azoulay, 70, said he would watch the wedding on TV, although others were less enthusiastic.\n“I am very happy for them, but personally I’m not that bothered,” Gerard Le Gall told Reuters as he bought his papers at a kiosk opposite the Diana memorial.
