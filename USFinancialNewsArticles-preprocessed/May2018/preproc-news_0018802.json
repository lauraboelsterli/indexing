Margins primarily improved at the Company's:\nSouth America SBU, reflecting market reforms enacted in Argentina, as well as higher contracted pricing in Chile and Colombia; and US and Utilities SBU, due to lower maintenance costs and improved availability at generation facilities, as well as higher regulated rates at DPL in Ohio.\nDetailed Strategic Highlights\nOn track to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019 and attain investment grade ratings in 2020 Upgraded by S&P to BB+ and outlook revised by Moody's to Ba2 Positive Alto Maipo, a subsidiary AES Gener (67% owned by AES), finalized a new construction contract with Strabag and secured additional funding from project lenders, for the 531 MW Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile New agreement, which is expected to be effective this week upon completion of customary conditions, is fixed price and lump sum, transfers all geological risks to Strabag and provides a date certain for completion, with strong performance guarantees AES Gener will invest $200 million, which will be contributed to the project on a 50/50 basis, along with additional non-recourse debt, and an additional $200 million will be funded toward the project's completion in 2020, for a total of $400 million (AES ownership-adjusted $270 million) Commenced commercial operations of 671 MW Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana Remaining 3.8 GW under construction on schedule through 2020 Year-to-date, signed long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for 838 MW of renewables that are expected to begin construction later this year, including: sPower signed 15-year a PPA with Microsoft for 315 MW of solar in Virginia and a 30-year PPA for 220 MW of wind in South Dakota AES Distributed Energy signed PPAs of 17-25 years for 120 MW of solar in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island AES Argentina agreed to acquire the 100 MW Energetica wind development project in Argentina with a 20-year, U.S. Dollar-denominated PPA AES Argentina will use local debt capacity to fund the project Committed to adopt the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nGuidance and Expectations 1\nThe Company reaffirms its 2018 Adjusted EPS guidance of $1.15 to $1.25 and its average annual growth rate target of 8% to 10% through 2020. Growth in 2018 will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, cost savings and lower Parent interest.\nThe Company also reaffirms its 2018 Parent Free Cash Flow expectation of $600 million to $675 million.\nThe Company's 2018 guidance and expectations through 2020 are based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of March 31, 2018.\n1 Adjusted EPS and Parent Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See attached \"Non-GAAP Measures\" for definition of Adjusted EPS and see below for definition of Parent Free Cash Flow. The Company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent or reconciliation for its Adjusted EPS guidance without unreasonable effort. See \"Non-GAAP measures\" for a description of the adjustments to reconcile Adjusted EPS to Diluted EPS 2018. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Pre-Tax Contributions, as well as reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nParent Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an alternative to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Parent Free Cash Flow is equal to Subsidiary Distributions less cash used for interest costs, development, general and administrative activities, and tax payments by the Parent Company. Parent Free Cash Flow is used for dividends, share repurchases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the Parent Company.\nAttachments\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Segment Information, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Non-GAAP Measures and Parent Financial Information.\nConference Call Information\nAES will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).

(b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses and associated benefits and costs due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains or losses and associated benefits and costs due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company’s internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring activities, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the year beginning January 1, 2018, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS to exclude unrealized gains or losses from equity securities resulting from a newly effective accounting standard. We believe excluding these gains or losses provides a more accurate picture of continuing operations. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to equity securities remeasurement. The Company has also reflected these changes in the comparative period.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet of NCI (1)\nPer Share\n(Diluted) Net\nof NCI (1)\nNet of NCI (1) Per Share\n(Diluted) Net\nof NCI (1)\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to AES and Diluted EPS $ 685 $ 1.03 $ (24 ) $ (0.04 ) (2)\nAdd: Income tax expense from continuing operations attributable to AES 198 20 Pre-tax contribution $ 883 $ (4 ) Adjustments Unrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains) $ 12 $ 0.02 $ (1 ) $ — Unrealized foreign currency gains (3 ) — (9 ) (0.01 ) Disposition/acquisition losses (gains) (778 ) (1.17 ) (3)\n52 0.08 (4)\nImpairment expense — — 168 0.25 (5)\nLosses (gains) on extinguishment of debt 171 0.26 (6)\n(16 ) (0.02 ) (7)\nRestructuring costs 3 — — — Less: Net income tax expense (benefit) 0.14 (8)\n(0.09 ) (9)\nAdjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS $ 288 $ 0.28 $ 190 $ 0.17",
