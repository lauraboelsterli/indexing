    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DiamondRock Hospitality Company (the \"Company\") (NYSE: DRH), a lodging-focused real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of 30 premium hotels in the United States, today announced results of operations 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Income : Net income was $4.3 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.02. Comparable RevPAR : RevPAR was $157.38, a 1.8% increase from the comparable period of 2017. Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin : Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.42%, a 132 basis point contraction from the comparable period of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA was $43.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million from 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the hurricane-related closures of the Frenchman's Reef and Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort and Havana Cabana Key West. Adjusted FFO : Adjusted FFO was $33.7 million and Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.17. Hotel Acquisitions : The Company acquired The Landing Resort & Spa in South Lake Tahoe, California and the Hotel Palomar in Phoenix, Arizona on March 1, 2018. Business Interruption Insurance Income : The Company recognized $6.0 million of business interruption income during the quarter related to ongoing insurance claims for Frenchman's Reef and Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort, Havana Cabana Key West and the Lodge at Sonoma. Dividends : The Company declared a dividend of $0.125 per share during the first quarter, which was paid on April 12, 2018.\nMark W. Brugger, President and Chief Executive Officer of DiamondRock Hospitality Company stated, \"Lodging trends in the first quarter modestly exceeded our expectations and we are cautiously optimistic that this will continue for the balance of the year. Accordingly, we are pleased to be able to raise full year 2018 guidance. In the first quarter, DiamondRock remained focused on value-add capital allocation and strategically executed on internal and external growth opportunities. We took advantage of internal opportunities within the portfolio by investing over $25 million on hotel renovations to drive portfolio growth in net asset value. DiamondRock also grew its portfolio during the quarter with two exciting new acquisitions.\"\nOperating Results\nPlease see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this press release for an explanation of the terms \"EBITDAre,\" \"Adjusted EBITDA,\" \"Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin,\" \"FFO\" and \"Adjusted FFO\" and a reconciliation of these measures to net income. Comparable operating results include our 2018 and 2017 acquisitions for all periods presented and exclude the Frenchman's Reef and Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort (\"Frenchman's Reef\") and Havana Cabana Key West for all periods presented due to the closure of these hotels.

The pre-acquisition operating results were obtained from the seller of the hotels during the acquisition due diligence process. We have made no adjustments to the amounts provided to us by the seller. The pre-acquisition operating results were not audited or reviewed by the Company's independent auditors.\n(2) Actual operating results include Frenchman's Reef and Havana Cabana Key West and the operating results of hotels acquired for the Company's respective ownership periods.\nUpdate on Impact from Natural Disasters\nAs previously disclosed, the Company is pursuing insurance claims for the remediation of property damage and business interruption at Frenchman's Reef, Havana Cabana Key West and the Lodge at Sonoma. The Company is insured for up to $361 million for each covered event, subject to certain deductibles and other conditions. During the first quarter, the Company recognized $6.0 million of business interruption income for Frenchman's Reef, Havana Cabana Key West and the Lodge at Sonoma. The Company continues to negotiate with its insurers for additional business interruptions proceeds.\nFrenchman's Reef : The hotel was significantly damaged by last year's hurricanes and is expected to remain closed through 2019. The Company expects to receive insurance proceeds for its business interruption losses, including lost profits, during the closure period. The Company submitted its insurance claim during the first quarter and is working diligently with its insurance carriers and the USVI government to evaluate all alternatives to ensure the best outcome for its shareholders.\nHavana Cabana Key West : The Company substantially completed a comprehensive renovation and re-positioning of the hotel in connection with the remediation of substantial wind and water-related damage from Hurricane Irma. The hotel reopened as the Havana Cabana Key West in April 2018. The Company expects to receive insurance proceeds for its business interruption losses, including lost profits during the closure period.\nHotel Acquisitions\nOn March 1, 2018, the Company acquired the 77-room Landing Resort & Spa in South Lake Tahoe, California for $42 million, or $545,000 per key. The Landing is a premier luxury resort with one of the best locations in Lake Tahoe. Also on March 1, 2018, the Company acquired the 242-room Hotel Palomar in Phoenix, Arizona for $80 million, or $331,000 per key. The Hotel Palomar is a highly-rated boutique hotel located in the heart of the CityScape mixed-use project in downtown Phoenix.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company invested approximately $25.8 million in capital improvements at its hotels during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company expects to spend approximately $135 million for capital improvements in 2018. Significant projects that have been substantially completed to date include:\nChicago Marriott Downtown : The Company completed the final phase of the hotel's $110 million multi-year renovation during the first quarter, which included the remaining 258 of 1,200 guest rooms and the hotel's 60,000 square feet of meeting space. Havana Cabana Key West : The Company completed a comprehensive renovation of the hotel as part of the remediation of the substantial wind and water-related damage caused by Hurricane Irma. The hotel reopened as the Havana Cabana Key West in April 2018. Bethesda Marriott Suites : The Company substantially completed a renovation of the guest rooms at the hotel during the first quarter. Westin Boston Waterfront Hotel : The Company completed a refresh of the hotel's guest rooms during the first quarter.\nOther significant projects planned for the remainder of 2018 include:\nVail Marriott: The Company expects to renovate the hotel's guest rooms and meeting space to a luxury level in mid-2018 to help raise the average daily rate and close the rate gap with the hotel's luxury competitive set. Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort: The Company expects to renovate and upgrade the hotel's 432 guest rooms in 2018 to drive market share. Hotel Rex: In connection with joining the Viceroy Collection, the Company expects to complete a comprehensive renovation and re-positioning of the hotel in the fourth quarter of 2018. The hotel will close for approximately four months during renovation. The renovation is expected to be completed in time to take advantage of an expected strong 2019 lodging market in San Francisco. JW Marriott Denver: The Company expects to begin renovating the hotel's guest rooms, public space and meeting rooms in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the majority of the work occurring in 2019. The renovation is expected to secure the hotel's position as the top luxury hotel in the high-end Cherry Creek submarket of Denver.\nThe Company incurred approximately $2.0 million in renovation displacement of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018, primarily attributed to the renovations at the Chicago Marriott Downtown, Bethesda Marriott Suites and Westin Boston Waterfront. The Company anticipates approximately $4.0 million in additional renovation displacement of Hotel Adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of 2018, which is primarily attributable to the upgrade renovations at the Vail Marriott, Hotel Rex and Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. The displacement is expected to be approximately $1.0 million in the second quarter, and $1.5 million in each of the third and fourth quarters.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $69.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand and approximately $937.6 million of total debt, which primarily consisted of property-specific mortgage debt and $300.0 million of unsecured term loans. The Company has no outstanding borrowings on its $300.0 million senior unsecured credit facility and 22 of its 30 hotels are unencumbered by debt.\nDividends\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to stockholders of record as of March 29, 2018. The dividend was paid on April 12, 2018.\nGuidance\nThe Company is providing annual guidance for 2018, but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business. Achievement of the anticipated results is subject to the risks disclosed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparable RevPAR growth excludes Frenchman's Reef and Havana Cabana Key West and includes the Company's 2017 and 2018 acquisitions for all periods.\nBased on increased confidence in lodging fundamentals, the Company is raising its 2018 guidance and expects the full year 2018 results to be as follows:\nPrevious Guidance\nRevised Guidance\nChange at Midpoint\nMetric\nLow End\nHigh End\nLow End\nHigh End\nComparable RevPAR Growth\n0 percent\n2 percent\n1.5 percent\n2.5 percent\n+ 100bps\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$249 million\n$261 million\n$254 million\n$263 million\n+ $3.5 million\nAdjusted FFO\n$199 million\n$209 million\n$205 million\n$212 million\n+ $4.5 million\nAdjusted FFO per share (based on 202 million diluted shares)\n$0.99 per share\n$1.03 per share\n$1.01 per share\n$1.05 per share\n+ $0.02 per share\nThe guidance above incorporates the following assumptions:\nBusiness interruption insurance proceeds of approximately $20 million; Corporate expenses of $27 million to $28 million, excluding severance charges from the Company's CFO transition; Interest expense of $40 million to $41 million; and Income tax expense of $8 million to $11 million;\nThe Company expects approximately 29% to 30% of its full year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to be earned in the second quarter of 2018, which includes approximately $4.0 million of business interruption insurance income.\nSelected Quarterly Comparable Operating Information\nThe following table is presented to provide investors with selected quarterly comparable operating information.

These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nUse and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and FFO\nEBITDA represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate.\" EBITDAre represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) adjusted for: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control; (5) impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate; and (6) adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization, and in the case of EBITDAre, impairment and gains or losses on dispositions of depreciated property) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA and EBITDAre as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Nareit, which defines FFO as net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results.\nHotel EBITDA\nHotel EBITDA represents net income excluding: (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) corporate general and administrative expenses (shown as corporate expenses on the consolidated statements of operations), and (5) hotel acquisition costs. We believe that Hotel EBITDA provides our investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest), our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and our corporate-level expenses (corporate expenses and hotel acquisition costs). With respect to Hotel EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and third-party management companies have direct control. We believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nAdjustments to EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA\nWe adjust EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted FFO and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated and property-level operating performance. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as Hotel Adjusted EBITDA divided by total hotel revenues.\nWe adjust EBITDA, FFO and Hotel EBITDA for the following items:\nNon-Cash Ground Rent: We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight line recognition of rent from our ground lease obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable lease assets. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. Non-Cash Amortization of Favorable and Unfavorable Contracts: We exclude the non-cash amortization of the favorable and unfavorable contracts recorded in conjunction with certain acquisitions because the non-cash amortization is based on historical cost accounting and is of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle: Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company's actual underlying performance for the current period. Gains or Losses from Early Extinguishment of Debt: We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company's capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels. Hotel Acquisition Costs: We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Severance Costs: We exclude corporate severance costs incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations or structured severance programs because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Hotel Manager Transition Items: We exclude the transition items associated with a change in hotel manager because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Other Items: From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Such items may include, but are not limited to, the following: pre-opening costs incurred with newly developed hotels; lease preparation costs incurred to prepare vacant space for marketing; management or franchise contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; costs incurred related to natural disasters; and gains from insurance proceeds, other than income related to business interruption insurance.\nIn addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any fair value adjustments to debt instruments. We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following

We provide this important supplemental information to our investors because this information provides a useful means for investors to measure our operating performance on a comparative basis. See the column titled \"Comparable.\"\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP in this release. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations at our hotels that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. In particular, we note the pre-acquisition operating results set forth in the column titled \"Adjustments for Acquisitions\" were obtained from the respective sellers of the hotels during the acquisition due diligence process.
