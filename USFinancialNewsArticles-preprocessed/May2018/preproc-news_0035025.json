(OTCQB: MRMD), a professional management company in the emerging medical cannabis industry, today reported first quarter financial results for 2018, posting consecutive year over year increased Q1 quarterly revenue since 2015.\nMariMed Quarterly Revenue 2015 2016 2017 2018 Q1 $ 100,496 $ 610,541 $ 1,150,219 $ 2,082,950 Q2 $ 65,073 $ 714,434 $ 1,621,057 --- Q3 $ 428,555 $ 912,181 $ 1,915,697 --- Q4 $ 675,735 $ 1,326,964 $ 1,527,557 ---\n“MariMed continues on a solid trajectory of year over year growth that it has achieved each quarter since 2015,” stated Robert Fireman, CEO of MariMed Inc. “Our new Maryland cultivation and production facility, which came online in Q1, will bring increased rent, management and licensing fees, adding to our existing revenue streams from facilities in Illinois, Delaware, and Nevada. We anticipate increases in our revenue from our assets as the cannabis business in Maryland and Massachusetts continues to expand.”\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue: $2.08 million in first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.15 million first quarter of 2017, an increase of 81%. The increase is primarily due to the expanding operations of MariMed’s medical marijuana clients from real estate revenue, management fees and licensing fees.\nDebt Reduction: reduced liabilities by $1.5 million through the conversion of $0.98 million of promissory notes into Common Stock and retiring $500,000 of additional promissory notes.\nOPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS\nCorporate:\nCapital Raised: raised approximately $1.5 million in equity through the sale of its 144 Common Stock in private placement in 2018 at prices averaging 15% below the market price.\nGrowth in Multiple States: MariMed continued expanding its operations in cannabis-licensed states:\nMaryland\n·Kind Therapeutics USA began production of products from first crops under MariMed guidance.\n·Began distribution of Nature’s Heritage Cannabis™, MariMed’s new branded strains and products.\n·Began cultivation of Tikun Olam™ branded cannabis strains that have been proven effective in clinical research trials.\nMassachusetts\nContinued construction of 68,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art cultivation and production cannabis facility in New Bedford. Constructing licensed cannabis dispensary in Middleborough. Actively pursuing permit approval for development of two additional dispensaries in Boston area.\nNevada\nExpanded Kalm Fusion ™ Popcorn and Powdered Tincture into medical and recreational dispensaries.\nDelaware, Illinois, Maine\nContinued distribution of licensed Kalm Fusion and Betty’s Eddies ™ brands to 57 additional medical cannabis dispensaries.\nBranded Products\nIntroduced MariMed’s new Nature’s Heritage Cannabis brand, MariMed’s branded products and flower grown by Kind Therapeutics USA to approximately 35 newly opened medical cannabis dispensaries in Maryland. Continue to expand licensing sales of MariMed Brands, Kalm Fusion and Betty’s Eddies.\n“We raised approximately $1.5 million in capital and reduced our debt by approximately $ 1.5 million in the quarter,” noted Jon Levine, MariMed CFO. “We are displaying to investors and shareholders our consistent performance on quarter over quarter growth.”\nMariMed had $251,166 of operating income in first quarter of 2018, an increase from $228,552 in the comparable quarter in 2017. MariMed incurred a net loss of $1.83 million in the first quarter of 2018, versus net income of $0.11 million in the first quarter of 2017. The loss is primarily due to non-cash equity compensation and debt settlements in 2018 that have no impact on operations/cashflow.\nOutlook for 2018\n“As cannabis legalization takes effect on July 1 in Massachusetts, we expect to supply dispensaries with our branded marijuana products across the state,” said Mr. Fireman. “We are scheduled to open our first dispensary in Massachusetts the third quarter of 2018, further bolstering our ongoing revenue streams from managed services and the leasing of our cannabis facilities.”\n“With each new client, we generate significant revenue from fees for leases, licenses and managed services,” Jon Levine, continued. “We expect incremental growth in licensing from new product lines and organic growth from product sales as our licensed Nature’s Heritage Cannabis, Kalm Fusion, Betty’s Eddies, Tikun Olam and Lucid Mood brands gain loyal followings in each current market and as we expand our national distribution network to additional states.”\n“Building upon our diverse platform, we are continuing to raise capital for new business and product development, strategic acquisitions and expansion of infrastructure that will enable us to take advantage of this critical time in the industry,” concluded Mr. Fireman.\nMariMed’s full financial results are available on MariMed’s website ( ir.marimedadvisors.com/quarterly-reports ) and at www.sec.gov\nSearch MariMed and post on social media with the hash tag #MedicatedByMarimed:\nTwitter: @MariMedInc\nFacebook: @MariMedInc\nInstagram: MariMedInc\nYouTube: MariMedInc\n# # #\nAbout MariMed Inc.:\nMariMed designs, develops, finances, and optimizes the success of medical cannabis cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities through its validated management.
