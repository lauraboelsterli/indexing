The Registration Statement includes a proxy statement/prospectus that is both the definitive proxy statement distributed to holders of the Naked’s common stock in connection with the solicitation by Naked of proxies for the vote by the stockholders on the Business Combination and a prospectus of Holdco in connection with the distribution of its securities to such holders. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS COMBINATION, INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS THAT ARE FILED OR WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT NAKED, BENDON AND HOLDCO AND THE PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION.

Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names and interests in the proposed Business Combination of Naked’s directors and officers in Naked’s filings with the SEC. Additional information regarding the directors and executive officers of Naked is also included in Naked’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2018 and in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus. Information regarding the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to Naked’s shareholders in connection with the proposed Business Combination are set forth in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus for the proposed Business Combination.
