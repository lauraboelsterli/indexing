    "text": "BRASILIA, May 4 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Friday that while his country would likely accept U.S.-imposed quotas on steel exports, no final decision had yet been made.\nTemer, in an interview with the government’s NBR TV station, said he held out hopes that Brazil could negotiate a better steel deal with the United States in the coming weeks. Brazil’s foreign and trade ministries this week contradicted a U.S. announcement that the two countries had reached a deal on steel and aluminum import tariffs, saying no final decision was made.
