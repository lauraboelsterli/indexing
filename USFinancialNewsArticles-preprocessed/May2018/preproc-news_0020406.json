    "text": "MARTINSVILLE, Va., May 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- George Revington has announced he will retire from his positions as Chief Operating Officer of Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ:HOFT) and as President of Hooker subsidiary HMI, effective June 1, 2018.\nRevington has served as the second ranking officer at the company for over two years, and has been involved with HMI for a total of 18 years in the chief executive role.\n“For eighteen years, it has been my passion to create HMI to be a different kind of company in our industry—forward-looking technologically advanced and lean. It has been a great ride with many wonderful people. At the same time, there are other adventures that I’d like to pursue in my personal interests and in business,” Revington said.\n“George’s strategic vision, and his ability to develop ground-breaking strategies and successfully implement them, is as good as I have ever experienced,” said Paul Toms, chairman and chief executive officer of Hooker Furniture. “We appreciate his contributions and service, and have enjoyed working with him for the past two-and-a-half years.”\n“I want to thank all of the smart, determined people who built HMI from humble beginnings in Phoenix, Arizona, and who lived the HMI culture,” Revington said. “I also thank the trusted partners in Asia for their incredible hard work and willingness to adapt. And I thank our retail partners, whose openness created truly collaborative relationships that are the basis for sustainable competitive advantage for both parties.\n“Hooker Furniture and HMI have the strategies and people in place to continue to grow, and are extremely well-positioned to be a major force in the industry. I wish everyone the very best.”\nSeparately, HFC is announcing appointments in the HMI President’s role.\nIncorporated in 1924, Hooker Furniture is one of the most respected furniture brands in the world. The company's 2016 acquisition of Home Meridian International (HMI) ranks Hooker as one of the top five sources for the U.S. furniture market.
