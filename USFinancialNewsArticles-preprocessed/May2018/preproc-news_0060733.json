    "text": "The top 10 most affordable small colleges Share Published 2:37 PM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 Updated 23 Hours Ago Students walk on the College of the Ozarks campus.\nMany families assume public colleges and universities are far more affordable than private ones. Turns out, that's only partly true.\nAt public, four-year institutions, costs for the 2017-18 school year hit $20,770, according to the College Board . Tuition plus room and board at four-year private universities was much higher: $47,000, on average, in the current academic year.\nHowever, some colleges — both public and private — are making a name for themselves by keeping costs way down and giving students an opportunity to get a small-school experience at a reasonable price.\nStudent Loan Hero ranked the most affordable small colleges in the country by comparing the tuition, fees and average student debt at schools with graduating classes of 500 students or fewer.\nHere are the top 10: 10. Cameron University in Oklahoma Cameron University Annual tuition and fees: $5,970 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $20,019\nThe first public college to make the list will put its money where its mouth is: \"The Cameron University Guarantee\" promises to provide additional education, at no cost, to any CU baccalaureate graduates if a future employer finds gaps in the graduate's major field of study. 9. College of Coastal Georgia Undergraduate enrollment: 3,529 Annual tuition and fees: $4,434 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $25,455\nIn addition to students from its home state, the College of Coastal Georgia offers the in-state rate to all residents of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and Tennessee who meet the requirements for admission. The beachfront school will even waive the application fee for applications submitted between May 28 and June 1. 8. Southern Utah University Annual tuition and fees: $6,530 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $16,892\nThanks to its affordable in-state tuition, this college in Cedar City helps half its students finish without loans, and those who do borrow have balances well below average. In addition, grads have a 94 percent job placement rate, according to the school. 7. New College of Florida New College of Florida. Annual tuition and fees: $6,916 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $15,173\nAlthough it is part of the Florida State University System, New College students leave Sarasota with less indebtedness than any of the other state schools. Even though more than 90 percent of students receive some form of financial assistance, there is a guaranteed freshman scholarship program and a wide array of both merit and need-based scholarships and grants. 6. New Mexico Highlands University New Mexico Highlands University Annual tuition and fees: $5,550 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $17,312\nLocated in Las Vegas, New Mexico, NMHU is the third-most-affordable university in the Southwest region and yet its graduates make more money on average than any other university in the state, according to the school. 5. Dixie State in Utah Arts building at Dixie State University in Utah Undergraduate enrollment: 8,993 Annual tuition and fees: $5,022 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $15,882\nAnother public college to make the list, Dixie State in St. George, has the lowest tuition of all the four-year state schools in Utah. That, coupled with a low cost of living, means students can limit the amount they need to borrow. Just 38 percent of graduates finish school with debt. 4. York College in New York York College, New York Annual tuition and fees: $6,747 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $4,614\nThis public school is part of the City University of New York (CUNY) network. In-state residents pay a low tuition of just $6,330 a year and more than 55 percent of full-time undergraduates attend tuition-free. 3. Alice Lloyd College in Kentucky Alice Lloyd College Annual tuition and fees: $2,050 Average student loan balance among graduates with debt: $10,714\nOne of the few private schools in the top 10, this college in Pippa Passes offers a tuition guarantee that students will pay nothing out of pocket for up to 10 semesters. However, to be eligible, undergrads must be from one of the neighboring counties in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. 2. Berea College",
