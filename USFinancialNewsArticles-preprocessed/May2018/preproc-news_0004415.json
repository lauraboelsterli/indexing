    "text": "CANONSBURG, Pa., CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CEIX) today reported financial and operating results for the 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nHighlights of the CEIX first quarter 2018 1 results include:\nNet income and cash flow from operations of $71.0 million and $115.7 million, respectively; Total dilutive earnings per share of $2.20; Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $150.3 million - raised guidance by 8% 3 ; Organic free cash flow net to CEIX shareholders 2 of $88.2 million; Reduced outstanding debt and equity by $26.0 million and approximately $1.3 million, respectively; Total net leverage ratio 2 reduced to 2.0x compared to 2.4x at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017; 2018 cash spending expected to be reduced by approximately $10.0 million through lease conversions; Expect to invest approximately $20.0 million through 2019 in efficiency improvement capital spending.\nManagement Comments\n\"We delivered very strong operational and financial performance as we completed our first full quarter as an independent public company\" said Jimmy Brock, Chief Executive Officer of CONSOL Energy Inc. \"We outperformed most of our key guidance metrics and generated significant free cash flow, which gave us the confidence to accelerate de-leveraging as well as initiate modest stock buybacks earlier than expected. We strongly believe that our equity and debt are currently undervalued in the market place; therefore, we deployed some of our free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase portions of every category of our debt and equity that were issued or distributed in November 2017 as part of the spin-off process. We will remain return-driven in the deployment of our capital. On the operational front, the strong quarterly performance was driven by record production out of our Bailey mine and by improved coal prices in the domestic thermal coal markets. This quarter was a testament to our differentiated marketing strategy, which enables us to capture significant pricing upside during peak weather events while delivering consistent volume and pricing performance at other times. Our netback contracts provide asymmetric pricing opportunity that aligns us with the profitability of coal-fired generation in the dispatch curve. The volume consistency and potential for pricing upside associated with these contracts ties well to the low cost structure, scale, and longevity of our mining operations, and thus they are valuable components of our overall sales portfolio. It is also noteworthy that our revenue per ton on traditional domestic contracts was improved compared to the year-ago period as well. Finally, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect the positive trends in the business. Our priorities for utilizing the improved earnings and cash flow are very clear: (a) de-risk the balance sheet, and (b) grow opportunistically, while improving shareholder returns.\"\nPennsylvania Mining Complex (PAMC) Review and Outlook\nPAMC Sales and Marketing\nOur Sales and Marketing team sold 6.6 million tons of coal during the first quarter of 2018 at an average revenue per ton of $52.98 compared to 6.8 million tons at an average revenue per ton of $46.80 in the year-ago period. The improvement was largely driven by greater-than-expected revenue on our netback contracts, which reflected strong PJM West power prices during the quarter. Our revenue per ton also benefited from improved pricing under our non-netback domestic contracts and from continued strength in the export markets. Offsetting these improvements were January winter weather-driven challenges that affected rail and port logistics and limited further upside to shipments.\nOn the domestic front, heating degree days during the quarter in the Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, and East North Central regions we serve were approximately 11-23% greater than the year-ago period, but still approximately 3-7% below normal, based on preliminary data. Although the quarter as a whole was still slightly milder than average, the significant improvement in heating demand compared to the year-ago period translated into improved burn at our customers' power plants and helped to further draw down coal inventories. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), inventories at domestic utilities stood at approximately 121 million tons at the end of February, down by approximately 25% from year-ago levels. More importantly, we believe inventories at several of our key Northern Appalachian rail-served power plants now stand below 20 days. This gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to ship all of our contracted coal despite recent softness in natural gas prices. We are greater than 95% contracted for 2018 shipments and are 74% and 26% contracted for 2019 and 2020, respectively, assuming an annual production run rate of 27 million tons. We anticipate that our cost structure and differentiated marketing strategy will allow our customers to stay competitive with natural gas for the foreseeable future.\nFurthermore, while Henry Hub spot prices averaged just $3.08/mmBtu during the quarter, the return to more normal winter temperatures helped to boost PJM West day-ahead power prices to an average of $45.31/MWh, marking the highest quarterly average price since the first quarter of 2015. This was due, in part, to the cold weather event in early January, but the month of March also turned in the third-highest monthly PJM West power price ($33.69/MWh) that has been observed in the last 32 months, even though Henry Hub spot prices averaged just $2.69/mmBtu in March. These improvements in power prices boosted average revenue per ton under our netback contracts, as noted above.\nOverall, global coal demand growth continues to improve, tying to overall broadening and accelerating economic growth. On the export front, while demand in Europe has modestly softened, growth in India has more than compensated for this. Prior to 2017, our coal moving to India was primarily going into the industrial sector to the brick and cement industries; however, we are now beginning to penetrate into India's coal-fired power generation sector as well, which has created additional upside for our high calorific value coal. We also expect additional demand improvement from Turkey, pending easing sulfur restrictions. We are seeing improved demand growth around the globe in many more countries. This global demand growth, coupled with a supply side that has experienced minimal investment in recent years, is increasingly creating an imbalance in the international marketplace for coal. In our view, this has created an opportunity for the United States to become an essential piece of the seaborne market rather than a swing supplier.\nAdditional Details on Export Contract\nAs previously disclosed, against the strong export backdrop in the fourth quarter of 2017, we succeeded in concluding a multi-year contract for approximately 14 million tons of coal in the export markets with shipments beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and extending through the second quarter of 2020. The contracted volume is comprised of approximately 70% thermal coal and 30% crossover metallurgical coal. Coal prices in the first year of the contract are fixed at the mine and are captured in our current guidance for 2018. For the second year of the contract, the price of coal is collared with an average floor price that is greater than our 2017 average revenue per ton of $45.52. Furthermore, in conjunction with the coal sales agreement, we also entered into a full capacity take-or-pay agreement for the CONSOL Marine Terminal (CMT) with a fixed revenue of approximately $120 million for the same period. These contractual arrangements not only highlight the global attractiveness of our coal production and infrastructure assets but also are a testament to our ability to take advantage of market volatility and de-risk a substantial portion of our revenue at attractive prices.\nPAMC Operations Review\nPAMC achieved strong first quarter production of 6.7 million tons, which compares to 6.9 million tons in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we benefited from strong production at the Bailey mine, partially offset by a longwall move at the Harvey mine and adverse geological conditions at the Enlow Fork mine. Our Bailey mine produced a record-setting 3.8 million tons in the first quarter, surpassing its previous high mark of 3.5 million tons set in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPAMC shipped 6.6 million tons during the first quarter, compared to 6.8 million tons in the year-ago quarter. While we experienced logistical challenges synchronizing rail and port availability, due to harsh January weather conditions, our Sales and Marketing team was successful in minimizing the overall impact. Total coal revenue for the first quarter came in at $351 million and improved by $34.6 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue per ton of coal sold. Our average revenue per ton increased to $52.98 from $46.80 in the year-ago quarter largely due to improved average revenue per ton on our netback contracts.\nThe Company's total costs during the first quarter were $333 million compared to $316 million in the year-ago quarter. However, total PAMC operating costs remained consistent quarter over quarter, increasing $1 million to $234 million in the first quarter from $233 million in the year-ago quarter. PAMC reported average cash cost of coal sold per ton 2 of $29.21, compared to $28.75 in the year-ago quarter. This increase was essentially driven by higher royalties and production taxes. Average cash margin per ton sold 2 for the first quarter of 2018 expanded by $5.72, or 32%, to $23.77 per ton compared to the year-ago period, driven by higher average revenue per ton.\nFor the quarter, other costs increased by $8.0 million compared to the year-ago quarter, including approximately $4.8 million in demurrage expense created by the above-mentioned rail and port logistical challenges as well as an increase in costs related to externally purchased coal for blending purposes.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nCoal Production\nmillion tons\n6.7\n6.9\nCoal Sales\nmillion tons\n6.6\n6.8\nAverage Revenue Per Ton\nper ton\n$52.98\n$46.80\nAverage Cash Costs of Coal Sold 2\nper ton\n$29.21\n$28.75\nAverage Cash Margin Per Ton Sold 2\nper ton\n$23.77\n$18.05\nCONSOL Marine Terminal Review\nFor the first quarter of 2018, throughput volumes out of CMT were 3.5 million tons compared to 3.1 million tons in the year-ago period. Even though throughput volumes were improved, we note that during several periods of significant snow events faced during the quarter, our throughput was impacted by frozen coal in the railcars limiting further upside. For the first quarter, terminal revenue and terminal operating costs were $15.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, compared to $12.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in the year-ago period. Looking forward, we expect the terminal to benefit from the recently-executed export contract, which provides a firm and attractive revenue stream for the next two years.\nReducing Cash Costs and Improving Cost of Capital\nDuring the first quarter, we took advantage of a strong leasing market and bought out one set of longwall shields at our Bailey mine from the operating lease agreement and refinanced it as a capital lease. This strategy allowed us to lower our overall cash spending even after accounting for the interest expense of the lease. In the month of April, we also executed an early buyout option on the Harvey longwall shields, terminated the operating lease and refinanced it as a capital lease. The financing rates on both of these leases are significantly below our weighted average cost of capital, and the transactions are immediately accretive to our cash flows. In aggregate, we expect an approximate $10.0 million reduction in 2018 cash spending as a result of these refinancings. Furthermore, the financing charges on these capital leases are fixed and insulate us from future increases in interest rates.\n2018 Guidance and Outlook\nBased on our current contracted position, coal market outlook and production forecasts, we are providing the following financial and operating performance targets for 2018:\nCoal Sales Volumes (100% PAMC) - 26.2-27.2 million tons Average revenue per ton sold - $47.15-$48.75 Terminal throughput volume - 12-15 million tons Cash cost of coal sold per ton 3 - $28.50-$30.00 Adjusted EBITDA 3 (incl. 100% PAMC) - $370-$430 million Effective tax rate - 10-15% Capital expenditures (incl. 100% PAMC) - $125-$145 million\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nThe following table presents a condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nNet Income\n$\n70,958\n$\n46,445\nAdjustments to Reconcile Net Income to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\n49,471\n52,993\nOther Non-Cash Adjustments to Net Income\n9,120\n(10,133)\nChanges in Working Capital\n(13,816)\n(40,768)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n115,733\n48,537\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nCapital Expenditures\n(21,956)\n(9,021)\nProceeds from Sales of Assets\n393\n9,709\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\n(21,563)\n688\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nNet Payments on Long-Term Debt\n(27,366)\n(4,000)\nDistributions to Noncontrolling Interest\n(5,587)\n(5,467)\nOther Financing Activities\n(23,477)\n(46,431)\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\n(56,430)\n(55,898)\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash\n$\n37,740\n$\n(6,673)\nFirst Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call and webcast, during which management will discuss the first quarter of 2018 financial and operational results, is scheduled for May 3, 2018 at 10:00 AM ET.

Our cost of coal sold per ton represents our costs of coal sold divided by the tons of coal we sell. We define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in coal inventory, both in volumes and carrying values. The cost of coal sold per ton includes items such as direct operating costs, royalty and production taxes, direct administration costs, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs. Our costs exclude any indirect costs, such as selling, general and administrative costs, freight expenses, interest expenses and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cost of coal sold is total costs. The cash cost of coal sold includes cost of coal sold less depreciation, depletion and amortization cost on production assets. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash cost of coal sold is total costs.\nWe define average cash margin per ton as average coal revenue per ton, net of average cost of coal sold per ton, less depreciation, depletion and amortization. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to average cash margin per ton is total coal revenue.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as (i) net income (loss) plus income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization, as adjusted for (ii) certain non-cash items, such as long-term incentive awards. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss).\nWe define leverage ratio as the ratio of net debt to the last twelve months' (LTM) earnings before interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as long-term incentive awards, amortization of debt issuance costs and capitalized interest.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of cost of coal sold and cash cost of coal sold to total costs, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nTotal Costs and Expenses\n$\n333,115\n$\n316,370\nFreight Expense\n(17,887)\n(12,282)\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\n(13,484)\n(17,079)\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\n(1,426)\n—\nInterest Expense\n(21,045)\n(4,022)\nOther Costs (Non-Production)\n(36,758)\n(36,434)\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Non-Production)\n(8,375)\n(13,107)\nCost of Coal Sold\n$\n234,140\n$\n233,446\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Production)\n(41,096)\n(39,886)\nCash Cost of Coal Sold\n$\n193,044\n$\n193,560\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of average cash margin per ton for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except per ton information).\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nTotal Coal Revenue\n$\n351,009\n$\n316,448\nOperating and Other Costs\n229,802\n229,994\nLess: Other Costs (Non-Production)\n(36,758)\n(36,434)\nTotal Cash Cost of Coal Sold\n193,044\n193,560\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\n49,471\n52,993\nLess: Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (Non-Production)\n(8,375)\n(13,107)\nTotal Cost of Coal Sold\n$\n234,140\n$\n233,446\nTotal Tons Sold (in millions)\n6.6\n6.8\nAverage Revenue per Ton Sold\n$\n52.98\n$\n46.80\nAverage Cash Cost per Ton Sold\n29.21\n28.75\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs per Ton Sold\n6.13\n5.77\nAverage Cost per Ton Sold\n35.34\n34.52\nAverage Margin per Ton Sold\n17.64\n12.28\nAdd: Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Costs per Ton Sold\n6.13\n5.77\nAverage Cash Margin per Ton Sold\n$\n23.77\n$\n18.05\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2018\n2018\n2017\nDollars in thousands\nPA Mining\nComplex\nOther\nTotal\nCompany\nTotal\nCompany\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n98,480\n$\n(27,522)\n$\n70,958\n$\n46,445\nAdd: Income Tax Expense\n—\n6,185\n6,185\n9,406\nAdd: Interest Expense, net\n—\n21,045\n21,045\n4,022\nLess: Interest Income\n—\n(601)\n(601)\n(590)\nEarnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT)\n98,480\n(893)\n97,587\n59,283\nAdd: Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization\n43,257\n6,214\n49,471\n52,993\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes and DD&A (EBITDA)\n$\n141,737\n$\n5,321\n$\n147,058\n$\n112,276\nAdjustments:\nStock/Unit-Based Compensation\n$\n1,701\n$\n146\n$\n1,847\n$\n3,760\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\n—\n1,426\n1,426\n—\nTotal Pre-tax Adjustments\n1,701\n1,572\n3,273\n3,760\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n143,438\n$\n6,893\n$\n150,331\n$\n116,036\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling\nInterest\n13,686\n—\n13,686\n11,590\nAdjusted EBITDA Attributable to CONSOL Energy Inc.\nShareholders\n$\n129,752\n$\n6,893\n$\n136,645\n$\n104,446\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net leverage ratio (in thousands).\nTwelve Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet Income\n$\n107,082\n$\n82,569\nPlus:\nInterest Expense\n43,121\n26,098\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\n168,480\n172,002\nIncome Taxes\n84,007\n87,228\nStock/Unit-Based Compensation\n20,172\n22,085\nCCR Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Agreement\n(108,649)\n(100,805)\nCash Distributions from CONSOL Coal Resources LP\n34,686\n34,509\nCash Payments for Legacy Employee Liabilities, Net\nof Non-Cash Expense\n(1,724)\n407\nOther Adjustments to Net Income\n193\n(5,216)\nConsolidated EBITDA per Credit Agreement\n$\n347,368\n$\n318,877\nConsolidated First Lien Debt\n$\n504,092\n$\n503,949\nSenior Secured Second Lien Notes\n290,000\n300,000\nMEDCO Revenue Bonds\n102,865\n102,865\nAdvance Royalty Commitments\n2,085\n2,085\nConsolidated Indebtedness per Credit Agreement\n899,042\n908,899\nLess:\nAdvance Royalty Commitments\n2,085\n2,085\nCash on Hand\n190,971\n152,446\nConsolidated Net Indebtedness per Credit Agreement\n$\n705,986\n$\n754,368\nNet Leverage Ratio (Net Indebtedness/EBITDA)\n2.0\n2.4\nFree cash flow, organic free cash flow and organic free cash flow net to CEIX shareholders are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations and non-core asset sales after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand CONSOL's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that free cash flow, organic free cash flow and organic free cash flow net to CEIX shareholders do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making . We have based these on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: whether the operational, strategic and other benefits of the separation can be achieved; whether the costs and expenses of the separation can be controlled within expectations; deterioration in economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate may decrease demand for our products, impair our ability to collect customer receivables and impair our ability to access capital; volatility and wide fluctuation in coal prices based upon a number of factors beyond our control including oversupply relative to the demand available for our products, weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels; an extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal affecting our operating results and cash flows; the risk of our debt agreements, our debt and changes in interest rates affecting our operating results and cash flows; the effect of our affiliated company credit agreement on our cash flows; foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad; our customers extending existing contracts or entering into new long-term contracts for coal on favorable terms; our reliance on major customers; our inability to collect payments from customers if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts; our inability to acquire additional coal reserves and other assets; our inability to control the timing of divestitures and whether they provide their anticipated benefits; the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and other systems, disruption of rail, barge, gathering, processing and transportation facilities and other systems that deliver our coal to market and fluctuations in transportation costs; a loss of our competitive position because of the competitive nature of coal industries, or a loss of our competitive position because of overcapacity in these industries impairing our profitability;
