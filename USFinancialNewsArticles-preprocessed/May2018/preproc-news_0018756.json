    "text": "- Positive unanimous vote at Epidiolex ® (cannabidiol) FDA Advisory Committee meeting -\n- NDA PDUFA goal date scheduled for June 27, 2018 -\n- Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. EST -\nLONDON and CARLSBAD, Calif., GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) (GW, the Company or the Group), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, announces financial results for the second quarter ended 31 March 2018.\n“The positive outcome of the Epidiolex FDA Advisory Committee meeting was a momentous event for GW. The strength and consistency of the clinical data, together with the public presentations that featured very moving personal stories of the challenges associated with managing these difficult forms of epilepsy, led to a unanimous vote in support of approval,” stated Justin Gover, GW’s Chief Executive Officer. “With our late June FDA decision date nearing, our commercial team is busy preparing to launch Epidiolex in the second half of this year. Should Epidiolex be approved, we believe that this will signal a major vote of confidence in GW’s cannabinoid platform to discover and develop prescription medicines that meet exacting regulatory standards and will serve us to accelerate a number of important pipeline programs that have the potential to offer additional value.”\nOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nEpidiolex (CBD) orphan epilepsy program in Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and infantile spasms (IS) Regulatory NDA for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS and Dravet PDUFA goal date of June 27, 2018 Positive, unanimous vote in support of approval by FDA Advisory Committee Conditional grant of rare pediatric disease designation by FDA European submission accepted for review by the EMA.
