Gross operating income, at €663m, rose +16% YoY at constant exchange rate (+8% current) vs. 1Q17.

Expressed in basis points of loans outstanding (excluding credit institutions), the businesses' cost of risk worked out to 19bps in 1Q18. Pre-tax profit rose +13% to €632m in 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 .\nThe 1Q18 tax rate reached ~35% (~41% in 1Q17), the first quarter being impacted by IFRIC 21 and the non-deductibility of the SRF and French systemic risk banking tax contributions. The tax rate guidance for 2018 is maintained at around 30%.\nNet income (group share), adjusted for IFRIC 21 and excluding exceptional items, came out at €502m in 1Q18, up +15% YoY . Accounting for exceptional items (-€28m impact net of tax in 1Q18) and IFRIC 21 (-€151m impact in 1Q18), the reported net income (group share) increased +15% YoY at €323m in 1Q18.\nNatixis delivered a 15.4% underlying RoTE (1) excluding IFRIC 21 impact and the businesses' underlying RoE (1) reached 16.9%, up +290bps and +190bps respectively vs. 1Q17.\nAsset & Wealth Management\n€m 1Q18 1Q17 1Q18\nvs. 1Q17 constant\nFX Net revenues 777 704 10% 20% o/w Asset management 739 671 10% 21% o/w Wealth management 37 33 12% 12% Expenses (528) (519) 2% 10% Gross operating income 248 186 34% 48% Provision for credit losses 0 0 Associates and other items 0 9 Pre-tax profit 248 195 28% 40% Cost/income ratio (1) 67.5% 73.2% (5.7)pp RoE after tax (1) 14.0% 11.5% +2.5pp\n1Q18 net revenues from Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) were up a significant +20% YoY at constant exchange rate (+10% current).

Net revenues from Wealth management were up +12% YoY.\nIn Asset management, 1Q18 margins excluding performance fees (€65m in 1Q18 vs. €26m in 1Q17) improved +3.6bps YoY to 31bps overall and rose +2.8bps to 15bps in Europe and +1.5bps to 40bps in North America.\nAsset management attracted +€6bn of net inflows overall during the quarter, including +€8.1bn of Retail and Wholesale LT net inflows driven by various high fee strategies (average fee rate >60bps (2) ) at Harris Associates, Loomis Sayles, H 2 O, Dorval and DNCA. On the other hand, this dynamic came together with -€2.1bn of Institutional LT net outflows due to the redemption of 3 institutional mandates for ~€5.4bn of AuM, although at a low fee rate of (6bps average). AuM reached €818bn at end-March 2018 , of which €406bn in Europe and €399bn in North America. AuM growth this quarter was driven by the combination of net inflows, a -€8bn negative market effect and a -€11bn FX effect. Average AuM at constant exchange rate increased by +10% YoY in Europe (excl. Life insurance) and +14% YoY in North America. Wealth management AuM reached €31.5bn (3) .\nAWM delivered a +250bps YoY increase in underlying RoE (1) to 14.0% in 1Q18 , experienced a significant positive jaws effect, both at constant (10pp) and current (8pp) exchange rate and an underlying cost/income ratio (1) down -570bps.\nSee note on methodology and excluding IFRIC 21 impact for the calculation of the cost/income ratio and the RoE Only for +€7.1bn raised by the platforms out of the +€8.1bn of R&W, the rest being raised by the affiliates directly (mainly DNCA in France & Italy and H20) Including Vega IM, 60% owned by Natixis Wealth Management\nUnless specified otherwise, the following comments and data refer to underlying results, i.e. excluding exceptional items (see detail p2)\nCorporate & Investment Banking\n€m 1Q18 1Q17 1Q18\nvs. 1Q17 constant\nFX Net revenues 938 971 (3)% 1% Net revenues excl.

Business lines benefit from remuneration of normative capital allocated to them. By convention, the remuneration rate on normative capital is maintained at 2%.
