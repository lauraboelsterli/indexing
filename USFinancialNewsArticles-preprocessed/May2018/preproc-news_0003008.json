    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally-integrated solutions, today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenue increased 4.6% to $260.5 million, or 3.4% on a constant currency basis; GAAP operating profit margin of (7.0%); Non-GAAP operating profit margin of 12.3%; and GAAP diluted loss per share of ($0.53); Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increase of 5.4% to $0.39.\n\"In the first quarter 2018, NuVasive's International business continued its momentum of 20% growth year over year on a constant currency basis, with our core U.S. hardware business showing solid case volume growth,\" said Gregory T. Lucier, chairman and chief executive officer of NuVasive. \"As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our continued innovation—including the expansion of our lateral procedural solutions with the integration of Lateral Single-Position Surgery, further build out of our Advanced Materials Science portfolio and the initial launch of our Surgical Intelligence platform—to drive further differentiation of NuVasive technologies with surgeon partners. We also anticipate our Ohio manufacturing facility production ramping up in the second half of the year and we begin to realize the 400 basis point improvement in gross margins through this in-sourcing manufacturing effort.\"\nA full reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in the tables of this news release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNuVasive reported first quarter 2018 total revenue of $260.5 million, a 4.6% increase compared to $249.0 million for the first quarter 2017. On a constant currency basis, first quarter 2018 total revenue increased 3.4% compared to the same period last year.\nFor the first quarter 2018, GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit was $186.7 million and $187.1 million, respectively, and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 71.7% and 71.8%, respectively. These results compared to both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit of $187.6 million, and both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 75.3% for the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company reported a GAAP net loss of ($27.1) million, or ($0.53) per share, for the first quarter 2018 compared to a GAAP net income of $12.4 million, or $0.22 per share, for the first quarter 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported net income of $20.2 million, or $0.39 per share, for the first quarter 2018 compared to net income of $19.7 million, or $0.37 per share, for the first quarter 2017. The GAAP net loss for the quarter was driven primarily by an increase in litigation liability of $29.0 million related to the Company's previously disclosed lawsuit with a former sales agent, which has been ongoing since 2013.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company obtained a favorable tax ruling with respect to its operations in Tennessee. The Company modified its local operations to obtain the ruling, which provides for tax exemptions for property, sales and use taxes specific to the state. With the Company's primary distribution facility based in Memphis, the Company expects this tax ruling to yield in excess of $100 million in tax savings over the next 15 years. The Company engaged a specialized tax consultant to assist with these efforts and the Company recorded a non-recurring, success-based fee of $6.1 million in its first quarter 2018 financials.\nAnnual Financial Guidance for 2018\nThe Company reiterated its full-year 2018 guidance, and assumes a full-year benefit of U.S. tax reform, suspension of the medical device tax and the recent acquisition of SafePassage.\n2018 Guidance Range 1\nPrior\nCurrent\n(in Million's; except %'s and EPS)\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nRevenue\n$ 1,095\n$ 1,105\n$ 1,095\n$ 1,105\n$ 1,095\n$ 1,105\n$ 1,095\n$ 1,105\n% Growth - Reported 2\n6.4%\n7.3%\n6.4%\n7.3%\n6.7%\n7.6%\n6.7%\n7.6%\n% Growth - Constant Currency 2, 3\n5.9%\n6.9%\n5.7%\n6.6%\nOperating margin\n13.0%\n13.0%\n17.6%\n17.6%\n9.6%\n9.7%\n17.6%\n17.6%\nEarnings per share\n$ 1.56\n$ 1.59\n$ 2.44\n$ 2.47\n$ 0.71\n$ 0.74\n$ 2.44\n$2.47\nEBITDA\n23.4%\n23.4%\n26.9%\n26.9%\n19.5%\n19.5%\n26.9%\n26.9%\nTax Rate\n~19%\n~19%\n~24%\n~24%\n~31%\n~31%\n~23%\n~23%\n1\nPrior guidance reflects the range provided February 26, 2018.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures which are intended to exclude the impact of foreign exchange currency fluctuations. The measure constant currency is the use of an exchange rate that eliminates fluctuations when calculating financial performance numbers. The Company also uses measures such as free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less cash used in the acquisition and disposition of capital. Additionally, the Company uses an adjusted EBITDA measure which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, business transition costs, one-time restructuring and related items in connection with acquisitions, investments and divestitures, non-recurring consulting fees, certain litigation liabilities, and other significant one-time items. Management calculates the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this earnings release excluding these costs and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to enable it to further and more consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operations. Management believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measures gives them additional information to enable them to assess, in the same way management assesses, the Company's current and future continuing operations. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nReconciliation of First Quarter 2018 Results\nGAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nThree months ended\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nMarch 31, 2018\nGAAP net loss\n$ (27,132)\nInterest expense/(income), net\n9,333\nProvision for income taxes\n(10,126)\nDepreciation and amortization\n32,090\nEBITDA\n$ 4,165\nBusiness transition costs 1\n2,253\nNon-cash purchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions 2\n405\nLitigation liability 3\n28,995\nNon-recurring consulting fees 4\n6,084\nImpairment of strategic investment\n9,004\nNon-cash stock based compensation\n4,134\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 55,040\nAs a percentage of revenue\n21.1%\n1\nCosts related to acquisition, integration and business transition activities which include severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, third party merger and acquisitions costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and other costs directly associated with such activities.\n2\nRepresents costs associated with non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, such as acquired inventory fair market value adjustments, which are amortized over the period in which underlying products are sold.\n3\nRepresents the amount accrued as an estimated loss contingency in connection with the Madsen Medical, Inc. litigation matter.\n4\nNon-recurring consulting fees associated with the implementation of our state tax-planning strategy.\nReconciliation of First Quarter 2018 Results\nGAAP Net Loss per Share to Non-GAAP Earnings per Share\nAdjustments\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nGAAP net loss\n$ (27,132)\n$ (0.53)\nBusiness transition costs 1\n2,253\nNon-cash purchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions 2\n405\nNon-cash interest expense on convertible notes\n4,099\nLitigation liability 3\n28,995\nNon-recurring consulting fees 4\n6,084\nImpairment of strategic investment\n9,004\nAmortization of intangible assets\n12,425\nTax effect of adjustments 5\n(15,976)\nAdjustments to GAAP net loss\n47,289\nNon-GAAP earnings\n$ 20,157\n$ 0.39\nGAAP weighted shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n51,226\nNon-GAAP weighted shares outstanding - diluted 6\n51,742\n1\nCosts related to acquisition, integration and business transition activities which include severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, third party merger and acquisitions costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and other costs directly associated with such activities.\n2\nRepresents costs associated with non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, such as acquired inventory fair market value adjustments, which are amortized over the period in which underlying products are sold.\n3\nRepresents the amount accrued as an estimated loss contingency in connection with the Madsen Medical, Inc. litigation matter.\n4\nNon-recurring consulting fees associated with the implementation of our state tax-planning strategy.\n5\nThe impact on results from taxes include tax effecting the adjustments above at the statutory rate as well as taking into account discrete items and including those discrete items in the annual effective tax rate calculation.
