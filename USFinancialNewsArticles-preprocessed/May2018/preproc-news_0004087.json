(NYSE: IVR) (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Summary:\nQ1 2018 net income attributable to common stockholders of $41.5 million or $0.37 basic earnings per common share (\"EPS\") compared to $137.4 million or $1.23 basic EPS in Q4 2017 Q1 2018 core earnings* of $50.4 million or core EPS of $0.45 compared to $52.5 million or core EPS of $0.47 in Q4 2017 Q1 2018 book value per diluted common share** of $17.16 compared to $18.35 at Q4 2017 Economic return*** of (4.2)% for the quarter Q1 2018 common stock dividend maintained at $0.42 per share\n\"We are pleased to report another quarter of strong core earnings that exceed our first quarter common stock dividend,\" said John Anzalone, Chief Executive Officer. \"While higher interest rates and increased asset volatility during the quarter presented challenges, our seasoned residential and commercial real estate assets and disciplined risk management served us well. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on emerging investment opportunities to the extent further volatility creates compelling valuations.\"\n* Core earnings (and by calculation, core earnings per common share) are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") financial measures.

Refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for important disclosures and a reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures of net income attributable to common stockholders (and by calculation, basic earnings (loss) per common share), total interest income (and by calculation, average earning asset yields), total interest expense (and by calculation, cost of funds), net interest income (and by calculation, net interest rate margin) and debt-to-equity ratio.\nFinancial Summary\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $41.5 million compared to $137.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Lower net income attributable to common stockholders was primarily driven by a $143.2 million increase in losses on investments that was partially offset by a $69.1 million increase in gains on derivative instruments. Losses on investments primarily consist of unrealized losses on the Company's mortgage-backed securities accounted for under the fair value option. Net income attributable to common stockholders also declined due to an $8.0 million decrease in net interest income and an $8.0 million increase in preferred stock dividends. Book value per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 6.5% to $17.16 primarily due to rising interest rates driving a decrease in the valuations of the Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio that exceeded the increase in the valuations of the Company's interest rate hedges.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated $50.4 million in core earnings, a decrease of $2.1 million or 4.0% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Core earnings decreased in the first quarter primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in effective interest expense that was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in income from the Company's joint venture investments. Higher effective interest expense was driven by the December 2017 and March 2018 increases in the Federal Funds target interest rate.\nTotal interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $153.2 million compared to $153.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Higher total interest income reflects a 4 basis point increase in average earning asset yields to 3.38% that was partially offset by a slight decrease in average earning assets to $18.1 billion from $18.3 billion during the fourth quarter.\nThe Company decreased its average borrowings by $0.3 billion (1.6%) in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in average borrowings of $15.7 billion and total interest expense of $68.1 million compared to average borrowings of $15.9 billion and total interest expense of $59.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's total interest expense rose during the first quarter due to a 23 basis point increase in its cost of funds to 1.74% from 1.51% in the fourth quarter.\nThe Company's debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.2x as of March 31, 2018 from 6.0x as of December 31, 2017 reflecting lower equity due to declines in mortgage-backed security valuations. The Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.8x as of March 31, 2018 from 6.1x as of December 31, 2017 primarily because it utilized proceeds from repurchase agreement borrowings to retire its Exchangeable Senior Notes on March 15, 2018.\nTotal expenses include management fees and general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of directors and officers insurance, legal costs, accounting, auditing and tax services and miscellaneous general and administrative costs. Total expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $12.0 million compared to $12.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. While total expenses were unchanged in the first quarter, the ratio of annualized total expenses to average equity (1) increased to 2.26% compared to 2.17% for the fourth quarter due to lower equity.\nAs previously announced, the Company declared the following dividends on March 15, 2018: a common stock dividend of $0.42 per share paid on April 26, 2018 and a Series A preferred stock dividend of $0.4844 per share paid on April 25, 2018. The Company declared the following dividends on its Series B and Series C Preferred Stock on May 2, 2018 to its stockholders of record as of June 5, 2018: a Series B Preferred Stock dividend of $0.4844 per share payable on June 27, 2018 and a Series C Preferred Stock dividend of $0.46875 per share payable on June 27, 2018.\n(1)\nThe ratio of annualized total expenses to average equity is calculated as the annualized sum of management fees plus general and administrative expenses divided by average equity. Average equity is calculated based on the weighted month-end balance of total equity excluding equity attributable to preferred stockholders.\nAbout Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc.\nInvesco Mortgage Capital Inc. is a real estate investment trust that primarily focuses on investing in, financing and managing residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans.

In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of its peer companies.\nCore Earnings\nThe Company calculates core earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders adjusted for (gain) loss on investments, net; realized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net; unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net; realized and unrealized (gain) loss on GSE CRT embedded derivatives, net; (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions, net; amortization of net deferred (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps; net loss on extinguishment of debt; and cumulative adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. The Company may add and has added additional reconciling items to its core earnings calculation as appropriate.\nThe Company believes the presentation of core earnings provides a consistent measure of operating performance by excluding the impact of gains and losses described above from operating results. The Company excludes the impact of gains and losses because gains and losses are not accounted for consistently under U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, certain gains and losses are reflected in net income whereas other gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income. For example, the majority of the Company's mortgage-backed securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, and changes in the valuation of these securities are recorded in other comprehensive income on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the fair value option for its mortgage-backed securities purchased on or after September 1, 2016, and changes in the valuation of these securities are recorded in other income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, certain gains and losses represent one-time events.\nThe Company believes that providing transparency into core earnings enables its investors to consistently measure, evaluate and compare its operating performance to that of its peers over multiple reporting periods. However, the Company cautions that core earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP), or as an indication of the Company's cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP), a measure of the Company's liquidity, or an indication of amounts available to fund its cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to core earnings for the following periods:\nThree Months Ended\n$ in thousands, except per share data\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n41,471\n137,436\n87,130\nAdjustments:\n(Gain) loss on investments, net\n160,370\n17,153\n1,853\nRealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net (1)\n(113,578)\n(73,646)\n(14,918)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net (1)\n(31,901)\n(7,368)\n(13,438)\nRealized and unrealized (gain) loss on GSE CRT embedded derivatives, net (2)\n2,468\n(7,401)\n(14,148)\n(Gain) loss on foreign currency transactions, net (3)\n(1,814)\n(387)\n(513)\nAmortization of net deferred (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps (4)\n(6,539)\n(6,438)\n(6,298)\nNet loss on extinguishment of debt\n26\n233\n4,711\nSubtotal\n9,032\n(77,854)\n(42,751)\nCumulative adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest\n(114)\n981\n539\nSeries B preferred stock dividend adjustment (5)\n—\n(2,870)\n—\nSeries C preferred stock dividend adjustment (6)\n—\n(5,211)\n—\nCore earnings attributable to common stockholders\n50,389\n52,482\n44,918\nBasic income (loss) per common share\n0.37\n1.23\n0.78\nCore earnings per share attributable to common stockholders (7)\n0.45\n0.47\n0.40\n(1) U.S. GAAP gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations includes the following components:\nThree Months Ended\n$ in thousands\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nRealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n113,578\n73,646\n14,918\nUnrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n31,901\n7,368\n13,438\nContractual net interest expense\n(12,112)\n(16,763)\n(22,894)\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments, net\n133,367\n64,251\n5,462\n(2) U.S. GAAP realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations includes the following components:\nThree Months Ended\n$ in thousands\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nRealized and unrealized gain (loss) on GSE CRT embedded derivatives, net\n(2,468)\n7,401\n14,148\nGSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest\n5,633\n5,819\n5,807\nRealized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net\n3,165\n13,220\n19,955\n(3) U.S. GAAP other investment income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations includes the following components:\nThree Months Ended\n$ in thousands\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nDividend income\n1,288\n819\n816\nGain (loss) on foreign currency transactions, net\n1,814\n387\n513\nOther investment income (loss), net\n3,102\n1,206\n1,329\n(4) U.S. GAAP repurchase agreements interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations includes the following components:\nThree Months Ended\n$ in thousands\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nInterest expense on repurchase agreement borrowings\n66,124\n58,393\n36,245\nAmortization of net deferred (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps\n(6,539)\n(6,438)\n(6,298)\nRepurchase agreements interest expense\n59,585\n51,955\n29,947\n(5)\nOn September 14, 2017, the Company declared a dividend on Series B Preferred Stock that covered the period from September 27, 2017 through December 26, 2017. The Company recorded the entire dividend declared as a charge to retained earnings under U.S. GAAP during the three months ended September 30, 2017. The Company deferred declaring its next dividend on Series B Preferred Stock to February 2018. The Company reduced core earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 for the cumulative impact of deferring the declaration date to February 2018 because the Company considers all dividends accumulated during the quarter a current component of its capital costs regardless of the dividend declaration date.\n(6)\nOn September 14, 2017, the Company declared a dividend on Series C Preferred Stock that covered the period from the date of issuance, August 16, 2017, to but not including the dividend payment date, December 27, 2017. The Company recorded the entire dividend declared as a charge to retained earnings under U.S. GAAP during the three months ended September 30, 2017. The Company deferred declaring its next dividend on Series C Preferred Stock to February 2018. The Company reduced core earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 for the cumulative impact of deferring the declaration date to February 2018 because the Company considers all dividends accumulated during the quarter a current component of its capital costs regardless of the dividend declaration date.\n(7)\nCore earnings per share attributable to common stockholders is equal to core earnings divided by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\nEffective Interest Income/ Effective Yield/ Effective Interest Expense/Effective Cost of Funds/Effective Net Interest Income/Effective Interest Rate Margin\nThe Company calculates effective interest income (and by calculation, effective yield) as U.S. GAAP total interest income adjusted for GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest that is recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net. The Company includes its GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest in effective interest income because GSE CRT coupon interest is not accounted for consistently under U.S. GAAP. The Company accounts for GSE CRTs purchased prior to August 24, 2015 as hybrid financial instruments, but has elected the fair value option for GSE CRTs purchased on or after August 24, 2015. Under U.S. GAAP, coupon interest on GSE CRTs accounted for using the fair value option is recorded as interest income, whereas coupon interest on GSE CRTs accounted for as hybrid financial instruments is recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss). The Company adds back GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest to its total interest income because the Company considers GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest a current component of its total interest income irrespective of whether the Company has elected the fair value option for the GSE CRT or accounted for the GSE CRT as a hybrid financial instrument.\nThe Company calculates effective interest expense (and by calculation, effective cost of funds) as U.S. GAAP total interest expense adjusted for contractual net interest expense on its interest rate swaps that is recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net and the amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps that is recorded as repurchase agreements interest expense. The Company views its interest rate swaps as an economic hedge against increases in future market interest rates on its floating rate borrowings. The Company adds back the net payments it makes on its interest rate swap agreements to its total U.S. GAAP interest expense because the Company uses interest rate swaps to add stability to interest expense. The Company excludes the amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps from its calculation of effective interest expense because the Company does not consider the amortization a current component of its borrowing costs.\nThe Company calculates effective net interest income (and by calculation, effective interest rate margin) as U.S. GAAP net interest income adjusted for contractual net interest expense on its interest rate swaps that is recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments, amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps that is recorded as repurchase agreements interest expense and GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest that is recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net.\nThe Company believes the presentation of effective interest income, effective yield, effective interest expense, effective cost of funds, effective net interest income and effective interest rate margin measures, when considered together with U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding the Company's borrowing costs and operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles total interest income to effective interest income and yield to effective yield for the following periods:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n$ in thousands\nReconciliation\nYield/Effective Yield\nReconciliation\nYield/Effective Yield\nReconciliation\nYield/Effective Yield\nTotal interest income\n153,225\n3.38\n%\n152,981\n3.34\n%\n124,637\n3.06\n%\nAdd: GSE CRT embedded derivative\ncoupon interest recorded as\nrealized and unrealized credit\nderivative income (loss), net\n5,633\n0.12\n%\n5,819\n0.12\n%\n5,807\n0.14\n%\nEffective interest income\n158,858\n3.50\n%\n158,800\n3.46\n%\n130,444\n3.20\n%\nThe following table reconciles total interest expense to effective interest expense and cost of funds to effective cost of funds for the following periods:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n$ in thousands\nReconciliation\nCost of Funds\n/ Effective\nCost of Funds\nReconciliation\nCost of Funds\n/ Effective\nCost of Funds\nReconciliation\nCost of Funds\n/ Effective\nCost of Funds\nTotal interest expense\n68,133\n1.74\n%\n59,937\n1.51\n%\n38,368\n1.08\n%\nAdd (Less): Amortization of net\ndeferred gain (loss) on de-\ndesignated interest rate swaps\n6,539\n0.17\n%\n6,438\n0.16\n%\n6,298\n0.18\n%\nAdd: Contractual net interest expense\non interest rate swaps recorded\nas gain (loss) on derivative\ninstruments, net\n12,112\n0.31\n%\n16,763\n0.42\n%\n22,894\n0.64\n%\nEffective interest expense\n86,784\n2.22\n%\n83,138\n2.09\n%\n67,560\n1.90\n%\nThe following table reconciles net interest income to effective net interest income and net interest rate margin to effective interest rate margin for the following periods:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n$ in thousands\nReconciliation\nNet Interest\nRate Margin /\nEffective\nInterest Rate\nMargin\nReconciliation\nNet Interest\nRate Margin /\nEffective\nInterest Rate\nMargin\nReconciliation\nNet Interest\nRate Margin /\nEffective\nInterest Rate\nMargin\nNet interest income\n85,092\n1.64\n%\n93,044\n1.83\n%\n86,269\n1.98\n%\nAdd (Less): Amortization of net\ndeferred (gain) loss on de-\ndesignated interest rate swaps\n(6,539)\n(0.17)\n%\n(6,438)\n(0.16)\n%\n(6,298)\n(0.18)\n%\nAdd: GSE CRT embedded derivative\ncoupon interest recorded as\nrealized and unrealized credit\nderivative income (loss), net\n5,633\n0.12\n%\n5,819\n0.12\n%\n5,807\n0.14\n%\nLess: Contractual net interest expense\non interest rate swaps recorded\nas gain (loss) on derivative\ninstruments, net\n(12,112)\n(0.31)\n%\n(16,763)\n(0.42)\n%\n(22,894)\n(0.64)\n%\nEffective net interest income\n72,074\n1.28\n%\n75,662\n1.37\n%\n62,884\n1.30\n%\nRepurchase Agreement Debt-to-Equity Ratio\nThe following tables show the allocation of the Company's equity to its target assets, the Company's debt-to-equity ratio, and the Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is the ratio of total debt (sum of repurchase agreements and secured loans and exchangeable senior notes) to total equity. The Company presents a repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure of leverage, because the mortgage REIT industry primarily uses repurchase agreements, which typically mature within one year, to finance investments. The Company believes presenting the Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio, when considered together with U.S. GAAP financial measure of debt-to-equity ratio, provides information that is useful to investors in understanding the Company's refinancing risks, and gives investors a comparable statistic to those other mortgage REITs who almost exclusively borrow using short-term repurchase agreements that are subject to refinancing risk.\nThe Company's debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.2x as of March 31, 2018 from 6.0x as of December 31, 2017 reflecting lower equity due to declines in mortgage-backed security valuations. The Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio increased to 6.8x as of March 31, 2018 from 6.1x as of December 31, 2017 primarily because it utilized proceeds from repurchase agreement borrowings to retire its Exchangeable Senior Notes on March 15, 2018.\nMarch 31, 2018\n$ in thousands\nAgency\nRMBS\nCommercial Credit (1)\nResidential Credit
