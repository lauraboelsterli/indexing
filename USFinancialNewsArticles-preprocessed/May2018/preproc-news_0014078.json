Soccer Football - Championship - Hull City v Cardiff City - KCOM Stadium, Hull, Britain - April 28, 2018 Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock ahead of the game Action Images/Craig Brough\nThe Welsh club, sitting in the second automatic promotion place, are in pole position to go up with champions Wolverhampton Wanderers, as they hold a one-point lead over third-placed Fulham going into the final round of matches.\nBoth contenders face sides who are not safe from relegation but Cardiff have home advantage against Reading while Fulham, who have the better goal difference, travel to Birmingham City.\nThe 69-year-old Warnock, who has been a manager almost continuously for 38 years, took over at Cardiff in October, 2016 with the team almost bottom of the Championship (second tier) and led them to a 12th-place finish.\nThey have been in contention for promotion for most of this season ahead of more fancied teams like Aston Villa and Middlesbrough.\n“This would be my biggest achievement by miles,” he said.\n“When you look at the state of this club 18 months ago, even to be challenging at this stage is a miracle.\n“But miracles do sometimes happen and I am hoping we can provide another one this weekend.” Reporting by Steve Tongue, editing by Ed Osmond",
