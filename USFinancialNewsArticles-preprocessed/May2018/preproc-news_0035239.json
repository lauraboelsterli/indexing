FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen logo is pictured during the Volkswagen Group's annual general meeting in Berlin, Germany, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nMatthias Gruendler, CFO of VW’s trucks arm which combines the MAN and Scania brands and a Brazil-based commercial vehicles business, has already been released from his duties, the spokeswoman said, adding that a successor has not yet been found.\nVolkswagen has said it could list its trucks business as part of expansion plans for the division, or issue debt.\nU.S. trucks peer Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ) said in a public filing last Friday that Gruendler planned to resign from the firm’s board of directors, adding that his decision to quit was not related to any disagreement with his employer over strategy or operations.
