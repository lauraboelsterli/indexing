    "text": "PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cable One, Inc. (NYSE: CABO) (the “Company” or “Cable ONE”) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights:\nNet income was $40.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 26.6% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $123.2 million, an increase of 26.7% year-over-year. Net profit margin was 15.3% and Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 46.3%. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA results for the first quarter of 2018 include NewWave Communications (“NewWave”) operations, which the Company acquired on May 1, 2017. Without the contribution from the NewWave operations, net income would have increased 17.7% year-over-year to $37.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7.4% to $104.4 million year-over-year. In addition, net profit margin would have been 17.4% and Adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 48.1%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $94.7 million, an increase of 21.0% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (1) was $82.1 million, an increase of 34.0% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total revenues were $265.8 million, including a $48.6 million contribution from NewWave operations, compared to $207.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Residential data revenues increased 31.4% and business services revenues increased 39.8% year-over-year. Excluding the contribution from NewWave operations, residential data revenues increased 10.7% and business services revenues increased 12.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are defined in the section of this press release entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics.” Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are reconciled to net income, Adjusted EBITDA margin is reconciled to net profit margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures is also reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to the “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” tables within this press release. First Quarter 2018 Financial Results Compared to First Quarter 2017\nRevenues increased $58.3 million, or 28.1%, to $265.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to $48.6 million in revenues attributable to the NewWave operations. For the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, residential data revenues comprised 44.6% and 43.5% of total revenues and business services revenues comprised 14.2% and 13.0% of total revenues, respectively. Excluding the $48.6 million contribution from NewWave operations in the first quarter of 2018, revenues increased to $217.1 million from $207.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) were $94.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and increased $25.7 million, or 37.1%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 35.6% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 33.3% for the year-ago quarter. Additional operating expenses attributable to the NewWave operations were $24.3 million for the first quarter of 2018. The remaining increase was due primarily to higher repairs and maintenance costs of $0.8 million, group insurance costs of $0.3 million and contract labor costs of $0.3 million. Excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, operating expenses would have been $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.4 million, or 2.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 32.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 33.3% in the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $51.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 and increased $4.6 million, or 9.8%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 19.2% and 22.4% for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additional selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the NewWave operations were $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the incremental expenses associated with the NewWave operations, selling, general and administrative expenses would have decreased $1.9 million, or 4.0%, to $44.5 million due to $1.5 million of acquisition-related costs and $1.3 million of severance costs incurred in the first quarter of 2017 that did not recur in 2018, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in group insurance costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, excluding the impact of the NewWave operations, would have been 20.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $48.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 and increased $9.2 million, or 23.4%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due primarily to new assets placed in service since the first quarter of 2017, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the NewWave acquisition, partially offset by assets that became fully depreciated since the first quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense related to the NewWave operations was $12.5 million for the first quarter of 2018. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 18.4% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 19.1% for the first quarter of 2017.\nWe recognized a $6.6 million net loss on disposal of assets during the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a $6.1 million net gain on disposal of assets, which primarily related to the sale of a non-operating property.\nInterest expense increased $7.1 million, or 93.6%, to $14.7 million due primarily to additional outstanding debt that was incurred in the second quarter of 2017 to finance the NewWave acquisition.\nIncome tax provision decreased $9.2 million, or 48.3%, to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of the 2017 Federal tax reform legislation.\nNet income increased $8.5 million, or 26.6%, to $40.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $32.1 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the NewWave operations, net income would have been $37.8 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $123.2 million and $97.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth of 26.7% includes the positive impact of the NewWave operations. Without the contribution from NewWave operations, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $104.4 million and year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.4% for the first quarter of 2018.\nCapital expenditures totaled $41.0 million and $35.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 was $82.1 million, an increase of $20.8 million, or 34.0%, from the prior year quarter. Excluding the NewWave operations, capital expenditures would have been $34.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $185.5 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, compared to $161.8 million at December 31, 2017. The Company’s debt balance was $1.2 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Company also had $196.9 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nCable ONE will host a conference call with the financial community to discuss results for the first quarter of 2018 on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).\nShareholders, analysts and other interested parties may register for the conference in advance at http://dpregister.com/10119518 . Those unable to pre-register may join the call via the live audio webcast on the Cable ONE Investor Relations website or by dialing 1-844-378-6483 (Canada: 1-855-669-9657/International: 1-412-542-4178) shortly before 11 a.m. ET.\nA replay of the call will be available from Wednesday, May 9, 2018, until Wednesday, May 23, 2018, on the Cable ONE Investor Relations website.\nAdditional Information Available on Website\nThe information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018, which will be posted on the “SEC Filings” section of the Cable ONE Investor Relations website at ir.cableone.net when it is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Investors and others interested in more information about Cable ONE should consult our website, which is regularly updated with financial and other important information about the Company.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics\nThe Company uses certain measures that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, net income, net profit margin or net cash provided by operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are reconciled to net income, and Adjusted EBITDA margin is reconciled to net profit margin, in the “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” tables within this press release. Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures is also reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities in the “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” tables within this press release.\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, severance expense, (gain) loss on deferred compensation, acquisition-related costs, (gain) loss on disposal of assets, billing system conversion costs, other (income) expense and other unusual operating expenses, as provided in the “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” tables within this press release. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company’s business as well as other non-cash or special items and is unaffected by the Company’s capital structure or investment activities. This measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the Company’s cash cost of debt financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.\n“Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues.\n“Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures,” when used as a liquidity measure, is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities excluding the impact of capital expenditures, interest expense, income tax provision, changes in operating assets and liabilities, deferred income taxes and other unusual operating expenses, as provided in the “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” tables within this press release.\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures to assess its performance, and it also uses Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures as an indicator of its ability to fund operations and make additional investments with internally-generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the measure used in the leverage ratio calculation under the Company’s credit facilities and outstanding 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022 to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and ability to take certain actions under the indenture governing the notes. Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures are also significant performance measures used by the Company in its annual incentive compensation program. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account cash used for mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures, and thus does not represent residual funds available for discretionary uses.\nThe Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to investors in evaluating the operating performance of the Company. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures is useful to investors as it shows the Company’s performance while taking into account cash outflows for capital expenditures and is one of several indicators of the Company’s ability to service debt, make investments and/or return capital to its shareholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and similar measures with similar titles are common measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in the Company’s industry, although the Company’s measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAbout Cable ONE\nCable ONE (NYSE: CABO) is among the 10 largest cable companies in the United States and a leading broadband communications provider.
