    "text": "BERKELEY, Calif., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aduro Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADRO) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.5 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to net loss of $21.8 million, or $0.32 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nRecent Developments:\nReported preclinical data on ADU-S100, BION-1301 and ADU-1604 at the American Association for Cancer Research\nReported initial observations from the first patient treated with our personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy\nReceived a milestone payment from Merck for initiation of a Phase 1 trial of our anti-CD27 antibody for patients with advanced solid tumors\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $327.8 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $349.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nRevenue was $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $2.8 million was primarily due to a $3.0 million milestone payment received from Merck for initiation of a Phase 1 trial for our anti-CD27 antibody.\nResearch and development expenses were $20.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $20.6 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $0.5 million was due to lower contract manufacturing expense of $3.1 million primarily related to BION-1301, partially offset by increases in clinical development and contract research expenses for our ongoing programs including ADU-S100, BION-1301, ADU-1604 and our personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy, as well as increases in stock-based compensation and personnel related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.3 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $0.7 million was driven primarily by legal fees associated with our patent portfolio and higher stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased compensation expense.\nIncome tax benefit was approximately $21 thousand for the first quarter of 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $2.8 million for the same period in 2017. The income tax benefit for 2017 related to federal income tax benefit associated with the carryback of the 2017 losses.\nAbout Aduro\nAduro Biotech, Inc. is an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that are intended to transform the treatment of challenging diseases.
