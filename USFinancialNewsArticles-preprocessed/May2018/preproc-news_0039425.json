    "text": "OTTAWA, May 16 (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing sales increased more than expected in March on strength in primary metals, aerospace products and parts, fabricated metals and other transportation equipment, Statistics Canada reported on Wednesday.\nFactory sales rose 1.4 percent, surpassing the 1.2 percent gain expected by economists, and Februaryâ€™s increase was upwardly revised to 2.7 percent from a previously reported 1.9 percent.\nVolume rose a more modest 0.6 percent in March.\nSales of primary metals rose 4.2 percent, building on a 4.4 percent increase in February. Iron and steel mills and ferro-alloy as well as alumina and aluminum production and processing industries posted the largest sales gains in the month.\nIn the aerospace industry, production increased 10.6 percent in March after a 4.0 percent gain in February, boosted by the depreciation of the Canadian dollar.\nSales were up by 4.6 percent in the fabricated metal product industries, by 37.4 percent in other transportation equipment and by 3.7 percent in the wood product industries.\nThe gains were partly offset by a 2.0 percent decline in the motor vehicle industry, a 1.7 percent drop in machinery and a 3.4 percent decrease in computer and electronic products.\nInventories rose 0.7 percent to a record high, making for a sixth consecutive monthly increase, driven by gains in the transportation, chemical and plastic and rubber product industries.
