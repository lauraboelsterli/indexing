Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans will host the following year, the eighth time it will be held there, a single-venue record.\nThat would make for the fourth time a Super Bowl has been hosted in Arizona (third at University of Phoenix Stadium) and a record-tying 11th time for New Orleans.

The aforementioned game in Miami is up next, followed by Tampa Bay and Los Angeles. The game in L.A. will be played in the stadium being built for the Rams and Chargers to share.\nThe NFL is ending the process of potential host cities bidding to win the league’s approval. Instead, the league will ask cities if they would like to host the game, while giving special merit to locations that have new stadiums.\nThe owners also awarded the 2019 NFL Draft hosting duties to Nashville on Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
