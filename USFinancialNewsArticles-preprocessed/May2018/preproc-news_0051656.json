    "text": "0 COMMENTS Companies are trying to get employees to think about ethics when making business decisions, and are using nudges--a tool of behavioral ethics--to influence how they make choices. Photo: iStockphoto.com/DNY59\nDrug maker Eli Lilly & Co. wants its employees to report wrongdoing and bad behavior. Part of that effort involves encouraging employees to watch videos of real-life situations in which their colleagues discuss the real-time ethical choices they made in the course of doing business.\nEli Lilly and other companies are looking to influence how people make decisions and are using “nudges,” or choice architecture, as a way to promote ethical behavior among their employees. Nudges are one of the ways businesses are deploying behavioral ethics to reaffirm their values and to keep employees focused on questions of ethics and compliance as they engage in their daily work.\nRarely do employees come across black-and-white issues in a business as complicated as pharmaceuticals and health care, so offering reminders to act ethically makes good business sense for the company, said Melissa Stapleton Barnes, the company’s chief ethics and compliance officer.\n“The idea is to keep this topic in front of people in any way we can,” said Ms. Barnes. “We know from research that when people have this kind of messaging in front of them they are more likely to make the right decisions.”\nAll employees receive ethics training “whether they like it or not,” she said, since “everyone thinks they are ethical,” even if they aren’t.\nThe company reports an increase in employee reporting but can’t tell for certain the role nudges played, as their effectiveness is hard to measure, said Ms. Barnes. She said she believes the nudges have helped, as the training videos are among the most-watched each quarter. “It’s hard to measure…but people are asking more questions, raising concerns, and that’s a good thing,” she said.\nAvoiding Traps\nAppealing to someone’s better nature is a good approach to take to nudge someone, said Philippa Foster Back, director of the U.K.-based Institute of Business Ethics. The organization published last month a briefing paper detailing the ways how behavioral ethics can influence decision-making.\n“Nudging is a very effective tool,” said Ms. Back, citing as an example the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and similar laws elsewhere that require companies to publish a statement about child labor in their supply chains. “The transformative effect it has had on companies focusing on their supply chain, how it is running and whether their suppliers are aligned with their own values…we call that a nudge law because of the positive effect it’s had,” she said.\nTodd Haugh, an assistant professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University, published a paper on nudges last year. In it he cited examples of how organizations can change employee behavior.\nIn one instance, an organization made employees opt out of its 401k retirement-savings program instead of opting in, which led to higher participation rates. In another, people made healthier eating choices when fatty and other unhealthy food was removed from their eye level at a cafeteria and placed in a harder-to-get place.\nCompanies should begin by nudging on what Mr. Haugh describes as “low-hanging fruit” such as expense reports. These are areas where employees are presented with the most opportunities for ethical transgressions, said Mr. Haugh.\nA nudge in this case could involve having employees attest they will be honest in reporting their expenses before they fill out the report, which has been shown to reduce fraud. “If [companies] can move the needle on those, they can set the tone for larger benefits down the road,” he said.\nOrganizations that want to integrate behavioral ethics into their training and culture-building initiatives should avoid the trap of focusing principally on their ethics and compliance programs, said Dov Seidman, chief executive of LRN Corp., an advisory-services firm that focuses on ethics and culture.\n“The goal must be to integrate ethical decision making into the company’s business” said Mr. Seidman.\nRemaining Top of Mind\nFord Motor Co. in 2015 created an app its employees can use to access the company’s code of conduct. The tool gives employees a chance to review the auto maker’s values as they figure out the proper action to take in any given business situation, said Raphael Richmond, the company’s global director of compliance.\nThe app supplements training an employee or supplier receives but that they may not have at the top of their mind when making decisions, she said. “We’re doing it from the perspective that the messages we give employees can help them to think through situations they might find themselves in,” said Ms. Richmond.\nOne challenge facing companies in this area is how to measure the effectiveness of nudges. While specific benchmarks have yet to be identified, there are indicators, such as the number of calls to the hotline, complaints filed, the results of employee surveys, said Ms. Back.\n“This is one of the areas where compliance is lacking,” said Mr. Haugh. Companies can begin to measure by making small changes–for instance, having employees certify to the honesty of their expense reports before they fill them out–and then measuring the results against those reports where employees didn’t have to do that.\nAny training or communications effort is only as good as the values that inform and underpin it, said Mr. Seidman. “If a company doesn’t ‘mean it’–have a clear purpose and strong values to guide how to achieve it–then no amount of nudges will change behavior,” he said.\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@wsj.com , and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.\nShare this: choice architecture Eli Lilly ethical behavior Ethics Ford Indiana University Institute of Business Ethics LRN Corp. nudges Previous The Morning Risk Report: Small Banks Require Patience as They Await Dodd-Frank Relief Next Corruption Currents: Ex-South Korean President Calls Bribery Charges an 'Insult' Content from our sponsor Deloitte Risk management, strategy and analysis from Deloitte How Agile Internal Audit Can Add Value Internal auditor groups are continually challenged to provide more value to stakeholders while enhancing organizational influence and impact. However, many efforts to address these challenges are not working—or not working quickly enough. An agile internal audit function can provide methods that work to change both the mindset of internal auditors and their work processes.
