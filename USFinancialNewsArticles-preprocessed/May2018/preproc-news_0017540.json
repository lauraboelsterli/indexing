    "text": "261 COMMENTS President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the nuclear deal his predecessor negotiated with Iran represents a giant gamble, easily the biggest of his presidency so far.\nMore precisely, the move represents a series of gambles—bets that Iran’s leaders, its economy and its people, as well as America’s allies and even the leader of North Korea, will react the way the president hopes. Mr. Trump may well win those bets, but the dangers that would accompany a loss are quite high.\nThe core of the president’s gamble is that a renewal of full-bore economic sanctions on Iran will be enough to compel its leaders back to the table to renegotiate the nuclear deal completed during President Barack Obama’s term. In fact, Mr. Trump flatly predicted Iran’s leaders will do exactly that.\nAlternatively, his calculation appears to be that a resumption of full-bore American pressure will so disrupt a weak Iranian economy—already reeling from rising prices, a falling currency and a long drought—that the result will be growing dissatisfaction and internal unrest that threatens the very survival of the regime.\nRelated Video President Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions on Tehran. He called the deal \"defective\" and said it didn't do enough to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump didn’t say he wants his move to bring regime change in Tehran, but with his references to the “murderous” government in Iran and his declaration that “the future of Iran belongs to its people,” he walked to the edge of calling for it. The risk, though, is that the Iranian people instead rally around their government now that it faces a renewed threat from America.\nThe further gamble is that U.S. allies in France, Britain and Germany, who have pleaded for a different course from the president, will cooperate in a new wave of economic sanctions rather than rebel and move out to construct a new relationship of their own with Iran. Such European defiance could undercut the pressure Mr. Trump is trying to create and ultimately isolate the U.S. rather than Iran.\nThe president’s pledge to impose sanctions on any nation that helps Iran targets America’s allies as much as the regime in Tehran, and could produce a sanctions fight not just with Iran, but also with allies.\nIn addition, Mr. Trump is taking a chance that Iran won’t simply respond by resuming full-bore nuclear activity , turning back on the hundreds of centrifuges it still possesses to produce the enriched uranium that the West fears would put it on the path toward nuclear-weapons capability. European leaders are urging the Iranians to react calmly, without precipitous action, but hard-liners in Tehran may instead seize the moment to revive actions they never wanted to halt in the first place.\nIranian lawmakers set a paper U.S. flag ablaze in parliament in Tehran on Wednesday, shouting, “Death to America!” Photo: /Associated Press Mr. Trump is further betting that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom he meets in a matter of weeks, will take away from his announcement the lesson the president wants—which is that an Iran-style deal that slows rather than eliminates Pyongyang’s nuclear program won’t be deemed sufficient. The risk is that North Korea will take away an alternative lesson, which is that the U.S. can’t be counted on to live up to deals its leaders make.\nAbove all, Mr. Trump’s decision represents a gamble that the heightened tensions with Iran that now are at hand won’t escalate into conflict —with the U.S., with Israel or with Saudi Arabia.\n“The worst case is that Iran restarts selected nuclear activities, and either Israel or the U.S. determines that is unacceptable, uses military force and Iran responds in any number of ways around the region or around the world with all its tools,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Those tools, he notes, include terrorism and cyberwarfare.\nIndeed, after Mr. Trump’s move, “the ball is now essentially in Iran’s court as to how this crisis evolves,” says Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution. “I think the likely short-term approach will seek to maximize whatever diplomatic and economic restitution may be on offer from Europe.”\nRelated\nU.S. Pullout From Iran Pact Widens Mideast Gulf Trump’s Iran Sanctions Put Oil Giants in a Bind How Fast Could Iran Build a Nuclear Bomb Saudi Arabia Pledges to Support ‘Stability of Oil Markets’ But, she adds, “Tehran has a wide range of options available for demonstrating that its leverage on the ground in conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere across the region is at least as formidable as U.S. economic leverage.”\nFinally, Mr. Trump is gambling that his tough line on Iran will convince others in the region that the U.S. will remain adamant and unyielding in its insistence that Iran won’t ever be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. The president said that will help ensure that others in the region don’t set out to acquire nuclear weapons of their own, and seek to beat Iran to the punch as they do so.\nThe risk there, of course, is that the reverse could happen. Iran could now respond with a burst of new nuclear activity, Mr. Haass says, prompting Saudi Arabia and potentially others to break away from the global Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and begin their own march toward nuclear arms.\nWrite to Gerald F.
