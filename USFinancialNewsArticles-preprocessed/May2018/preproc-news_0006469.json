    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX) today announced first quarter 2018 unaudited financial and operating results. Additional details can be found in the Company's @NFX publication, located on its website http://www.newfield.com .\nNewfield plans to host a conference call at 10 a.m. CDT on May 2, 2018. To listen to the call, please visit Newfield's website at http://www.newfield.com . To participate in the call, dial 323-794-2551 and provide conference code 3053206 at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nIn the first quarter of 2018, both domestic net production and Anadarko Basin net production exceeded the high-end of the Company's guidance ranges. First quarter 2018 domestic net production was 173,600 BOEPD (41% oil and 61% liquids). The better than expected results during the quarter were primarily related to higher volumes from the Anadarko Basin, which averaged approximately 117,500 BOEPD during the first quarter. Consolidated production for the first quarter of 2018 was 176,500 BOEPD (42% oil, and 62% liquids). The Company lifted 261,000 net barrels from its offshore oil field in China. First quarter 2018 capital investments were $345 million and the Company reiterated its full year capital investment plan of approximately $1.3 billion. During the first quarter, Newfield amended and extended its unsecured credit facility by $200 million to a total capacity of $2.0 billion. The term was extended to May 2023. As of March 31, 2018 the Company had no borrowings on the facility. The Company continues to see strong returns from its development drilling campaign in STACK. To date, Newfield has drilled or participated in more than 85 infill wells. These developments have tested as many as 12 wells per drilling spacing unit and results to date on average exceed our three-year plan well performance estimates. Long-term production updates for these various infill developments can be found in the Company's @NFX publication. As part of an ongoing drilling campaign to hold acreage by production, the Company turned to sales several new wells in the Western STACK region of Blaine and Custer Counties, Oklahoma. The Debbie and Sandrock wells attained early gross production rates of nearly 30 MMcfe/d. The Sawyer and Lois wells had 24-hour gross initial rates of 2,483 BOEPD (54% oil) and 1,842 BOEPD (40% oil), respectively. As expected, due to the geographic location of these HBP wells, the production was weighted toward natural gas -- but results demonstrate the potential of this region. With the recent completion of these wells, Newfield's acreage position in this area is substantially all held by production. Additional information regarding these Western STACK wells is available in @NFX. Realized crude oil prices during the first quarter of 2018 in STACK averaged approximately 100% of NYMEX WTI. Domestic natural gas prices in first quarter averaged more than 90% of Henry Hub pricing as a result of Newfield's proactive marketing initiatives. Detailed information on realizations for the first quarter can be found in @NFX.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Production Summary\nFor the first quarter, the Company recorded net income of $86 million, or $0.43 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Earnings were impacted by an unrealized derivative loss of $79 million, or $0.39 per share. After adjusting for the effect of the unrealized derivative loss during the period, net income would have been $165 million, or $0.82 per share. See the \"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release for additional disclosures.\nRevenues for the first quarter were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million. Discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million.\nNewfield's consolidated net production in the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 176,500 BOEPD, comprised of 42% oil, 20% natural gas liquids and 38% natural gas. Domestic net production in the first quarter was approximately 173,600 BOEPD, comprised of 41% oil, 20% natural gas liquids and 39% natural gas.\n2018E Production, Cost and Expense Guidance\nDomestic Production\nOil (mbopd)\n74\nNGLs (mbopd)\n38\nNatural Gas (mmcfpd)\n412\nTotal (mboepd)\n175 - 185\nDomestic Expenses ($/BOE) 1\nLOE 2\n$\n3.43\nTransportation 3\n4.95\nProduction & other taxes\n4.7\n%\nGeneral & administrative (G&A), net\n$\n3.44\nInterest expense, net\n1.42\nEffective Tax rate\n0 - 5\n%\nCAPEX ($MM) 1\nDrilling & Completion\n$\n1,160\nOther\n140\nTotal CAPEX 1\n$\n1,300\nChina Production (mbopd) 4\n3 - 5\n1 Cost and expenses are expected to be within 5% of the estimates above\n2 Total LOE includes recurring, major expense and non E&P operating expenses\n3 2018E transportation / processing fees include ~$38 million of Arkoma unused firm gas transportation and ~$21 million of Uinta oil and gas delivery shortfall fees\n4 Full year estimates include the first quarter lifting of 261,000 barrels and planned liftings of approximately 750,000 barrels in the second quarter.
