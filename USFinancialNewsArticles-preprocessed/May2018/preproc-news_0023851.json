    "text": "First Quarter RevPAR Increased 4.3 percent; First Quarter Franchise and other Fee-based Revenue Grew 8.0 percent\nIRVING, Texas, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La Quinta Holdings Inc. (“La Quinta” or the “Company”) (NYSE:LQ) today reported its results for the first quarter .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nGrew system-wide comparable RevPAR 4.3 percent; excluding the owned hotels significantly impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and the owned hotels undergoing significant renovation, system-wide RevPAR grew 5.9 percent\nFranchise comparable RevPAR increased 7.8 percent, driving an increase in franchise and other fee-based revenue of 8.0 percent\nSystem-wide RevPAR Index decreased by nine basis points; excluding the owned hotels significantly impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and the owned hotels undergoing significant renovation, system-wide RevPAR Index grew nearly 200 basis points\nOpened eight franchised hotels, totaling over 650 rooms, including the first location in Chile\nFranchise pipeline stands at 259 hotels, representing approximately 24,400 additional rooms, and the brand’s footprint continued to expand with 6 new franchise agreements for key locations in coastal North Carolina, St. Louis, Missouri and Yucaipa, California\nCompleted the construction phase of 12 renovations, bringing the total number of repositioning projects with construction complete to 39, as part of the Company’s owned hotel repositioning efforts\nReported Net Loss of $15.1 million; Adjusted Net Loss was $6.2 million\nGenerated Net Loss per Share of $0.13; Adjusted Net Loss per Share was $0.05\nOverview\n“We are extremely pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered gains in RevPAR despite the ongoing hurricane disruption in our owned hotel business, and continued to execute on our key strategic initiatives to deliver a consistent product, to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience and to drive engagement with our brand,” said Keith A. Cline, President and Chief Executive Officer of La Quinta. “We have completed the significant renovation of 39 owned hotels in our repositioning program and continue to be very encouraged by their early results.”\nMr. Cline continued, “We expect to complete the spin-off of our owned hotel assets into CorePoint Lodging as well as the sale of our franchise and management business to Wyndham Hotel Group by the end of this month. These are exciting opportunities for the thriving La Quinta brand, which celebrates its 50 th anniversary this year, and for our owned hotel portfolio as it transitions to become CorePoint Lodging, all of which we believe will yield long-term benefits to our stakeholders.”\nFinancial Overview\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company grew system-wide comparable RevPAR 4.3 percent over the same period of 2017, driven by 7.8 percent growth in its franchise locations and a 0.2 percent increase in its owned hotels. Excluding the impact of the owned hotels undergoing significant renovation as part of the repositioning effort and the owned hotels affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 5.9 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The Company grew franchise and other fee-based revenue 8.0 percent in the first quarter of 2018, over the same period of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported net loss of $15.1 million and Adjusted Net Loss of $6.2 million. Net Loss per Share was $0.13 and Adjusted Loss per Share was $0.05. Total Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $64.0 million.\nHurricanes Harvey and Irma continued to have a significant impact on the Company’s business in the first quarter, once again lifting performance for the franchised hotels, and posing significant challenges for certain owned hotels, particularly those in Florida affected by Hurricane Irma. The Company estimates that the impact of the hurricanes on first quarter results was a reduction of approximately $11 million in Total Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company’s system-wide portfolio, as of March 31, 2018, is located across 48 states in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Colombia and Chile. The portfolio includes:\nMarch 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 # of hotels # of rooms # of hotels # of rooms Owned (1) 315 40,300 318 40,700 Joint Venture 1 200 1 200 Franchised (2) 591 48,300 570 46,500 Totals 907 88,800 889 87,400 (1) As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, Owned included two hotels (300 rooms) and three hotels (400 rooms), respectively, designated as assets held for sale\n(2) As of both March 31, 2018 and 2017, Franchised included four hotels (500 rooms), respectively, under temporary franchise agreements related to formerly owned hotels which are in the process of leaving the system\nThe results of operations for the Company for the three months and 2017 include the following highlights ($ in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (1) 2017 (1) % Change Total Revenue $ 228,780 $ 234,272 -2.3 % Franchise and Management Segment Adj.

As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a pipeline of 259 franchised hotels totaling approximately 24,400 rooms, to be located in the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador.\nOwned Hotel Portfolio\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had two hotels held for sale. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company closed on the sale of one hotel. In addition, during the first quarter, construction progressed on the portfolio of approximately 50 owned hotels which the Company believes have the opportunity to be repositioned upward within their markets in order to drive enhanced guest experience and revenue growth. As of March 31, 2018, 39 of these hotels had completed the construction phase of the project and are now in the process of being reintroduced to their markets with encouraging early results.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.9%, including the impact of an interest rate swap. Total cash and cash equivalents was $113.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\nOutlook\nOn January 18, 2018, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham”) and La Quinta announced that they entered into a definitive agreement under which Wyndham will acquire La Quinta’s franchise and management business for $1.95 billion in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, immediately following completion of the planned taxable spin-off of La Quinta’s owned real estate assets into a new publicly-traded real estate investment trust (the “Spin”), CorePoint Lodging Inc. (“CorePoint Lodging”).\nGiven the expected timeline to close these transactions, La Quinta is not providing guidance for 2018. Near the time of the Spin, management of CorePoint Lodging expects to conduct investor education meetings during which, among other items, financial and strategic outlooks will be provided.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call with prepared remarks for investors and other interested parties beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

The Company believes this financial information provides meaningful supplemental information. The Company further believes the presentation of Total Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted (Loss) Earnings Per Share provides meaningful information because it excludes the impact of certain special items and/or certain items that are not expected to have an ongoing effect on its operations. This represents how management views the business and reviews its operating performance. It is also used by management when publicly providing the business outlook.\n“EBITDA” and “Total Adjusted EBITDA.” Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure in many industries. The Company adjusts EBITDA when evaluating its performance because the Company believes that the adjustment for certain items, such as restructuring and acquisition transaction expenses, impairment charges related to long-lived assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, discontinued operations, and other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance, provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding its ongoing operating performance. The Company believes that EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about it and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by the Company’s management team to evaluate its operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, lenders and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in the Company’s industry.\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net (loss) income, cash flow or other methods of analyzing the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company’s interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on its indebtedness;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that the Company considers not to be indicative of its future operations;\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\nother companies in the Company’s industry may calculate EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to the Company to reinvest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to the Company to meet its obligations.\n“Total Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents the ratio of Total Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues.\n“Adjusted operating income (loss)” represents the Company’s reported operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude the impact of items not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Adjusted operating income (loss) is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in the Company’s operating results.\n“Adjusted Net (Loss) Income” and “Adjusted (Loss) Earnings Per Share” are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), earnings per share, or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s definitions of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted (Loss) Earnings Per Share are included to assist investors in performing meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means of highlighting the results of the Company’s ongoing operations in a comparable format.\nTOTAL ADJUSTED EBITDA NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (unaudited, in thousands) Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018 Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2017 Operating income $ 4,342 $ 23,972 Interest expense, net (21,456 ) (19,980 ) Other income (expense) 119 (24 ) Income tax benefit (expense) 1,927 (2,290 ) Income from noncontrolling interest (71 ) (89 ) Net (Loss) Income attributable to La Quinta\nHoldings’ Stockholders (15,139 ) 1,589 Interest expense 21,744 20,108 Income tax (benefit) expense (1,927 ) 2,290 Depreciation and amortization 39,893 36,257 Noncontrolling interest 71 89 EBITDA 44,642 60,333 Gain (loss) on sales (498 ) 138 Gain related to casualty disasters (928 ) (1,928 ) Equity-based compensation 2,365 3,943 Amortization of software service agreements 2,467 2,359 Retention plan 2,484 2,550 Reorganization costs 9,894 2,143 Other losses, net 3,586 2,412 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,012 $ 71,950\nSEGMENT REVENUES AND TOTAL ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION (unaudited, in thousands) Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018 Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2017 Revenues Owned Hotels $ 197,555 $ 205,635 Franchise and management 27,180 26,714 Segment revenues 224,735 232,349 Other fee-based revenues from franchised properties 6,397 5,754 Corporate and other 28,206 28,783 Intersegment elimination (30,558 ) (32,614 Total revenues $ 228,780 $ 234,272 Total Adjusted EBITDA Owned Hotels $ 49,247 $ 58,721 Franchise and management 27,180 26,714 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 76,427 85,435 Corporate and other (12,415 ) (13,485 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,012 $ 71,950\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (unaudited, in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017 Operating income $ 4,342 $ 23,972 Retention plan 2,484 2,550 Reorganization costs 9,894 2,143 (Gain) loss on sales (498 ) 138 Adjusted operating income $ 16,222 $ 28,803\nADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (unaudited, in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Net Income Diluted\nEarnings\nPer\nShare Net Income Diluted\nEarnings\nPer\nShare Net (Loss) Income attributable to La Quinta\nHoldings’ Stockholders $ (15,139 ) (0.13 ) $ 1,589 0.01 Retention plan 2,484 0.02 2,550 0.03 Reorganization costs 9,894 0.09 2,143 0.02 (Gain) loss on sales (498 ) — 138 — Tax impact of adjustments (2,928 ) (0.03 ) (1,932 ) (0.02 Adjusted Net (Loss) Income attributable to La Quinta Holdings’ Stockholders $ (6,187 ) (0.05 ) $ 4,488 $ 0.04 Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic 116,324 115,936 Weighted average common shares outstanding, diluted 116,324 116,368\nLA QUINTA HOLDINGS INC.\nCERTAIN DEFINED TERMS\n“ADR” or “average daily rate” means hotel room revenues divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period.\n“comparable hotels” means hotels that: were active and operating in the Company’s system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the applicable period and were active and operating as of January 1st of the previous year; except for (i) hotels that sustained substantial property damage or other business interruption, (ii) owned hotels that become subject to a purchase and sale agreement, or (iii) hotels in which comparable results are otherwise not available. Management uses comparable hotels as the basis upon which to evaluate ADR, occupancy, RevPAR and RevPAR Index on a system-wide basis and for each of the Company’s reportable segments.\n“occupancy” means the total number of rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels.\n“RevPAR” or “revenue per available room” means the product of the ADR charged and the average daily occupancy achieved.\n“RevPAR Index” measures a hotel’s fair market share of its competitive set’s revenue per available room.\n“system-wide” refers collectively to the Company’s owned, franchised and managed hotel portfolios.\nSource:La Quinta Holdings Inc.",
