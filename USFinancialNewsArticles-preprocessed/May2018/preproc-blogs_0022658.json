    "text": "0 COMMENTS The same accounting rule change that boosted Alphabet earnings is now hurting Warren Buffett‘s.\nMr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a $1.14 billion first-quarter loss Saturday, but said that was due to $6.2 billion in losses on equity investments that the company now has to count in net income because of an accounting change that took effect at the start of the year.\nThat change distorts Berkshire’s earnings, the company says. The investment gains and losses are “often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our periodic economic performance,” Berkshire said in its latest quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Berkshire’s first-quarter operating earnings, which the company considers a better barometer of its performance, were $5.29 billion, up 49% from a year ago.\n“It really is not representative of what’s going on in the business at all,” said Mr. Buffett at Berkshire’s annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Neb. “If you look at the figure of operating earnings, which is what we look at, we actually earned a record amount of any quarter we’ve ever had.”\nThe investment losses stem from a new rule that accounting rule-makers issued in 2016 on how companies should recognize and measure the value of the financial instruments they own. One part of the rule requires companies to include in their net income some gains and losses on their equity investments that had previously been kept out of the net income calculation.\nThe change affects Berkshire because of the significant stakes it owns in other companies, and the losses reflect the poor performance of some of those investments in the first quarter. Shares of Wells Fargo & Co. lost 13.6% during the quarter; Coca-Cola shares fell 5.3% and American Express shares were down 6.1%.\nA different provision of the same new rule helped first-quarter earnings at Alphabet, Google’s parent. Alphabet’s first-quarter earnings, announced last month, included $3 billion in gains on the values of the stakes it owns in Uber Technologies Inc. and other hot technology startups that are closely held and don’t trade regularly.\nThe provision affecting Alphabet indicated that companies which owned such hard-to-value equity securities could value them on a mark-to-market basis if there were “observable price changes” in those securities or similar investments. That means Alphabet and other companies which own stakes in tech “unicorns” that have soared in value can now reflect those gains in their own earnings.\nMr. Buffett had warned in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders in February that Berkshire’s earnings would appear more volatile starting this year because of the rule change. The value of Berkshire’s holdings affected by the new rule can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a given quarter, he wrote, and that will render Berkshire’s bottom-line net income “useless” for analytical purposes.\nHe wrote that he expects “considerable confusion among shareholders for whom accounting is a foreign language.”\nNicole Friedman contributed to this article.\nShare this: Alphabet Berkshire Earnings Previous Stocks to Watch: Berkshire, Starbucks, Apple, Mondelez, Wells Fargo, Nvidia, Exxon, Blackstone",
