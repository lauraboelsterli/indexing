REUTERS/Steve Nesius/File Photo\nThe issue has formed a central part of corporate engagement for many of the investors ahead of the season for annual general meetings.\nBP holds its AGM on Monday, with fellow oil major Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday, at which shareholders are set to vote on whether the company should set firm carbon emissions targets linked to the Paris deal.\n“Regardless of the result at the Shell AGM, we strongly encourage all companies in this sector to clarify how they see their future in a low-carbon world.\n“This should involve making concrete commitments to substantially reduce carbon emissions, assessing the impact of emissions from the use of their products and explaining how the investments they make are compatible with a pathway towards the Paris goal.”\nThe letter also urged policymakers to take “clearer and more collective action” to implement regulation supporting investment in lower-carbon technologies and would talk with companies and maintain oversight of their actions.\n“The broad support for this letter sends one clear message- investors are embracing their responsibility for supporting the Paris agreement. It is time for the entire oil and gas industry to do the same,” a spokesman for Newton Investment Management, one of the signatories, told Reuters.
