The complaint did not mention the firm by name, but the only FINRA record for a Woojae Jung lists Goldman Sachs as the employer. \"We are aware of the situation regarding Mr. Jung and are cooperating with legal authorities on the matter,\" Goldman said in a statement. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A Goldman Sachs sign hangs on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\nA Goldman Sachs banker has been charged with insider trading.\nA seven-count criminal complaint unsealed Thursday charged Woojae \"Steve\" Jung with trading with an unnamed co-conspirator on material non-public information he accessed while working at an investment bank with offices in New York and San Francisco.\nThe complaint did not mention the bank by name, but the only FINRA record for a Woojae Jung lists Goldman Sachs as the employer . A LinkedIn profile page for a Steve Woojae Jung states he is vice president, investment banking, at Goldman Sachs.\n\"We are aware of the situation regarding Mr. Jung and are cooperating with legal authorities on the matter,\" Goldman said in a statement.\nWR Grace, SanDisk, KLA-Tencor and Microsemi are among the stocks allegedly involved in the insider trading scheme, the court documents showed. In each case, Jung accessed sensitive, market-moving information through the investment bank, which was involved in potential restructuring or acquisition deals, according to the documents.\nIn all, 37-year-old Jung and his 38-year-old co-conspirator traded in securities of 12 different companies based on the material, non-public information and generated profits of about $140,000 between 2015 and 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate complaint Thursday.\nJung purchased securities using a brokerage account held in the name of Sungrok Hwang, a friend living in South Korea, the SEC said. The commission seeks a permanent injunction against Jung, and the return of ill-gotten gains from him and his friend.",
