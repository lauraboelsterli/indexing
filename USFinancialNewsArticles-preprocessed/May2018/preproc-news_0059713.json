    "text": "WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - In a setback to abortion rights advocates, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for Republican-backed restrictions on medication-induced abortions to take effect in Arkansas that could lead to the shuttering of two of the state’s three abortion clinics.\nThe nine justices declined to hear an appeal by abortion provider Planned Parenthood of a lower court ruling that had revived the state law, which sets regulations regarding the RU-486 “abortion pill,” after it was earlier struck down by a federal judge. The law had remained blocked pending the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood could yet ask a judge to reimpose the injunction blocking the law.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ",
