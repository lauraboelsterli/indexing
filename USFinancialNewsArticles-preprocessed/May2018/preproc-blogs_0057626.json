    "text": "J.P. Morgan Chase, the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, said trading revenue in the second quarter is likely to be about unchanged from a year ago amid charges related to taxes and accounting rule changes.\n\"Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,\" Co-president Daniel Pinto said Tuesday during a conference in New York. \"The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat.\"\nJ.P. Morgan shares fell 1.7 percent Tuesday amid a broad sell-off for bank stocks.\nshow chapters 'Big Short' investor Steve Eisman on the state of US banking 5 Hours Ago | 03:04 Pinto cited \"good performance\" in rates, commodities and the corporate credit business. \"Equities overall we are doing fine,\" he added.\nThe charges include a $100 million quarterly hit related to a tax-oriented investment business within the fixed income division, Pinto said.\nThe bank produced about $4.9 billion in trading revenue in the second quarter of 2017.",
