    "text": "NEW YORK, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Financial Engines, Inc. (\"FNGN\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: FNGN) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman (the \"Affiliates\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $45.00 in cash for each FNGN share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether FNGN's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, in its latest financial statements, FNGN reported an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue, from the $113.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $125.7 million reported in the same period of the following year. The Company also reported an impressive annual growth of 26% in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and a 31% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether FNGN's Board acted in the best interests of FNGN's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own FNGN shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/financial-engines-inc/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-financial-engines-inc-acquisition-300640609.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
