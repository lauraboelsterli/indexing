Net interest income rose by 8.8 percent from a year earlier to 7.81 billion rupees, reflecting strong growth in its overseas activities and, to a lesser extent, higher investments in government securities.\nThe bank, which also operates in Madagascar, the Maldives, the Seychelles, Mayotte, Mozambique and Reunion, said net fee and commission income rose by 7 percent in the nine months to the end of March, supported by higher revenues from lending, regional trade financing and payment activities.\nIts earnings per share rose to 22.84 rupees, from 21.78 rupees a year earlier.
