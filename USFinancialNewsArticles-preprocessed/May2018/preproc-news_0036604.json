    "text": "CHICAGO, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Professional Diversity Network, Inc. (NASDAQ:IPDN), (“PDN” or the “Company”), a global developer and operator of online and in-person networks that provide access to networking, training, educational and employment opportunities for diverse individuals, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights include:\nTotal cost and expenses reduced by $3.4 million, or 36.8%, from $9.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $5.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nSignificantly reduced net loss to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million for the period ended March 31, 2017\nSignificantly reduced Adjusted EBITDA loss to $1.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017\nContinued to enhance the value of our brands and network offerings to our members and business partners\nMichael Wang, Professional Diversity Network Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"While the company continued to sustain losses, we continue to make significant positive strides in our diversity recruitment and women's networking segments. The improvements in these sectors in the U.S. are very important to our global growth. Our women's networking and employment services operations in the U.S. are very complimentary to our China expansion. The company was and remains committed to providing our members with a network to enhance them professionally and personally.”\nWang continued, “We continue to have more work to do in China and the U.S. in 2018 to enhance shareholder value. Our recruitment brand is very strong and I am pleased with the measurable progress made in 2017 and our first quarter of 2018 to create more value for our customers by launching new services to help companies hire executive talent, especially in the digital transformation sector. For the balance of 2018, we will continue to remain vigilant on our cost controls and invest in growth where and when we see opportunities to do so. We continue to believe that China presents significant opportunity for our future growth toward profitability and much of my time and the company’s efforts will be in the China market.”\n2018 First quarter Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, PDN reported total revenue of $3.5 million, a 37.0% decrease from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, attributable primarily to reductions in our sales staff and workforce in our NAPW segment.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased by 36.8% to $5.9 million from $9.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily the result of a $1,540,000 decrease in sales and marketing expenses mostly attributable to NAPW segment as a result of lower headcount and reduced spending on lead generation, a $624,000 decrease in legal expenses, a $397,000 decrease in stock-based compensation, a $221,000 decrease in general and administrative personnel expense for our NAPW and Noble Voice segments, and a $159,000 decrease in compensation to independent board directors.\nThe Company reported a net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $2.0 million or $0.48 per share - compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.80 per share, for the period ended March 31, 2017.\nLoss from operations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $2.3 million compared to a loss of $3.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing a 36.6% decrease. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.5 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.3 million during the same period of the prior year, a decrease of $0.8 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $2.7 million in cash and $4.8 million in current assets, which represents a decrease of $0.3 million in cash and $0.9 million in current assets from December 31, 2017.

ADJUSTED EBITDA (Unaudited) We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by financial analysts and others to measure operating performance. Furthermore, management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure may provide investors with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business. However, while we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of operating performance, Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Further, Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, may not be comparable to EBITDA, or similarly titled measures, as defined by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure reported in our consolidated financial statements:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Net loss $ (2,034 ) $ (3,102 ) Stock-based compensation expense 118 516 Depreciation and amortization 701 836 Interest expense - 12 Interest and other income (1 ) (2 ) Income tax benefit (284 ) (602 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,500 ) $ (2,342 ) About Professional Diversity Network (PDN)\nProfessional Diversity Network, Inc.
