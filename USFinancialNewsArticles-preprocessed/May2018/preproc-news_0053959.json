    "text": "ST PETERSBURG, May 24 (Reuters) - Russia may tap the global debt market later this year if there are no geopolitical shocks, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Thursday, adding that he saw no immediate risks of a possible ban on buying Russian debt.\nRussia last issued Eurobonds in March, trumpeting strong demand despite political turmoil sparked by an attack on a former Russian spy in Britain and Western financial sanctions that are still in place.\nAfter borrowing $4 billion in mid-March, Russiaâ€™s borrowing plan envisages raising another $3 billion this year though the finance ministry has no urgent need to borrow as it is on track to post a budget surplus.
