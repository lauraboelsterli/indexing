    "text": "SANTIAGO, May 4 (Reuters) - Chile’s new government will slash $1.15 billion from its budget in 2018 and a total of $4.6 billion between 2018 and 2021, in an effort to return the country to “fiscal responsibility,” finance minister Felipe Larrain said on Friday.\nConservative President Sebastian Pinera took office in early March, calling for a return to fiscal equilibrium after inheriting a larger than expected deficit from center-left predecessor and former President Michelle Bachelet.\nReporting by Dave Sherwood Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
