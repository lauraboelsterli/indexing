    "text": "1 COMMENTS To the U.S. government, Kevin Mallory was a man in desperate straits, with no income in his pocket but with information in his head useful to China, given his longtime work as a covert CIA officer who spoke Mandarin.\nTo his defenders, Mr. Mallory, 61 years old, is a patriotic and religious American who served multiple stints overseas in the military, was captured and beaten in Iraq and was only trying to cultivate foreign agents to turn them over to his former colleagues.\nThe effort to divine Mr. Malloy’s intentions when he was approached by Chinese agents in early 2017—and when he later provided one of those agents with documents the government says were classified—is a big test in the Justice Department’s intensifying effort to combat Chinese espionage. The rare trial against a former member of the U.S. intelligence community accused of double-dealing for another power is scheduled to face a jury on May 29.\nFederal prosecutors in Alexandria, Va., contend that Mr. Mallory, who has worked for both the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, provided the documents to his Chinese contact via a secure phone given to him by the contact, promising to send more once he received word on payment.\nHe arranged to be paid through an “account in another name,” telling his contact in messages he thought had been erased that he “destroyed the paper records” because it was “too dangerous” to keep them around, according to the charges. He also allegedly misled U.S. customs agents when he returned from a trip to Shanghai on April 21, 2017, by not initially reporting the $16,500 in cash in his carry-on bags.\nMr. Mallory’s lawyers say he was trying to string along the Chinese agents while regularly alerting his former colleagues in the intelligence community what was going on. In court filings, his attorneys outline a timeline suggesting that Mr. Mallory was in frequent contact with CIA officials, saying he had an “urgent” need to talk to them about his trips to China.\n“I keep getting banged on, but in a little bit more detailed way,” Mr. Mallory said in one voicemail left for a CIA official on April 26, 2017, according to his lawyers. They say this shows he was conscientiously keeping the CIA informed about the approaches by the Chinese.\nKevin Mallory The Justice Department is stepping up its efforts to go after what appear to be increasingly aggressive recruitment efforts by China’s intelligence operatives. U.S. officials say those efforts have progressed from recruiting ethnic Chinese and Chinese Americans to a wider pool of potential targets.\nAt least three major federal cases involving Chinese espionage are under way, including Mr. Mallory’s. A longtime State Department employee was accused last year of concealing contacts with Chinese spies, and a former CIA officer suspected of providing information that helped the Chinese government identify U.S. informants in that country was arrested earlier this year and indicted this month with conspiring to commit espionage.\nIf convicted, Mr. Mallory faces at least 30 years in prison.\nThe Justice Department has also botched several prosecutions, prompting complaints from Chinese-Americans that the government is unfairly targeting their community. Prosecutors have dropped at least three such cases in recent years—one against a Chinese-American employee at the National Weather Service, another against a Temple University professor , and a third against two former Eli Lilly scientists.\nLast month a judge ordered the Commerce Department to reinstate the Weather Service employee , saying she was correct to assert she had been the “victim of a gross injustice” when fired by the department in 2016 .\nMr. Mallory’s associates describe him in court papers as a person who would wash a roof or clean a yard for a friend in need of assistance, not one who would betray his country. “I was moved to tears,” one former neighbor said in a letter to the court, recounting Mr. Mallory’s comments on the “true meaning of July 4th” at an Independence Day gathering near his Virginia home one year.\nSeveral of Mr. Mallory’s associates submitted letters explaining that Mr. Mallory, along with his Taiwan-born wife, is an active member of a Chinese congregation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints outside Washington, D.C. Mr. Mallory, who is not ethnically Chinese, told customs agents in April 2017 that he had met in Shanghai with an individual he knew through the church.\nMr. Mallory appeared at a recent court hearing with close-cropped hair wearing a green prison jumpsuit. He sat quietly beside his lawyer, public defender Geremy Kamens, who successfully argued the trial be pushed back two weeks as the defense team’s technical expert reviews the secure phone Mr. Mallory had used.\nMr. Mallory’s lawyers argue that he provided the Chinese contacts with no substantive information. In an effort to mislead them, they say, he even created a document with a false classification marking, which he then crossed out to make it look like he was trying to hide something before sending it to the agent.\nProsecutors dismiss Mr. Malloy’s claims as efforts to cover his tracks. They cite a recording of a jailhouse call between Mr. Mallory and his wife just after the FBI searched their house upon his June 2017 arrest.\nIn the call, in which the couple spoke Mandarin, Mr. Mallory asked his wife if the FBI had taken an SD data storage card, wrapped in aluminum foil, from a drawer in their bedroom closet. The FBI had found the card, which had at least seven classified documents on it, according to court records.\nAfter hearing about the call, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis, who is overseeing the case, ordered last July that Mr. Mallory be detained to ensure his appearance at trial.\n“The government, in a June 22nd search, found the card that he was concerned about,” Judge Ellis said, at the July 7, 2017, hearing. He also cited an earlier message Mr. Mallory allegedly sent his Chinese contact in which Mr. Mallory wrote, “Your object is to gain information, and my object is to be paid for.”\nThe Chinese agent allegedly responded, “My current object is to make sure [of] your security and try to reimburse you.”\nJudge Ellis was struck by that back-and-forth. “That’s a perfect exchange between a handler and his spy operative,” he said. “Right out of a movie, almost.”\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com",
