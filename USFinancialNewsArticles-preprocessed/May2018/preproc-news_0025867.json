    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Easterly Acquisition Corp. (“Easterly”) (NASDAQ:EACQ) and JH Capital Group Holdings, LLC (“JH Capital”) announced that they are in discussions to terminate by mutual agreement the Investment Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2017, by and among JH Capital, Jacobsen Credit Holdings, LLC, NJK Holding LLC, Kravetz Capital Funding LLC, and Easterly. If the Investment Agreement is terminated, the parties will abandon the business combination transaction contemplated by the Investment Agreement.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006277/en/\nIn connection with such discussions, Easterly has filed with the SEC a notification of late filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on Form 12b-25, indicating that Easterly will file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on or before the fifth calendar day following such Form 10-Q’s prescribed due date of May 10, 2018.\nEasterly must complete an initial business combination prior to June 30, 2018 or cease all operations, redeem the public shares of its common stock and dissolve and liquidate its remaining assets to its creditors and remaining stockholders. Upon the conclusion of the termination discussions and expected termination of the Investment Agreement, Easterly will evaluate if it will seek an additional period of time in which it can complete an initial business combination or whether it will cease all operations, redeem the public shares of its common stock and dissolve and liquidate its remaining assets to its creditors and remaining stockholders. In the event of Easterly’s liquidation, there will be no distribution with respect to Easterly’s outstanding warrants and, accordingly, the warrants will expire worthless.\nAbout JH Capital\nJH Capital is a specialty finance business that offers end-to-end solutions to customers at every stage of the distressed credit cycle, from default to rehabilitation.
