    "text": "DETROIT, May 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc. (AAM), (NYSE: AXL) today reported its financial results for the first quarter 2018 and confirmed AAM's full year 2018 financial outlook.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nSales of $1.86 billion Net income attributable to AAM of $89.4 million, or 4.8% of sales Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 Adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 Adjusted EBITDA of $317.0 million, or 17.1% of sales\n\"AAM's first quarter financial performance was highlighted by continued strength in our end markets, realization of our new business backlog and operational excellence on a global basis,\" said AAM's Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, David C. Dauch. \"We are off to a great start in achieving our 2018 financial targets, while continuing to focus on critical launch and acquisition integration activities during the year.\"\nAAM's sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased to $1.86 billion as compared to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\nAAM's net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $89.4 million, or $0.78 per share as compared to net income of $78.4 million, or $0.99 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nAAM defines Adjusted earnings per share to be diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, debt refinancing and redemption costs and non-recurring items, including the tax effect thereon. Adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2018 were $0.98 compared to $1.03 in the first quarter of 2017.\nAAM defines EBITDA to be earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related costs and debt refinancing and redemption costs. In the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $317.0 million, or 17.1% of sales, as compared to $183.6 million, or 17.5% of sales, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAAM's net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2018 was $66.9 million as compared to $62.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAAM defines free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow excluding the impact of cash payments for restructuring and acquisition-related costs and settlements of pre-existing accounts payable balances with acquired entities. AAM's Adjusted free cash flow for the first quarter of 2018 was a seasonal use of $41.7 million.\nAAM Sells Aftermarket Business of Powertrain Business Unit\nIn April 2018, AAM sold the aftermarket business of our Powertrain business unit to Hidden Harbor Capital Partners. Cash proceeds from the sale of these non-core assets were approximately $50 million. The impact of this sale will be recorded in the Company's second quarter 2018 financial results.\nAAM to Redeem $100 million of its 6.625% Notes\nAAM has issued a notice of redemption for $100 million of its outstanding 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (6.625% Notes), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date of May 30, 2018. AAM will use cash on hand, including proceeds from the aftermarket business sale, to settle the redemption of the 6.625% Notes.\nAAM's Full Year 2018 Outlook\nAAM is confirming its full year 2018 financial outlook:\nAAM is targeting sales of approximately $7 billion in 2018. This sales projection is based on the anticipated launch schedule of programs in AAM's new and incremental business backlog and the assumption that the U.S. Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate of sales (\"SAAR\") will be in the range of 16.8 million to 17 million light vehicle units in 2018. AAM is targeting an Adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 17.5% to 18.0% of sales in 2018. AAM is targeting Adjusted free cash flow of approximately 5% of sales in 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call Information\nA conference call to review AAM's first quarter 2018 results is scheduled today at 10:00 a.m. ET. Interested participants may listen to the live conference call by logging onto AAM's investor web site at http://investor.aam.com or calling (855) 681-2072 from the United States or (973) 200-3383 from outside the United States. A replay will be available from 1:00 p.m. ET on May 4, 2018 until 11:59 p.m. ET May 11, 2018 by dialing (855) 859-2056 from the United States or (404) 537-3406 from outside the United States. When prompted, callers should enter conference reservation number 3190139.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) included within this press release, AAM has provided certain information, which includes non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted free cash flow. Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is included in the attached supplemental data.\nCertain of the forward-looking financial measures included in this earnings release are provided on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items and their related effects in any future period. The magnitude of these items, however, may be significant.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management, investors, and banking institutions in their analysis of the Company's business and operating performance. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measure. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by AAM may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCompany Description\nAAM is a premier, global leader in design, engineering, validation and manufacturing of driveline, metal forming, powertrain, and casting products for automotive, commercial and industrial markets.\nHeadquartered in Detroit, AAM has over 25,000 associates operating at more than 90 facilities in 17 countries to support our customers on global and regional platforms with a focus on quality, operational excellence and technology leadership.
