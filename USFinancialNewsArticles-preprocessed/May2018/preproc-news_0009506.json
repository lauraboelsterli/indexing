    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will analyze information presented by Israel on Iran’s nuclear activities on Monday but independent inspections must be maintained, a German government spokesman said.\n“It is clear that the international community had doubts that Iran was carrying out an exclusively peaceful nuclear program,” the spokesman said. “It was for this reason the nuclear accord was signed in 2015, including the implementation of an unprecedented, thorough and robust surveillance system by the International Atomic Energy Agency.”\nThe spokesman said it was critical to maintain independent surveillance to ensure Iran was complying with the accord.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal\n ",
