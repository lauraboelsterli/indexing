Among those feeling the pinch are two of Europe’s star currencies from 2017: Poland’s zloty has dropped 7.7% against a resurgent dollar over the past month, one of the steepest declines within emerging markets; Hungary’s forint has not been far behind, shedding 7.2%.\nBank of England Could Raise Rates in Coming Months, Carney Says : The Bank of England is likely to raise its key interest rate in “a few months” if the U.K. economy’s first-quarter slowdown proves to be short-lived, a member of its Monetary Policy Committee said Tuesday.\nCambridge Analytica Staff Told Firm Is Liquidating : Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the heart of Facebook’s data scandal, is liquidating assets and has asked workers to vacate its London office, according to employees.\nU.K. Lawmakers Call for Tougher Crackdown on Illicit Russian Funds : An influential group of British lawmakers criticized the U.K. government for not doing enough to clamp down on illicit Russian money, as it emerged that a prominent oligarch hadn’t been able to enter Britain in recent weeks because of a delay in his visa renewal.\nEmotional Tributes Open First Phase of Inquiry Into London’s Grenfell Fire : Britain began the first phase of its public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower blaze with emotional memorials to some of the 72 people killed nearly a year ago.\nBritain Unlikely to Review Comcast’s $30 Billion Sky Deal : Britain is unlikely to open an antitrust review into Comcast’s $30 billion bid for U.K. pay-television company Sky, a senior government official said Monday, removing a hurdle for the cable firm in a takeover battle that also includes 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney.\nIN THE PAPERS\nA Survival Guide to Europe’s New Privacy Rules – Politico\nCould Britain Have an Election in 2018?
