    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., May 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellworks Group, Inc., a world leader in the field of Precision Medicine, announced today that Dr. Allen Lichter, former CEO of ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), has been elected to Cellworks Board of Directors. He will join Dr. Bill Rutter, co-founder of Chiron Corporation and former Chairman of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UCSF as well as Dr. David Lawrence, former Chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente. Dr. Lichter also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Value in Cancer Care Consortium and a member of the CancerLinQ Board of Governors.\n“Cancer is heterogeneous – as diverse as the patient population that suffers from it,” said Dr. Lichter. “Treating cancer needs to go beyond developing new drugs and beyond the ‘one mutation one drug’ paradigm. Personalized drug combinations which match patients to drugs is the true power of Personalized Medicine. I am pleased to join the board of Cellworks, to help bring this vision to reality.”\n“Allen brings a wealth of clinical knowledge and leadership expertise,” said Yatin Mundkur, CEO of Cellworks. “I am confident that he will make significant contributions to Cellworks' goal of helping physicians and payers navigate to the most efficacious, cost-effective treatments for patients in a transparent and timely manner.”\nDr. Allen Lichter was Chief Executive Officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) from 2006-2016. While at University of Michigan, Dr. Lichter served as Dean of the Medical School from 1998-2006 and as Chair and Professor of Radiation Oncology from 1984-1996. He has been awarded Gold Medals from the American Society for Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) in 2005 and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in 2014. In 2002 he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Medicine (NAM).\nAbout Cellworks Group, Inc.\nCellworks Group, Inc. is a world leader in Precision Medicine in the key therapeutic areas of Oncology and Immunology.
