    "text": "PHILADELPHIA and NEW YORK, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cohen & Company Inc. (NYSE American:COHN), formerly known as Institutional Financial Markets, Inc., a financial services firm specializing in fixed income markets, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary Operating Results\nThree Months Ended ($ in thousands) 3/31/18 12/31/17 3/31/17 Total revenues $ 9,338 $ 11,675 $ 14,492 Compensation and benefits 5,194 5,034 7,185 Non-compensation operating expenses 4,504 4,542 4,719 Operating income (360 ) 2,099 2,588 Interest expense, net (1,819 ) (1,848 ) (1,612 ) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) (2,179 ) 251 976 Income tax expense (benefit) (28 ) (1,359 ) 5 Net income (loss) $ (2,151 ) $ 1,610 $ 971 Compensation as a percentage of revenue was 56% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 43% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 50% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The number of Cohen & Company employees was 92 as of March 31, 2018, compared to 88 as of December 31, 2017, and 80 as of March 31, 2017.\nDuring December 2017, the United States Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% resulting in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax liability and a $1.4 million tax benefit being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLester Brafman, Chief Executive Officer of Cohen & Company, said, “This past quarter, the combination of increased interest rates and volatility in the equity markets suppressed trading volumes resulting in lower revenues in our broker-dealer. That being said, we continued to increase the balances of our GCF matched book repo business and we remain optimistic about our pipeline going forward. In addition, we continue to focus on the development of several new revenue sources that are less dependent on the day-to-day fluctuation of the financial markets. While we are disappointed with our results in the quarter, we remain committed to enhancing stockholder value, and in the first quarter continued to pay our quarterly dividend.”\nTotal Equity and Dividend Declaration\nAs of March 31, 2018, total equity was $45.7 million, compared to $48.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be payable on May 30, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 16, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

It was founded in 1999 as an investment firm focused on small-cap banking institutions, but has grown to provide an expanding range of capital markets and asset management services. Cohen & Company’s operating segments are Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing. The Capital Markets segment consists of fixed income sales, trading, and matched book repo financing as well as new issue placements in corporate and securitized products, and advisory services, operating primarily through Cohen & Company’s subsidiaries, J.V.B.

As of March 31, 2018, 88.6% of the Company’s assets under management were in collateralized debt obligations that Cohen & Company manages, which were all securitized prior to 2008.

These statements, estimates, and forecasts are “forward-looking statements.” In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “ might,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “seek,” or “continue” or the negatives thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this communication are forward-looking statements and are based on various underlying assumptions and expectations and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which are available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.cohenandcompany.com/investor-relations/sec-filings . Such risk factors include the following: (a) a decline in general economic conditions or the global financial markets, (b) losses caused by financial or other problems experienced by third parties, (c) losses due to unidentified or unanticipated risks, (d) a lack of liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds for use in our businesses, (e) the ability to attract and retain personnel, (f) litigation and regulatory issues, (g) competitive pressure, (h) an inability to generate incremental income from acquired businesses, (i) unanticipated market closures due to inclement weather or other disasters, (j) losses (whether realized or unrealized) on our principal investments, including on our CLO investments, (k) the possibility that payments to the Company of subordinated management fees from its European CLO will continue to be deferred or will be discontinued, and (l) the possibility that the stockholder rights plan may fail to preserve the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets, whether as a result of the acquisition by a person of 5% of the Company’s common stock or otherwise. As a result, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this communication will prove to be accurate or correct. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future performance or events described in the forward-looking statements in this communication might not occur. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nCautionary Note Regarding Quarterly Financial Results\nDue to the nature of our business, our revenue and operating results may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, revenue and net income in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Further, our employee compensation arrangements are in large part incentive-based and, therefore, will fluctuate with revenue. The amount of compensation expense recognized in any one quarter may not be indicative of such expense in future periods. As a result, we suggest that annual results may be the most meaningful gauge for investors in evaluating our business performance.\nCOHEN & COMPANY INC.
