    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 11:13 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago Walmart buys controlling stake in India's Flipkart for $16 billion Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) has agreed to pay $16 billion (12 billion pounds) for a roughly 77 percent stake in Indian online shopping site Flipkart, the U.S. retailer’s biggest foreign investment ever as it battles rival Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) in one of the world’s biggest emerging markets.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe remainder of the business will be held by some of Flipkart’s existing shareholders, including Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ), Tiger Global Management LLC and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

Chinnappa/File Photo\nThe investment was more than the $10-12 billion given by sources close to the deal in the past week.\nWalmart said it expected the deal to knock about 25-30 cents off its earnings in fiscal 2019, assuming the deal closes at the end of the second quarter.\nIt also said that the deal included $2 billion of funding from new equity in Flipkart, which could be sold to additional investors in the future, diluting the U.S. company’s overall stake.
