    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday criticized last week’s referendum in Burundi as being marred by a lack of transparency and voter intimidation and condemned the government’s decision to suspend media outlets.\n“The government allowed vigorous campaigning by the opposition during the designated two-week campaign period, but numerous cases of harassment and repression of referendum opponents in the months preceding the vote contributed to a climate of fear and intimidation,” the State Department said in a statement.\nThe referendum on Thursday granted changes that could allow the current president of Burundi to stay in office until 2034.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
