    "text": "8:14 AM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 01:06\nSome experts say that feeling respected and like you have influence at work matter to your happiness more than your salary does. And philanthropist Melinda Gates says there is a simple and subtle way you can get the credit and authority you deserve: Keep your supporters close.\nSurrounding yourself with people who validate and encourage you can help co-workers, managers and outsiders take you more seriously, says Gates, who recently started investing in female-led and minority-focused venture capital firms.\nAnyone who wants to be taken seriously \"needs to surround herself with people who have her back, who know she is the leader â€” man or woman,\" Gates tells Fortune in an interview published Wednesday. Then, when a person who has your back is asked a question that should have been directed at you, they can redirect by saying, \"'Jane actually knows the answer to that. Jane, you and I were just talking about that. Tell them what you think.'\" Spencer Platt | Getty Images Warren Buffett (R) speaks to the media with Bill and Melinda Gates June 26, 2006 at a news conference where Buffett spoke about his financial gift to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in New York City.\nWhen your team defers to you, Gates notes, it establishes that you are the team's expert on that topic.\n\"You do that once or twice and the people at the table will stop asking him the questions and realize that she's the one that knows this business deeply, and she's the one who has credibility,\" Gates says.\nHarvard public policy professor and behavioral economist Iris Bohnet calls Gates' solution \" micro-sponsorship ,\" or the act of enlisting a few coworkers to advocate for you when you've been wronged. \"Become vigilant about attributing comments to the people who made them first,\" Bohnet says. \"Everyone, men and women, can become a micro-sponsor.\"\n\"At the end of the day, giving rightful credit doesn't just help you, it makes your creditor look good, too,\" adds Jessica Bennett, author of \" Feminist Fight Club .\" show chapters",
