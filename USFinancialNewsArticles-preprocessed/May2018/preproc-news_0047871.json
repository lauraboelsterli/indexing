    "text": "NEW YORK, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Remedy ( www.digitalremedy.com ), a white-labeled ad operations and sales solution for publishers, advertisers, and influencers, announced today that Turner’s President of Ad Sales Donna Speciale has been appointed to the company’s board of directors, effective immediately. Her appointment follows the acquisition of CrowdHere and the elevation of its former CEO Nick Pahade to COO and president of Digital Remedy.\n“Donna is widely recognized as one of the best industry strategists, having foreseen how TV should be folded into the video category,” said Mike Seiman, Chairman and CEO of Digital Remedy . “Such prescience will enable us to smoothly navigate the coming convergence of digital content, film, video, and social for the benefit of our clients.”\nA trailblazer for reimagining advertising in the new age of media consumption, Speciale has transformed how Turner collaborates with marketers to better utilize advanced data and premium content to drive business outcomes for brands. She has been a leading voice in the expansion of audience targeting including the groundbreaking launch of OpenAP, and has invested in award-winning brand studios that provide powerful storytelling platforms for marketers. Speciale and the entire Turner leadership team have also taken a proactive approach with strengthening user experiences across the portfolio, which has led to stronger ROI for brands, including limited ad formats on TNT and truTV.\n“Digital Remedy has been at the forefront of new media ad advancements since digital’s early days, and I’m pleased to join their Board of Directors,” said Speciale. “As demands heighten for ad tech and media innovation, we need to come together as an industry to develop solutions not additional barriers for marketers.”\nWhat differentiates Speciale from most sales heads is her over two decades of experience working directly with clients on the agency side. Prior to joining Turner, she was president of investment, activation, and agency operations at MediaVest Worldwide, overseeing the agency’s integrated digital, broadcast, print, and out-of-home practice, as well as investments on behalf of clients such as Kraft, Walmart, P&G, and Coca-Cola. In addition to MediaVest, which Speciale joined in 2014, she led the broadcast investment team at WPP's Mediacom.\nSpeciale is well-known for driving innovation in the marketplace and has received numerous industry recognitions, while her teams and the companies she has represented have received countless honors. In 2018, she joined the Board of Directors for MAKERS and has prioritized providing greater access and opportunities for women and people of color at the leadership level. In recognition of this effort, she was featured this year by Variety for her “Impact” and Adweek as a “Disruptor.” In 2017, she was featured as one of the Adweek \"Most Indispensable Executives\" for her work on OpenAP, alongside Fox and Viacom. Speciale has been featured within this list for several years, including in 2016 when she was honored as one of the top ten leaders. Speciale has also been recognized by Broadcasting & Cable for their 2015 “Hall of Fame,\" Multichannel News as a “Wonder Woman” (2013), Advertising Age within their “Top Women in Advertising” (2012), CableFAX within both the “100” and “Most Powerful Women” (2012-17) lists, Television Week as a “TV Buyer of the Year” (2006), MediaWeek for the “All Star” (2003) list, and Advertising Age as a “Woman to Watch” (2001). She has been honored by Advertising Women of New York (AWNY) as an “Advertising Woman of the Year” and received both their “Impact Award” and “Working Woman Award.” In 2014, she was as a recipient of the “Reisenbach Award for Distinguished Citizenship” by the John A. Reisenbach Foundation.\nIn addition to her work with MAKERS, she is an active member of Advertising Women of New York (AWNY) and the Video Advertising Bureau (VAB).\nTurner, a Time Warner company, creates and programs branded news, entertainment, animation and young adult media environments on television and other platforms for consumers around the world.\nAbout Digital Remedy\nDigital Remedy solves the complex and evolving online marketing challenges of marketers, publishers, and influencers through a combination of innovative technology and superior customer service.
