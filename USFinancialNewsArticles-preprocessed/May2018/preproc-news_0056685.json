    "text": "LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Britain’s Marks & Spencer on Wednesday reported a 5.4 percent fall in full-year profit, a second straight decline, hurt by a weakening in the food profit margin.\nM&S, one of the best known names in British retail, made a pretax profit before one off items of 580.9 million pounds ($778.6 million) in the year to March 31.\nThat was ahead of analysts’ average forecast of 573 million pounds but down from 613.8 million pounds made in 2016-17.\nAfter taking account of adjusted items of 514.1 million pounds, including 321.1 million pounds of charges relating to store closures, pretax profit was 66.8 million pounds, a 62.1 percent fall.\n$1 = 0.7460 pounds Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
