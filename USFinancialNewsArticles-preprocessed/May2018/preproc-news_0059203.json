    "text": "2 COMMENTS PARIS—Playing her first tournament match since March, Serena Williams is back at the French Open—and she’s playing a lot better than anyone could expect.\nWilliams won her first-round match against Kristyna Pliskova, 7-6(4), 6-4 in an hour and 45 minutes. She hit 13 aces. She won 80% of her first serve points. She had 29 winners and 25 unforced errors. She was spotty at times, especially on her serve (she hit seven double faults). But already, after one match, she looked a lot more like the Serena of old.\n“I feel like I’m on the right track,” Williams said. “I have been putting a lot of work in on the court.”\nPliskova, a hard-hitting lefty with a big serve like her higher-ranked twin sister, Karolina, said Williams surprised her.\n“She played better than I expected, so it was a tough match,” Pliskova said.\nWilliams, 36 years old, played her last Grand Slam event in January 2017, when she won the Australian Open. She was pregnant when she won that title, and had her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September. She didn’t compete until March this year, and in those two tournaments—in Indian Wells and Miami—she won two matches and lost two, including the first round in Miami. During both events, she looked out of sorts when running to the ball and while serving.\nThat’s why it was so encouraging to see how she played in Paris on Tuesday. Williams moved well—she had enough speed and stretch to run down the ball—and seemed determined on every point, with various “Come on!” shouts and fist pumps. She swung her forehand and backhand with authority, and seemed comfortable sliding on the clay.\nWilliams also had a new look: She wore a tight catsuit—but the reason wasn’t just for style. Williams has had various blood clots since giving birth, a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated. She said the new outfit helps.\n“I have been wearing pants in general a lot when I play so I can keep, you know, the blood circulation going,” Williams said.\nWilliams will next play Ashleigh Barty, a 22-year-old from Australia who is ranked No. 17. They have played just once, back in 2014 when Barty was essentially a rookie. (Williams won easily.) Chances are Williams will attempt to win convincingly, like she always does. And besides winning, she said she has an extra incentive to waste no time on the court.\n“I want to get home and see Olympia, because I have been here all day,” Williams said. “Usually we hang out all the time.”",
