    "text": "0 COMMENTS The recent tax overhaul repealed a deduction for investment-advisory fees that effectively will raise fees for millions of investors. There are a few steps investors can take to ease the impact, writes Laura Sanders.\nBelow, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.\nPLANNING & INVESTING\nNew York Found a Fix for Some Hit by Tax Law. Employers Are Skeptical: Companies worry about costs and complexity of a payroll levy that would skirt federal cap on state-tax deductions.\nWatch Out: Junk Bonds Are Getting Junkier: Increased demand has allowed high-yield issuers to get away with weaker covenants that would never have been accepted in the past.\nMARKET TALK\nLabor Dept data show the labor force participation rate dropping to 62.8% in April from 62.9% in March and 63.0% in February. But there’s reason to believe the declines are blips. The rate has dropped steadily since the recession and has bounced around the 62.0%-63.0% range since 2014. Analysts say the rate’s sideways movement signals a balance between the improving economy and retiring Americans. “As baby boomers move into retirement years, the percentage of the population above 65 is growing, and they are much less prone to work,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. This is “being almost exactly offset by cyclical tightening in the labor market.” To be sure, the rate for prime-age workers, 25-54-year-olds, also declined, but the “employment to population ratio of prime aged workers between 25-54 held steady at 79.2 percent which is a cyclical high,” RSM’s Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas noted. (sharon.nunn@wsj.com)\nA potential downturn in U.K. credit conditions means RBS is still the top choice among large British banks, says Exane BNP Paribas. The decision by RBS to abandon 0% credit cards in 2014, and the fact that the lender has shrunk overall consumer credit exposure by 15% in three years leaves it relatively well-positioned, says Exane. Analysts at Exane note that RBS’s major rivals, Lloyds Bank and Barclays, have increased their consumer-credit exposure by 25% over the same period, and have more than twice as much capital consumed by unsecured credit.

But what do those points really mean? The WSJ’s wine columnist investigated, and tasted high-rated wines to determine which ones really make the grade.\n$$$\nThe WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing covers topics of interest to wealth managers, financial planners and other advisers.
