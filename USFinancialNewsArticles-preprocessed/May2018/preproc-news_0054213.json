    "text": "Published 19 Hours Ago CNBC.com\nMoon quickly convened a meeting with aides so they could \"figure out what President Trump's intention is and the exact meaning of it,\" according to a Moon spokesman quoted by Yonhap News Agency .\nSouth Korea 's Blue House released the statement below in the early morning hours Friday, local time:\nPresident Moon Jae In convened an emergency national security council's standing committee meeting for an hour from midnight on 25th KST.\nIt is very regretful and disconcerting that the US-NK summit will not happen as planned. Denuclearization and the lasting peace on the Korean peninsula cannot be abandoned or delayed as they are the historical assignment. The sincerity of the affected parties who have been working to resolve the problem has not changed. It is hard to resolve sensitive and difficult diplomatic issues with the current way of communications. (We) hope that the leaders resolve problems through direct and close dialogue.
