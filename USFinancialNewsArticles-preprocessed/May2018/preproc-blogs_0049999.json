    "text": "CNBC.com Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nA Twitter user has crafted the exact search needed to send your feed back 10 years â€” and it's resurfacing some early, silly tweets.\nThe specific search, shared by early Kickstarter executive Andy Baio , will show you what everyone who you follow now was tweeting about 10 years ago. (You can adjust the date in the search field too to search earlier or later.) Just click the link to run the search on your own account.\nIt was a simpler time on Twitter a decade ago. A lot of people just tweeted out their minute-to-minute activities or random thoughts.\nTen years ago tomorrow, CNBC Technology product editor Todd Haselton was apparently returning to a favorite bar in Alphabet City in Manhattan.",
