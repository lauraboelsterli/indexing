    "text": "May 30, 2018 / 1:21 PM / Updated 4 hours ago US STOCKS-Wall St set to recover after selloff driven by Italy turmoil Reuters Staff\n* Italy renews attempt to form a government\n* U.S. private employers added less-than-expected jobs in May\n* First qtr GDP growth revised to 2.2 pct from prior 2.3 pct\n* HP Inc, Salesforce.com gain on strong results\n* Futures up: Dow 0.51 pct, S&P 0.37 pct, Nasdaq 0.21 pct (Adds comment, adds details, changes prices)\nBy Medha Singh\nMay 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Wednesday, indicating a rebound from the steep selloff driven by a political crisis in Italy that had pushed the S&P 500 and the Dow Industrials to their worst day in a month.\nA renewed attempt to form a coalition government in Rome by the two anti-establishment parties, the 5-Star Movement and League, raised hopes that Europe’s third largest economy could avoid a new election.\nA surprise breakthrough to form a hung government would ease uncertainty, but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro-zone fiscal rules.\nEquity index futures pared some gains after the second revision to first-quarter GDP data showed U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought. GDP grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said, instead of the previously reported 2.3 percent pace.\n“It’s a rebound from yesterday on hopes that there may be some agreement on forming a government. But these kind of perceptions are going to bounce back and forth,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg.\n“Markets are a little bit fragile because it’s a holiday week. That could lead to some sharp moves either way.”\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 and the Dow posted their first 1 percent drop in May as investors scurried for safety assets such as U.S. bonds on fears of political instability in Italy.\nAt 8:58 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 125 points, or 0.51 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.37 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 14.75 points, or 0.21 percent.\nADP National Employment report showed U.S. private employers added 178,000 private sector jobs in May, below Reuters consensus view of 190,000.\nInvestors also kept a wary eye on the developments around tariffs and trade. In an unexpected change in tone, the United States said late on Tuesday it could still impose tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China unless it addressed the issue of theft of American intellectual property.\nChina said on Wednesday it was ready to fight back if Washington was looking for a trade war, days ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\nShares of big U.S. banks rose about 1 percent in premarket trading. The Federal Reserve is set to consider a proposal to modify the “Volcker Rule” at 3:00 p.m. ET.\nThe proposal, which marks another step by Trump administration regulators to ease banking rules, is aimed at preventing lenders from making market bets while accepting taxpayer-insured deposits.\nAmong stocks, cloud-based business software maker Salesforce.com rose 4.9 percent, while computer and printer maker HP Inc jumped 4.2 percent after raising full-year profit forecasts.\nMichael Kors slipped 5.0 percent after a disappointing yearly earnings forecast.
