The jets will also have new wings, interiors, and Rolls Royce engines, among other upgrades, Bombardier spokesman Mark Masluch said.\nThe 5500 and 6500, which have the same bodies as Bombardier’s current Globals, will be manufactured at the company’s existing Canadian production lines.\nThe new jets are expected to receive certification in 2019, ahead of delivery by the end of next year and will drive a “premium price,” Masluch said by phone from Geneva, ahead of the EBACE business jet show.\nThe Global 5500, which lists for $46 million, has a range of 5,700 nautical miles and can connect Sao Paolo and Paris, while the Global 6500, which lists for $56 million, has a range of 6,600 nautical miles, can connect Hong Kong and London, Bombardier said.\nBombardier’s larger cabin planes compete against General Dynamics Corp’s Gulfstream, whose G650 business jets will continue to have unmatched flight range at the top end of the pure business jet segment until the largest Global enters service this year.
