    "text": "150 COMMENTS The Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car involved in a fatal accident in Arizona this spring determined the need to apply emergency braking a little more than a second before impact but wasn’t set up to automatically do so, U.S. safety investigators said Thursday.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released its preliminary report on the March 18 incident in Tempe, Ariz., near Phoenix. The crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world.\nMore Coverage Read the Report from the National Transportation Safety Board Uber Shuts Down Arizona Self-Driving Vehicle Operations Operator of Self-Driving Car in Fatal Uber Crash Had Criminal Record Uber Crash Highlights Growing Safety Concern: Pedestrians Driverless-Vehicle Accident Complicates Push to Ease Rules The NTSB, which has no regulatory authority but has influence over transportation safety, said its report doesn’t determine the likely cause and that its probe continues.\nUber was testing a fleet of Volvo Cars sport-utility vehicles that come equipped with automatic emergency braking and other safety features.The vehicles, however, are modified by the ride-hailing company, which equips them with cameras, sensors and onboard computers. An operator rides in each vehicle, prepared to take the wheel to ensure safety as needed.\nThe NTSB said the Uber vehicle’s sensors detected the pedestrian walking across the road with a bicycle six seconds before impact. At first, the self-driving system’s software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, then as a vehicle and finally as a bicycle with varying expectations of where the bike was headed.\nThe NTSB said the vehicle was traveling at 43 miles an hour before impact. At that speed, six seconds is enough time for a vehicle to stop, said Todd Humphreys, an associate professor who specializes in robotic perception at the University of Texas at Austin. He said stopping time in those conditions could have occurred within less than three seconds.\nIt was 1.3 seconds before impact that the system decided emergency braking was needed, the NTSB said. According to Uber, the NTSB said, Volvo’s built-in automatic braking system had been disabled during testing to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.”\n“The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action,” the report said. “The system isn’t designed to alert the operator.”\nUber’s decision to deactivate the vehicle’s automatic-braking system and leave it in the hands of the safety operator, who in turn wasn’t given an alert, were mistakes, Mr. Humphreys said.\n“This was an absolutely inexcusable design decision,” he said in an email. “Over those critical 1.3 seconds, the car could have slowed down from 43 to 24 mph before the collision.” That would have given the pedestrian a better chance of surviving the collision, he said\nA video released around the time of the crash showed the safety operator glancing down toward the center console of the vehicle several times before impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, the operator said she had been monitoring the self-driving system interface.\nRelated Video As part of its investigation, the Tempe, Ariz., police department released this video showing the moment before a self-driving Uber operating in autonomous mode struck a pedestrian on March 18. Warning: Graphic content. PHOTO: CHRIS CARLSON/ASSOCIATED PRESS In addition to being responsible for intervening in the driving of the vehicle, the safety operator is also monitoring diagnostic messages that appear on a digital screen in the center console and tagging events for further review, the NTSB said.\nMany autonomous vehicle developers begin with two safety operators and move to one as their systems become more advanced. Uber moved from two to one after more than a year of planning and continues to use two in some scenarios, the company said.\n“We decided to make this transition because after testing, we felt we could accomplish the task of the second person—annotating each intervention with information about what was happening around the car—by looking at our logs after the vehicle had returned to base, rather than in real time,” the company said.\nMr. Humphreys said the operator shouldn’t be expected to interact with the screen if it means not looking at the road. “A second Uber employee should have been in the car to interact with the system interface,” he said\nThe pedestrian was dressed in dark clothing and was walking a bicycle across the road, not at a crosswalk, according to the report. NTSB also said the pedestrian tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana.\nVolvo, in statement, said it was helping with the investigation, noting its driver-assistance system was disengaged.\nAn Uber spokeswoman Thursday said the company has worked with the NTSB and started its own review, bringing on former NTSB head Christopher Hart to advise on its safety culture. She said the company in the coming weeks will detail changes it plans to make.\nOn Wednesday, Uber said it was closing down its self-driving vehicle program in Arizona, two months after the state barred it from road-testing self-driving technology.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com",
