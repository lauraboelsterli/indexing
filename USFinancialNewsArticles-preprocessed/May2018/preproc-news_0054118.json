    "text": "President Trump has called off a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Before his announcement, we spoke with Ambassador Chas Freeman, a retired American diplomat, about the broader strategic issues on the Korean peninsula. Lodged between China, Japan and Russia, Korea has long been the object of great power rivalry. Occupied at times by both China and Japan, Korea was carved in half at the end of World War Two, with the North becoming a communist state allied with the Soviet Union and the South a capitalist nation allied with the United States. Eight decades later, it is still divided.\nMore Commentary on North Korea Kent Harrington: Trump's nuke focus misses Kim's real leverage About the Author Arshad Mohammed writes about U.S. foreign policy for Reuters as a diplomatic correspondent based in Washington.
