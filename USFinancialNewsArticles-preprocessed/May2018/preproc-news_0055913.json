It’s not easy.”\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov said he was forced to take more chances with the new balls to tackle slower court conditions.\n“The court was getting pretty heavy, but the balls especially, they were getting really fluffy and heavy,” he told reporters.\n“But, you know, at the same time I felt like I played really well... really tried to dictate the first couple of games when they came out.” 1445 EDMUND EASES INTO ROUND TWO\nBritish number one Kyle Edmund booked a place in the second round with a 6-2 6-4 6-3 victory over Australian’s Alex de Minaur.\n1430 SHARAPOVA SURVIVES OPENING-ROUND SCARE\nFormer world number one Maria Sharapova won the last six games in the final set to beat Richel Hogenkamp 6-1 4-6 6-3 in just under two hours.\nThe two-time French Open champion will meet Croatia’s Donna Vekic in the second round.

It was Nadal’s 80th win at Roland Garros and 105th in best-of-five matches on clay. 1235 CILIC IN CRUISE CONTROL\nThird seed Marin Cilic backed his aggressive style of play to beat Australia’s James Duckworth 6-3 7-5 7-6(4) on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\nCilic, who reached the quarter-finals last year, struck 47 winners to seal the victory in two hours and 13 minutes. 1230 MUGURUZA BATTLES PAST KUZNETSOVA\nWorld number three Garbine Muguruza recorded a convincing 7-6(0) 6-2 victory over Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in a battle of former French Open champions. 1220 SHAPOVALOV STORMS INTO ROUND TWO\nCanadian teenage sensation Denis Shapovalov hit 32 winners to collect his first main draw win at Roland Garros, defeating John Millman of Australia 7-5 6-4 6-2.
