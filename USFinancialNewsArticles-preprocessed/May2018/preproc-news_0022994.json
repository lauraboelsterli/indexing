    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 8:59 PM / Updated 17 hours ago 'Hello kitties' turns to 'beware bobcats' in Texas Lisa Maria Garza 3 Min Read\nSAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - With big blues eyes and stubby tails, two kittens taken in by a San Antonio family looked adorable until the fiery seven-week-old felines ripped apart formula bottles and repeatedly bit the hands that were trying to feed them. Two baby bobcats which were surrendered to an animal shelter this week after a local family brought them into their home, believing they were domestic cats, and were bitten while trying to feed them are seen in San Antonio, Texas, U.S., May 7, 2018.

But the tiny felines were actually wild bobcats that were surrendered to a shelter this week, and officials said on Thursday the family was under investigation for possibly violating Texas wildlife laws.\n“Bengal kittens look like house cats. They do not look like wild cats,” San Antonio Animal Care Services (ACS) spokeswoman Lisa Norwood said on Thursday, adding the two species are rarely confused for the other.\nThe family initially told ACS workers that they discovered the cubs abandoned in an alleyway. Later, they confessed that the kittens were found by a relative in a nearby rural county and then brought to San Antonio, according to Norwood.
