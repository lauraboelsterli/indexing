    "text": "May 23, 2018 / 2:18 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Court suspends Israel's revocation of Human Rights Watch official's work visa Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli court on Wednesday suspended Israel’s revocation of a work permit issued to the local representative of Human Rights Watch, saying the decision was based on outdated information.\nOmar Shakir’s visa was withdrawn early this month after Israel accused him of supporting a boycott against it and gave him two weeks to leave the country.\nBoth Shakir, a U.S. citizen who serves as Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director, and the New York-based organisation denied promoting boycotts against Israel.\nHe told Reuters that prior to his work at Human Rights Watch he had engaged in “divestment-related activism” that focused on companies that “violate human rights” in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, outposts many countries view as illegal.\nOpting to challenge the revocation in a Jerusalem court, Shakir and Human Rights Watch said Israel was seeking to suppress criticism of its human rights record.\nIsrael last year initially denied Shakir a work permit, a decision criticised by the United States. It later granted him a one-year work visa.\nIn its interim injunction, the court reasoned that the revocation was based on “old information” that predated the granting of the permit. It noted the visa had been extended until the end of last month even after a review process.\n“Under these circumstances, it seems the status quo must be preserved, by an interim injunction,” said a court document, staying the order for Shakir to leave Israel. The court scheduled a hearing for July 2 to continue deliberations in the case.\nOn Tuesday, the European Union called on Israeli authorities to reinstate Shakir’s permit, saying that “otherwise Israel would join a very short list of countries which have barred entry to, or expelled, Human Rights Watch staff”.\nIsrael is basing its decision to deport Shakir on a law that allows immigration authorities to deny entry to supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a group Israeli authorities say advocates the country’s demise.
