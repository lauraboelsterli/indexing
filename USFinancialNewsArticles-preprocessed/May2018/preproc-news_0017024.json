    "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBOT), a leading manufacturer of a key protein utilized in multiple immunotherapy development pipelines targeting Alzheimer's, lupus and cancer, among other diseases, today reported financial results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its business.\nDuring the quarter, Stellar continued to advance its optimization and expansion initiatives, which are intended to increase the scalability of the company's KLH production and manufacturing processes. A number of therapeutic vaccines that utilize the KLH protein as a carrier molecule are currently in clinical studies by third parties. While the outcomes of these clinical trials cannot be predicted, the company is preparing for the possible impact that favorable clinical results could have on the KLH market and Stellar's supply capabilities. Results from the first of these trials are anticipated to be announced during the summer of 2018, but there can be no certainty as to when our customers will issue their findings.\nFrank Oakes, Stellar's President and Chief Executive Officer, said that the heightened activity now is the result of multiple companies with KLH-conjugated vaccines entering Phase 2 trials in the past two years. \"We are eagerly awaiting upcoming developments from these clinical studies and continue to work closely with current and prospective customers to ensure long-term support of their immunotherapy programs.\"\nStellar Chief Financial Officer Kathi Niffenegger noted that during the second fiscal quarter the company initiated an expansion project at its Port Hueneme aquaculture facility. This key project has been planned in stages in order to prepare the company's core aquaculture infrastructure for expansion while managing upfront costs. \"We continue to closely manage our working capital and are aligning the timing of capital expenditures with third party milestones and market opportunities,\" she said.\nFinancial Results\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenues were relatively unchanged at $0.06 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year. Product sales increased by $0.05 million to $0.06 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.01 million for the same period last year. While the company's customer base has not changed significantly, product sales volumes are subject to variability associated with the rate of development and progression of clinical studies of third-party products that utilize Stellar KLH.\nTotal expenses increased by $0.20 million to $1.41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.21 million for the same period last year:\nCost of sales and contract services was relatively unchanged at $0.07 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year. Research and development expenses increased by $0.16 million to $0.49 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.33 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to research and development activities intended to increase the scalability and throughput capacity of existing manufacturing systems. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.03 million to $0.77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.75 million for the same period last year primarily due a non-cash share-based compensation expense in the most recent quarter which was partially offset by reduced corporate expenses.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, Stellar reported a net loss of $1.35 million, or $0.90 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $1.10 million, or $0.76 per basic share, for the second quarter of the prior year.\nSix months ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenues decreased by $0.12 million to $0.08 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.20 million for the same period last year due to a decrease in product sales. While the company's customer base has not changed significantly, product sales volumes are subject to variability associated with the rate of development and progression of clinical studies of third-party products that utilize Stellar KLH.\nTotal expenses increased by $0.05 million to $2.82 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.77 million for the same period last year:\nCost of sales and contract services decreased by $0.08 million to $0.07 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.15 million for the same period last year primarily due to decreased product sales volume as well as reduced expenses related to sales of KLH that was produced as a byproduct of the company's research and development activities. Research and development expenses increased by $0.33 million to $1.12 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.79 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to research and development activities intended to increase the scalability and throughput capacity of existing manufacturing systems, including engineering lots of KLH produced under the company's optimization initiative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.23 million to $1.45 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.68 million for the same period last year primarily due to management's continued actions to reduce corporate expenses.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, Stellar reported a net loss of $2.75 million, or $1.83 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $2.59 million, or $1.79 per basic share, for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nWorking Capital\nAt March 31, 2018, the company had working capital of $3.7 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.8 million.\nAll per-share results have been adjusted to reflect a one-for-seven reverse share split effected May 4, 2018.\nStellar will file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about May 7, 2018.
