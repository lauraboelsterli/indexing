    "text": "R. Kelly’s ouster from Spotify playlists last week touched off a broader debate about where the music industry should draw the line between penalizing bad behavior and engaging in censorship.\nSpotify Technology SA last week said it removed R.

RELATED VIDEO Sarah Jessica Parker on the #MeToo #TimesUp Movement Actress Sarah Jessica Parker and Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund Leader Tina Tchen spoke at WSJ’s Future of Everything festival about how workplace culture and the media industry have changed in the wake of the #MeToo movement.
