    "text": "ZURICH, May 25 (Reuters) - Swiss luxury goods group Richemont has clinched its takeover offer for Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP) by garnering more than 95 percent of the Italian groupâ€™s shares, the companies said on Friday.\nCartier owner Richemont, which like many rivals in the watch industry and high fashion world has been slow to move into selling online, had offered 38 euros per share for YNAP. The stock closed on Thursday at just below that level.\nThe offer valued YNAP at 5.3 billion euros ($6.20 billion).\n$1 = 0.8542 euros Reporting by Michael Shields\n ",
