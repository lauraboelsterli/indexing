    "text": "May 14, 2018 / 3:31 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Britain, EU clash in growing row over Galileo satellite project Andrew MacAskill , Michel Rose 3 Min Read\nLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Britain and its European Union partners clashed on Monday in a deepening row over the European Commission’s decision to exclude the United Kingdom from a new satellite navigation system, Galileo. Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrives in Downing Street, in London, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nGalileo is the EU rival to the global positioning system (GPS) developed and controlled by the United States and used by millions of consumer devices globally. It was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020.\nThe Commission, the EU’s executive, has started to exclude Britain and its companies from sensitive future work on Galileo ahead of the country’s exit from the bloc in a year’s time.\nBritain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said on Monday he had raised concerns with his French counterpart over the EU stance and the government said it might withhold security clearance for companies working on the project.\n“I mentioned our slight puzzlement about what had happened with the Commission’s decision on Galileo and the satellite,” Johnson said.\n“But our determination, nonetheless, (is) to go ahead with a (rival) UK satellite if that proved to be necessary.”\nOne expert said last week any rival British satellite navigation system could cost about 3 billion pounds ($4 billion).\nA few hours after Johnson’s comments, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said British companies could not be directly involved in a new EU satellite navigation system after Brexit, but Britain would have access to its signal.
