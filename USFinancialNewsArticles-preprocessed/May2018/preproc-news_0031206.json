(TSXV:EMH) (\"Emerald\" or the “Company”) has entered into a binding term sheet with a single Canadian institutional accredited investor (the “Investor”) under which the Investor has agreed, subject to certain customary conditions, to purchase 4,000,000 units of the Company (the “Units”) at a price of $4.20 per Unit for total gross proceeds of $16,800,000 (the “Offering”). The securities forming the Units will be qualified under a shelf prospectus supplement to be filed by Emerald prior to closing.\nEach Unit will consist of one common share of the Company and one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant will entitle the Investor to acquire one common share of the Company (a “Warrant Share”) at a price of $5.20 per Warrant Share for a period of eighteen months following the closing of the Offering. If the closing sale price of the Company’s common shares (the “Common Shares”) on the TSX Venture Exchange or other principal exchange upon which the Company’s shares are traded is greater than $6.50 per Common Share for a period of twenty consecutive trading days at any time after the closing of the Offering, the Company may accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants by giving notice to the Investor and in such case the Warrants will expire on the 30th day after the date on which the notice is given by the Company.\nThe Investor has also agreed to purchase from Emerald Health Sciences Inc. (“Sciences”), a control person of the Company, 2,000,000 Common Shares held by Sciences at a price of $4.20 per share (the “Secondary Sale”). The Secondary Sale will close concurrently with the closing of the Offering.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to fund the completion of its recently acquired Agro-Biotech facility in Quebec, working capital, and general corporate purposes.\nThe Units and Common Shares to be sold under the Secondary Sale will be offered by way of a shelf prospectus supplement to be filed in all of the provinces of Canada, except Quebec, pursuant to National Instrument 44-101 - Short Form Prospectus Distributions .\nThe closing date of the Offering and Secondary Sale is expected to be on or about May 22, 2018, and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the Investor being satisfied with the results of its due diligence, no material adverse change in the affairs of the Company, and the receipt of all necessary approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and the applicable securities regulatory authorities.\nThis press release will not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor will there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.
