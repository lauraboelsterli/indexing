    "text": "TORONTO, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Denison Mines Corp. (\"Denison\" or the \"Company\") (DML: TSX, DNN: NYSE MKT) today filed its Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the 2018. Both documents can be found on the Company's website at www.denisonmines.com or on SEDAR (at www.sedar.com ) and EDGAR (at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml ). The highlights provided below are derived from these documents and should be read in conjunction with them. All amounts in this release are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nDavid Cates, President and CEO of Denison commented, \"Today, Denison reported its results from the first quarter of 2018 – which proved to be another productive quarter, with numerous results showcasing the Company's assets in the Athabasca Basin. The Company reported significant increases in the estimated mineral resources at our Wheeler River and Midwest projects, as well as exploration successes from each of our winter drilling programs. At Wheeler River, the exploration team is approaching 2018 with the view of making a new discovery to complement the already impressive Gryphon and Phoenix deposits. At Waterbury, the winter program returned the second best drill hole to date at the Huskie zone, and at Hook-Carter, Denison initiated its inaugural drill program on the property and returned results that are indicative of the continuation of the mineralizing system within the Patterson Lake Corridor. As we progress through the second quarter of the year, I am pleased to report that we are advancing on schedule with the Wheeler River Pre-Feasibility Study – which remains on track for completion during the second half of 2018. With a combination of company specific and industry related catalysts on the horizon, 2018 continues to have the potential to be a very exciting year.\nPERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS\nAnnounced increase in mineral resources estimated for Wheeler River\nOn January 31, 2018, Denison announced an 88% increase in the Indicated Mineral Resources estimated for the Wheeler River project (63.3% Denison owned). The result was attributable to an increase in the estimated resources at the Gryphon deposit, which is estimated to include, above a cut-off grade of 0.2% U 3 O 8 , 61.9 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (1,643,000 tonnes at 1.71% U 3 O 8 ) in Indicated Mineral Resources, plus 1.9 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (73,000 tonnes at 1.18% U 3 O 8 ) in Inferred Mineral Resources. Together with the resources estimated for the Phoenix deposit, the Wheeler River project is now host to 132.1 million pounds U 3 O 8 in total Indicated Mineral Resources – which will be used to support the Pre-Feasibility Study ('PFS') for the project, that was initiated in July 2016 and is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018. Following the resource update, Wheeler River retained and improved its standing as the largest undeveloped high-grade uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin.\nDiscovered high-grade uranium northeast of Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit\nOn April 18, 2018, Denison reported preliminary, radiometric equivalent uranium ('eU 3 O 8 ') results from the Wheeler River winter 2018 diamond drilling program, which totalled 21,153 metres in 29 holes. High-grade uranium drill intercepts were obtained at the sub-Athabasca unconformity 600 metres and 1 kilometre to the northeast of the Gryphon deposit along the K-North trend. Results included 0.55% eU 3 O 8 over 5.6 metres (including 2.3% eU 3 O 8 over 1.0 metre) in drill hole WR-704, and 0.94% eU 3 O 8 over 3.5 metres (including 2.7% eU 3 O 8 over 1.0 metre) in drill hole WR-710D1.\nExpanded the high-grade, basement-hosted, Huskie Zone on the Waterbury Lake property\nOn April 25, 2018, Denison reported assay results from the winter 2018 diamond drilling program on the Waterbury Lake project (64.22% Denison). The winter drilling program, totalling 9,794 metres in 19 holes, was focused on testing for extensions to the Huskie zone, which was discovered by Denison in July 2017. The program was highlighted by drill hole WAT18-452, which intersected 4.5% U 3 O 8 over 6.0 metres (including 5.8% U 3 O 8 over 4.5 metres) approximately 50 metres down-dip of the mineralization identified during 2017. The result from WAT18-452 suggests that mineralization at Huskie may be controlled by cross-cutting, northeast striking faults, interpreted to be associated with the regional Midwest structure, which presents additional targets for exploration during the summer of 2018.\nReported increase in mineral resources estimated for Midwest\nOn March 27, 2018, Denison reported an updated mineral resource estimate for the Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits located on the Midwest property (25.17% Denison owned), which is operated by Orano Canada Inc. ('Orano Canada'). Inferred Mineral Resources for the property increased by 13.50 million pounds of U 3 O 8 and currently total 18.2 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (846,000 tonnes at 1.0% U 3 O 8 ) above a cut-off grade of 0.1% U 3 O 8 . Indicated Mineral Resources for the property increased by 2.08 million pounds of U 3 O 8 and currently total 50.78 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (1,019,000 tonnes at 2.3% U 3 O 8 ) above a cut-off grade of 0.1% U 3 O 8 .\nCHANGE IN PRESENTATION CURRENCY\nEffective January 1, 2018, Denison changed its presentation currency to Canadian dollars ('CAD') from US dollars ('USD'). This change in presentation currency was made to better reflect the Company's business activities, which, following the divestiture of the Mongolian and African mining divisions in 2015 and 2016, are now solely focused in Canada, with the majority of the Company's entities, including all of its operating entities, having the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. The consolidated financial statements, for all periods presented, are shown in the new presentation currency.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n(in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,573\n$\n3,735\nNet loss\n$\n(6,968)\n$\n(1,124)\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n-\n(in thousands)\nAs at\nMarch 31,\n2018\nAs at\nDecember 31,\n2017\nFinancial Position:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n35,768\n$\n3,636\nInvestments in debt instruments (GICs)\n$\n-\n$\n37,807\nCash, cash equivalents and GIC's\n$\n35,768\n$\n41,443\nWorking capital\n$\n33,958\n$\n38,065\nProperty, plant and equipment\n$\n248,088\n$\n249,002\nTotal assets\n$\n316,146\n$\n326,300\nTotal long-term liabilities (1)\n$\n82,730\n$\n84,252\n(1)\nPredominantly comprised of the non-current portion of deferred revenue, non-current reclamation obligations, and deferred income taxes.\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nRevenues\nOn February 13, 2017, Denison closed an arrangement with Anglo Pacific Group PLC and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries (the 'APG Transaction') under which Denison received an upfront payment of $43,500,000 in exchange for its right to receive future toll milling cash receipts from the MLJV under the current toll milling agreement with the Cigar Lake Joint Venture ('CLJV') from July 1, 2016 onwards. The APG Transaction represents a contractual obligation of Denison to forward to APG any cash proceeds of toll milling revenue earned by the Company, after July 1, 2016, related to the processing of specified Cigar Lake ore through the McClean Lake mill, and as such, the upfront payment has been accounted for as deferred revenue.\nEffective January 1, 2018, upon adoption of IFRS 15, the accounting policy applicable to the toll milling deferred revenue arrangement has changed and the comparative period has been restated to reflect this change. Refer to the Company's unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for more details on the accounting for the APG Transaction related revenue.\nDuring Q1 2018, the McClean Lake mill processed 4.4 million pounds U 3 O 8 for the CLJV. The Company recorded toll milling revenue of $780,000 and related accretion expense of $829,000.\nRevenue from the Company's DES division was $2,378,000 and revenue from the Company's management contract with UPC was $415,000 during Q1 2018.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses in the Canadian mining segment include depreciation, mining and other development costs, as well as adjustments, where applicable, to the estimates of future reclamation costs in relation to the companies mining properties. Operating expenses during Q1 2018 were $1,442,000, including $839,000 of depreciation from the McClean Lake mill, which is associated with the processing and packaging of U 3 O 8 for the CLJV.\nOperating expenses at DES during Q1 2018 totaled $2,024,000 and relate primarily to care and maintenance, and environmental consulting services provided to clients, and includes labour and other costs.\nExploration and evaluation\nDuring Q1 2018, the Company continued to focus on its highest priority projects in the Athabasca Basin region in Saskatchewan. Denison's share of exploration and evaluation expenditures in the quarter was $6,254,000. The Company's Athabasca land package increased during the first quarter from 351,365 hectares (267 claims) to 353,007 hectares (270 claims) owing to selective staking contiguous with Denison's existing claims.\nWheeler River\nProject Highlights:\nUpdated resource estimate confirms Wheeler River as the largest undeveloped high-grade uranium project in the eastern Athabasca\nOn January 31, 2018, Denison announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the Gryphon deposit following drilling results from a further 144 drill holes completed during 2016 and 2017. The updated mineral resource estimate for Gryphon, above a cut-off grade of 0.2% U 3 O 8 , includes 61.9 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (1,643,000 tonnes at 1.71% U 3 O 8 ) in Indicated Mineral Resources, and 1.9 million pounds of U 3 O 8 (73,000 tonnes at 1.18% U 3 O 8 ) in Inferred Mineral Resources.\nThe Phoenix deposit, located approximately three kilometres southeast of Gryphon, is estimated to include Indicated Mineral Resources of 70.2 million pounds of U 3 O 8 above a cut-off grade of 0.8% U 3 O 8 (166,000 tonnes at 19.1% U 3 O 8 ). The mineral resource estimates are, as disclosed in the Technical Report with an Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Wheeler River Uranium Project, Northern Saskatchewan, Canada dated March 9, 2018 and prepared by Mark Mathisen, C.P.G. of Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. and Ken Reipas, P.Eng of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc.\nWith the update to the Gryphon deposit resource estimate, the combined Indicated Mineral Resources estimated for Wheeler River have increased by 88% to 132.1 million pounds U 3 O 8 , which will be used to support the Pre-feasibility study ('PFS') initiated for the project in 2016 and expected to be completed in the second half of 2018.\nProximal to existing uranium mining and milling infrastructure\nThe property is located in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin, which is host to existing uranium mining and milling infrastructure, including the 22.5% Denison owned McClean Lake mill. The Wheeler River property lies alongside provincial highway 914 and a provincial powerline.\nIncreasing Denison ownership\nAs previously announced on January 10, 2017, Denison entered into an agreement with its Wheeler River Joint Venture partners, Cameco Corp ('Cameco') and JCU (Canada) Exploration Company, Limited ('JCU'), to fund 75% of Joint Venture expenses in 2017 and 2018 (ordinarily 60%) in exchange for an increase in Denison's interest in the project up to approximately 66%. Under the terms of the agreement, Cameco is funding 50% of its ordinary 30% share in 2017 and 2018, and JCU continues to fund based on its 10% interest in the project. On January 31, 2018, Denison announced it had increased its interest in the Wheeler River project during 2017 from 60% to 63.3%, in accordance with this agreement.\nExploration Program:\nDenison's share of exploration costs at Wheeler River amounted to $3,127,000 during Q1 2018. The program was completed in early April 2018, with a total of 21,153 metres drilled in 29 diamond drill holes. The winter 2018 drilling program was focused on step-out drilling along strike of the Gryphon deposit and reconnaissance level regional exploration along the K-North and K-West trends. Refer to Denison's press release dated April 18, 2018 for results of the winter 2018 drill program.\nEvaluation Program:\nDuring Q1 2018, Denison's share of evaluation costs at Wheeler River amounted to $866,000, which related to work on PFS engineering and environmental activities.\nPFS Activities highlights include:\nThe advancement of engineering activities: including Gryphon shaft design; Gryphon mine ground stability and support analysis; Gryphon mine backfill trade-off study; radiological assessments; Phoenix ground freeze engineering; Phoenix mine design; water treatment plant design; Wheeler surface facilities; metallurgical analysis and milling capacity assessment; and metallurgical test programs.\nThe continuation of environmental and sustainability activities: including the community consultation and engagement process; data collection and assessment of aquatic environment, terrestrial environment and atmospheric environment; and waste rock geochemical testing.\nExploration Pipeline Properties\nDuring the 2018 winter season, Denison also carried out drilling programs at Waterbury Lake and Hook-Carter, while Orano Canada completed a winter drilling program, as operator, at the Midwest property.\nAt Waterbury Lake (Denison 64.22% interest and operator), the winter drilling program involved 9,794 metres of diamond drilling in 19 drill holes, and was focused on 50 metre step-out drilling along strike and down-dip of the Huskie zone, as well as wider-spaced reconnaissance drilling to the west along the geological trend. The winter drilling program is part of a larger 14,400 metre drill program planned for Waterbury Lake in 2018, with the remainder expected to be completed during the summer months. Refer to Denison's press release dated April 18, 2018 for results of the winter 2018 drill program at Waterbury Lake.\nAt Hook Carter (Denison 80% interest and operator), Denison completed 3,062 metres of diamond drilling in four drill holes. All four holes encountered hydrothermal alteration in both the sandstone and the basement lithologies associated with graphitic structures, which are indicative of the continuation of the mineralizing system within the Patterson Lake Corridor.\nAt Midwest (25.17% Denison owned), the winter 2018 drill program comprised 4,709 metres in 12 completed diamond drill holes. On March 27, 2018, Denison also reported an updated mineral resource estimate for the Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits located on the Midwest property.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nTotal general and administrative expenses were $1,832,000 during Q1 2018. These costs are mainly comprised of head office salaries and benefits, office costs in multiple regions, audit and regulatory costs, legal fees, investor relations expenses, project costs, and all other costs related to operating a public company with listings in Canada and the United States, as well as non-recurring project or legal costs.\nOther income and expenses\nDuring Q1 2018, the Company recognized a loss of $3,456,000 in other income. The loss is predominantly due to net losses on investments carried at fair value of $3,405,000.\nEquity share of income from associates\nDuring Q1 2018, the Company recognized a loss of $643,000 from its 18.55% equity share of its associate GoviEx Uranium Inc.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $35,768,000 at March 31, 2018.\nIn April 2018, the Company amended its CAD$24 million credit facility with the Bank of Nova Scotia. The amendment was related to the Company's change in presentation currency, discussed above. The covenant to maintain a specified level of tangible net worth has been changed to $131,000,000 (from USD$150,000,000). The credit facility is fully utilized for non-financial letters of credit in relation to future decommissioning and reclamation obligations.\nOutlook for 2018\nThere was no change in the Company's outlook for 2018.\nABOUT DENISON\nDenison was formed under the laws of Ontario and is a reporting issuer in all Canadian provinces.
