More information is available at www.convergeone.com .\nFootnotes\n(1)\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded total earnout consideration of $126.9 million related to the merger of Forum Merger Corporation and ConvergeOne, as the March 31, 2018 last twelve months pro forma EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with the merger agreement, was in excess of $155.0 million, and therefore, the first two tranches of the earnout have been deemed to be achieved. The earnout consideration was recorded as an equity transaction of $125.4 million and compensation expense of $1.5 million. For accounting presentation purposes, the equity portion of the earnout consideration is reflected as a reduction of the net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2018.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release includes \" \" regarding ConvergeOne with respect to its financial condition, its results of operations, its intended future capital return and its next quarterly cash dividend; its anticipated achievement of the targets related to the earnout under the merger agreement with Forum Merger Corporation; and its financial outlook for 2018. These reflect ConvergeOne's current views and information currently available. This information is, where applicable, based on estimates, assumptions and analysis that ConvergeOne believes, as of the date hereof, provide a reasonable basis for the information contained herein. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"aim\", \"estimate\", \"target\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"guidance\" or other similar words, and include statements regarding ConvergeOne's plans, strategies, objectives, targets and expected financial performance.\nThese involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of ConvergeOne. These risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the possibility that ConvergeOne may be adversely affected by economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (2) ConvergeOne's ability to identify and integrate acquisitions and achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with acquired businesses; (3) changes in applicable laws or regulations; and (4) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the reports ConvergeOne files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") as well as those under \"Risk Factors\" included in the Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-223837), filed by ConvergeOne with the SEC.\nActual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any projections and and the assumptions on which those vary from are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on as a predictor of future performance as projected financial information, cost savings, synergies and other information are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. All information herein speaks only as of (1) the date hereof, in the case of information about ConvergeOne, or (2) the date of such information, in the case of information from persons other than ConvergeOne. Except as required under applicable law, ConvergeOne undertakes no duty to update or revise the information contained herein.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in the Company's press release in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), ConvergeOne also presents the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per credit agreement, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EPS.\nA \"non-GAAP financial measure\" refers to a numerical measure of the Company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the Company's financial statements. The Company provides certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of the Company's liquidity. The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare the Company's performance to that of other companies.\nThe Company has presented: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per credit agreement, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EPS as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (a) total depreciation and amortization, (b) interest expense and other, net, and (c) income tax expense, as further adjusted to eliminate non-cash stock-based compensation expense, acquisition accounting adjustments, transaction costs, and other one-time nonrecurring costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA per credit agreement as Adjusted EBITDA plus (a) Board of Directors related expenses (b) one time and non-recurring process and efficiency improvements, (c) pro forma synergies, and (d) EBITDA per acquisition. The Company defines Adjusted net income as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (a) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, (b) amortization of debt issuance costs, (c) non-cash share-based compensation expense, (d) costs related to debt refinancing, (e) acquisition accounting adjustments, (f) transaction costs, (g) other costs, and (h) the income tax impact associated with the foregoing items. The Company defines Adjusted EPS as Adjusted net income divided by weighted shares outstanding on a diluted basis.\nThe Company believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of the Company's core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. ConvergeOne management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results, and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance.\nThe Company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA per credit agreement and Adjusted Net Income 2018 outlook to GAAP net income, or its Adjusted EPS 2018 outlook to GAAP EPS, because the reconciling items between such GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures cannot be reasonably predicted or accurately forecasted due to the uncertain of timing and the magnitude of the reconciling items, and therefore, is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConvergeOne Holdings, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated
