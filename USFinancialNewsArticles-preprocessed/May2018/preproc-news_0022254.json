(NYSE:NRP) today reported first quarter of 2018 results as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nChange\n(In thousands, except per unit data)\n2018 2017 Net income from continuing operations $ 26,088 $ 6,111 $ 19,977 327 % Net income 26,074 5,904 20,170 342 % Net income attributable to common unitholders and general partner 18,574 3,404 15,170 446 % Basic net income per common unit 1.49 0.28 1.21 432 % Diluted net income per common unit 1.15 0.28 0.87 311 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 54,886 51,285 3,601 7 % Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 20,211 20,489 (278 ) (1 )% Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations (173 ) (2,068 ) 1,895 92 % Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of continuing operations (28,713 ) 54,153 (82,866 ) (153 )% Distributable Cash Flow (1) 20,845 18,547 2,298 12 % Free Cash Flow (1) 19,302 18,712 590 3 % Craig Nunez, President and Chief Operating Officer, commented: \"We delivered solid operating performance and continued to generate significant amounts of cash during the first quarter. As our leverage profile continues to improve, we remain focused on maximizing cash generation, strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our liquidity.\"\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, NRP had liquidity of $76.2 million, consisting of $21.2 million in cash and $55.0 million of borrowing capacity available under its credit facility. NRP's consolidated Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio at March 31, 2018 was 3.5x.\nNRP continues to focus on reducing its debt while maintaining sufficient liquidity to operate its business. NRP's goal is to achieve a leverage ratio, defined as Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA, of less than 3.0x, while maintaining minimum liquidity of $100 million, which may consist of a combination of cash and/or available borrowing capacity.\nWith respect to the first quarter of 2018, NRP declared a cash distribution of $0.45 per common unit and a distribution of $7.5 million in cash on NRP’s preferred units. NRP's distribution coverage ratio over the last twelve months was 6.0x before taking into account the $30 million annual distribution on NRP's preferred units, and 4.6x after taking into account the preferred unit distribution.\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nSegment Information\nCoal Royalty and Other\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nChange\n(In thousands)\n2018 2017 Net income $ 40,728 $ 35,094 $ 5,634 16 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 46,070 43,845 2,225 5 % Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 38,793 37,932 861 2 % Net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations 1,143 6 1,137 18,950 % Net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations — 16 (16 ) (100 )% Distributable Cash Flow (1) 39,936 37,937 1,999 5 % Free Cash Flow (1) 39,280 38,346 934 2 %\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nNet income from the Coal Royalty and Other segment increased primarily due to lower depletion expense as a result of lower production and prior year asset impairment. Overall coal related revenues were essentially flat, as the impact of lower production was offset by higher coal prices. Distributable cash flow increased during the period primarily as a result of increased cash flow from our natural gas royalty properties.\nSoda Ash\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nChange\n(In thousands)\n2018 2017 Net income $ 9,621 $ 10,294 $ (673 ) (7 )% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 12,250 12,250 — — % Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 10,153 12,250 (2,097 ) (17 )% Net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations 2,097 — 2,097 100 % Distributable Cash Flow (1) 12,250 12,250 — — % Free Cash Flow (1) 12,250 12,250 — — %\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nNet income from the Soda Ash segment decreased primarily as a result of lower international sales and higher selling, general and administrative costs.\nConstruction Aggregates\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nPercentage\nChange\n(In thousands)\n2018 2017 Net loss $ (1,975 ) $ (1,539 ) $ (436 ) (28 )% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 902 2,375 (1,473 ) (62 )% Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 2,797 4,046 (1,249 ) (31 )% Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations (3,413 ) (2,074 ) (1,339 ) (65 )% Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations (49 ) (96 ) 47 49 % Distributable Cash Flow (1) 191 2,099 (1,908 ) (91 )% Free Cash Flow (1) (696 ) 1,855 (2,551 ) (138 )%\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and reconciliation tables at the end of this release.\nNet loss from the Construction Aggregates segment increased primarily due to unfavorable weather and higher repair and maintenance and fuel costs.

In addition, interest expense decreased as a result of debt reduction. Distributable cash flow increased primarily as a result of prior year payment of performance based awards related to the completion of our recapitalization transactions and lower G&A costs, partially offset by the timing of interest payments on NRP's 2022 Senior Notes.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held today at 10:00 a.m. ET.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the partnership expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the partnership based on its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the partnership. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity prices; decreases in demand for coal, aggregates and industrial minerals, including trona/soda ash; changes in operating conditions and costs; production cuts by our lessees; unanticipated geologic problems; our liquidity, leverage and access to capital and financing sources; changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, litigation risk, and other factors detailed in Natural Resource Partners’ Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Natural Resource Partners L.P. has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n“Distributable Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations plus distributions from unconsolidated investment in excess of cumulative earnings, proceeds from sales of assets, including those included in discontinued operations, and return of long-term contract receivables (including affiliate); less maintenance capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interest. DCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. DCF may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies. In addition, DCF presented below is not calculated or presented on the same basis as Distributable Cash Flow as defined in our partnership agreement, which is used as a metric to determine whether we are able to increase quarterly distributions to our common unitholders. DCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions to our common and preferred unitholders and our general partner and repay debt.\n“Free Cash Flow” is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations plus distributions from unconsolidated investment in excess of cumulative earnings and return of long-term contract receivables (including affiliate); less maintenance and expansion capital expenditures, cash flow used in mitigation payments and acquisition costs classified as financing activities and distributions to non-controlling interest. FCF is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. FCF may not be calculated the same for us as for other companies. FCF is a supplemental liquidity measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions to our common and preferred unitholders and our general partner and repay debt.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) from continuing operations less equity earnings from unconsolidated investment; plus total distributions from unconsolidated investment, interest expense, net, debt modification expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation, depletion and amortization and asset impairments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net income or loss attributable to partners, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance, liquidity or ability to service debt obligations. There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance, including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring items that materially affect our net income (loss), the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA presented below is not calculated or presented on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA as defined in our partnership agreement or Consolidated EBITDDA as defined in Opco's debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.\n“Adjusted Net Income” is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as Net income attributable to common unitholders and general partner plus restructuring transaction expenses that include debt modification expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and restructuring-related incentive compensation expense, asset impairments and income (loss) from discontinued operations; less gain on sale of assets. Adjusted net income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing and financial activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management team believes Adjusted net income is useful in evaluating our financial performance because restructuring transaction expenses are one time charges, gains on asset sales are not related to the operations of our business and asset impairments are non-cash charges. Excluding these from net income allows us to better compare results from ongoing operations period-over-period.\n-Financial Tables, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Recap of Metrics
