CATHARINES, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Algoma Central Corporation (“Algoma” or “the Company”) (TSX: ALC), a leading provider of marine transportation services, today announced its results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAll amounts reported below are in thousands of Canadian dollars, except for per share data and unless otherwise noted. First quarter 2018 highlights include:\nA 61% reduction in net loss for the first quarter to $7,453 compared to a net loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $19,105.

The Domestic Dry-Bulk segment loss of $10,400 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the loss of $16,011 in the prior year, was due primarily to a foreign currency gain in 2018.

Joint venture earnings increased by $2,087 of which $1,215 is in Global Short Sea earnings. Re-organization of the NovaAlgoma Short Sea Carrier fleet resulted in an expansion of the fleet from 15 vessels to 20 vessels. Two new Equinox class vessels, the Algoma Sault and the Algoma Innovator arrived in Canada in the first quarter of 2018 and began operations at the end of March.
