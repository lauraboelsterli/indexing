LoveLife's management and founders have over 25 years of experience each in the professional match making business as senior C level executives. We have combined our teams at Upper Street Marketing and LoveLife and have launched the new LoveLife businesses.\nIn their respective roles as C level executives, they created and executed on a successful business model that generated incremental revenue growth exceeding $1,000,000.00 per month while maintaining a very high level of profitability.\nManagement is now in the process of replicating that success within Upper Street Marketing, Inc. and its new subsidiaries LoveLife USA, Inc. and LoveLife Canada, Inc.\nDescription of the LoveLife USA and LoveLife Canada\nSome background on the LoveLife companies: The business of LoveLife USA, Inc. and LoveLife Canada, Inc. specializes in the process of connecting singles who are looking for a life partner. The methodology incorporates the traditional in person match making process where the company's professionally trained match makers access individuals looking to meet their life partner using various proprietary algorithms and processes and then using the company's massive database of eligible partners, identifies potential matches and makes introductions. It is old fashioned match making for which clients pay a fee.\nThe company will also incorporate these technologies for the implementation of their online service, which will be launched during the fall of this year. This service will compete with www.match.com and other online matchmaking or dating services, with some key differences.
