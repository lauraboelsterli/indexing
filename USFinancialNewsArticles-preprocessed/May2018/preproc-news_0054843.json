    "text": "24 COMMENTS The power of national Democratic leaders to shape their own midterm candidate field will be tested anew Tuesday, following last week’s surprise defeat of one of their favored candidates in a Nebraska primary .\nIn Texas, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to sideline one candidate, political activist Laura Moser, who is vying in a runoff election against attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in Houston. DCCC-backed candidates are favored to win their runoff elections in two other Lone Star districts .\nAnd in Kentucky, which also holds primary elections Tuesday, Democrats will choose between Amy McGrath, a former Marine and political novice, and Jim Gray, the mayor of Lexington whom the DCCC had encouraged to run.\nWith control of Congress at stake, leaders of both parties aim to advance their strongest general-election candidates for this year’s high-stakes midterm elections. President Donald Trump has intervened in several Senate GOP primary contests to back party favorites and nudge others out.\nBut among Democrats, direct efforts by party leaders to anoint a particular candidate and drive out competition often has met with resistance and resentment from local candidates and grassroot activists suspicious of the party.\nThe DCCC was rebuffed last week when the candidate party leaders endorsed in a Nebraska House primary, centrist former Rep. Brad Ashford, lost to nonprofit executive Kara Eastman, who campaigned on her support for a single-payer health care system.\nIn Houston, the DCCC tried without success to nudge Ms. Moser out of the race to face GOP Rep. John Culberson because it believed she, as an outspoken activist and journalist who lived in Washington, D.C., until launching her campaign, would be the weaker general election candidate.\nLizzie Pannill Fletcher and her husband, Scott Fletcher, leave a polling place after voting in the primary election in Houston on March 6. Photo: Brett Coomer/Associated Press When the committee released opposition research about potentially controversial writings by Ms. Moser in March, she used it to show her outsider status. It boomeranged on the party, giving her a fundraising boost and propelling her into Tuesday’s runoff.\nSince then, the DCCC has taken a more hands-off approach to Ms. Moser, but she still bridles at the hostility of the party establishment.\n“It’s really hard to fight against the whole machine,” she said in a phone interview, taking a break from campaigning in Houston’s sweltering heat.\nShe disagrees with the view that winning in the swing district requires a centrist with cross-party appeal.\n“If we want a different result, we need to run different kinds of candidates,” said Ms. Moser, calling for a more partisan approach during a debate earlier this month. “There are more of us than there are of them.”\nMs. Fletcher, who hasn’t been officially endorsed by the DCCC, said she opposed an “us versus them” political strategy. “Our approach in this has been to talk to every single resident in this district,” she said.\nWhat’s Dividing Democrats The most recent fundraising reports show that, as of early May, Ms. Fletcher had raised $1.4 million, to Ms. Moser’s $1.2 million. But there is a big disparity in campaign cash on hand: Ms. Fletcher had over $362,000 compared with Ms. Moser’s $80,000.\nMr. Culberson, who faced no serious opposition in the GOP primary , declined to say which candidate he considers a more-formidable opponent. “That’s for the Democrats to decide,” he said Thursday during a brief interview at the Capitol.\nIn Dallas, the DCCC endorsed former NFL linebacker Colin Allred over businesswoman Lillian Salerno. Ms. Salerno backs a single-payer health care system, while Mr. Allred is for a public option to compete with private insurance companies.\nThe winner will face GOP Rep. Pete Sessions. Democrats didn’t field an opponent against Mr. Sessions in 2016, even though Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump in the district.\nMs. Salerno, who has raised $665,000, said Texas Democrats don’t appreciate the DCCC trying to handpick a candidate before voters have decided.\n“These are Texans,” she said. “They don’t want to be told what to do.”\nGOP Rep. John Culberson will face either Laura Moser or Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in the Houston Congressional election this fall. Photo: Bill Clark/Zuma Press Mr. Allred, now a civil rights attorney who worked in the Obama administration , has raised $1 million for his campaign. He said Ms. Salerno’s more-liberal platform would repel swing voters in the general election.\n“I’m the only candidate that can win in the fall, and the national party understands that as well,” he said.\nAnd in a district that stretches across a vast swath of Texas from San Antonio to El Paso, DCCC-backed former Air Force intelligence officer Gina Ortiz Jones is expected to defeat Rick Treviño, a public school history teacher, who says he was inspired to run by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nMs. Ortiz Jones has raised $1.2 million to Mr. Treviño’s $48,000.\nIn Kentucky, Ms. McGrath, the former Marine, was initially seen as an underdog against the national party’s recruit. But she has proven a prolific enough fundraiser that DCCC officials now find her to be a credible candidate equal to Mr. Gray. The party hasn’t endorsed either candidate in the primary.\nA mid-April poll for the McGrath campaign found she was leading Mr. Gray by a 42%-35% margin.\nRelated Video The Democrats have a \"blue wave\" of momentum building for the 2018 midterms, thanks to a motivated base, success in special elections and a low approval rating for President Trump. Will that be enough to take back the House and the Senate? Ms. McGrath was catapulted from obscurity last year after an introductory video—showing her as a Marine fighter pilot, recounting the obstacles she faced as a woman in her military career—went viral and brought a fundraising windfall. She said her campaign has been propelled by voters hungry for change in the Washington status quo.\n“Do we need more businessmen? Do we have a lack of experienced standard politicians?” she said in an interview. “The response is no. People are tired of the standard politician.’”\nThe winner of Tuesday’s Kentucky primary will face GOP Rep. Andy Barr.\nAs of early May, Ms. McGrath had raised $2.036 million, compared with Mr. Gray’s $1.329 million. But he had more campaign cash on hand, more than $463,000 to her $302,000.\nGray campaign manager Jamie Emmons says the mayor, who has been endorsed by the district’s largest newspaper, is leading the race in other polls. “We are closing out this primary with excitement and momentum,” he said.\nElection 2018: Up Next View full election calendar Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Reid J.
