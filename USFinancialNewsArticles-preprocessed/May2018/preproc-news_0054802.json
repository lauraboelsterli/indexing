    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 3:59 PM / Updated 4 minutes ago Teacher, student injured in Indiana school shooting - police Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - A teacher and a teenage student were injured in a shooting at an Indiana middle school on Friday morning and another student was in custody, police said.\nThe male student, who is a suspect in the shooting, has been detained, Noblesville Police Chief Kevin Jowitt told a news conference.\nThe incident was the latest in a series of shootings at U.S. schools and colleges, some of which have claimed dozens of lives, stretching back decades.\nThe only people injured in Friday’s incident at Noblesville West Middle School were the teenage student and the teacher, according to Jowitt. Local TV station WTTV, citing a source at the scene, said the student victim suffered a fractured ankle.\nThe police chief said the school, attended by more than 1,350 students, has been cleared, but he did not provide details of the incident.\n“The situation is contained,” he said.\nThe shooting occurred shortly after 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) at the school about 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Indianapolis, and authorities said the school was placed on lockdown.

She said no information was available on their conditions.\nIndiana Governor Eric Holcomb, flying back from Europe, said in a statement that he was monitoring the situation.\n“Our thoughts are with all those affected by this horrible situation,” he said, adding that about 100 State Police officers had been made available to work with local responders.\nThe incident occurred a week after a 17-year-old high school student in Santa Fe, Texas, near Houston shot and killed eight classmates and two teachers.
