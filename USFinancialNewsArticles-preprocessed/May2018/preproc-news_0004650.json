(NASDAQ: NTCT), a leading provider of service assurance, security, and business analytics, announced that two new directors, Alfred Grasso and Susan L. Spradley, were appointed to the Company’s Board, effective as of April 23, 2018.\n“We are pleased to welcome Al and Sue to our Board as a part of our ongoing efforts to bring on experienced, knowledgeable advisors who can help us effectively capitalize on the opportunities we see to expand on our market and technology leadership and deliver greater value to our key stakeholders,” said Anil Singhal, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, NETSCOUT. “These individuals are highly accomplished leaders who will bring tremendous experience and valuable insight that can further enhance our ability to compete and expand our business globally.”\nMr. Grasso brings four decades of leadership experience from MITRE Corporation where he held positions of increasing responsibility that culminated in his serving as president and chief executive officer from 2006 to 2017. He continues to serve as a Trustee and consultant to the organization. Mr. Grasso’s extensive experience includes service on the boards of a number of scientifically-driven organizations and non-profit institutions. Mr. Grasso holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a master’s degree in computer science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\nMs. Spradley is a partner in the Tap Growth Group, a position she has held since August 2017, and the Chief Executive Officer of Motion Intelligence, Inc. From January 2013 to January 2017, she served in various executive roles at Viavi Solutions Inc. (formerly JDS Uniphase). Prior to 2013, Ms. Spradley served as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of US Ignite, a White House and National Science Foundation initiative focused on applications for smart city implementation. Ms. Spradley’s experience also includes senior leadership roles at Nokia Siemens Networks and Nortel Networks. Ms. Spradley currently sits on the Board of Directors of Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ: QRVO), a leading provider of innovative RF solutions, and Avaya Holdings Corp. (NYSE: AVYA), a global leader in digital communications software, services, and devices, and serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of US Ignite. Ms. Spradley holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Kansas.\nDetailed biographies for Mr. Grasso and Ms. Spradley are available on the Board of Directors section of NETSCOUT’s website.\nThe addition of Ms. Spradley and Mr. Grasso increases the size of NETSCOUT’s Board of Directors to nine directors, seven of whom are independent. With her appointment as a class III director, Ms. Spradley joins the Board for an initial term that will end in 2020. As a class I director, Mr. Grasso’s initial term will end at the next annual meeting at which time he is expected to be nominated to serve a full three-year term ending in 2021. Mr. Grasso is a fitting successor to the seat formerly occupied by the late Victor DeMarines, who was a colleague of Mr. Grasso’s during their respective tenures at MITRE Corporation.\nAbout NETSCOUT\nNETSCOUT SYSTEMS, INC.
