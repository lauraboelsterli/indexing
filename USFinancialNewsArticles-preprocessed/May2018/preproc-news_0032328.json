Increased manufacturing infrastructure to support future demand from domestic and international Tier-1 wireless carrier customers including: Leased a new 29,000 square foot production facility to ramp up production. Added key production staff to reduce lead times and gain efficiencies.\nMilitary Received a 20-unit purchase order for a light weight mobile DC power system for the U.S. Army robotic mule project after receiving Phase II approval in Q4 2017. Product will supply power to Army Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS), a global military strategy to remotely provide surveillance, transportation and reconnaissance over wide areas, thereby increasing standoff distances, survivability and reaction times in the battlefield. Received a $0.8 million purchase order from a major U.S. defense manufacturer of military vehicles.\nProduct Development Continued to invest in research and development to meet new customer requirements. Commenced marketing for lower cost Summit Series Hybrid DC power system for off-grid and bad grid applications in international markets. Commenced marketing for lower cost, compact 15kW horizontal DC generator to compete with AC generator in the telecom replacement market. Revamped key supplier discussions and relationships to improve future margin profile on products in anticipation of increased demand for the company’s backup DC power solutions.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights Net sales decreased 2% to $4.9 million in Q1 2018, as compared to $5.0 million in Q1 2017. Net sales increased 22% in Q1 2018 to $4.9 million, as compared to $4.0 million in Q4 2017. Backlog increased to $2.5 million at March 31, 2018 and is currently $4.3 million at May 11, 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to 30% in Q1 2018, as compared to 39% in Q1 2017. Operating expenses increased to $1.8 million in Q1 2018, as compared to $1.0 million in Q1 2017. Net loss was $0.3 million in Q1 2018, or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.6 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, in Q1 2017.\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nNet sales totaled $4.9 million in Q1 2018, a decrease of 2%, as compared to $5.0 million in Q1 2017. The decrease in net sales was primarily a result of a price reduction in the company’s DC power systems. Of note, the number of DC power systems sold in the first quarter was 15% greater than in the same period in 2017.\nBacklog totaled $2.5 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $1.0 million at March 31, 2017. As of May 11, 2018, backlog totaled $4.3 million, a 72% increase as compared to March 31, 2018. The increase in backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the end of 2017 was attributable to increasing sales to the company’s new largest Tier-1 wireless telecommunications carrier customer, as well as increasing sales to military customers.\nGross profit decreased 23% to $1.5 million in Q1 2018, as compared to $1.9 million in Q1 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to 30% in Q1 2018, as compared to 39% in Q1 2017. The gross profit in Q1 2018 was negatively affected due to the price reduction in our DC power systems that took effect in March 2017, coupled with an increase in cost of materials as a result of volatility in the steel market and other raw materials markets. The company made substantial improvements in its production facility and product line during 2017 and continues to believe that gross profit margin will improve to above 35% in subsequent quarters as the volume of sales increases.\nOperating expenses increased to $1.8 million in Q1 2018, from $1.0 million in Q1 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing as well as research and development expenses.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.3 million, or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $0.6 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The decline in net income is attributable to a price reduction in the company’s DC power systems, coupled with higher operating expenses.\nCash at March 31, 2018 totaled $11.7 million, as compared to $14.2 million at December 31, 2017 with no long-term debt outstanding. The decrease in cash as of the comparative periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was the result of a $1.8 million quarter over quarter increase to our accounts receivable caused by the timing of delivery of a large order late in the first quarter of 2018. We expect accounts receivable and cash flow to normalize as we move through 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“The first quarter of 2018 was highlighted with continued sequential revenue growth, improved backlog and increased diversification among our telecom, international and military segments,” said Polar Power CEO, Arthur Sams. “In fact, 25% of our backlog today is represented by the military segment and our largest wireless carrier customer in 2016 now represents less than 27% of our total net sales. I am also happy to report that our newly signed Tier-1 wireless carrier customer continues to ramp nicely and is one of the main drivers behind our sequential backlog improvement.\n“The steps taken in 2017 are now starting to bear fruit across all of our key verticals and we are starting to see initial purchase orders commence in our international segment. During the first quarter we received new purchase orders in our Namibia project and two Sri-Lanka project sites. We expect these orders to expand in the comping quarters as the project size represents large site rollouts by our customers in these territories. The rest of the world continues to develop as field trials in Malaysia and Japan are being completed and we are seeing the addition of multiple new customers to our international field trial roster.\n“On the financial front, we did experience some impact to our gross margin profile during the first quarter as volatility in the raw materials market elevated prices and we continued to invest in our production infrastructure to reduce lead times and to achieve higher efficiencies. Our decision to invest in capacity was largely based upon conversations with our Tier-1 wireless carrier customers, prospects and international sales team and the confidence we have in converting those requirements into sales opportunities. We do believe as our volume of sales increases our gross profit margin will improve to above 35%,” continued Sams.\n“Another key initiative made during the first quarter to improve our gross margin profile was aligning our conversations directly with key suppliers to some of our most critical components. In fact, today I am in Japan negotiating with our core engine suppliers as I have a clear line of sight into our future demand. This clarity helps negotiate better pricing and should result in an elevated gross profit margin for our prime and backup DC power solutions.\n“As we enter the midpoint of the second quarter of 2018 our optimism is supported with the increase in our backlog and the potential commencement of initial orders with our newly signed Tier-1 wireless carrier customer. We believe the combination of an improved revenue trajectory, a diverse customer base, a healthy balance sheet and conservative cash management will create shareholder value in the quarters to come. We look forward to sharing more on our developing story at soon to be announced upcoming investor conferences and roadshows in key cities across the United States,” concluded Sams.\nConference Call Details\nPolar Power CFO Luis Zavala and COO Raj Masina will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer period.
