    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords fourth graf\nGiancarlo Stanton homered and had four hits as the New York Yankees beat the Oakland Athletics 6-2 on Sunday following a lengthy rain delay at Yankee Stadium.\nAfter a rain delay of two hours, 45 minutes, Stanton helped the Yankees win for the 19th time in 22 games by producing his second four-hit game of the season and the sixth of his career.\nHis first three hits were off left-hander Brett Anderson (0-2). Stanton is now batting .429 (15-for-35) with seven homers and 15 RBIs off left-handed pitching.\nStanton had a two-run single in the first, another single in the third, and then became the fourth Yankee to reach double digits in homers in the fifth. It is the first time the Yankees had four players reach double-digit homers in the first 40 games of a season.\nStanton added a double in the seventh off right-hander Santiago Casilla.\nAaron Hicks added an RBI single and run-scoring groundout as the Yankees improved to 13-2 in their past 15 home games.\nAaron Judge contributed a run-scoring single in the eighth and scored twice.\nLuis Severino (6-1) allowed one run on five hits and two walks in six innings. He struck out seven, won his fourth straight decision and allowed one run or none for the 21st time since the start of last season.\nJed Lowrie hit an RBI single for the Athletics and Mark Canha homered in the ninth for Oakland, which lost for the fifth time in six games. Oakland was held to two runs or fewer for the sixth time in eight games.\nAnderson allowed four runs and eight hits in five innings.\nThe Yankees loaded the bases before an out was recorded and took a two-run lead 15 pitches in on a single up the middle by Stanton. After Anderson got a double play, the Yankees made it 3-0 on a base hit past the mound by Hicks.\nOakland scored on Lowrie’s bloop single to right field in the fifth. The hit scored Jonathan Lucroy after catcher Gary Sanchez dropped Judge’s short-hop throw from right.\nStanton made it 4-1 with two outs in the fifth when he drove a 2-1 fastball over the right-center-field fence and into the Yankees bullpen. The Yankees scored their final two runs on Hicks’ grounder in the seventh and Judge’s single in the eighth.\nCanha made it 6-2 with a homer to center field off Chasen Shreve.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
