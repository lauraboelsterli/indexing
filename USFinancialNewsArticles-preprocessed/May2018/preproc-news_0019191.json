    "text": "Excellent sales growth - up 23 percent; Operating income up 14 percent\nPerformance Chemicals operating income up 102 percent; Fuel Specialties operating income up 4 percent\nSemi-annual dividend increased 15 percent; Ninth consecutive increase\nENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innospec Inc. (NASDAQ:IOSP) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company also announced the declaration of its semi-annual dividend of $0.44 per common share for the first half of 2018, representing an increase of 15 percent. This dividend will be paid on May 31, 2018, to shareholders on the record at May 21, 2018.\nTotal net sales for the quarter were $360.7 million, up 23 percent from the $294.3 million reported in the corresponding quarter last year. Net income was $22.2 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to $17.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, recorded a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $43.9 million, a 12 percent increase from $39.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nResults for this quarter include special items summarized in the table below. Excluding these items, adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $1.00 per diluted share a year ago, a 2 percent increase. Innospec closed the quarter in a net debt position of $140.7 million. As expected, cash generation for the quarter was negative with net cash used in operating activities of $2.0 million, before capital expenditures of $3.8 million and software capitalization of $0.8 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA, income before income taxes and net income excluding special items, and related per-share amounts, are non-GAAP financial measures that are defined and reconciled with GAAP results herein and in the schedules below.\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 Quarter ended March 31, 2017 (in millions, except share and per share data) Income\nbefore\nincome\ntaxes Net\nincome Diluted\nEPS Income\nbefore\nincome\ntaxes Net\nincome Diluted\nEPS Reported GAAP amounts $ 29.7 $ 22.2 $ 0.90 $ 23.2 $ 17.2 $ 0.70 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 4.6 3.7 0.15 5.1 3.3 0.14 Foreign currency exchange (gains)/losses (1.0 ) (0.8 ) (0.03 ) 1.0 0.7 0.03 Foreign exchange loss on liquidation of subsidiary - - - 1.8 1.8 0.07 Fair value acquisition accounting - - - 1.7 1.4 0.06 3.6 2.9 0.12 9.6 7.2 0.30 Adjusted non-GAAP amounts $ 33.3 $ 25.1 $ 1.02 $ 32.8 $ 24.4 $ 1.00 Commenting on the first quarter results, Patrick S. Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer, said,\n“Overall, Innospec has had a very good start to the year, with an increase in EPS, despite minimal sales into Octane Additives when compared to last year. We continue to deliver good sales growth in all of our strategic business units excluding Octane Additives, and our margin improvement programs are well established, which we believe will deliver enhanced profitability later in the year. Our strategy remains right on track.”\n“Performance Chemicals had a particularly strong quarter, with all regions showing excellent growth. Customers have responded well to our expanded product lines, both in personal care and home care. Combined with the improvement in margins we delivered, the business has more than doubled its operating income from the comparable quarter.”\n“Fuel Specialties delivered solid growth. Margins were a little below our expected range, but we expect these to recover in the coming months, as the lag from raw material increases works its way through. New product launches continued to support this growth with customers who benefit from our robust technologies.”\n“Oilfield Services showed excellent sales growth, with sales approaching $100 million for the quarter, as customer activity in the Americas remained very strong. Margins remain short of our expectations, as raw material and transportation issues continue to impact us. However, we feel confident that the programs we have in place will deliver improvement in the near term.”\n“Octane Additives had a very slow quarter with minimal sales, which resulted in a small loss. We have now received a further order for delivery in the second quarter, although this is smaller than previous orders, as our customer manages their inventories.”\nIn Performance Chemicals, revenues of $124.0 million were up 31 percent from $94.5 million a year ago. The business grew in all regions with volume growth of 10 percent and a favorable price/mix of 9 percent augmented by a positive currency impact of 12 percent. As we anticipated, gross margins improved to 20.5 percent from 17.7 percent a year ago reflecting the positive results of several improvement projects. Overall, operating income more than doubled to $12.1 million, from $6.0 million a year ago.\nRevenues in Fuel Specialties were $143.4 million for the quarter, a 13 percent increase from $126.4 million last year. The improvement comprised an increase in volume of 1 percent, a positive price/mix variance of 4 percent and a positive 8 percent currency impact. Gross margins were down 2.7 percentage points on last year’s strong quarter to 33.8 percent. Operating income improved by 4 percent to $28.2 million, compared to $27.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nRevenues in Oilfield Services for the quarter were $92.9 million, up 40 percent from $66.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, driven by increased customer activity. Volume growth of 33 percent and a price/mix benefit of 7 percent contributed to the growth. Gross margins were down 4.4 percentage points over the comparable quarter. The Oilfield Services business delivered an operating income of $3.0 million for the quarter which was on par with a year ago, but improved sequentially from last quarter.\nAs we anticipated, revenues in Octane Additives were $0.4 million for the quarter compared to $6.9 million a year ago. This produced an operating loss of $1.4 million for the quarter, compared to a profit of $2.0 million in last year’s first quarter.\nCorporate costs for the quarter were slightly higher than expected at $13.0 million, compared with $10.9 million a year ago due mainly to higher personnel related expenses.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.3 percent, compared to 25.9 percent in the same quarter last year.\nNet cash outflow from operations was $2.0 million, compared to a cash outflow of $19.9 million a year ago. The comparative quarter last year included a significant outflow of cash for working capital related to the acquisition and business expansion. As of March 31, 2018, Innospec had $78.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and total debt of $218.8 million, resulting in net debt of $140.7 million.\nMr. Williams concluded,\n“We are very pleased with our overall start to the year, which shows the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet. Customer activity has been good in all of our core businesses. Excluding Octane Additives from both periods, we have improved our underlying adjusted EPS by 13 percent over last year.\n“Our focus on margin improvement in Performance Chemicals is delivering ahead of plan and the results in operating income are excellent. We plan to make further improvements, both in this business and in our other strategic businesses, which we anticipate will underpin additional gains later in the year.”\n“We are pleased that our Board has approved a further 15 percent increase in our semi-annual dividend to 44 cents per share, which will be the ninth consecutive time that we have increased our dividend. Our strategy remains on track and we feel confident of our prospects for the rest of 2018 and beyond.”\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe information presented in this press release includes financial measures that are not calculated or presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures comprise adjusted EBITDA, income before income taxes excluding special items, net income excluding special items and related per share amounts together with net debt. Adjusted EBITDA is net income per our consolidated financial statements adjusted for the exclusion of charges for interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and acquisition fair value adjustments. Income before income taxes, net income and diluted EPS, excluding special items, per our consolidated financial statements are adjusted for the exclusion of amortization of acquired intangible assets, foreign currency exchange (gains)/losses, foreign exchange loss on liquidation of subsidiary and fair value acquisition accounting. Net debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided herein and in the schedules below. The Company believes that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and may assist them in evaluating the Company’s underlying performance and identifying operating trends. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. While the Company believes that such measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s performance, investors should not consider them to be a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not provide a comparable view of the Company’s performance relative to other companies in similar industries. Management uses adjusted EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP EPS) and adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP net income) to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the Company’s operations. Management believes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is GAAP net income and has provided a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and net income excluding special items, and related per share amounts, to GAAP net income herein and in the schedules below.\nAbout Innospec Inc.\nInnospec Inc. is an international specialty chemicals company with approximately 1900 employees in 23 countries.
