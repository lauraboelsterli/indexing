    "text": "0 COMMENTS A daily digest of The Wall Street Journal’s coverage of energy companies, commodity markets and the forces that shape them.\nSend us tips, suggestions and complaints: EnergyJournal@wsj.com\nOIL PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE FUELED BY IRAN DEAL CONCERNS\nMarket jitters over whether President Donald Trump will exit the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran sent oil contracts soaring, writes the Wall Street Journal’s Biman Mukherji.\nMr. Trump is due to decide by May 12 whether to withdraw from a deal with Iran and six world powers that lifted economic sanctions on Tehran and allowed the country to boost its oil production in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.\nOn the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude for June delivery recently was up 1.2% at $70.56 a barrel in the Globex trading session. July Brent crude on London’s ICE Futures exchange rose 1.1% to $75.66.\nRising oil prices this year have taken investors by surprise, Alison Sider and Georgi Kantchev write. The price of crude has climbed nearly 12% this year and has reached its highest levels since 2014—a rally that has caught most big banks flat-footed.\nLast December, analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, would average around $57 a barrel in the first quarter. Instead, prices averaged $67.\nCrude prices have proven particularly difficult to pin down lately because of factors such as geopolitical risk and the rise of the U.S. shale industry, as well as efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and external producers to eliminate global supply.\n“Forecasts can be upended by unexpected events—it’s your best call at a point in time,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas.\nGLENCORE SCRAPS PLANNED SALE OF $9 BILLION STAKE IN RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY\nMining giant Glencore PLC and Qatar walked back plans to sell an almost $9 billion stake in Russian state oil company PAO Rosneft to CEFC China Energy Co., a once-high-flying Chinese firm now embroiled in legal woes.\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES SEEK TOUGH NEW TRUCK EMISSIONS TARGETS\nA handful of countries in the European Union are seeking far-reaching carbon emissions targets for trucks in advance of a proposed measure from the EU expected later this month, Reuters reports. Unlike the U.S. and other countries, the EU has no restrictions on emissions from trucks.\n‘ The supply of oil needs to rise in order to satisfy demand, which is likewise growing. If US sanctions end up removing Iranian supply from the market too, the already tight oil market will be in even shorter supply. ’\n—Analysts for Commerzbank LABOR STRIKES AND WORKER PROTESTS ERUPT ACROSS IRAN\nAnger is boiling over in Iran as people have taken to the streets to protest worsening economic conditions such as high unemployment and rising food prices, reports the WSJ’s Asa Fitch.\nThere have been hundreds of recent outbreaks of labor unrest in Iran, an indication of deepening discord over the nation’s economic troubles.\nProtesters are turning against employers and government leaders who promised but failed to deliver better times in the two years since economic sanctions were lifted in the nuclear deal.\nThe strain on Iran’s economy may worsen if President Trump decides to pull the U.S. out of the nuclear deal with Tehran.\nFUTURECURVE\nMay 10: Africa Oil & Power is holding its first investor forum in London. The speakers include Pablo Galante Escobar, the head of LNG for Vitol and Gabriel M. Obiang Lima, the minister of mines and hydrocarbons of Equatorial Guinea.\nJune 5-6th: The London Crude Oil Summit. The speakers include Franco Magnani CEO of Eni Trading and Shipping.\nShare this: Energy Newsletter Glencore Iran nuclear deal PAO Rosneft President Donald Trump Previous WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Taxes, Mooch, Wine Next The Capital Spending Boom is Mostly About Tech",
