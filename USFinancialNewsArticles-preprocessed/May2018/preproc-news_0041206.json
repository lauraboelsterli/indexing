    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Monday stepped up pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to reduce Germany’s persistently large current account surplus by hiking public investment.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks after she received a \"Peace Lamp\" award from the Catholic monks at the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, Italy, May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Yara Nardi “The new government’s coalition agreement contains several welcome measures which will continue to address some of these challenges,” the IMF said in its annual policy recommendations.\n“Yet, the current favourable economic environment provides an opportunity for the new government to take more forceful policy actions,” the IMF added.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Paul Carrel\n ",
