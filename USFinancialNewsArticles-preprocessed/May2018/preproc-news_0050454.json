    "text": "May 25, 2018 / 10:33 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago Daimler threatened with recall of over 600,000 diesel models - Spiegel Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler faces a recall order for more than 600,000 diesel-engine vehicles including C-Class and G-Class models because of suspected emissions manipulation, German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. The Daimler logo is seen before the Daimler annual shareholder meeting in Berlin, Germany, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\nGermany’s KBA vehicle authority is probing concrete suspicions that the affected cars were fitted with illicit defeat devices designed to manipulate emissions levels, the magazine said, without citing sources.\nDaimler said on Friday it had not received a formal summons from KBA regarding its C-Class and G-Class models, a precursor to a recall, but declined to comment in detail on the Spiegel report.\nThe report comes a day after the KBA ordered Daimler to recall the Mercedes Vito van model fitted with 1.6 litre diesel Euro-6 engines because of engine control features to reduce exhaust emissions which KBA said breached regulations.\nDaimler has said it is appealing the KBA findings on the Vito and will go to court if necessary.\nSince rival Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers including VW, Daimler and BMW have faced a backlash against diesel technology in which they have invested billions of euros.\nAfter news of the Vito recall emerged, German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer summoned Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche to a meeting on Monday, a spokeswoman for the ministry said.\nHe also asked the KBA to pursue any further leads related to emissions at Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz premium brand.\nThe KBA declined comment.
