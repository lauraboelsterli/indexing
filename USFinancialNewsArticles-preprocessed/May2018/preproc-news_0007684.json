(CSE:AFI) (OTCQB:RSSFF) ( www.affinorgrowers.com ) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that the Company has appointed Randy Minhas, C.Dir, CPA, CA, BBA as the Company’s new Chief Financial Officer effective immediately.

Mr. Minhas has served as Director, Chief Financial Officer and Controller for several publicly traded companies since 2011 focusing on forecasting, business development, development of internal controls and complete financial reporting services. Mr. Minhas currently serves as the Lead Independent Director and Audit Committee Chair of Clean Seed Capital Corp., a publicly listed entity in the agriculture industry. In addition, Mr. Minhas is currently serving as the Group Controller for Rye Patch Gold Corp., a role he will transition out of once Rye Patch completes its merger with Alio Gold Inc. Mr. Minhas has helped Rye Patch transition from an exploration stage Company to a Company with a fully producing gold mine. During this time, the Company has raised in excess of $75 million dollars in equity financings and over US$25 million dollars in debt financing. Prior to joining Rye Patch, Mr. Minhas served as the Financial Reporting and SOX specialist for Golden Queen Mining Inc., helping take the Company from the exploration stage to a fully producing gold mine.\nMr. Minhas holds a Bachelor of Business Administration from Simon Fraser University and completed his Chartered Accountant designation in 2008.

The Company and its Board of Directors would like to thank Mr. Chaudhry for his leadership and direction during his tenure as CFO and director.\nAbout Affinor Growers\nAffinor Growers is a publicly traded company on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol (\"AFI\").
