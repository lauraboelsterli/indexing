GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trade war fears ebb as U.S., China agree to continue talks Washington and Beijing both claimed victory on Monday as the world's two largest economies stepped back from the brink of a global trade war and agreed to hold further talks to boost U.S. exports to China. • Prodded by Trump, FBI to look into complaint about its 2016 tactics The Justice Department agreed on Monday to investigate \"any irregularities\" in FBI tactics related to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign after Trump questioned whether an FBI informant had been planted into his political organization. • U.S. toughens stance on Iran, lists sweeping demands The United States on Monday demanded Iran make sweeping changes -- from dropping its nuclear program to pulling out of the Syrian civil war -- or face severe economic sanctions as the Trump administration hardened its approach to Tehran. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading down 0.3 percent at 10,514.50. • Indian government bonds are likely to ease in early trade as the central bank did not announce an open market operation to buy notes, as some traders had expected. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.80 percent-7.86 percent. • The Indian rupee will likely open marginally higher against the U.S. currency after the dollar index pulled back from its highest level this year. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks rose on Monday and gains in industrials helped propel the Dow to a more than two-month closing high, after a truce between the United States and China calmed fears that a trade war might be imminent. • The dollar hovered near four-month highs on renewed optimism about global growth as the United States and China agreed to drop their tariff threats, while oil stayed at multi-year peaks over potential sanctions in Venezuela. • U.S. Treasuries were steady on Monday as investors evaluated whether last week’s selloff that sent benchmark yields to almost 7-year highs was overdone, and before demand for U.S. debt will be tested by new supply. • Oil prices rose amid worries that Venezuela's crude output could drop further following a disputed presidential election in the country and with potential sanctions on the OPEC-member. • Gold prices were largely steady, after posting a fresh low for the year-to-date in the previous session, as the U.S. dollar took a breather from its recent rally to trade below a five-month high.
