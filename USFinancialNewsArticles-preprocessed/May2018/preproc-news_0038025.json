    "text": "BOSTON and SAN FRANCISCO and HERZLIYA, Israel , May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Battery Ventures, a global investment firm, announced that General Partner Michael Brown, a 20-year veteran of the firm, has joined the board of directors of the National Venture Capital Association, the venture industry’s main trade group.\nBrown—who is based in Boston and specializes in investments in business software and financial services—joins the NVCA’s board along with six other new members, all of whom will serve four-year terms. Earlier today at its annual “VCs-to-DC” national meeting in Washington, DC, the NVCA announced the new board members as well as its new board chairman, Alexis Borisy of Third Rock Ventures.\n“It’s a great honor to have an opportunity to work much more closely with the NVCA and its President and CEO Bobby Franklin to help shape the group’s policy positions and promote its advocacy work with the venture community—as well as its important work with government officials in Washington,” said Brown.\nHe added that “venture investors and entrepreneurs of all stripes are facing critical challenges today in areas such as capital-markets regulation, immigration policy, changes to the tax code, diversity and inclusion and broader technology policy. The NVCA will play an important role in making sure venture-backed companies can continue to grow, attract capital, create jobs and benefit the broader economy.”\nThe NVCA has been active recently on specific issues including patent reform; increased investment in federal basic research programs; and the creation of new visas for foreign entrepreneurs who want to start businesses in the U.S., among other activities.\nBrown was previously a board member of the New England Venture Capital Association and, prior to joining Battery in 1998, worked as a financial analyst in Goldman Sachs’ financial-institutions group. He graduated from Georgetown University with a dual degree in finance and international business.\nAbout Battery Ventures\nBattery strives to invest in cutting-edge, category-defining businesses in markets including software and services, Web infrastructure, consumer Internet, mobile and industrial technologies.
