    "text": "GOLETA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Deckers Brands (NYSE: DECK), a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, today announced the appointment of William L. McComb to its Board of Directors. Mr. McComb brings expertise in building strong brands and leveraging omni-channel consumer engagement strategies. Coinciding with this appointment, Deckers also announced that John G. Perenchio has resigned from the Board.\n“We are very pleased to welcome Bill to the Deckers Board,” said John Gibbons, Chairman of the Board. “He brings valuable and additive skills to our team, including experience in building strong brands through strategic portfolio development in the fashion lifestyle and footwear sectors, as well as evolving direct-to-consumer relationships through digital engagement. His capabilities and leadership approach are firmly aligned with Deckers’ vision and strategy, supporting management’s intent focus on driving stockholder value through our continued transformation.”\n“I am delighted and honored to join the Deckers Board of Directors,” said Mr. McComb. “In Deckers, I see a company with great opportunities, a Board eager to drive value creation, and a management team deeply committed to unlocking growth and profitability. For years I admired their marketing and merchandising; I aim to help them achieve their vision and distinguish themselves in today's omni-channel marketplace.”\nMr. McComb served as chief executive officer of Liz Claiborne, Inc. (renamed Fifth & Pacific Companies, Inc. in 2012) and was a member of the company’s board of directors from November 2006 to February 2014. He led the company’s succession in management and name to Kate Spade & Company, after successfully completing an extensive turnaround of the company. Mr. McComb also previously served in various management positions of Johnson & Johnson, including company group chairman.\nMr. McComb is currently an advisor to Bain & Company’s digital consulting practice. He serves on the boards of the Center for Business Analytics at the University of Virginia’s McIntire School of Business, and The Marshall Project, a NYC based non-profit, where he chairs the nominating and governance committee. He formerly served on the boards of the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the National Retail Federation, among others. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Miami University (Ohio) and a Masters of Business Administration in Marketing and Finance from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.\nThis appointment coincides with the resignation of John G. Perenchio. Mr. Perenchio has served as a member of the Deckers Board since 2005 and was serving on the Board’s Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee. “On behalf of our management team and the Board, I'd like to thank John for his service to Deckers Brands,” continued Mr. Gibbons. “We are grateful for his contributions to our organization over the past twelve years and we wish him the best of luck in all of his future endeavors.”\nAs previously announced, Deckers remains committed to identifying at least two new independent directors in advance of its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. McComb represents the first new independent director appointed to the Board as part of this ongoing process.\nAbout Deckers Brands\nDeckers Brands is a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high performance activities.
