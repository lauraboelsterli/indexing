    "text": "THOMASVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (Nasdaq: ODFL) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, payable on June 20, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2018.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock through June 2020. This new repurchase program will commence upon the expiration of the previously authorized two-year repurchase program announced on May 23, 2016.\nGreg C. Gantt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion, commented, “We are pleased with the Board’s authorization of this new stock repurchase program, which is integral to our capital allocation strategy and reflects our commitment to building long-term shareholder value. Old Dominion’s strong balance sheet and cash flow have enabled us to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly cash dividend, while at the same time continuing to strategically invest in the long-term growth of our business. We are proud that our effort to create shareholder value has produced a compound annual growth rate in our stock price of 29% over the past five years.”\nUnder the new repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company’s management team. The new repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nForward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements in this news release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
