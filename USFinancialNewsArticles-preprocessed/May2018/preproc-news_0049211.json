    "text": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Empire Industries Ltd. (TSX-V:EIL) today reported its unaudited consolidated financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The unaudited consolidated financial statements and MD&A have been filed on SEDAR and can be viewed at sedar.com or at empind.com .\n“We are getting back on track after a disappointing end to 2017,” stated Guy Nelson, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The steps we’ve taken to improve our operations have already begun to positively impact our results, and we expect that to accelerate throughout 2018 and beyond. Our recently announced private placement is scheduled to close in 2Q18. This will ensure we continue to have the financial depth to undertake the major projects we have underway.”\nSummary of first quarter 2018 consolidated results\nContract Backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $214 million, down 7% from $230 million at December 31, 2017. The Company expects its backlog to reach new record levels when the first two ride system contracts are executed under the previously announced strategic cooperation agreement with an Asian theme park owner. Revenues increased by $1.3 million (4%), to $33.7 million, from $32.4 million in 1Q17 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.6 million (52.3%), to $1.5 million from $3.1 million in 1Q17. Net loss increased by $1.0 million to $0.8 million from net income of $0.2 million in 1Q17.\nSummary of First Quarter 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31\n($ millions except share price and per share amounts) Q1\n2018 Q1\n2017 Revenue 33.7 32.4 Adjusted EBITDA ($) 1 1.5 3.1 Adjusted EBIT ($) 1 0.0 2.0 Net income (loss) from all operations (0.8 ) 0.2\nFinancial Position (at March 31, 2018 ) Total assets 95.5 75.3 Shareholders’ equity 20.1 20.3\nPer Share Information (Basic & Diluted) Income per share – basic & diluted (0.01 ) 0.02 1 Adjusted earnings (loss) before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is not defined by IFRS. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account the Company’s share of profit of an associate investment, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, fair value changes in foreign currency forward contracts and non-cash components of stock based compensation. Adjusted EBIT is the result of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and amortization expenses. While not IFRS measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT are used by management, creditors, analysts, investors and other financial stakeholders to assess the Company’s performance and management from a financial and operational perspective.\nAbout Empire Industries Ltd.\nEmpire focuses on designing, supplying, and installing premium theme park, media-based attractions and ride systems for the global entertainment industry.
