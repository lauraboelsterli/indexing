The group already published preliminary results on May 3.\nTALANX Q1 results due. Net profit seen down 5 percent at 227 million euros. Poll:\nZALANDO Zalando said it would launch a 50 million euro ($59 million) share buyback to cover its management stock option programmes.\nSTEINHOFF South African retailer Steinhoff said that an investigation by auditors PwC has found that the overstatement of its profits may result in additional material impairments, sending its shares more than 13 percent lower.\nNFON Shares in NFON due to start trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The issue price was set at 12 euros per share.\nANALYSTS’ VIEWS UNIPER - HSBC cuts to “reduce” from “hold”, cuts price target to 24 euros from 25 euros\nOVERSEAS STOCK MARKETS Dow Jones +0.8 pct, S&P 500 +0.9 pct, Nasdaq +0.9 pct at close.\nNikkei +1.0 pct, Shanghai stocks -0.1 pct.\nTime: 5.11 GMT.\nGERMAN ECONOMIC DATA No economic data scheduled.\nDIARIES REUTERS TOP NEWS ($1 = 1.2763 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Douglas Busvine and Maria Sheahan)\n ",
