    "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa., May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JetPay® Corporation (“JetPay” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:JTPY) announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nJetPay adopted the new accounting standards requirements of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606” or “ASC 606”), replacing ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . The Company adopted the requirements of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which required both the current and prior reporting periods to be presented under the same methodology. Accordingly, the March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017 financial statements and related disclosures within this press release and within our Form 10-Q are presented on an “As Adjusted” basis.\nThe adoption of ASC 606 had several significant impacts on JetPay financial statements and results, including:\nUnder ASC 606, the Company reflects revenues net of certain fees that the Company pays to third parties, including interchange, which is earned by the cardholder’s issuing bank, and dues and assessments, which are earned by the credit card associations. The Company previously reported some of these items as revenues and cost of revenues under previous standards. This change in presentation will have no effect on the reported amount of gross profit and operating income; however, the Company’s total revenues and cost of revenues 2017 is each lower by $5.2 million.\nUnder ASC 606, the timing of recognition of certain revenue streams, including Form W-2 and annual and quarterly tax filing revenues, has changed from when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to when a customer takes control of the goods or services. This change in the timing of revenue recognition resulted in an increase in revenues of $744,000 for the three months ended at March 31, 2017.\nUnder ASC 606, certain incremental direct costs of obtaining and fulfilling a contract, primarily inside commission costs, are deferred and recognized over the estimated terms of the Company’s customer relationships. This change in the timing of commission recognition resulted in a reduction of commission expenses of $148,000 2017.\nThe detailed impact of adopting ASC Topic 606 on revenues and financial results within the Payment Services Segment and the HR & Payroll Segment is more fully described in the chart below.\nRevenues, as reported under ASC 606, increased 9.5%, or $1.4 million, to $15.9 million 2018, as compared to $14.5 million for the same period in 2017. Under former ASC Topic 605, Revenues would have increased 13.8% 2018 versus the same period in 2017. Revenues within our Payment Services Segment increased 14.4% or $1.3 million, to $10.4 million 2018 as compared to $9.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nRevenues within our HR & Payroll Services Segment increased 1.1%, or $59,000, to $5.44 million 2018, as compared to $5.38 million in 2017. Under former ASC Topic 605, revenues in the HR & Payroll Segment would have increased 13.6% as ASC 606 changed the timing of revenue recognition of $744,000 of revenues from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 9.6% to $7.7 million, or 48.7% of revenues, 2018, up from $7.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) were $1.4 million and $2.2 million 2018 and 2017, respectively. EBITDA, adjusted for non-recurring and non-cash items (“adjusted EBITDA” - see Non-GAAP Financial Measures definition and reconciliation of operating income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA below), was $2.4 million, or 15.3% of revenues 2018, as compared to $2.5 million, or 17.3% of revenues, for the same period in 2017.\nThe ratio of total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt of $15.7 million and common stock subject to possible redemptions, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity totaling $62.3 million, was 20.1% at March 31, 2018, a slight improvement from 20.5% at December 31, 2017.\nNews Highlights\nEntered into a settlement agreement with Valley National Bank, settling JetPay Payment Services, TX, LLC’s (“JetPay Payments, TX”) litigation against Valley National Bank on April 30, 2018. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Valley National Bank paid JetPay Payments, TX $2,175,000.\nAnnounced a new facility which consolidates our Lehigh Valley, PA-based Human Resource, Payroll Processing, and Payroll Tax Service operations bringing together the approximate 140 area employees. The new location provides JetPay increased operating capacity to support the organizations growth plans and includes an expanded datacenter and production facility that offers increased speed and capabilities for delivering human capital management (HCM) and payroll processing.\nAnnounced a partnership with, Biz2Credit , the leading online resource for small business finance. Through this arrangement, JetPay customers will gain access to capital through Biz2Credit's small business lending marketplace which has arranged more than $2 billion in financing to thousands of small and mid-size companies over the last decade.\nAnnounced a new strategic partnership with Chargeback Gurus to offer businesses the combined services needed to improve risk management and overall payment processing services. Chargeback Gurus offers solutions that help merchants manage fraud as well as fight and recover chargebacks. The collection of more chargebacks allows merchants to minimize losses and increase their overall profitability.\n“JetPay’s performance in the first quarter of 2018 was strong and consistent with our first quarter revenue growth expectations. With our services to the State of Illinois continuing to roll out, the realization of new strategic partnerships, and the expansion of our JetX cash discount product, our Payments business continued its solid growth course,” stated Diane (Vogt) Faro, CEO of JetPay Corporation. “When combined with the record results in our HR & Payroll Segment, JetPay’s performance is improving each quarter. Our teams throughout the country are working hard to grow revenues while continuing to provide the first-class service our customers have come to expect,” Ms. Faro added.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017 (As Adjusted)\nRevenues were $15.9 million 2018, compared to $14.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues for the Payment Services Segment increased $1.3 million, or 14.4%, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was attributable to net revenue growth in our Government and Utilities, e-Commerce, and ISO/ISV sectors, including an increase in revenues in our JetX discount for cash product. Revenues for the HR & Payroll Services Segment increased by $59,000, or 1.1%, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The growth within the HR & Payroll Services Segment was negatively impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nOperating income 2018, was $288,000, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2017. Operating income includes depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million and $1.1 million 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increasing by $1.1 million in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily related to a $450,000 legal settlement, an increase in professional fees for non-repetitive matters of $293,000, and the net impact of adopting ASC Topic 606 which increased operating income by $848,000 in the first quarter of 2017. This year-over-year decrease in operating income is partially offset by a favorable $111,000 change in fair value of contingent consideration liability.\nNet loss 2018, was $(371,000) or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(3.3) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $2.9 million, compared to net income of approximately $681,000 or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(1.4) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $2.1 million for the same period in 2017. The positive net income in 2017 before the accretion of convertible preferred stock was due primarily to the shift of $848,000 of operating income from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017 under the new standards of ASC 606.\nConference Call\nJetPay will conduct a conference call on Thursday, May 17, 2018 at 9:00 AM EST (6:00 AM PST) to discuss these results and conduct a question and answer session.

The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with financial measures it uses in the management of its business. The Company defines EBITDA as operating income (loss), before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and non-cash changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as defined above, plus certain non-recurring items, including certain legal and professional costs for non-repetitive matters, legal settlement costs, non-cash stock option costs, and non-cash losses on the disposal of fixed assets. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as indicators of the Company’s operating performance and ability to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments and, in the absence of refinancing options, to repay debt obligations. Management believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because non-cash costs and other items that management believes are not indicative of its results of operations are excluded. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP measures, which have limitations as an analytical tool. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, may differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. For a description of our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), see the section of this press release titled “EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation.”\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation (Unaudited)\n(000’s omitted) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n2017 (As Adjusted) Operating income $ 288 $ 1,070 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability (37 ) 74 Amortization of intangibles 848 874 Depreciation 313 231 EBITDA $ 1,412 $ 2,249 Professional fees for non-repetitive matters 367 74 Legal settlement costs 450 - Non-cash stock based compensation 195 184 Non-cash loss on disposal of fixed asset 8 - Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,432 $ 2,507\nImpact of the Adoption of ASC Topic 606 (Unaudited)\n(000’s omitted) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\nRevenues Adjusted EBITDA Revenues Adjusted EBITDA Payment Services Segment Previously Reported under ASC 605 $ 16,282 $ 2,044 $ 14,303 $ 1,765 Change in Presentation of Interchange and Card Brand Fees (5,852 ) - (5,188 ) - Deferral of Commissions - 64 - 81 As Adjusted under ASC 606 $ 10,430 $ 2,108 $ 9,115 $ 1,846 HR & Payroll Services Segment Previously Reported under ASC 605 $ 5,267 $ 1,402 $ 4,638 $ 1,009 Change in Timing of Revenue Recognition & Associated Costs 174 174 744 700 Deferral of Commissions - 59 - 67 As Adjusted under ASC 606 $ 5,441 $ 1,635 $ 5,382 $ 1,776\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “ ” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
