    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (NYSE: TPX) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company also reaffirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nTotal net sales decreased 10.3% to $648.0 million from $722.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Chairman and CEO Scott Thompson commented, \"Over the last twelve months, the team has made considerable progress towards resetting the foundation of our Company. We have enhanced our relationships with a diversified base of retail partners, we have expanded our owned store footprint and online presence, we are in the process of meaningfully enhancing our product portfolio, and we continue to be laser-focused on shareholder value. Our flexible operating model and productivity initiatives were on full display in the first quarter, as we maintained our gross margins despite planned sales declines after the termination with our largest account last year and cost pressures from commodities. With a new suite of bedding products and an intense focus on execution, Tempur Sealy is well positioned to increase earnings and create long-term shareholder value.\"\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nThe Company's business segments include North America and International. Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the business segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results.\nNorth America net sales decreased to $485.0 million from $582.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by the Mattress Firm termination. On a constant currency basis (1) , North America net sales decreased 17.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017. GAAP gross margin was 37.9% as compared to 36.8% in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP operating margin was 11.1% as compared to 8.8% in the first quarter of 2017.\nAt the beginning of the second quarter of 2017, the Company terminated its contracts with Mattress Firm, a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. In the first quarter of 2017, net sales to Mattress Firm were $94.5 million. Excluding Mattress Firm sales in the prior year, North America net sales were flat in the first quarter of 2018.\nNorth America net sales through the wholesale channel decreased to $454.0 million. North America net sales through the direct channel increased $6.9 million, or 28.6%, to $31.0 million, primarily driven by growth from expanded retail stores and increased web sales, as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nNorth America gross margin declined 90 basis points as compared to adjusted gross margin (1) for the first quarter of 2017. The decline was driven primarily by commodity cost inflation, fixed cost deleverage on lower unit volume and unfavorable brand mix. These were partially offset by improved channel mix, operational improvements and favorable product mix. North America operating margin declined 330 basis points as compared to adjusted operating margin (1) for the first quarter of 2017. The decline in adjusted operating margin was driven by operating expense deleverage and the decline in gross margin. The Company implemented a price increase in March 2018 to partially offset the expected commodity inflation.\nInternational net sales increased 16.6% to $163.0 million from $139.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a constant currency basis (1) , International net sales increased 8.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 51.5% as compared to 51.6% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating margin was 16.5% as compared to 18.5% in the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational net sales through the wholesale channel increased $20.1 million or 17.6% to $134.2 million and sales through the direct channel increased $3.1 million or 12.1% to $28.8 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational gross margin declined 10 basis points as compared to adjusted gross margin (1) for the first quarter of 2017. International operating margin declined 260 basis points as compared to adjusted operating margin (1) for the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by unfavorable operating expense leverage from significant investments in advertising, as well as the change in classification of royalty income due to the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance.\nCorporate GAAP operating expense increased to $27.0 million from $17.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a benefit of $9.3 million related to a change in estimate for performance-based stock compensation. Corporate operating expense increased to $27.0 million as compared to adjusted operating expense (1) of $25.1 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company reported $34.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.8 billion in total debt, as compared to $41.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.8 billion in total debt as of December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe Company reaffirmed today its financial guidance for 2018. For the full year 2018, the Company currently expects adjusted EBITDA (1) to range from $450 million to $500 million.\nThe Company noted its expectations are based on information available at the time of this release, and are subject to changing conditions, many of which are outside the Company's control.\nThe Company also noted that its 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability. The Company further noted that it is unable to reconcile this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP net income, its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure, without unreasonable efforts, because the Company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP net income in 2018 but would not impact adjusted EBITDA. These items that impact comparability may include restructuring activities, foreign currency exchange rates, income taxes (including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company's full year 2018 GAAP financial results.\nRecent Changes to Revenue Recognition Accounting Standards\nDue to a new revenue recognition standard adopted on January 1, 2018, the Company changed the classification of royalty income from a component of operating income to revenue. In the first quarter of 2018, this accounting standard adoption increased North America wholesale net sales by approximately $2 million and increased International wholesale net sales by approximately $3 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year. There is no impact to reported operating income, net income, or EBITDA arising from this change in classification. Although these earnings measures did not change, net sales increased compared to the same period in the prior year and gross margin and operating margin were negatively impacted by this change in accounting standard. This will continue to impact the Company's results and their comparability to the prior year period, in each quarter of 2018.\nConference Call Information\nTempur Sealy International, Inc. will host a live conference call to discuss financial results today, May 3, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n(in millions, except percentages, ratios and per common share amounts)\nThe Company provides information regarding adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income (expense), adjusted operating margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated funded debt and consolidated funded debt less qualified cash, and free cash flow, which are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income and earnings per share as a measure of operating performance or an alternative to total debt. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with performance measures that better reflect the Company's underlying operations and trends, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income and operating income. The adjustments management makes to derive the non-GAAP measures include adjustments to exclude items that may cause short-term fluctuations in the nearest GAAP measure, but which management does not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of the Company's business, including the exclusion of charges associated with the Mattress Firm termination in the first quarter of 2017 and other costs.\nThe Company believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying results from continuing operations and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage the Company's business, to evaluate its consolidated and business segment performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, to establish operational goals and to provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP and these non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable measures defined by GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For more information about these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure, please refer to the reconciliations on the following pages.\nConstant Currency Information\nIn this press release the Company refers to, and in other press releases and other communications with investors the Company may refer to, net sales or earnings or other historical financial information on a \"constant currency basis,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These references to constant currency basis do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. To provide information on a constant currency basis, the applicable financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior corresponding period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS\nA reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a calculation of adjusted EPS are provided below.

Cost of sales included $11.5 million of charges related to the write-off of customer-unique inventory and product obligations. Operating expenses included $14.4 million of net charges, which included a write-off of $17.2 million for customer incentives and marketing assets, $5.8 million of employee-related costs and $0.7 million of professional fees. These charges were offset by $9.3 million of benefit related to the change in estimate associated with performance-based stock compensation that was no longer probable of payout following the Mattress Firm termination.\n(2)\nTax adjustments represent adjustments associated with the aforementioned items and other discrete income tax events.\n(3)\nAdjustments for the North America business segment included $32.4 million of costs related to the Mattress Firm termination. Cost of sales included $11.5 million of charges related to the write-off of customer-unique inventory and product obligations. Operating expenses included $20.9 million of charges, which included a write-off of $17.2 million for customer incentives and marketing assets, and $3.7 million of employee-related costs and professional fees.\n(4)\nAdjustments for the International business segment represent certain employee-related expenses.\n(5)\nAdjustments for Corporate represent costs related to the Mattress Firm termination. The Company recorded $9.3 million of benefit related to the change in estimate associated with performance-based stock compensation that was no longer probable of payout, $0.9 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense and $1.1 million of other employee-related expenses and professional fees.\n(6)\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes $34.3 million of charges related to the termination of the relationship with Mattress Firm. This amount represents the $25.9 million of net charges discussed in Footnote 1 above, and adds the net amortization impact of $8.4 million of stock-based compensation benefit incurred in the first quarter of 2017.\n(7)\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company recorded a total of $9.1 million of non-interest related charges associated with a Latin American subsidiary. Operating income includes $5.1 million of restructuring charges, which relate to the wind down of certain operations, leadership termination charges and professional fees, as well as $3.8 million of non-income tax charges. Other expense, net includes $0.2 million of other charges.\n(8)\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company incurred a total of $3.4 million in other costs. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $3.0 million in charges for hurricane-related costs and a customer's bankruptcy. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred $0.4 million in costs associated with an early lease termination.\n(9)\nThe Company presents deferred financing costs as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For purposes of determining total debt for financial covenant purposes, the Company has added these costs back to total debt, net as calculated in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(10)\nQualified cash as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement equals 100.0% of unrestricted domestic cash plus 60.0% of unrestricted foreign cash. For purposes of calculating leverage ratios, qualified cash is capped at $150.0 million.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tempur-sealy-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641594.html\nSOURCE Tempur Sealy International, Inc.",
