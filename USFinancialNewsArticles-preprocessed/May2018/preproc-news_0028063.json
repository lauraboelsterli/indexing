    "text": "May 11, 2018 / 4:07 PM / a few seconds ago Sri Lanka name four uncapped players for Windies tour Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Sri Lanka opening batsman Mahela Udawatte has been called into a 17-man test squad for next month’s tour to West Indies, along with three other uncapped players, Kasun Rajitha, Jeffrey Vandersay and Asitha Fernando.\nThe 31-year-old Udawatte will hope to get his first opportunity in the longest format, more than 10 years after his one-day international debut in West Indies.\nRegular opener Dimuth Karunaratne remains on the sidelines with a fractured finger, and fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Pradeep are out with back and hamstring issues respectively.\nThe national selectors have also included senior players Angelo Mathews and Suranga Lakmal but their participation in the tour is subject to fitness.\n“Mathews and Lakmal are not unfit as such,” Sri Lanka’s chief selector Graeme Labrooy told ESPNcricinfo.\n“In fact they are fit, but we wanted to see if they were match-fit. The team is at a training camp in Pallekele, so we’ll give them until May 14 before we make a final decision on those two players.”\nThe first of three tests begins on June 6 at Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain.\nFull squad:\nDinesh Chandimal (captain), Mahela Udawatte, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Janith Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lahiru Gamage, Kasun Rajitha, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Asitha Fernando.
