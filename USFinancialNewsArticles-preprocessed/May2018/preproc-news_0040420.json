    "text": "ROME, May 17 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia (TIM) has asked the Italian government to approve a temporary layoff scheme for 4,000 workers as part of the new 2018-20 business plan the telecoms group unveiled in March, a source close to the matter said on Thursday.\nTIM had no immediate comment.\nUnder the state-sponsored scheme, workers remain at home for a certain period of time as the company adjusts to lower market demand, but are not laid off.\nReporting by Alberto Sisto, writing by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Valentina Za\n ",
