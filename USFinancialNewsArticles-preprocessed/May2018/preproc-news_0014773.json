    "text": "May 6, 2018 / 8:47 PM / Updated 6 hours ago Merkel allies reject idea of European finance minister - Handelsblatt Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Leading politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives want to pass a resolution at a meeting this week to reject any pooling of debts in Europe and any fiscal policy without national parliamentary controls, Handelsblatt reported. German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Darmstadt, Germany, May 3 ,2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe daily business newspaper, citing sources from the conservative bloc’s parliamentary leadership, said the senior politicians also oppose European Commission plans for a European finance minister.\nThe group includes the parliamentary leaders of the conservative bloc in the Bundestag, the European Parliament as well as from Germany’s 16 states, Handelsblatt reported.\nMerkel will join them on Monday for a meeting in Frankfurt.\nThe report highlights the resistance among Merkel’s conservatives to any euro zone reforms that could see more German taxpayers’ money being used to fund other member states.\nThe conservatives are nervous about European Union reform after bleeding support to the anti-euro Alternative for Germany (AfD) party at national elections last September.\nLast month, Merkel called for a spirit of compromise on reforming the euro zone at a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, who pressed for solidarity among members of the currency union.
