Adjusted diluted EPS, for the purpose of reported results, excludes the impact of the foregoing as well as expenses relating to challenges to the Company’s business model, and expenses relating to FTC Consent Order implementation. See Schedule A – “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a detailed reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS to diluted EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of why we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006383/en/\nHerbalife Nutrition Ltd.\nMedia Contact:\nJennifer Butler\nVP, Media Relations\n213.745.0420\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nEric Monroe\nDirector, Investor Relations\n213.745.0449\nSource: Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.",
