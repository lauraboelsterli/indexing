    "text": "POMPANO BEACH, Fla., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, CentralReach, the premier provider of electronic health record and practice management software for clinics focused on applied behavioral analysis (ABA), speech therapy, and occupational therapy (OT) is pleased to announce that it has closed the acquisition of Chartlytics, the leading real-time behavior change analytics software provider. CentralReach, backed by Insight Venture Partners, will combine its cloud-based practice management and clinical data collection software with Chartlytics' best-in-class precision data measurement and advanced analytics technology, bringing the power of the combined offering to its over 40,000 therapist and educator users.\n\"We couldn't be happier to welcome Chartlytics to the CentralReach family,\" said Charlotte Fudge, CentralReach's founder. \"Just this past month alone, the CDC reported higher autism prevalence rates that increased from an estimated 1 in 68 children in 2016 to now 1 in 59 in 2018. By adding Chartlytics to the market-leading CentralReach product portfolio, we will continue to support the growing need from our users for advanced clinical analytics and precision treatment.\"\nBy joining forces, CentralReach and Chartlytics will lead the ABA, speech therapy, and OT markets on their journey to adopt next-generation clinical research and assessment technology, including sophisticated data collection, goal graphing, client session notes, and now – with Chartlytics – precision behavior measurement, an information-rich visual display, and real-time decision-making to accelerate learning outcomes. All of this functionality complements CentralReach's scheduling, payroll, billing, claims processing, and content marketplace offerings.\n\"This acquisition is a pivotal moment in the history of precision behavior measurement,\" said David Stevens, co-founder of Chartlytics. \"Increasing the quality of decision making for CentralReach therapists and educators is truly meaningful since it will help learners, many of them children on the spectrum, to thrive.\"\n\"CentralReach already was the scale leader with the most advanced technology in the ABA, speech therapy, and OT segments,\" said Lonne Jaffe, Managing Director at Insight Venture Partners. \"We expect the CentralReach acquisition of Chartlytics to accelerate the industry's adoption of advanced analytics capabilities, augmenting and empowering the best clinicians in the industry with data and insights, and dramatically improving quality of care.\"\nFor more information on CentralReach and its services, please visit: https://centralreach.com/\nFor more on Chartlytics and its software capabilities, please visit: https://www.chartlytics.com/\nAbout CentralReach\nCentralReach is the leading EHR and practice management solution for clinicians focused on applied behavior analysis, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and PK-12 education.
