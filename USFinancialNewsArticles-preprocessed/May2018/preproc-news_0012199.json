    "text": "First Quarter Revenue Increased 34% Year-over-Year\nBURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Everbridge , Inc. (NASDAQ: EVBG), the global leader in critical event management and incident response automation, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our first quarter results exceeded our guidance ranges for revenue and profitability,” said Jaime Ellertson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Everbridge. “This strong performance was driven by the continued global adoption of Everbridge Mass Notification, the growing number and size of multi-product deals, highlighted by upgrades to our Critical Event Management platform, and continued success leveraging our global partner network.”\nEllertson continued, “We completed our acquisition of UMS in early April, significantly expanding our global footprint and bringing us capabilities to serve entire countries. We are optimistic that our growing product portfolio and broadening geographic reach will further enable us to extend our market leadership as we pursue the multi-billion-dollar opportunity ahead of us.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue was $30.5 million, an increase of 34% compared to $22.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP operating loss was $(10.9) million, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $(6.2) million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating loss was $(3.4) million, compared to non-GAAP operating loss of $(4.0) million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating loss excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. GAAP net loss was $(12.3) million, compared to $(6.2) million for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss per share was $(0.43), based on 28.4 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to $(0.23) for the first quarter of 2017, based on 27.2 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss was $(4.8) million, compared to $(4.0) million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $(0.17), based on 28.4 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to $(0.15) for the first quarter of 2017, based on 27.2 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $(1.8) million, compared to a loss of $(2.3) million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss before interest income and interest expense, income tax expense and benefit, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Cash flow from operations was $7.5 million compared to $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow was $5.3 million compared to an outflow of $(0.3) million for the first quarter of 2017.

We use these non-GAAP measures for financial, operational and budgetary decision-making purposes, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, and to generate future operating plans. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding past and future prospects, and permit us to more thoroughly analyze key financial metrics used to make operational decisions. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nWe do not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which are included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \" \" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding the anticipated opportunity and trends for growth in our critical communications and enterprise safety applications and our overall business, our market opportunity, our expectations regarding sales of our products, our goal to maintain market leadership and extend the markets in which we compete for customers, and our expected financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and the full fiscal year 2018.
