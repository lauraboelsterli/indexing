Commuter train services would not be affected in the event of a strike by Teamster members.\nThe labor strife comes at a time of tighter rail capacity in Canada, with CP and rival Canadian National Railway facing strong demand for shipments of grain, potash and other commodities.\nThe union members are committed to working with federal mediators to reach negotiated settlement and are willing to remain at the bargaining table until the May 29 strike deadline and beyond, the statement added.\nThe workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, are asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands.
