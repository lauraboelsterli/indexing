    "text": "DALLAS, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- InfraREIT, Inc. (NYSE: HIFR) (\"InfraREIT\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018 and provided the Company's financial outlook.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, InfraREIT reported the following highlights:\nNet income was $17.8 million Net income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. common stockholders per share (\"EPS\") was $0.29 per share Non-GAAP earnings per share (\"Non-GAAP EPS\") was $0.29 per share Funds from operations (\"FFO\") was $29.3 million and FFO on an adjusted basis (\"AFFO\") was $28.6 million Quarterly dividend declared of $0.25 per share of common stock, $1.00 per share annualized\nReaffirmed Guidance:\n2018 EPS range of $1.29 to $1.39 2018 Non-GAAP EPS range of $1.22 to $1.32 Expect to maintain the Company's quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, or $1.00 per share annualized through 2018 Earnings and dividend guidance assumes the existing lease payments continue as scheduled and that InfraREIT maintains its real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") status throughout 2018 Footprint capital expenditures range of $70 million to $180 million for the period of 2018 through 2020\nRecent events:\nInfraREIT's Board of Directors completed its initial review of the Company's REIT status and directed management to pursue an alternative structure that would involve, among other things, InfraREIT terminating its REIT status and opting for a traditional C-corporation structure (\"De-REIT alternative\"). Any De-REIT alternative could involve negotiations with Hunt Consolidated, Inc. (\"HCI\") and its affiliates (collectively, \"Hunt\") regarding the arrangements currently in place between the Company and Hunt and may require certain regulatory approvals. The Board of Directors has not set a specific timeline for evaluating and selecting a De-REIT alternative. In tandem with the Board's evaluation of a De-REIT alternative, the Conflicts Committee will continue to monitor HCI's Schedule 13D filings regarding Hunt's intentions with respect to the Company.\n\"Our pursuit of a De-REIT alternative does not change our core strategy,\" said David A. Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of InfraREIT. \"We are committed to operating and expanding our franchise as a transmission-focused utility, supporting load growth in West Texas and the expansion of renewables in the Panhandle. We advanced our strategy in the first quarter with two important milestones. Sharyland successfully energized the final line segment of our second circuit, expanding the generation export capacity from the Panhandle and allowing more low-cost, emissions-free wind generation to reach the broader ERCOT market. Also, we placed into service the first synchronous condensers within the ERCOT system, at the Alibates and Tule Canyon stations. These condensers enhance grid stability and export capacity of the transmission system in the Panhandle,\" added Campbell.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nLease revenue, consisting of only base rent, increased 15 percent to $45.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $39.6 million for the same period in 2017. There was no percentage rent recognized during the first quarter of 2018 or 2017 as Sharyland Utilities, L.P.'s (\"Sharyland\") year-to-date adjusted gross revenue did not exceed the annual specified breakpoints under the Company's leases. The Company anticipates that little to no percentage rent will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year, with the largest amounts of percentage rent recognized in the third and fourth quarters of each year.\nNet income was $17.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $11.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. common stockholders was $0.29 per share during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.18 per share during the same period in 2017. The $6.8 million increase in net income is a result of a $6.1 million increase in lease revenue, $1.1 million decrease in depreciation expense and $0.7 million increase in other income, net partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest expense, net.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $0.29 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 45 percent. The drivers of growth in Non-GAAP EPS were the same as the drivers of the increase in net income. FFO was $29.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $23.7 million for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of $5.6 million resulting mainly from the increase in lease revenue. For the first quarter of 2018, AFFO was $28.6 million, compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of 16 percent.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $1.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $289.5 million of unused capacity under its revolving credit facilities.\nOutlook and Guidance\nEPS is projected in the range of $1.29 to $1.39 for 2018. Non-GAAP EPS is estimated in the range of $1.22 to $1.32 for 2018. The difference between Non-GAAP EPS and EPS is due to adjustments related to straight-line rent and expenses associated with the asset exchange transaction completed in November of 2017 (\"Asset Exchange Transaction\"). InfraREIT expects to maintain the Company's current quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, or $1.00 per share annualized, through 2018. These forecasted amounts assume that InfraREIT maintains its REIT status throughout 2018 and that the existing lease payments are made by Sharyland as scheduled during 2018.\nThe Company estimates footprint capital expenditures in the following ranges over the next three years: $50 million to $80 million for 2018; $10 million to $50 million for 2019; and $10 million to $50 million for 2020.\nThe Company's consolidated debt profile continues to target debt as a percentage of total capitalization at or below 60 percent and AFFO-to-debt of at least 12 percent.\nThe guidance provided above constitutes forward-looking statements, which are based on current economic conditions and estimates, and the Company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting or unusual items. Supplemental information relating to the Company's financial outlook is posted in the Investor Relations section of the Company's Web site at www.InfraREITInc.com .\nCompany Structure Review\nInfraREIT's Board of Directors completed its initial review of the Company's REIT status and directed management to pursue a De-REIT alternative. Hunt has informed the Company that it agrees with the Board's direction.\nAny De-REIT alternative could involve one or more of the following: combining Sharyland with Sharyland Distribution & Transmission Services, L.L.C. (\"SDTS\"), terminating the leases between SDTS and Sharyland, terminating the Company's operating partnership, and/or other negotiations with Hunt, including terminating or renegotiating the Company's management agreement and development agreement, and engaging in related negotiations. InfraREIT intends to explore various De-REIT options and has not yet determined to pursue a specific form of De-REIT alternative. There is no specific timeline set for completing the evaluation of a De-REIT alternative and there can be no assurance that any De-REIT alternative will be executed. The Company expects to continue operating as a REIT until the execution of a De-REIT alternative, if any.\nCommunications from Hunt Consolidated, Inc.\nOn January 16, 2018, InfraREIT's shareholder, HCI, filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's Conflicts Committee intends to consider any proposal from HCI; however, at this time, no offer has been made to InfraREIT.\nDividends and Distributions\nOn February 27, 2018, InfraREIT's Board of Directors declared cash distributions and dividends of $0.25 per unit and share, respectively, to unitholders and stockholders of record on March 29, 2018, which were paid on April 19, 2018.\nAnnual Stockholders Meeting\nInfraREIT's Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. U.S. Central Time, at the Fairmont Dallas Hotel, 1717 North Akard Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. The Board of Directors established Monday, March 12, 2018, as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy.\nHunt Project Quarterly Updates\nInfraREIT's quarterly \"Hunt Project Updates\" can be found on the Company's Web site ( www.InfraREITInc.com ) under the \"Hunt Transmission-Our Developer\" and \"Investor Relations\" sections and in the \"Q1 2018 Results & Supplemental Information\" presentation posted on the Company's Web site.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAs previously announced, management will host a teleconference call on May 3, 2018, at 10 a.m. U.S. Central Time (11 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time). David A. Campbell, Chief Executive Officer, and Brant Meleski, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss InfraREIT's results and financial outlook.\nInvestors and analysts are invited to participate in the call by phone at 1-855-560-2576, or internationally at 1-412-542-4162 (access code: 10118251) or via the Internet at www.InfraREITInc.com . A replay of the call will be available on the Company's Web site or by phone at 1-877-344-7529, or internationally at 1-412-317-0088 (access code: 10118251), for a seven-day period following the call.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains certain financial measures that are not recognized under generally accepted principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In particular, InfraREIT uses Non-GAAP EPS, FFO and AFFO as important supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. InfraREIT is no longer including cash available for distribution (\"CAD\"); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"); and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company presents non-GAAP performance measures because management believes they help investors understand InfraREIT's business, performance and ability to earn and distribute cash to its stockholders by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income. Reporting on these measures in InfraREIT's public disclosures also ensures that this information is available to all of InfraREIT's investors. The non-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nInfraREIT offers these measurers to assist users in assessing the Company's operating performance under GAAP, but these measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered measures of liquidity, alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including capital expenditures, make payments on the Company's indebtedness or make distributions. In addition, InfraREIT's method of calculating these measures may be different from methods used by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income, cash flows from operating activities or revenues. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the Schedules to this press release.\nAbout InfraREIT, Inc.\nInfraREIT is a real estate investment trust that is engaged in owning and leasing rate-regulated electric transmission assets in the state of Texas. The Company is externally managed by Hunt Utility Services, LLC, an affiliate of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. (a diversified holding company based in Dallas, Texas, and managed by the Ray L. Hunt family). The Company's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"HIFR.\" Additional information on InfraREIT is available at www.InfraREITInc.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The Company defines Non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted average shares outstanding calculated in the manner described in the footnotes below.\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. per diluted share to Non-GAAP EPS:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\n(In thousands, except per share amounts, unaudited)\nAmount\nPer Share (3)\nAmount\nPer Share (3)\nNet income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc.\n$\n12,864\n$\n0.29\n$\n7,949\n$\n0.18\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n4,900\n0.29\n3,068\n0.18\nNet income\n17,764\n0.29\n11,017\n0.18\nBase rent adjustment (1)\n(120)\n—\n957\n0.02\nTransaction costs (2)\n151\n—\n—\n—\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n17,795\n$\n0.29\n$\n11,974\n$\n0.20\n(1)\nThis adjustment relates to the difference between the timing of cash base rent payments made under the Company's leases and when the Company recognizes base rent revenue under GAAP. The Company recognizes base rent on a straight-line basis over the applicable term of the lease commencing when the related assets are placed in service, which is frequently different than the period in which the cash base rent becomes due.\n(2)\nThis adjustment reflects the transaction costs related to the Asset Exchange Transaction. These costs are exclusive of the Company's routine business operations or typical rate case costs and have been excluded to present additional insights on InfraREIT's core operations.\n(3)\nThe weighted average common shares outstanding of 43.8 million was used to calculate net income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. per diluted share. The weighted average redeemable partnership units outstanding of 16.9 million was used to calculate net income attributable to noncontrolling interest per share. The combination of the weighted average common shares and redeemable partnership units outstanding of 60.7 million was used for the remainder of the per share calculations.\nSchedule 2\nInfraREIT, Inc.\nExplanation and Reconciliation of FFO and AFFO\nFFO and AFFO\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains and losses from sales of property (net) and impairments of depreciated real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Applying the NAREIT definition to the Company's consolidated financial statements, which is the basis for the FFO presented in this press release and the reconciliations below, results in FFO representing net income (loss) before depreciation, impairment of assets and gain (loss) on sale of assets. FFO does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by GAAP and it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs, including distributions.\nAFFO is defined as FFO adjusted in a manner the Company believes is appropriate to show its core operational performance, including: (a) an adjustment for the difference between the amount of base rent payments that the Company receives with respect to the applicable period and the amount of straight-line base rent recognized under GAAP; (b) adding back the transaction costs related to the Asset Exchange Transaction; and (c) adjusting for other income (expense), net.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to FFO and AFFO:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n17,764\n$\n11,017\nDepreciation\n11,577\n12,687\nFFO\n29,341\n23,704\nBase rent adjustment (1)\n(120)\n957\nOther income, net (2)\n(733)\n(3)\nTransaction costs (3)\n151\n—\nAFFO\n$\n28,639\n$\n24,658\n(1)\nSee footnote (1) on Schedule 1 on Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP EPS\n(2)\nIncludes allowance for funds used during construction (\"AFUDC\") on other funds of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. There was no AFUDC on other funds recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n(3)\nSee footnote (2) on Schedule 1 on Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP EPS\nSchedule 3\nInfraREIT, Inc.\nExplanation and Reconciliation of Forecasted Guidance for 2018\nForecasted GAAP Net Income Attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. Per Share to Non-GAAP EPS\nThe Company provides yearly guidance for Non-GAAP EPS, which is one of the supplemental financial measures it uses in evaluating the Company's operating performance. The Company believes that Non-GAAP EPS helps the Company and investors better understand the Company's business and performance by providing perspectives not immediately apparent from net income.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of the forecasted GAAP net income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc. per share to Non-GAAP EPS for the year ending December 31, 2018:\nFull Year 2018\n(Per share amounts, unaudited)\nLow\nHigh\nNet income attributable to InfraREIT, Inc.\n$\n1.29\n$\n1.39\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n1.29\n1.39\nNet income\n1.29\n1.39\nBase rent adjustment\n(0.08)\n(0.08)\nTransaction costs\n0.01\n0.01\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$\n1.22\n$\n1.32\nFor additional information, contact:\nFor Investors:\nBrook Wootton\nVice President, Investor Relations\nInfraREIT, Inc.\n214-855-6748\nFor Media:\nJeanne Phillips\nSenior Vice President, Corporate Affairs & International Relations\nHunt Consolidated, Inc.\n214-978-8534\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infrareit-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300641630.html\nSOURCE InfraREIT, Inc.",
