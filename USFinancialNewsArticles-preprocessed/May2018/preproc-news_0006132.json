    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO) announced today that it priced $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"Notes\") in a private offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The Notes were priced to investors at 100.000% of their principal amount and are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.\nFICO intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay certain indebtedness outstanding under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility, including, but not limited to, indebtedness borrowed under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility drawn to repay all of our outstanding 7.18% Series D Senior Notes due 2018 at maturity.\nFICO expects to close on the sale of the Notes on May 8, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes are being sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States, to non-U.S. persons in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor shall there be any sales of the notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. This press release is being issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, Rule 135(c) under the Securities Act.\nStatement Concerning Forward-Looking Information\nExcept for historical information contained herein, the statements contained in this news release that relate to FICO or its business are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
