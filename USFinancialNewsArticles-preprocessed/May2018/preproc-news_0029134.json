    "text": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain’s Serica Energy said it is looking into how renewed sanctions on Iran would impact a British gas field which it operates in partnership with the Iranian Oil Company (UK) Limited.\nThe United States plans to impose new unilateral sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would abandon an agreement with Iran, which limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for removing joint U.S.-Europe sanctions.\nSerica said it was evaluating the implications of Trump’s statements on the Rhum field in Britain’s North Sea, in which the Iranian Oil Company (UK) has a 50 percent share.\n“We will update the market, as appropriate, in due course,” Serica said in a statement on Wednesday.\nSerica bought its stake in the Rhum field from BP last year.
