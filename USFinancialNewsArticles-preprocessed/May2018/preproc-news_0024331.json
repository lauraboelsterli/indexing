    "text": "Net Revenue Increased 13.1% from the Prior Year Period\nExcluding the Chicago Bakery, Net Revenue Increased 5.2%\nChicago Bakery Transformation Underway\nReaffirms Full Year 2018 Outlook\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hostess Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWNK) (NASDAQ: TWNKW) (“Hostess” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary 1 :\nNet revenue increased 13.1%; excluding the Chicago Bakery 2 , net revenue increased 5.2%. The Chicago Bakery, acquired on February 1, 2018, contributed $14.5 million of net revenue. Point of sale increased 6.3% for the 12-week period ended March 24, 2018. Point of sale for the top seven sub-brands increased 8.5%. These sub-brands represent 69.1% of the Company’s net revenue. The Hostess® brand's market share for the 12-week period ended March 24, 2018 was 17.9%, up 124 basis points. This represents a record market share for the brand since its re-launch in 2013. Net income was $29.3 million (including a one-time gain of $12.4 million related to the buyout of a portion of the tax receivable agreement) compared to $24.2 million. Diluted EPS was $0.23 per share compared to $0.15 per share. Adjusted EPS was $0.14 per share compared to $0.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.0 million, or 22.5% of net revenue, compared to $54.5 million or 29.5% or net revenue. Cash and cash equivalents of $100.5 million as of March 31, 2018 with a leverage ratio of 4.00x, both driven by operating cash flows of $38.3 million.\n“We are pleased with our sales momentum and strong start to 2018,” commented Dean Metropoulos, Executive Chairman of Hostess. “Our Chicago Bakery transformation is well underway, which we believe will provide significant opportunities for revenue growth within the Breakfast subcategory and be accretive to our future earnings. We continue to introduce new innovative items that have expanded the Hostess® brand market share and continue to expect to grow well above the category average in 2018 and beyond.”\n1 This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income attributed to Class A stockholders, adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the schedules in the press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measure. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are to the first quarter of 2017.\n2 On February 1, 2018, the Company acquired certain breakfast-related assets from Aryzta, LLC. These assets included the Chicago Cloverhill bakery facility, the related inventory, and the Big Texas® and Cloverhill® brands. Throughout this press release, these assets are referred to collectively as the “Chicago Bakery.” First Quarter 2018 (Comparisons to the First Quarter of 2017)\nNet revenue was $208.7 million, an increase of 13.1%, or $24.2 million, compared to $184.5 million. The Chicago Bakery, which the Company acquired during the quarter to expand its breakfast product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities, contributed $14.5 million of net revenue. Excluding the Chicago Bakery, net revenue increased 5.2%, driven by the continued momentum from the Company’s 2017 product innovations.\nGross profit was $71.2 million, or 34.1% of net revenue, compared to $79.3 million, or 43.0% of net revenue. The decline was primarily attributed to $4.3 million in negative gross profit from the Chicago Bakery resulting in a 478 basis point decrease to gross margin. In addition, higher transportation costs as a result of tightened shipping capacity, higher co-packing costs and one-time bonuses paid to hourly employees as a result of the projected benefits of the newly enacted tax legislation also impacted gross profit.\nAdvertising, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $30.8 million, or 14.8% of net revenue, compared to $28.6 million, or 15.5% of net revenue. This increase on a dollar basis was primarily attributable to an increase in non-cash share-based compensation of $1.1 million due to a full quarter of stock compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to only a partial quarter for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company has also increased display rack deployment in support of revenue growth.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to buyout the Apollo Funds' rights to all current and future tax savings under the tax receivable agreement in exchange for a $34.0 million cash payment, resulting in a gain of $12.4 million.\nThe Company recognized an impairment loss of $1.4 million related to the planned disposition of certain production equipment before the end of its useful life.\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 18.2%, giving effect to the non-controlling interest, a partnership for income tax purposes, compared to 29.2%. The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate was primarily attributed to a lower federal statutory rate enacted by the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). The tax impact of the gain on the buyout of the tax receivable agreement also decreased the Company's effective tax rate.\nNet income was $29.3 million, compared to net income of $24.2 million. Net income attributed to Class A stockholders was $23.8 million, or $0.23 per share (on a diluted basis), compared to $15.8 million, or $0.15 per share.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.14, compared to $0.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.0 million, or 22.5% of net revenue, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $54.5 million, or 29.5% of net revenue. The decreases in adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA were primarily attributable to the negative gross profit from the Chicago Bakery.\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) and In-Store Bakery. The SBG segment consists of sweet baked goods that are sold under the Hostess® and Dolly Madison® brands, Hostess® branded bread and buns and frozen retail products. The operations attributed to the Chicago Bakery are included in the SBG segment. The In-Store Bakery segment consists of Superior® and Hostess® branded products sold through the in-store bakery section of grocery and club stores. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had two operating segments: SBG and Other. The analysis below reflects the new segment presentation for both the current and comparative periods.\nSweet Baked Goods Segment: Net revenue was $199.3 million, an increase of $24.5 million, or 14.0%, compared to $174.8 million. The Chicago Bakery contributed $14.5 million of the increase in net revenue. The remaining increase was driven primarily by continued growth from 2017 product innovations. Gross profit was $69.4 million, or 34.8% of net revenue, compared to $76.8 million, or 43.9% of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the Chicago Bakery operations, which produced negative gross profit for the quarter. Gross profit was also impacted by higher transportation and co-packing costs and bonuses paid to hourly employees as a result of the projected benefits of the newly enacted tax legislation.\nIn-Store Bakery Segment: Net revenue was $9.4 million, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 3.0%, compared to net revenue of $9.7 million. Gross profit was $1.8 million, or 19.1% of net revenue, compared to gross profit of $2.5 million, or 25.8% of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a shift in product and channel mix. Gross margin further decreased due to higher transportation costs as well as one-time bonuses paid to hourly employees.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $100.5 million and approximately $96.1 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit, under its revolving line of credit. The Company generated operating cash flow of $38.3 million during the quarter. The Company had outstanding term loan debt of $991.3 million and net debt of $890.8 million as of March 31, 2018, resulting in a leverage ratio of 4.00x based on adjusted EBITDA of $222.7 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. See the schedules in the press release for the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and the calculation of the leverage ratio.\nOutlook\nThe Company expects that its continued focus on its strategic initiatives of core distribution expansion, innovation and white space expansion will result in growth well above the SBG category in 2018. In addition, the Company expects to continue to serve as a platform for future acquisitions.\nThe Company reaffirms its outlook for adjusted EPS of $0.65 to $0.70. Please refer to the schedules in this press release for the calculation of expected basic, diluted and adjusted EPS. The Company's expected tax rate for 2018 is approximately 21%, giving effect to the non-controlling interest, a partnership for income tax purposes.\nThe Company reaffirms its outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $220 million to $230 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See the schedules in this press release for a reconciliation of anticipated 2018 adjusted EBITDA to anticipated net income of $98 million to $106 million for 2018.\nThe Company reaffirms its outlook for cash provided by operations of $175 million to $180 million in 2018. Significant anticipated cash outflows from investing and financing activities include $50 million to $60 million of total capital expenditures, $34 million to buy out a portion of the tax receivable agreement and $24 million to fund the acquisition of the Chicago Bakery. The net increase in cash for 2018 of $35 million to $40 million is expected to result in a leverage ratio of 3.50x to 3.70x at year end, prior to any additional acquisitions.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, May 9, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT to discuss the results for the first quarter.\nInvestors interested in participating in the live call can dial 877-451-6152 from the U.S. and 201-389-0879 internationally.

These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company has included adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributed to Class A stockholders, and adjusted EPS, because it believes the measures provide management and investors with additional information to measure the Company's performance and liquidity, estimate the Company's value and evaluate the Company's ability to service debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude (i) interest expense, net, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) income taxes and (iv) as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. For example, adjusted EBITDA:\ndoes not reflect the Company's capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company's debt; and does not reflect payments related to income taxes, the tax receivable agreement or distributions to the non-controlling interest to reimburse its tax liability.\nAdjusted Net Income Attributed to Class A Stockholders and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted net income attributed to Class A stockholders excludes certain items that affect comparability. Adjusted net income attributed to Class A stockholders is divided by weighted average diluted Class A shares outstanding to determine adjusted EPS. The adjustments to net income attributed to Class A stockholders are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjusted net income attributed to Class A stockholders and adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or recurring items. Certain adjustments are shown net of income taxes and net of allocation to the non-controlling interest.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended (In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet income $ 29,302 $ 24,199 Plus non-GAAP adjustments: Income tax provision 6,519 9,980 Interest expense, net 9,340 9,830 Depreciation and amortization 10,091 9,266 Share-based compensation i. 1,623 521 Gain on buyout of tax receivable agreement ii.

The Company recognized a gain resulting from the excess of the carrying value of the liability over the $34 million cash payment. iii. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.4 million related to the planned disposal of certain production equipment before the end of its useful life. iv. In response to Tax Reform, the Company paid one-time bonuses to its hourly employees in the first quarter of 2018. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA-Guidance for the year ended December 31, 2018\nReconciliation of 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income presents inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are necessary for a full reconciliation to net income. The Company's outlook for 2018 adjusted EBITDA is based on the same methodology used to present adjusted EBITDA for completed periods. However, the amounts, if any, of the non-recurring items that are excluded from adjusted EBITDA are highly uncertain and incapable of estimation, and have not been included in the table below. Such non-recurring items may include non-cash expenses for earn out liabilities, the impact to net income resulting from Tax Receivable Agreement transactions, and/or other items. As such items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA, the occurrence and magnitude thereof, while impacting net income and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, would have no impact on adjusted EBITDA for 2018. In addition, the below reconciliation assumes that the overall capital structure of the Company and effective income tax rates are consistent with the structure at March 31, 2018. Changes to these assumptions could significantly impact net income for 2018, and accordingly, the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, but not adjusted EBITDA itself. For additional information regarding adjusted EBITDA, refer to the related explanations presented above under “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA”.\n2018 Guidance Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation (Unaudited) Estimated\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nAmounts in millions, except shares and per share data\nNet income attributed to common stockholders $69 - $75 Net income attributed to the non-controlling interest i. 29 - 31 Net income 98 - 106 Plus non-GAAP adjustments: Income tax provision ii. 27 - 29 Interest expense, net 41 - 41 Depreciation and amortization 42 - 42 Share-based compensation iii. 8 - 8 Other expenses iv. 4 - 4 Adjusted EBITDA $220 - $230 i. The Company conducts its business through its subsidiary Hostess Holdings, L.P. (“Hostess Holdings”). The net income of Hostess Holdings is allocated to owners pro rata based on ownership percentage. As of March 31, 2018, the Company owned approximately 99.9 million of Hostess Holdings' 130.2 million total partnership units. The remaining approximately 30.3 million partnership units are owned by a non-controlling interest.\nii. Represents the corporate income tax expense generated from the Company's interest in Hostess Holdings. The non-controlling interest represents an ownership interest in Hostess Holdings, which is a partnership for tax purposes.
