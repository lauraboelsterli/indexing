    "text": "SAO PAULO, May 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian online credit card provider Nubank has expanded its client base by more than 30 percent since the end of 2017, but it still cannot forecast when it will post a profit, its chief executive said on Tuesday.\nChief Executive Officer David Velez told Reuters that Nubank, which does not charge fees to customers, reached 4 million credit card clients in May, up from 3 million late last year.\nNubank’s expansion underscores how financial technology start-ups are gaining momentum in Brazil amid a highly concentrated banking industry, although few of them are profitable.\nVelez said Nubank’s main focus for now continues to be growing its client base rapidly and not trying to turn a profit in the short term.\nIn 2017, Nubank posted a net loss of 117 million reais ($32.1 million).
