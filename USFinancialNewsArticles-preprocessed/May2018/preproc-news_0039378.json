    "text": "May 16, 2018 / 5:24 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago French group Alstom posts higher annual sales and profits Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - French manufacturing group Alstom ( ALSO.PA ), which has agreed to merge its rail operations with Germany’s Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), reported a rise in annual sales and profits and forecast further growth in profits in the medium term. The logo of Alstom is seen before a news conference to present the company's full year 2016/17 annual results in Saint-Ouen, near Paris, France, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nAlstom’s sales for its 2017/2018 financial year rose by 9 percent from the previous year to 7.951 billion euros (6.9 billion pounds), while adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) climbed 22 percent to 514 million euros.\nAlstom also proposed a dividend of 0.35 euros, up 40 percent from last year, while its EBIT margin rose to 6.5 percent from 5.8 percent.\nLast year, Siemens and Alstom agreed to merge their rail operations, creating a European champion to challenge the advance of China’s state-owned CRRC ( 601766.SS ).\nAlstom said it expected sales of around 8 billion euros for next year, and an EBIT margin of up to 7 percent.\n“Alstom continued to leverage the growing globalisation of the mobility market and is now in excellent position to join forces with Siemens Mobility,” said Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge in a statement.
