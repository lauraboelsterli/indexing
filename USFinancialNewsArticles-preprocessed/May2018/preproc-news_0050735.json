    "text": "(Reuters) - Independent Bank Group Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Guaranty Bancorp for about $1 billion to expand its operations in the state of Colorado.\nThe company said it would pay about $35.37 for each Guaranty Bank share, representing a premium of 9 percent to Guarantyâ€™s Tuesday close.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Guaranty Bancorp had total assets of $3.7 billion and total deposits of $3 billion.\nThe deal is the latest in a spate of consolidations among smaller U.S. regional banks looking to shore up assets and build their client base.\nOn Monday U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp agreed to buy smaller rival MB Financial Inc in a deal valued at $4.7 billion.\nIndependent Bank received a fairness opinion from Stephens Inc, while Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc served as financial adviser to Guaranty Bancorp.\nReporting by Karan Nagarkatti in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
