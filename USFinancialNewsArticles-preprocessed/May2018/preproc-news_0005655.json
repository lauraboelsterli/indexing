    "text": "DENVER, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\n(Compared to first quarter 2017 unless otherwise noted)\nTotal agent count increased 6.2% to 120,821 agents U.S. and Canada combined agent count increased 1.9% to 84,829 agents Revenue increased 11.0% to $52.6 million Net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. of $5.0 million and earnings per diluted share (GAAP EPS) of $0.28 Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $22.8 million, Adjusted EBITDA margin 1 of 43.4% and Adjusted earnings per diluted share (Adjusted EPS 1 ) of $0.49\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"RE/MAX Holdings\") (NYSE: RMAX), parent company of RE/MAX, one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Mortgage (\"Motto\"), an innovative mortgage brokerage franchise, today announced operating results for the quarter .\n\"Steady performance across our primary operating drivers highlighted first quarter results,\" stated Adam Contos, Chief Executive Officer. \"We grew our worldwide network by more than 7,000 agents year-over-year, we continued to expand Motto and, as previously announced, we made a bold and significant investment in our network by acquiring booj, a highly regarded real estate technology company. Strong attendance at our annual agent conference also favorably impacted the quarter.\"\nContos continued, \"Two recently released major industry reports again confirmed our wide lead in per-agent productivity among large U.S. real estate brokerages. RE/MAX agents continue to be productive in virtually every market condition. When inventory is tight, multiple offers are common, and the competition for listings is fierce, our network of highly productive agents combined with our differentiated business model give us a built-in and unique competitive advantage. Homebuyers and sellers should not settle for anything less than an experienced, productive agent.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results\nAgent Count\nThe following table compares agent count as of March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nAs of March 31\nChange\n2018\n2017\n#\n%\nU.S.\n63,612\n62,441\n1,171\n1.9%\nCanada\n21,217\n20,836\n381\n1.8%\nSubtotal\n84,829\n83,277\n1,552\n1.9%\nOutside the U.S. & Canada\n35,992\n30,527\n5,465\n17.9%\nTotal\n120,821\n113,804\n7,017\n6.2%\nRevenue\nRE/MAX Holdings generated total revenue of $52.6 million of 2018, an increase of $5.2 million or 11.0% compared to $47.4 million 2017. Revenue increased 6.8% from organic growth, 3.7% from acquisitions, and 0.5% from foreign-currency movements. Organic growth was driven primarily by increased revenue from our annual agent conference, agent count increases, rising home prices, and Motto expansion.\nRecurring revenue streams, which consist of continuing franchise fees and annual dues, increased $2.7 million or 8.8% over the first quarter of 2017 and accounted for 64.5% of revenue 2018 compared to 65.8% in the comparable period in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $38.9 million of 2018, an increase of $6.3 million or 19.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses increased principally due to higher selling, operating and administrative expenses, partially offset by reduced amortization expense.\nSelling, operating and administrative expenses were $34.4 million 2018, an increase of $7.7 million or 28.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and represented 65.3% of revenue compared to 56.2% in the prior-year period. Expenses increased primarily due to $2.1 million of expenses incurred in connection with the investigation by a special committee of our board of directors; severance expense of $1.8 million; the acquisition of booj; investments in Motto and the recently acquired Northern Illinois region; as well as an increase in expenses from our annual agent conference.\nNet Income and GAAP EPS\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings was $5.0 million of 2018, an increase of $0.4 million or 9.8% from the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to contributions from multiple organic growth contributors – including agent count growth, increased revenue from our annual agent conference and rising home prices – and the acquisition of the Northern Illinois region, as well as reductions in our provision for taxes and amortization expense. These were partially offset by increased selling, operating and administrative expenses, as described above. Reported basic and diluted GAAP EPS were each $0.28 per share of 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted EBITDA was $22.8 million of 2018, an increase of $0.9 million or 4.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA grew primarily due to contributions from the acquisition of the Northern Illinois region, agent count growth, increased revenue from our annual agent conference, and rising home prices, partially offset by severance expense, investment in Motto and the acquisition of booj. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.4% 2018 compared to 46.3% 2017.\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS were each $0.49 of 2018 and benefited from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act compared to the prior-year period. The ownership structure used to calculate Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for the quarter assumes RE/MAX Holdings owned 100% of RMCO, LLC (\"RMCO\"). The weighted average ownership RE/MAX Holdings had in RMCO was 58.5% for the quarter .\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had a cash balance of $30.1 million, a decrease of $20.7 million from December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, RE/MAX had $228.5 million of term loans outstanding, net of an unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, down from $229.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDividend\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on May 30, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2018.\nOutlook\nThe Company's second quarter and full-year 2018 Outlook includes the expected impact of the acquisition of booj and assumes no further currency movements, acquisitions or divestitures.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, RE/MAX Holdings expects:\nAgent count to increase 5.25% to 6.25% over second quarter 2017; Revenue in a range of $52.0 million to $54.0 million; and Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $26.0 million to $27.5 million.\nFor the full-year 2018, RE/MAX Holdings expects:\nAgent count to increase 5.0% to 6.0% over 2017; Revenue in a range of $213.0 million to $216.0 million; and Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $103.5 million to $106.5 million.\nThe effective U.S. GAAP tax rate attributable to RE/MAX Holdings is estimated to be between 15% and 17% in 2018.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call for interested parties on Friday, May 4, 2018, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
