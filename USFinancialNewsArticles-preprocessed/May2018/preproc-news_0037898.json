    "text": "7 COMMENTS KABUL—Taliban insurgents gave up their bid to take over the capital of the western province of Farah on Wednesday, slipping out of the city in the early-morning darkness without any apparent resistance from government forces, residents said.\nAfter a day of intense fighting with government forces , backed by Afghan and U.S. fighter aircraft and drones, Taliban fighters were unable to seize control of the remote provincial capital—a goal Afghanistan’s largest insurgency has been unable to achieve anywhere in the country since 2015.\nTo avert further bloodshed, roads out of the capital, which bears the same name as the province, were left open by government forces so Taliban fighters could withdraw to the sparsely populated and largely rural areas outside the city, said one local man contacted by telephone from the Afghan capital, Kabul.\nBy late morning, he and authorities said, shops were open in Farah and residents who had fled were returning to their homes, some on streets still littered with bodies and where government tanks and armored vehicles were posted.\nMeanwhile, offensive operations by government troops were continuing outside the capital, said Army Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell, spokesman for U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan .\nIt wasn’t immediately known whether the ease with which the Taliban left the city, located near the Iranian border, resulted from an explicit agreement between commanders on both sides. Breaking off fighting to avoid further bloodshed is a time-honored and frequently practiced tradition in civil conflicts in Afghanistan.\nAbdul Basir Salangi, the provincial governor, said the Taliban were “shamefully defeated” in their attempt to capture the city.\nRelated Coverage\nTaliban Attack Tests Afghan Forces Near Iran Border Coordinated Suicide Bomb Attacks in Kabul Kill at Least Six People America’s $78 Billion Afghan Security Force Is Shrinking Afghan President Offers Opening to Talks With Taliban Mr. Salangi said more than 300 Taliban fighters were killed or wounded in the fighting. Among government soldiers and police, 10 were killed and another 10 wounded. Three civilians also died, he said. The casualty figures couldn’t be independently verified. The extent of property damage in Farah wasn’t clear.\nThwarted in their original aim to seize control of Farah, the Taliban, in the aftermath of the fighting, sought quickly to redefine success.\nThey issued a statement describing their fighters’ departure from the city as a strategic retreat ordered by commanders. They also said they had accomplished their goals of seizing weapons and ammunition, and briefly holding key government installations, claims that couldn’t be independently verified.\nYet while a clear setback for the Taliban, the battle to dislodge the insurgents from Farah wasn’t an unalloyed success for the government of President Ashraf Ghani.\nThe initial Taliban assault on Farah, which was led by suicide bombers driving Humvees loaded with explosives, penetrated the city limits quickly, showing that the country’s largest insurgency remains a formidable foe, despite the efforts of better-armed government forces.\nAshraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president, speaking at an event in Herat in February. Photo: Associated Press With local forces unable to repel the assault, elite Afghan commando units were flown into Farah from nearby provinces, and U.S. fighter aircraft and drones were deployed.\n“If they hadn’t arrived quickly, it would’ve been a big disaster,” said Gul Ahmad Aazami, who represents Farah province in Afghanistan’s parliament.\nA chronic lack of government services and tough policing has allowed the Taliban to operate freely in many parts of the province, eroding the resolve of residents to oppose the Islamist militant group.\nIn a sign of how powerful the Taliban remain in the province, the Farah city resident who described the return of some semblance of normal life there refused to give his name.\n“The Taliban could come back,” he said.\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com",
