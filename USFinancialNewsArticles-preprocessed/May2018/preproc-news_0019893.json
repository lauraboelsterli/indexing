    "text": "Quarterly Product Revenue Up 66% Year-Over-Year\nOn Track for Potential FDA Clearance of T2Bacteria Panel in the Second Quarter 2018\nLEXINGTON, Mass., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO) an emerging leader in the development and commercialization of innovative medical diagnostic products for critical unmet needs in healthcare, announced today operating highlights and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Business and Financial Performance Highlights:\nReported first quarter total revenue of $2.311 million, up 146% year-over-year. Reported first quarter product revenue of $1.048 million, up 66% year-over-year. Secured five new placements of T2Dx ® Instruments in the first quarter and 4 contracts with access to 10 new hospitals. Increased targeted high-risk patients at newly contracted hospitals by 48,000, ahead of the 35,000 high-risk patients targeted in the quarter. Awarded grant of $2 million from CARB-X to accelerate the development of an expanded panel of tests utilizing the T2MR platform for sepsis-causing bacterial infections and resistance. Customers published 6 peer-reviewed studies demonstrating the clinical and performance advantages of the T2Dx Instrument over blood culture.\n“The first quarter was a positive start to the year for our core business, highlighted by 66% year-over-year product revenue growth, the expansion of our installed base and prudent expense management. There continues to be positive momentum in the market for our technology, with several new peer-reviewed publications demonstrating our superior performance and our new collaboration with CARB-X focused on a broad-based diagnostic panel for sepsis-causing bacterial infections,” said president and chief executive officer John McDonough. “Perhaps most importantly, there is robust and growing customer interest in the T2Bacteria Panel, which remains on track for potential FDA clearance in the second quarter of 2018. We anticipate this will be an inflection point for our business based on a significant expansion of our market opportunity and a positive shift in our growth trajectory.”\nAdditional Financial Results:\nResearch revenues were $1.2 million, compared to $326,000 last quarter and $310,000 in last year’s first quarter. Costs and expenses, excluding cost of product revenue, were $10.5 million, a 16% decrease over last year’s first quarter costs and expenses of $12.5 million. Operating margins were a loss of $11.5 million, a 20% decrease over last quarter’s $14.4 million operating margin loss and a 12% decrease over last year’s first quarter operating margin loss of $13.1 million.\nWeighted average shares outstanding were 36.0 million this quarter compared to 35.9 million last quarter and 30.6 million in last year’s first quarter.\nAnticipated Events:\nThe company provides the following guidance for the second quarter 2018:\nTotal revenue in the second quarter 2018 is expected to be in the range of $3.0 million to $3.3 million. Second quarter 2018 product revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $1.3 million.\nThe company expects to secure placements of at least 8 T2Dx Instruments in the second quarter by closing at least 6 new contracts that provide access to a minimum of 35,000 high-risk patients.\nOperating expenses, excluding cost of product revenue, for the second quarter 2018 are projected to be in the range of $10.0 million to $10.5 million, including non-cash stock based compensation and depreciation expenses of $2.0 million.\nThe company expects to provide full-year 2018 financial guidance upon FDA clearance of the T2Bacteria ® Panel.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today with the investment community at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the financial results and other business developments.
