    "text": "Venture Capital Barclays is reportedly looking at a potential merger with Standard Chartered Barclays and Standard Chartered had discussed the potential benefits of merging, but no deal has been made, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. Stanchart said it's \"entirely focused on executing our strategy, and do not comment on this type of speculation.\" Barclays had no comment when contacted by CNBC. Justin Solomon | CNBC Barclays headquarters in London, England.\nBarclays has spoken to its rival bank Standard Chartered about a potential merger but no formal or informal bid was made, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing two unnamed sources.\nBarclays told CNBC it has no comment on the report. Two unnamed sources close to the bank, cited by Reuters, said there was no truth in the rumor and it wasn't exploring any potential mergers with other lenders.\nStanchart said it's \"entirely focused on executing our strategy, and [does] not comment on this type of speculation.\"\nThe FT reported that one director each from the two London-headquartered banks met to discuss the possible benefits of merging. The conversation that took place was part of a wider effort by Barclays to improve its financial performance, according to the report.\nBarclays has come under pressure from activist investor Sherborne , which is pushing the British lender to shrink its under-performing investment banking unit, Reuters reported last week.",
