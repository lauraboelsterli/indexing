    "text": "WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: PFSI) today reported net income of $66.9 million 2018, on revenue of $238.2 million. Net income attributable to PFSI common stockholders was $16.6 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Book value per share increased to $20.74, from $19.95 at December 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nPretax income was $73.0 million, down from $121.8 million in the prior quarter; the prior quarter’s results included a $32.0 million benefit related to remeasurement of tax-related items that did not recur First quarter results reflect higher mortgage rates which drove an increased earnings contribution from the servicing segment and a decrease from the production segment driven by lower production margins Production segment pretax income was $17.2 million, down 69 percent from the prior quarter and 64 percent from the first quarter of 2017 Total loan acquisitions and originations were $14.3 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), down 16 percent from the prior quarter and 4 percent from the first quarter of 2017 Correspondent government and direct lending interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) totaled $10.9 billion in UPB, down 8 percent from the prior quarter and 2 percent from the first quarter of 2017 Servicing segment pretax income was $54.9 million, up 71 percent from the prior quarter and 309 percent from the first quarter of 2017 Servicing segment pretax income excluding valuation-related changes was $36.3 million, up 29 percent from the prior quarter and 63 percent from the first quarter of 2017 1 Completed previously announced acquisition of a bulk portfolio of Ginnie Mae and conventional conforming mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) with UPB of $3.2 billion Servicing portfolio grew to $255.3 billion in UPB, up 4 percent from December 31, 2017, and 26 percent from March 31, 2017 Investment Management segment pretax income was $1.0 million, down from $1.5 million in the prior quarter and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 Net assets under management were $1.5 billion, down 2 percent from December 31, 2017, and 1 percent from March 31, 2017 Issued $650 million of 5-year term notes at attractive rates under Ginnie Mae MSR financing structure, refinancing $400 million of 3-year term notes issued in February 2017\n“We had good results in a challenging market environment,” said President and CEO David Spector. “Our earnings were driven by strong performance in our servicing segment. We expect this segment to continue to be a larger contributor to PennyMac Financial’s earnings and to benefit from higher interest rates and the continued growth of our loan servicing portfolio. The earnings contribution of our production segment decreased significantly, driven by heightened competition among originators and aggregators as market participants lowered margins to fill their existing operational capacity. Another influencing factor was our desire to deploy capital into additional investments in mortgage servicing rights.”\n1 Excludes changes in the fair value of MSRs, the ESS liability, and gains (losses) on hedging which were $127.8 million, $(6.9) million, and $(103.6) million, respectively, and a $1.3 million reversal of provision for credit losses on active loans in the first quarter of 2018. The following table presents the contribution of PennyMac Financial’s Production, Servicing and Investment Management segments to pretax income:\nQuarter ended March 31, 2018 Mortgage Banking\nInvestment\nProduction\nServicing\nTotal\nManagement\nTotal\n(in thousands) Revenue Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale at fair value $ 36,198 $ 35,216 $ 71,414 $ - $ 71,414 Loan origination fees 24,563 - 24,563 - 24,563 Fulfillment fees from PMT 11,944 - 11,944 - 11,944 Net servicing fees - 116,789 116,789 - 116,789 Management fees - - - 5,775 5,775 Carried Interest from Investment Funds - - - (180 ) (180 ) Net interest income (expense): Interest income 14,248 28,367 42,615 - 42,615 Interest expense 2,102 34,627 36,729 16 36,745 12,146 (6,260 ) 5,886 (16 ) 5,870 Other 316 395 711 1,315 2,026 Total net revenue 85,167 146,140 231,307 6,894 238,201 Expenses 67,997 91,265 159,262 5,943 165,205 Pretax income $ 17,170 $ 54,875 $ 72,045 $ 951 $ 72,996 Production Segment\nProduction includes the correspondent acquisition of newly originated government-insured mortgage loans for PennyMac Financial’s own account, fulfillment services on behalf of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) and direct lending through the consumer direct and broker direct channels.\nPennyMac Financial’s loan production activity for the quarter totaled $14.3 billion in UPB, of which $10.1 billion in UPB was for its own account, and $4.2 billion in UPB was fee-based fulfillment activity for PMT. Correspondent government and direct lending IRLCs totaled $10.9 billion in UPB.\nProduction segment pretax income was $17.2 million, a decrease of 69 percent from the prior quarter and 64 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Production revenue totaled $85.2 million, a decrease of 35 percent from the prior quarter and 23 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter change resulted from a $32.5 million decrease in net gains on mortgage loans held for sale, driven by lower margins from higher mortgage rates and heightened competition among industry participants.\nThe components of net gains on mortgage loans held for sale are detailed in the following table:\nQuarter ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (in thousands) Receipt of MSRs in loan sale transactions $ 141,873 $ 143,904 $ 132,143 Mortgage servicing rights recapture payable to PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust\n(1,425 ) (1,553 ) (1,695 ) Provision for representations and warranties, net (379 ) (381 ) (530 ) Cash investment (1)\n(63,594 ) (69,001 ) (57,574 ) Fair value changes of pipeline, inventory and hedges\n(5,061 ) 25,652 14,612 Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale $ 71,414 $ 98,621 $ 86,956 Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale by segment:\nProduction $ 36,198 $ 68,716 $ 62,837 Servicing $ 35,216 $ 29,905 $ 24,119 (1) Net of cash hedge expense PennyMac Financial performs fulfillment services for conventional conforming loans acquired by PMT in its correspondent production business. These services include, but are not limited to: marketing; relationship management; the approval of correspondent sellers and the ongoing monitoring of their performance; reviewing loan data, documentation and appraisals to assess loan quality and risk; pricing; hedging and activities related to the subsequent sale and securitization of loans in the secondary mortgage markets for PMT. Fees earned from the fulfillment of correspondent loans on behalf of PMT totaled $11.9 million in the first quarter, down 38 percent from the prior quarter and 28 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in fulfillment fee revenue was driven by lower acquisition volumes by PMT and a reduction in the weighted average fulfillment fee, reflective of the more competitive market environment. For the first quarter, the weighted average fulfillment fee rate was 28 basis points, down from 33 basis points in the prior quarter.\nProduction segment expenses were $68.0 million, a 10 percent decrease from the prior quarter and a 9 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily driven by reductions in incentive-based compensation and corporate overhead, which is allocated across segments based upon their relative profitability.\nServicing Segment\nServicing includes income from owned MSRs, subservicing and special servicing activities. Servicing segment pretax income was $54.9 million compared with $32.0 million in the prior quarter and $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Servicing segment revenues totaled $146.1 million, an increase of 13 percent from the prior quarter and 64 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to an increase in net loan servicing fees, driven by MSR fair value gains resulting from the sharp rise in interest rates during the first quarter, net of hedge results, and an elevated level of revenue related to the reperformance of government-insured and guaranteed loans bought out of Ginnie Mae pools in prior periods.\nNet loan servicing fees totaled $116.8 million and included $160.7 million in servicing fees reduced by $61.2 million in realization of MSR cash flows. Valuation-related gains totaled $17.3 million, which includes MSR fair value gains of $127.8 million, associated hedging losses of $103.6 million and changes in fair value of the excess servicing spread (ESS) liability resulting in a $6.9 million loss. The MSR fair value gains resulted from expectations for lower prepayment activity in the future due to higher mortgage rates. Before January 1, 2018, PennyMac Financial carried the majority of its MSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company elected to account for all MSRs at fair value prospectively.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of net loan servicing fees:\nQuarter ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (in thousands) Servicing fees (1) $ 160,673 $ 162,008 $ 129,315 Effect of MSRs: Amortization and realization of cash flows (61,176 ) (66,891 ) (48,460 ) Change in fair value and provision for/reversal of impairment of MSRs carried at lower of amortized cost or fair value 127,806 28,029 12,701 Change in fair value of excess servicing spread financing\n(6,921 ) 4,593 2,773 Hedging gains (losses) (103,593 ) (20,837 ) (22,166 ) Total amortization, impairment and change in fair value of MSRs\n(43,884 ) (55,106 ) (55,152 ) Net loan servicing fees $ 116,789 $ 106,902 $ 74,163 (1) Includes contractually-specified servicing fees Servicing segment revenue also included $35.2 million in net gains on mortgage loans held for sale from the securitization of reperforming government-insured and guaranteed loans, compared with $29.9 million in the prior quarter and $24.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. These loans were previously purchased out of Ginnie Mae securitizations as early buyout loans (EBO) and brought back to performing status through PennyMac Financial’s successful servicing efforts, primarily with the use of loan modifications. Net interest expense totaled $6.3 million, a decrease of 24 percent from the prior quarter and 36 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Interest income increased by $3.8 million from the prior quarter, driven by growth in capitalized interest resulting from higher modifications of EBO loans during the quarter. Interest expense increased by $1.8 million from the prior quarter, driven by the accelerated recognition of costs related to the refinancing of MSR-backed term notes.\nServicing segment expenses totaled $91.3 million, a 6 percent decrease from the prior quarter and a 21 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by a reduction in expenses related to the buyout of defaulted government loans from securitizations and a reversal in the provision for credit losses from improved loan performance.\nThe total servicing portfolio reached $255.3 billion in UPB at March 31, 2018, an increase of 4 percent from the prior quarter end and 26 percent from a year earlier. Servicing portfolio growth during the quarter was driven by the Company’s loan production activities, supplemented by a $3.2 billion UPB bulk portfolio acquisition. Of the total servicing portfolio, prime servicing was $254.4 billion in UPB and special servicing was $0.9 billion in UPB. PennyMac Financial subservices and conducts special servicing for $77.5 billion in UPB, an increase of 3 percent from December 31, 2017. PennyMac Financial’s owned MSR portfolio grew to $173.5 billion in UPB, an increase of 4 percent from the prior quarter end.\nThe table below details PennyMac Financial’s servicing portfolio UPB:\nMarch 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (in thousands) Loans serviced at period end: Prime servicing: Owned Mortgage servicing rights Originated $ 125,643,312 $ 119,673,403 $ 97,505,384 Acquisitions 47,843,853 46,575,834 37,843,903 173,487,165 166,249,237 135,349,287 Mortgage servicing liabilities 1,766,722 1,620,609 1,900,493 Mortgage loans held for sale 2,512,546 2,998,377 2,180,760 177,766,433 170,868,223 139,430,540 Subserviced for Advised Entities 76,636,300 73,651,608 61,144,328 Total prime servicing 254,402,733 244,519,831 200,574,868 Special servicing: Subserviced for Advised Entities 903,138 1,328,660 2,308,468 Total special servicing 903,138 1,328,660 2,308,468 Total loans serviced $ 255,305,871 $ 245,848,491 $ 202,883,336 Mortgage loans serviced: Owned Mortgage servicing rights $ 173,487,165 $ 166,249,237 $ 135,349,287 Mortgage servicing liabilities 1,766,722 1,620,609 1,900,493 Mortgage loans held for sale 2,512,546 2,998,377 2,180,760 177,766,433 170,868,223 139,430,540 Subserviced 77,539,438 74,980,268 63,452,796 Total mortgage loans serviced $ 255,305,871 $ 245,848,491 $ 202,883,336 Investment Management Segment\nPennyMac Financial manages PMT and two private Investment Funds for which it earns base management fees and may earn incentive compensation. Net assets under management were $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2018, down 2 percent from December 31, 2017, and 1 percent from March 31, 2017.\nPretax income for the Investment Management segment was $1.0 million, compared with $1.5 million in the prior quarter and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Management fees, which include base management fees from PMT and the private Investment Funds, decreased 4 percent from the prior quarter and increased 7 percent from the first quarter of 2017. No incentive fee was paid by PMT during the quarter, consistent with the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2017.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of management fees and carried interest:\nQuarter ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 (in thousands) Management fees: PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust Base $ 5,696 $ 5,900 $ 5,008 Performance incentive - - - 5,696 5,900 5,008 Investment Funds 79 88 366 Total management fees 5,775 5,988 5,374 Carried Interest (180 ) 5 (128 ) Total management fees and Carried Interest $ 5,595 $ 5,993 $ 5,246 Net assets of Advised Entities: PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust $ 1,542,258 $ 1,544,585 $ 1,458,590 Investment Funds 2,668 29,329 97,551 $ 1,544,926 $ 1,573,914 $ 1,556,141 Investment Management segment expenses totaled $5.9 million, an increase of 34 percent from the prior quarter and 39 percent from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a change in accounting for expenses reimbursed by PMT under the Company’s management agreement with PMT. Beginning January 1, 2018, PennyMac Financial is required to include such expense reimbursements in its net revenue and the expenses reimbursed in its expenses. Previously, PennyMac Financial accounted for such reimbursements as reductions to its expenses.\nConsolidated Expenses\nTotal expenses for the first quarter were $165.2 million, a 7 percent decrease from the prior quarter and a 16 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by lower total expenses in the production and servicing segments.\n***\nExecutive Chairman Stanford L. Kurland concluded, “The mortgage origination market is in a period of significant transition, with interest rates increasing meaningfully from the end of last year, resulting in a reduction of refinancing volumes. As the market continues to normalize, we believe PennyMac Financial is positioned to perform well as a result of our comprehensive mortgage banking platform and leading production and servicing businesses. We continue to pursue opportunities that are expected to help us grow. These include growth in our consumer direct channel and our recently launched broker channel. We also are focused on the expansion of our product menu to better serve our customers and drive additional volume, including a re-emphasis on jumbo loans and developing loan products to help borrowers access home equity. Technology is the foundation for these initiatives. We are investing in technology to drive greater efficiencies, while at the same time focusing on continually improving interaction with our customers to ensure the successful execution of our growth strategies and our ability to deliver strong profitability into the future.”\nManagement’s slide presentation will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.ir.pennymacfinancial.com beginning at 1:30 p.m. (Pacific Daylight Time) on Thursday, May 3, 2018.\nAbout PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.\nPennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing of U.S. mortgage loans and the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market.
