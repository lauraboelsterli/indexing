    "text": "CHICAGO, May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Continental Materials Corporation (NYSE American:CUO) today reported a net loss of $6,193,000 or $3.65 per share for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $422,000 or 25 cents per share for the same period in 2017. The current year quarter includes the write-off of $6,934,000 ($5,201,000 net of tax benefit) of deferred development costs associated with a mining property for which the Company had applied to the state of Colorado to obtain mining permits. After the permits were denied by the Reclamation Mining and Safety Division (DRMS) of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources in 2016, the Company was invited to resubmit its request and address concerns raised during the first application hearing. On April 26, 2018, despite the recommendation of the DRMS staff to approve the application as submitted, the permit was denied again by the voting committee members. The Company has not yet received final written notice of the decision, but has written-off all related capitalized amounts as of March 31, 2018.\nConsolidated sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $36,873,000, an increase of $2,770,000 or 8.1% compared to the first three months of 2017. Sales in the Concrete, Aggregates and Construction Supply (“CACS”) segment increased $1,581,000 as demand for ready-mix concrete improved over the prior year. Sales in the Door segment were higher by $427,000. Sales in the Heating and Cooling and Evaporative Cooling segments increased $557,000 and $207,000, respectively. Furnace sales in the first quarter of 2018 were higher compared to the first quarter of 2017; however, fan coil sales and backlog have decreased for the same period comparison.\nThe consolidated operating loss in the first quarter of 2018, before the $6,934,000 write-off of deferred development discussed above, was $1,259,000 compared to a consolidated operating loss of $611,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The Door segment reported an increase of $145,000 in operating profit in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Heating and Cooling segment reported a smaller increase of $6,000 for the same comparison period. The CACS and Evaporative Cooling segments reported increased operating losses, $404,000 and $199,000, respectively, for the current first quarter compared to the prior year first quarter.\nInterest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $108,000 compared to $66,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior year quarter is attributable to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates negotiated on the Company’s revolving line effective in the second quarter of 2017.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory income tax rates adjusted for non-deductible expenses, tax credits and other tax items. The estimated effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was a benefit of 25.0% compared to a benefit of 34.0% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in benefit is attributable to the recently enacted Tax Act which reduced the Company’s Federal Tax Rate from 34.0% to 21.0%.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT-- Statements in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.
