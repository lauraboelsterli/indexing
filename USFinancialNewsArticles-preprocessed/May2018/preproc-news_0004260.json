Refer to Note 2 - Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the financial statements for further discussion. First Quarter 2018 Review:\nOn a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues increased 14.1% to $124.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 16.0% to $15.5 million. Exchange rate movements against the Canadian dollar impacted consolidated revenues by (0.9%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (3.4%). Acquisitions contributed 4.9% to revenues and (6.8%) to Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. Organic growth contributed 9.2% to revenues during the first quarter.\nConsolidated profit (loss), in accordance with IFRS, was $(2.3) million or $(0.06) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to $0.6 million and $0.01 per share basic and diluted during the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.23 in the first quarter, compared to $0.22 in 2017.\nAltus Analytics revenues increased by 3.2% to $40.5 million. Revenue growth would have been 5.9% if the impact from foreign exchange movements was excluded. Growth in the quarter was driven by new license sales, education revenues and subscriptions from Altus Data Solutions, offset by the currency impact. Recurring revenues were $29.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up 1.2% or $0.4 million from $29.2 million in the same period in 2017. Movements in the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar impacted revenues by (2.7%).\nAdjusted EBITDA was $8.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down 35.5% or $4.6 million from $12.8 million in the same period in 2017. Changes in foreign exchange impacted Adjusted EBITDA by (4.5%). Adjusted EBITDA decreased because of higher expenses as we made significant incremental investments for ARGUS product development activities.\nThe CRE Consulting revenues increased 28.0% to $73.9 million. Property Tax revenues increased by 46.4%, with a strong start to the year across the global Property Tax practices. The Canadian Property Tax practice experienced significant revenue growth in Western Canada, including Vancouver, Alberta and Manitoba, where the business is at the start of a new cycle. The U.S. had strong contribution from across all service lines and the U.K. showed organic improvement from the legacy business as well as acquisitive growth from CVS. Exchange rate fluctuations impacted Property Tax revenues by 0.3%. Valuation and Cost Advisory revenues increased by 3.0% on stronger performance from the global Cost practice, driven by growth in both Canada and Australia. Changes in exchange rates impacted CRE Consulting revenues by 0.1%. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up 120.4% or $8.6 million from $7.1 million in the same period in 2017, largely driven by an increase of 209.7% or $8.9 million in Property Tax. The increase in Property Tax earnings was driven by higher revenues. Changes in exchange rates impacted CRE Consulting Adjusted EBITDA by 1.7%.\nGeomatics’ revenues were lower by 17.0% at $10.4 million, while Adjusted EBITDA declined 96.0% to $0.1 million as a result of lower revenues.\nCorporate costs (recovery) were $8.4 million in the first quarter, compared to $7.7 million in the same period in 2017. During the quarter, corporate costs increased on higher accrual of variable compensation resulting from increased earnings.\nAt the end of the first quarter, Altus Group’s balance sheet remained strong, giving the Company the financial flexibility to pursue its growth strategy. The Company’s bank debt was $163.3 million, representing a funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.95 times, compared to 1.84 times at December 31, 2017. Also, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $20.6 million at the end of the first quarter (compared to $28.1 million as at December 31, 2017).\nQ1 2018 Results Conference Call & Webcast\nDate: Thursday, May 3, 2018 Time: 5:00 p.m. (ET) Webcast: altusgroup.com (under the Investors tab) Live Call: 1-800-273-9672 (toll-free) or 416-340-2218 (Toronto area) Replay: A replay of the call will be available via the webcast at altusgroup.com About Altus Group Limited\nAltus Group Limited is a leading provider of independent advisory services, software and data solutions to the global commercial real estate industry.
