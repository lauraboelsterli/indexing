    "text": "(Adds comment on bond yields, prospect for deals, Kraft Heinz Co)\nON INFLATION\n\"One thing we know is, long-term bonds are a terrible investment at current rates, or anything close to current rates. Rates (on short-term bills) have gone up lately, so in 2018 my guess we'll have at least $500 million (more) in pre-tax income than we had last year.\"\nON DEALS\n\"I do not worry about the slowing deal flow. My phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals but we will be still the first (point) of call, irrespective of me or Charlie not being there.\"\nON KRAFT HEINZ\n\"The 3G people have gone into certain situations where there were probably ... A lot of expenses that were not delivering a dollar of value for a dollar expended. They made changes very fast to a situation that probably shouldn't have existed in the first place.\"\n\"Our managers have different techniques of keeping track of trying to maximize customer satisfaction at the same time that they don't incur other than necessary costs.\"\n ",
