    "text": "This release should be read with the Company's Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis (\"MD&A\"), available at www.tasekomines.com and filed on www.sedar.com . Except where otherwise noted, all currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Taseko's 75% owned Gibraltar Mine is located north of the City of Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia. Production volumes stated in this release are on a 100% basis unless otherwise indicated.\nVANCOUVER, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO; NYSE American: TGB) (\"Taseko\" or the \"Company\") reports the results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nRussell Hallbauer, President and CEO of Taseko, commented, \"As disclosed in our year-end report, production in early 2018 continued to be impacted by waste stripping shortfalls from 2017, where we effectively lost two months of waste stripping. With our stripping schedule compromised, our new pushback was delayed and only lower grade ore was available to process.\"\n\"The lower grades and resultant reduced copper and molybdenum production had a significant impact on our financial performance in the first quarter. But even with the low grades, we still managed to generate $12 million of Cash flow from operations and $14 million of earnings from mining operations before depreciation and amortization* in the quarter. Our adjusted net loss* of $11 million (or $0.05 per share) was negatively impacted by increased use of stockpiled ore as well as provisional pricing adjustments,\" stated Mr. Hallbauer.\nMr. Hallbauer continued, \"Gibraltar head grades can fluctuate quite dramatically quarter-over-quarter as a result of the mining sequence, consistent with any other large mining operation. However, over longer periods of time average mined grades will revert to the life of mine average grade. Gibraltar has 21 years of mine life remaining, so this quarter's metal production shortfall is a short-term issue. The Canadian dollar price of copper remains roughly $4.00 per pound, the strongest it has been since 2011, and with copper grades increasing we see both metal production and financial performance returning to more representative levels.\"\n\"I am very pleased to report that our Florence Copper Project continues to advance on-time and on budget. We will begin testing the injection and recovery well systems in the coming weeks and the SX/EW plant construction is well underway and expected to be operational in the next six months. Importantly, the recent changes to US tax legislation have had a significant impact on the project's after tax net present value, raising it from US$680 million** to approximately US$760 million, based on current estimates. Florence Copper, with its very low capital and operating costs, is one of the best near-term copper projects on the horizon and will have a material impact on our Company,\" added Mr. Hallbauer.\n\"In addition to Florence Copper, we have an exciting near-term catalyst with our Aley Niobium Project. After three years of additional engineering work, we are in the final stages of completing an updated technical report. This report will demonstrate both lower capital costs and improved mine economics at a lower long-term niobium price. We look forward to publicly releasing that report in the near future. Both of these projects point to a bright future for the Company,\" concluded Mr. Hallbauer.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* was $13.5 million; The increased use of stockpiled ore resulted in a non-cash inventory expense and additional depletion and amortization which reduced earnings from mining operations by $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2018; Cash flow from operations was $11.6 million, a decrease from the same period in 2017 due to lower copper production and sales volumes; In September 2017, the Company announced that it was moving forward with the construction of the Production Test Facility (\"PTF\") for the Florence Copper Project. The SX/EW plant and the associated wellfield, comprised of 24 production, monitoring, observation and point of compliance wells, will be built for approximately US$25 million. Wellfield drilling was completed in early April and construction of the process plant progressed smoothly through the first quarter, with steel for the plant being erected at the end of the quarter. The project is on-time and on budget with expenditures in the first quarter being approximately $14.3 million or US$10.8 million. The facility is expected to be operational by the end of the third quarter of 2018, with first copper cathode being produced in December; Copper and molybdenum production in the first quarter was 22.9 million pounds and 0.4 million pounds, respectively, a decrease from previous quarters as a result of the anticipated lower grade mine feed combined with the increased use of lower grade ore stockpiles, a consequence of the summer wildfires; Net loss was $18.5 million (or $0.08 per share) and Adjusted net loss* was $11.0 million (or $0.05 per share); Site operating costs, net of by-product credits* were US$2.02 per pound produced and Total operating costs (C1)* were US$2.33 per pound produced. Spending in the quarter remained at a similar level as previous quarter but unit costs were impacted by the lower grades and production; Total sales (100% basis) for the quarter were 22.8 million pounds of copper and 0.4 million pounds of molybdenum; and The Company's cash balance at March 31, 2018 was $64 million, reduced from $80 million at the end of 2017 due in part to cash used for construction of the Florence Copper PTF.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFinancial Data\nThree months ended March 31,\n(Cdn$ in thousands, except for per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nRevenues\n64,179\n104,389\n(40,210)\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization*\n13,544\n53,427\n(39,883)\nEarnings (loss) from mining operations\n(1,236)\n43,850\n(45,086)\nNet income (loss)\n(18,481)\n16,479\n(34,960)\nPer share - basic (\"EPS\")\n(0.08)\n0.07\n(0.15)\nAdjusted net income (loss) *\n(10,999)\n15,254\n(26,253)\nPer share - basic (\"adjusted EPS\") *\n(0.05)\n0.07\n(0.12)\nEBITDA *\n370\n49,145\n(48,775)\nAdjusted EBITDA *\n7,537\n47,934\n(40,397)\nCash flows provided by operations\n11,556\n79,765\n(68,209)\nOperating Data (Gibraltar - 100% basis)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nTons mined (millions)\n26.7\n21.8\n4.9\nTons milled (millions)\n7.5\n7.3\n0.2\nProduction (million pounds Cu)\n22.9\n41.3\n(18.4)\nSales (million pounds Cu)\n22.8\n40.8\n(18.0)\nOPERATIONS ANALYSIS\nFirst quarter results\nFirst quarter copper production at Gibraltar was 22.9 million pounds, lower than recent quarters as a result of reduced head grades and recoveries. Copper head grade at Gibraltar was 0.201% in the first quarter and the Company expects the head grade for the remainder of 2018 to be in line with the average life of mine reserve grade of 0.26%. Although the lower head grade in the first quarter was expected in the mine plan, head grade was also affected by reduced waste stripping in the third quarter of 2017 due to the summer wildfires in the Cariboo region and as a result more mill feed came from the stockpile than planned in the first quarter. The low head grades and some oxidation from stockpile ore also impacted copper recoveries which averaged 76% for the period.\nA total of 26.7 million tons were mined during the quarter at a strip ratio of 4.1 to 1. Waste stripping costs of $14.7 million (75% basis) were capitalized in the quarter related to the new pushback in the Granite pit. Approximately 2.5 million tons of ore were drawn from the ore stockpile in the first quarter.\nSite operating cost per ton milled* was $8.68 in the first quarter of 2018, which is higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the decreased capitalization of stripping costs and a decrease in the tons milled during the first quarter.\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits per pound produced* increased to US$2.02 in the first quarter of 2018 from US$1.69 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total site spending in the first quarter remained at a similar level to the previous quarter, but unit operating costs increased due to the lower copper production and lower capitalized stripping costs in the period. A total of 0.4 million pounds of molybdenum were sold resulting in by-product credits per pound produced* of US$0.23 in the first quarter. The increase in molybdenum by-product credit was a result of higher molybdenum prices.\nOff-property costs per pound produced* were US$0.31 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to US$0.34 for the 2017 year. The lower Off-property costs per pound produced* was primarily a result of lower treatment and refining costs charged on the Company's copper concentrate sales.\nTotal operating costs (C1) per pound* increased to US$2.33, a 10% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nGibraltar Mine (75% Owned)\nOperating data (100% basis)\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ2 2017\nQ1 2017\nTons mined (millions)\n26.7\n26.9\n23.3\n21.1\n21.8\nTons milled (millions)\n7.5\n7.9\n7.2\n7.5\n7.3\nStrip ratio\n4.1\n4.9\n4.1\n2.8\n2.4\nSite operating cost per ton milled (CAD$)*\n$8.68\n$7.68\n$5.93\n$7.67\n$8.59\nCopper concentrate\nGrade (%)\n0.201\n0.209\n0.284\n0.309\n0.328\nRecovery (%)\n75.7\n77.5\n86.1\n85.2\n85.9\nProduction (million pounds Cu)\n22.9\n25.5\n35.1\n39.4\n41.3\nSales (million pounds Cu)\n22.8\n32.0\n30.2\n40.7\n40.8\nInventory (million pounds Cu)\n2.9\n2.7\n9.3\n4.6\n5.9\nMolybdenum concentrate\nProduction (thousand pounds Mo)\n443\n537\n445\n789\n866\nSales (thousand pounds Mo)\n433\n589\n403\n794\n859\nPer unit data (US$ per pound produced) *\nSite operating costs *\n$2.25\n$1.86\n$0.97\n$1.08\n$1.15\nBy-product credits *\n(0.23)\n(0.17)\n(0.09)\n(0.11)\n(0.15)\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits *\n$2.02\n$1.69\n$0.88\n$0.97\n$1.00\nOff-property costs\n0.31\n0.42\n0.30\n0.34\n0.33\nTotal operating costs (C1) *\n$2.33\n$2.11\n$1.18\n$1.31\n$1.33\nGIBRALTAR OUTLOOK\nLooking beyond the first quarter, with the transition into the new ore zone completed, copper grade will increase and we expect the average copper grade for the remainder of 2018 to be in line with Gibraltar's average life of mine reserve grade of 0.26%.\nCopper markets have shown continued strength with prices at US$3.07 per pound as of May 1, 2018. Molybdenum prices have also stayed strong at US$12.40 per pound as of May 1, 2018.\nThe Company is pursuing an insurance claim related to the Cariboo region wildfires in July 2017. The amount of the insurance claim has not been finalized and is currently estimated to be in the range of $4 to $10 million on a 75% basis.\nREVIEW OF PROJECTS\nTaseko's strategy has been to grow the Company by leveraging cash flow from the Gibraltar Mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects. We continue to believe this will generate the best, long-term returns for shareholders. Our development projects are located in British Columbia and Arizona and represent a diverse range of metals, including gold, copper, molybdenum and niobium. Our project focus is currently on the development of the Florence Copper Project.\nFlorence Copper Project\nIn September 2017, the Company announced that it was moving forward with the construction of the Production Test Facility (\"PTF\") for the Florence Copper Project. The SX/EW Plant and the associated wellfield, comprised of 24 production, monitoring, observation and point of compliance wells, will be built for approximately US$25 million. Wellfield drilling was completed in early April and construction of the process plant progressed smoothly through the first quarter, with steel for the plant being erected at the end of the quarter.\nThe project is on time and on budget with expenditures in the first quarter being approximately $14.3 million or US$10.8 million. The entire facility, plant and wells are expected to be fully operational by the end of the third quarter of 2018.\nAley Niobium Project\nIn 2014, the Company filed an NI43-101 technical report for the Aley Niobium Project. Further engineering and metallurgical test work has been completed since then which is expected to result in improved project economics. Environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway.\nThe Company will host a telephone conference call and live webcast on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific) to discuss these results. After opening remarks by management, there will be a question and answer session open to analysts and investors. The conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 303-9079 in Canada and the United States, or (970) 315-0461 internationally. The conference call will be archived for later playback until May 10, 2018 and can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056 in Canada and the United States, or (404) 537-3406 internationally and using the passcode 2584329.\nRussell Hallbauer\nPresident and CEO\nNo regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information in this news release.\nNON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThis document includes certain non-GAAP performance measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. The Company believes that these measures are commonly used by certain investors, in conjunction with conventional IFRS measures, to enhance their understanding of the Company's performance. These measures have been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis. The following tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\nTotal operating costs and site operating costs, net of by-product credits\nTotal costs of sales include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as transportation costs and insurance recoverable. Site operating costs is calculated by removing net changes in inventory, depletion and amortization, insurance recoverable, and transportation costs from cost of sales. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits is calculated by removing by-product credits from the site operating costs. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits per pound are calculated by dividing the aggregate of the applicable costs by copper pounds produced. Total operating costs per pound is the sum of site operating costs, net of by-product credits and off-property costs divided by the copper pounds produced. By-product credits are calculated based on actual sales of molybdenum (net of treatment costs) and silver during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(Cdn$ in thousands, unless otherwise indicated) – 75% basis\n2018\n2017\nCost of sales\n65,415\n60,539\nLess:\nDepletion and amortization\n(14,780)\n(9,577)\nInsurance recoverable\n4,000\n-\nNet change in inventories of finished goods\n967\n233\nNet change in inventories of ore stockpiles\n(3,896)\n1,172\nTransportation costs\n(2,829)\n(5,217)\nSite operating costs\n48,877\n47,150\nLess by-product credits:\nMolybdenum, net of treatment costs\n(5,009)\n(5,807)\nSilver, excluding amortization of deferred revenue\n(92)\n(449)\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits\n43,776\n40,894\nTotal copper produced (thousand pounds)\n17,145\n30,943\nTotal costs per pound produced\n2.55\n1.32\nAverage exchange rate for the period (CAD/USD)\n1.26\n1.32\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits (US$ per pound)\n2.02\n1.00\nSite operating costs, net of by-product credits\n43,776\n40,894\nAdd off-property costs:\nTreatment and refining costs of copper concentrate\n3,954\n8,456\nTransportation costs\n2,829\n5,217\nTotal operating costs\n50,559\n54,567\nTotal operating costs (C1) (US$ per pound)\n2.33\n1.33\nAdjusted net income (loss)\nAdjusted net income (loss) remove the effect of the following transactions from net income as reported under IFRS:\nUnrealized foreign currency gains/losses; Unrealized gain/loss on copper put options; and Gain/loss on copper call option.\nManagement believes these transactions do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Furthermore, unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, and unrealized foreign currency gains/losses are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating results for the reporting periods presented.\nThree months ended March 31,\n($ in thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n(18,481)\n16,479\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss\n8,332\n(2,677)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on copper put options\n(1,165)\n52\nLoss on copper call option\n-\n1,414\nEstimated tax effect of adjustments\n315\n(14)\nAdjusted net income (loss)\n(10,999)\n15,254\nAdjusted EPS\n(0.05)\n0.07\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation. EBITDA is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. Issuers of \"high yield\" securities also present EBITDA because investors, analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations. The Company believes EBITDA is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity, because cash expenditures on interest are, by definition, available to pay interest, and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up; depreciation is a non-cash charge.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of the Company's performance and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA is prepared by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding to EBITDA certain items of expense and deducting from EBITDA certain items of income that are not likely to recur or are not indicative of the Company's future operating performance consisting of:\nUnrealized foreign exchange gains/losses; Unrealized gain/loss on copper put options; and Gain/loss on copper call option.\nWhile some of the adjustments are recurring, other non-recurring expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company's core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future results. Furthermore, unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, and unrealized foreign currency translation gains/losses are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating results for the reporting periods presented.\nThree months ended March 31,\n($ in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n(18,481)\n16,479\nAdd:\nDepletion and amortization\n14,780\n9,577\nAmortization of share-based compensation expense (recovery)\n(839)\n3,359\nFinance expense\n9,311\n8,034\nFinance income\n(323)\n(331)\nIncome tax expense (recovery)\n(4,078)\n12,027\nEBITDA\n370\n49,145\nAdjustments:\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss\n8,332\n(2,677)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on copper put options\n(1,165)\n52\nLoss on copper call option\n-\n1,414\nAdjusted EBITDA\n7,537\n47,934\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization\nEarnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization is earnings from mining operations with depletion and amortization added back.
