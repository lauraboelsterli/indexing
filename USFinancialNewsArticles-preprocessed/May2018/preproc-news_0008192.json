    "text": "SANTA ANA, Calif., May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kush Bottles, Inc. (OTCQB: KSHB) (\"Kush Bottles\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of packaging, supplies , vaporizers , hydrocarbon gases , solvents , accessories and branding solutions for the regulated cannabis industry, announced today it has completed its acquisition of Summit Innovations, LLC (\"Summit Innovations\"), a leading distributor of hydrocarbons to the legal cannabis industry based in Denver, Colorado. Summit Innovations was acquired in exchange for 1,280,000 shares of Kush Bottles common stock and approximately $3.2 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments and holdbacks, as further described in the Company's press release dated April 10, 2018 .\nHydrocarbon gases are used to convert cannabis plants into oils, and this acquisition marks Kush Bottles' entry into a new business vertical supplying gas to cannabis extractors. Summit Innovations operates seven distribution facilities located across the country. Its four core products are high purity butane, propane, iso-butane and blends. Summit Innovations works closely with legal cannabis manufacturers to ensure cleanliness, product quality, safety and compliance during the extraction process.\n\"We are pleased to close this acquisition and secure our entry into the hydrocarbon segment of the cannabis market,\" commented, Nicholas Kovacevich, CEO and Chairman of Kush Bottles. \"Gas is the lifeblood of the cannabis market and Summit Innovations offers a broad range of hydrocarbon gases that meet the complex needs of cannabis extractors across the country. By bringing Summit Innovations under the Kush Bottles umbrella, we expect to leverage synergies in our distribution channels to grow sales at both Summit and our existing business lines. This is a major step forward in our strategy to position Kush Bottles as a one-stop shop for any business looking to operate responsibly within the legal cannabis market.\"\nThe Company continues to evaluate new technologies and developments within the industry as it builds out a diversified suite of products and services that are integral to the proper functioning of the cannabis supply chain.\nKush Bottles will issue up to an additional 1,280,000 shares of Kush Bottles common stock if the Summit Innovations business achieves certain earn-out milestones of up to $12.0 million in eligible revenues during the twelve-month period following closing.\nTo be added to the distribution list, please email ir@kushbottles.com with \"Kush\" in the subject line.\nAbout Kush Bottles\nKush Bottles, Inc.
