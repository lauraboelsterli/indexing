    "text": "Strong Product Sales Performance Across Entire Portfolio\nContinuing to Optimize Operations to Achieve Cost Synergies\nImportant Achievements for Development and Discovery Efforts Including CARB-X Funding Award\nNEW HAVEN, Conn., May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLNT), a commercial-stage company discovering, developing and commercializing novel antibiotics to treat serious bacterial infections, today reported financial results and provided an update on commercial activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Melinta reported revenue of $14.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which includes product sales of $11.8 million and contract revenue of $3.0 million. In addition, the company earned $2.7 million in funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which it recorded as other income. This quarter was the first including sales from all four of the company’s antibiotic brands.\n“The new Melinta is off to a strong start in 2018, as we completed our first quarter as a combined company following the close of our acquisition of The Medicines Company’s infectious disease business on January 5, 2018,” said Dan Wechsler, President and CEO of Melinta. “During the quarter we launched Baxdela™ (delafloxacin) in the U.S. and continued our launch of Vabomere™ (meropenem and vaborbactam) in the U.S., and generated strong sales performance across all four of our brands, powered by our experienced antibiotics-focused salesforce. Our salesforce is now fully cross-trained with all reps selling all products beginning in May, significantly expanding our share of voice.\n“Within our pipeline we saw continued advancement, with our partners Menarini Group and Eurofarma Laboratórios submitting Marketing Authorization Applications for delafloxacin in the E.U. and Argentina, respectively. We also announced an agreement with CARB-X, one of the world's largest public-private partnerships devoted to early development antibacterial R&D, that will provide us funding to advance the development of a novel antimicrobial from our ESKAPE pathogen program.\n“From a financial perspective, we have received significant interest to partner outside of the U.S. on our products. In addition, we have strong support from shareholders and others to provide a foundation for the continued growth of our company.”\nQ1 2018 and Recent Business Highlights\nJanuary 5, 2018 - acquired the infectious disease business of The Medicines Company, including approved products Vabomere, Orbactiv® (oritavancin) and Minocin® (minocycline) for Injection In Q1: added well-experienced talent across the entire organization, including sales and marketing, medical affairs and other expertise completed integration had no disruption to product launches or performance February 6, 2018 – launched Baxdela in the United States February 20, 2018 – partner Eurofarma Laboratórios submitted the first of many anticipated marketing authorization applications (MAA) in Latin America, in Argentina, for delafloxacin for treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) additional MAA submitted in Peru on May 4, 2018 March 6, 2018 – partner Menarini submitted an MAA to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for delafloxacin (Quofenix) for treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI\nQ1 2018 Financial Results\nMelinta reported product sales for the first time in the first quarter of 2018 totaling $11.8 million, which included the addition of Vabomere, Minocin and Orbactiv as of January 5, 2018, the close of The Medicines Company acquisition, as well as the launch of Baxdela in February.\nFor the quarter, total net revenue was $14.8 million compared to total net revenue of $22.5 million for the same period in 2017, when Melinta was a private company. The composition of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was significantly different than that recognized in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, we recognized contract research revenue totaling $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 2017, we also recognized $19.9 million in upfront consideration from Menarini in connection with the execution of our ex-U.S. Baxdela licensing arrangement.\nin USD millions 2018 2017 Product sales $11.8 0.0 Contract revenue 3.0 2.6 Licensing revenue 0.0 19.9 Total net revenue * $14.8 $22.5 * Excludes BARDA grant funding included in Other Income Cost of goods sold was $7.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Notably, $4.7 million of the $7.7 million was comprised of non-cash, amortization of intangible assets. There were no product sales and therefore no costs of goods sold in the prior year period.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses were $16.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by additional headcount and development activities resulting from the recent merger with Cempra, the acquisition of the infectious disease business from The Medicines Company and accelerated patient enrollment for our ongoing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) registration trial for Baxdela.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $34.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was driven by costs to support a larger, public, commercial organization after the Cempra merger and the acquisition of the infectious disease business from The Medicines Company, including additional headcount and commercial infrastructure, and acquisition-related severance and other non-recurring expenses. Approximately $4.3 million was a result of acquisition-related costs and other non-GAAP adjustments.\nNet loss available to shareholders was $29.4 million, or $0.95 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $5.8 million for the same period in 2017. Net loss per share is impacted by changes in our share count as a result of the Cempra merger and financing related to the acquisition of the infectious disease business from The Medicines Company.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Melinta had cash and cash equivalents of $91.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents for this quarter was negatively impacted by the timing of certain payments and receipts of reimbursement expenses of approximately $10 million.\nQ1 2018 and Recent Pipeline and Publication Highlights\nComplete Results from the Phase 3 TANGO-1 Data for Vabomere Published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) 2 nd Pivotal Phase 3 Baxdela ABSSSI Trial Data Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases 12 Presentations at ECCMID 2018 including six from Vabomere TANGO-2 trial, as well as new in vitro and in vivo findings for Baxdela and a pyrrolocytosine lead molecule Pyrrolocytosine compound RX-P2382 against ESKAPE pathogens at ECCMID 2018 TANGO-2 Trial at ECCMID 2018, highlighting outcomes in vulnerable patient populations Discovery Platform Oral Presentations at ECCMID 2018 and American Society for Microbiology (ASM Microbe) Highlighting Progress Towards Leads for Drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Multidrug- and Extremely Drug-resistant ESKAPE Pathogens\n2018 Upcoming Potential Catalysts\nPivotal Phase 3 data for Baxdela in CABP Vabomere EMA regulatory approval decision TANGO-2 additional data and potential publication Additional ex-U.S. submissions for Baxdela in Central and South America Ex-U.S. partnership opportunities for Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin for Injection IND-enabling studies for the lead ESKAPE compound\nConference Call and Webcast\nMelinta’s earnings conference call for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 will be broadcast at 4:30pm EDT on May 8, 2018.

Visit www.melinta.com for more information.\nAs more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the former private company Melinta was determined to be the accounting acquirer in our November 2017 reverse merger with Cempra and, accordingly, historical financial information for the first quarter of 2017 presented in this press release reflects the standalone former private company Melinta and, therefore, period-over-period comparisons may not be meaningful.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, basis, we have included information about non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non‑GAAP financial measure, as a useful operating metric. We believe that the presentation of these non‑GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provides supplementary information to analysts, investors, lenders, and our management in assessing the Company’s performance and results from period to period. These non‑GAAP measures closely align with the way management measures and evaluates the Company’s performance. These non‑GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non‑GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock‑based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of our warrant liability, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related costs, and other adjustments, including severance. Non‑GAAP financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non‑GAAP measures used by other companies.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this communication constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act and are usually identified by the use of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will,” and variations of such words or similar expressions. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act and are making this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved.

Many of these factors that will determine actual results are beyond Melinta’s ability to control or predict.\nOther risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and in other filings that Melinta makes and will make with the SEC.
