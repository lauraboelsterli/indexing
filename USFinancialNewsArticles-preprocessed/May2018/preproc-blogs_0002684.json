His leaving date will be confirmed in due course, Lloyd’s said in a release.\nShare this: CFO MOVES Previous The Morning Ledger: U.S. Companies Squeezed by Rising Commodity Prices Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Talent Shortages Create Risk of Missed Opportunities: CFO Signals Anticipating higher investment post tax reform, North American CFOs voiced very strong internal concerns about driving initiatives and securing the talent they need, according to Deloitte’s first-quarter 2018 CFO Signals™ survey. Talent concerns have topped CFOs’ list of internal risks for many quarters, and their focus on talent acquisition, quality, and retention seems to have intensified. Despite talent constraints, 69% of the 155 CFOs responding to the survey say now is a good time to be taking greater risk—up from 63% in Q4 2017, and a new survey high.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
