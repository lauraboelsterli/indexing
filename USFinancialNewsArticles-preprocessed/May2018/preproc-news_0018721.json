    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Core Molding Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: CMT) (\"Core Molding\" or the \"Company\") today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"The Company recorded strong sales growth compared to the same period of last year driven by the first quarter 2018 acquisition of Horizon Plastics International, Inc. (\"Horizon Plastics\"), increased demand from North American heavy-duty truck customers and higher tooling sales,\" said Kevin Barnett, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Net sales, including Horizon Plastics net sales of $14.7 million, increased $26.3 million or 72% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Excluding Horizon Plastics, net sales increased 32%. Supporting our strategic objectives, Horizon Plastics expands our process and material offerings and increases the number of end markets we serve. As a result of the acquisition, for the first time in Core Molding's history, our non-truck sales represent approximately one-half of our total sales.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017:\nNet sales were $63.0 million compared to $36.7 million. Product sales were $59.7 million compared to $36.3 million. Gross margin was 12.5% compared to 17.7%. Selling, general and administrative expense were $6.8 million compared to $3.9 million. Operating income was $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million. Net income was $0.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share.\nFirst quarter 2018 gross margin of 12.5% was lower than prior year's gross margin of 17.7%. The Company continued to see pressure on gross margin, primarily due to higher raw material and labor costs and increased manufacturing inefficiencies. Raw material cost increases have continued across multiple commodities and multiple vendors, driven primarily by underlying cost pressures while labor costs have increased due to tightening labor market conditions. The rapid ramp up in demand by our customers and the launch of multiple new business programs has caused manufacturing inefficiencies, including hiring, training, overtime, contract labor and premium freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the Horizon Plastics acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company incurred one-time acquisition transaction costs and will have ongoing operating costs of the new entity along with the amortization costs of the intangible assets acquired.\nThe one-time acquisition transaction costs negatively impacted net income by $0.9 million ($1.3 million pre-tax), or $0.12 per share. Excluding the one-time costs, the Company's net income would have been $1.4 million, or $0.19 per share. The Horizon Plastics acquisition, excluding one-time transaction costs, contributed earnings per share for the quarter of $0.07.\nFinancial Position at March 31, 2018:\nCash and cash equivalents of $2.6 million. Total assets of $195.1 million. Total debt of $54.5 million. Stockholders' equity of $104.0 million.\nOutlook\nBarnett stated, \"Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018, we expect continued sales growth due to the acquisition of Horizon Plastics and further increases in certain key markets. Although the North American heavy-duty truck market is a smaller percent of net sales than in the past, the market remains our largest. Industry analysts are projecting 2018 heavy-duty truck productions levels to be 28% higher than 2017 which should have a positive impact on the Company's 2018 net sales. We anticipate that raw material costs will remain elevated throughout the year. We also expect that tight labor conditions will continue to put pressure on wages and incremental hiring. Our primary focus is on improving our manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ramp up in volumes and the multiple new program launches. We are highly committed to mitigating the effects of these costs and improving gross margin as the year progresses.\"\nBarnett concluded, \"We are seeing significant top-line growth as a result of our recent acquisition and strong organic growth from existing customers including multiple new program launches. We are excited that we have positioned the company with a broad offering of capabilities and look forward to working with our diverse customer base to meet their growing needs. With the Horizon Plastics acquisition, we anticipate annual revenues for the first time in the Company's history to exceed $200 million in 2018. Although we are currently experiencing operational challenges related to our strong sales growth, we expect to work through these challenges and remain optimistic in our ability to deliver long-term financial performance consistent with our historical levels.\"\nDividend\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on May 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 22, 2018.\nAbout Core Molding Technologies, Inc.\nCore Molding Technologies, Inc. is a manufacturer of sheet molding compound (SMC) and molder of fiberglass reinforced thermoset and thermoplastic materials.
