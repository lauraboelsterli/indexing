    "text": "DENVER, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Birner Dental Management Services, Inc. (OTCQX: BDMS), business services provider of PERFECT TEETH® dental practices, announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, revenue increased $161,000, or 1.0%, to $15.8 million compared to $15.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") decreased $385,000, or 49.6%, to $392,000. This result includes $66,000 of one-time expenses related to the accounting and valuation consulting services the Company utilized in connection with the $5,000,000 financing completed in December 2017. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $253,000 to $(478,000) compared to $(225,000) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Loss per share increased to $(0.25) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $(0.12) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company had capital expenditures of $126,000 and decreased bank debt outstanding by approximately $125,000.\nThe Company continues to experience strong patient flow with new patient visits up 5.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and total patient visits up 4.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Company had 107 dentists at March 31, 2018 compared to 112 dentists at December 31, 2017 and 102 dentists at March 31, 2017.\nThe company was unable to convert its strong patient flow to earnings due to the slow ramp in productivity from new dental professionals and decreases in hygiene and oral surgery revenues. The Company expects productivity of new dentists to increase with time and a recently hired hygiene director to assist with hygienist productivity.\nBirner Dental Management Services, Inc. acquires, develops, and manages geographically dense dental practice networks in select markets in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. As of March 31, 2018, the Company managed 68 dental offices under the PERFECT TEETH® name.\nThe Company previously announced it would conduct a conference call to review results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. MT. In addition to current operating results, the teleconference may include discussion of management's expectations of future financial and operating results. To participate in this conference call, dial in to 1-888-298-3465 and refer to Confirmation Code 9279206 approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled time. If you are unable to join the conference call on May 15, 2018, the rebroadcast number is 1-888-203-1112 with the pass code of 9279206. This rebroadcast will be available through May 29, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Disclosures\nThis press release includes a non-GAAP financial measure with respect to Adjusted EBITDA.

However, the Company believes that it may be useful to an investor in evaluating the Company's ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for this purpose. Investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss can be made by adding depreciation and amortization expense - offices, depreciation and amortization expense – Corporate, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense, net and income tax benefit to net loss as in the table below.\nQuarters\nEnded March 31,\n2017\n2018\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA:\nNet loss\n($225,059)\n($477,991)\nAdd back:\nDepreciation and amortization - Offices\n964,802\n778,701\nDepreciation and amortization - Corporate\n46,084\n33,374\nStock-based compensation expense\n35,236\n52,976\nInterest expense, net\n72,423\n164,143\nIncome tax benefit\n(116,663)\n(159,332)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$776,823\n$391,871\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/birner-dental-management-services-inc-announces-2018-first-quarter-financial-results-300648027.html\nSOURCE Birner Dental Management Services, Inc.",
