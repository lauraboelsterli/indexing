    "text": "On Track to Report Data from Part B of its Phase 2 Study of Palovarotene for Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva This Quarter\nEnrollment in Phase 3 MOVE Trial On Track, Phase 2 MO-Ped Trial Underway\nMONTREAL, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:CMTA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company innovating new treatments for people with ultra-rare bone disorders and other diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on recent progress and upcoming milestones.\n“During the first quarter of 2018, we continued to make significant progress with our palovarotene clinical programs,” said Clarissa Desjardins, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer. “Enrollment in our MOVE Trial is on track, and we recently initiated our MO-Ped Trial, which, to our knowledge, is the first-ever clinical trial of a pharmacologic treatment for MO, a debilitating and life-altering disorder. Additionally, we are on track to announce preliminary data from the Part B extension of our Phase 2 trial of palovarotene for FOP this quarter. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress this year as we continue our work to bring this potential treatment to patients.”\nRecent Progress and Upcoming Milestones\nIn April 2018, Clementia announced the start of the MO-Ped Trial, its Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of palovarotene, an RARγ agonist, for the treatment of pediatric patients with multiple osteochondromas, or MO, also known as multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE). The MO-Ped Trial is an international, multi-center, placebo-controlled study evaluating the rate of new osteochondromas (OCs) as assessed by whole body MRI, and is designed to potentially support registration in this indication. Clementia anticipates reporting preliminary data, including additional 12-week flare-up data as well as 12-month, whole body CT scan data, from the Part B open-label extension of its ongoing Phase 2 study of palovarotene for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, in the second quarter of 2018. The MOVE Trial, evaluating palovarotene in the first-ever global Phase 3 trial for FOP, is currently enrolling patients worldwide and is on track to complete enrollment by the end of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results (all amounts are presented in U.S. dollars)\nCash : As of March 31, 2018, Clementia had cash and investments of $131.6 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses : R&D expenses were $11.0 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2017. Increases in R&D expenses were primarily due to increases in: clinical studies and CRO related activities as a result of patient enrollment in the MOVE Trial and preparatory activities for the MO-Ped Trial with patient enrollment commencing in April 2018; manufacturing activities to meet clinical supply requirements of the MOVE and MO-Ped studies; non-clinical research activities to support future ocular studies and other potential indications; and personnel and related expenses in support of increased development activities. General and administrative (G&A) expenses : G&A expenses were $2.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2017. Increases in G&A expenses were primarily due to higher personnel and related costs to support the continued growth of the Company and an increase in pre-commercial marketing activities. Net Loss : Clementia reported net losses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $13.2 million ($0.42 per share), compared to $41.3 million ($17.48 per share) for the same period in 2017. The decrease in net loss quarter over quarter was largely driven by non-cash financial expenses primarily due to the re-measurement at fair value of the preferred shares embedded derivative in 2017 as compared to 2018. With the successful completion of the Company’s IPO in August 2017, all classes of preferred shares were converted into common shares and as such, gains or losses on the re-measurement of embedded derivatives at fair value and the accretion expenses ended in the third quarter of 2017.\nAbout Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nClementia is a clinical-stage company innovating new treatments for people with ultra-rare bone disorders and other diseases with high medical need.
