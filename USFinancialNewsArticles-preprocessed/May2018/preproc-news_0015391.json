    "text": "(Adds comment on Berkshire's future, cyber risk)\n WELLS FARGO SCANDAL\n\"Wells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives, and it's just that they just had the wrong incentives. ... The fact that you are going to have problems at some large institutions is not unique ... I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a co ... going forward is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes. We have a large unrealized gain (in the stock). I like it as an investment. (The CEO) is correcting mistakes made by other people.\"\nON long,\nON BERKSHIRE IN THE FUTURE\n\"I think the reputation of Berkshire being a good home for companies ... I don't think that's dependent on me and Charlie.\"\nON RISKS OF CYBER ATTACKS\n\"Frankly I don't think we or anybody else really knows what they're doing when writing cyber (insurance policies). We don't know what the implications of the policies will be ... We have a pretty good idea of (the risk of) a quake in California or a (Category) 3-4 hurricane. We don't know what we're doing in cyber and we ... don't want to be a pioneer on this ... we don't want to be no 1 , 2, or 3 on exposure (to it).\"\n ",
