(\"Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted.\nOperational Overview\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nChange\nOunces produced\nSilver\n7,428\n6,648\n11.7 %\nGold\n79,657\n83,778\n(4.9)%\nOunces sold\nSilver\n6,343\n5,225\n21.4 %\nGold\n69,973\n88,397\n(20.8)%\nSales price per ounce\nSilver\n$\n16.73\n$\n17.45\n(4.1)%\nGold\n$\n1,330\n$\n1,208\n10.1 %\nCash costs per ounce 1\nSilver 1\n$\n4.49\n$\n4.54\n(1.1)%\nGold 1\n$\n399\n$\n391\n2.0 %\nCash operating margin per ounce 1\nSilver 1\n$\n12.24\n$\n12.91\n(5.2)%\nGold 1\n$\n931\n$\n817\n14.0 %\nRevenue\n$\n199,252\n$\n197,951\n0.7 %\nNet earnings\n$\n68,123\n$\n61,224\n11.3 %\nPer share\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.14\n7.1 %\nAdjusted net earnings 1\n$\n69,945\n$\n61,224\n14.2 %\nPer share 1\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.14\n13.9 %\nOperating cash flows\n$\n125,340\n$\n119,923\n4.5 %\nPer share 1\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.27\n3.7 %\nDividends declared 1\n$\n39,852\n$\n30,906\n28.9 %\nPer share\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.07\n28.6 %\nAll amounts in thousands except gold ounces produced and sold, per ounce amounts and per share amounts.\nHighlights\nThe increase in attributable silver production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to higher production from the San Dimas mine, partially offset with the expiry of the Cozamin silver purchase agreement on April 4, 2017. The decrease in attributable gold production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was a result of lower production at the Minto and Sudbury mines. The increase in silver sales volume was due to a combination of increased production and relative changes to payable silver produced but not yet delivered to Wheaton. The decrease in gold sales volume was primarily the result of negative changes in the balance of payable gold produced but not yet delivered to Wheaton coupled with the decreased production levels at the Minto and Sudbury mines. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.09 per common share. This represents an increase of 29% relative to the comparable period in 2017.\nSubsequent to the Quarter\nOn May 10, 2018, First Majestic Silver Corp. (\"First Majestic\") announced that they had closed the previously announced acquisition of Primero Mining Corp. (\"Primero\"). In connection with this acquisition, the Company has terminated the existing San Dimas silver purchase agreement and entered into a new San Dimas precious metal purchase agreement with First Majestic. As it relates to the ongoing dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency (the \"CRA\"), the Tax Court of Canada has scheduled the trial to commence in mid-September 2019 for a two-month period. On April 25, 2018, Wheaton participated in a strategic private placement with Tradewind Markets, Inc. (\"Tradewind\"), a financial technology company that uses blockchain to streamline digital gold trading.\n\"Wheaton has had a solid start to 2018 with our core assets performing better than expected, demonstrating the inherent quality of our portfolio,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wheaton Precious Metals. \"We are encouraged by the sharp rebound in production at San Dimas and welcome First Majestic as a partner. With this strong foundation in place, we continue to advance a number of new opportunities for additional accretive growth that we believe will deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\"\nFinancial Review\nRevenues\nRevenue was $199 million in the first quarter of 2018, on sales volume of 6.3 million ounces of silver and 70,000 ounces of gold. This represents a 1% increase from the $198 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to (i) a 21% increase in the number of silver ounces sold, coupled with (ii) a 10% increase in the average realized gold price ($1,330 in Q1 2018 compared with $1,208 in Q1 2017); partially offset by (iii) a 21% decrease in the number of gold ounces sold and (iv) a 4% decrease in the average realized silver price ($16.73 in Q1 2018 compared with $17.45 in Q1 2017).\nCosts and Expenses\nAverage cash costs¹ in the first quarter of 2018 were $4.49 per silver ounce sold and $399 per gold ounce sold, as compared with $4.54 per silver ounce and $391 per gold ounce during the comparable period of 2017. This resulted in a cash operating margin¹ of $12.24 per silver ounce sold and $931 per gold ounce sold, a decrease of 5% per silver ounce sold and an increase of 14% per ounce of gold sold as compared with Q1 2017. The increase in the gold cash operating margin was primarily due to a 10% increase in the average realized gold price in Q1 2018 compared with Q1 2017 while the decrease in the silver cash operating margin was primarily due to a 4% decrease in the average realized silver price during the same period.\nEarnings and Operating Cash Flows\nAdjusted net earnings¹ and cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2018 were $70 million ($0.16 per share) and $125 million ($0.28 per share¹), compared with $61 million ($0.14 per share) and $120 million ($0.27 per share¹) for the same period in 2017, an increase of 14% and 5%, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $116 million of cash on hand and $663 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving term loan (the \"Revolving Facility\").\nCanadian Tax Dispute\nOn September 24, 2015, the Company received Notices of Reassessment (the \"Reassessments\") from the CRA for the 2005-2010 taxation years. The CRA's position in the Reassessments is that the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) relating to income earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased by an amount equal to substantially all of the income earned outside of Canada by the Company's foreign subsidiaries for the 2005-2010 taxation years. Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law and is vigorously defending its tax filing positions.\nOn January 8, 2016, the Company commenced an appeal in the Tax Court of Canada. The Company is currently in the discovery phase of the appeal, with a trial scheduled to commence in mid-September 2019 for a two-month period.\nFirst Quarter Asset Highlights\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, attributable production was 7.4 million ounces of silver and 79,700 ounces of gold, representing an increase of 12% and a decrease of 5%, as compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nOperational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, based upon counterparties' reporting, are as follows:\nSalobo\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Salobo produced 61,500 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 6% relative to the first quarter of 2017 as higher grades were partially offset by lower recovery. The Salobo plant operated at 98% despite a planned shut down for scheduled maintenance in the quarter.\nPeñasquito\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Peñasquito produced 1.4 million ounces of attributable silver, an increase of approximately 8% relative to the first quarter of 2017 as higher grades and recoveries were partially offset by lower throughput. According to Goldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") first quarter of 2018 MD&A, lower throughput at Peñasquito was due to ten days of planned shut downs during the month of February for mill relines and completing all tie-ins for the Pyrite Leach Project (\"PLP\"), which reduced the number of operating days for the mill. Subsequent to the shutdown, Goldcorp reports that new records were established for throughput at the primary crusher and concentrator driven by the continued implementation of a management operating system, which resulted in more consistent ore delivery to the primary crusher. In addition, ongoing mill improvement projects reportedly resulted in higher mill recoveries.\nAccording to Goldcorp, the PLP at Peñasquito was 86% complete as of March 31, 2018, and expected to commence commissioning in the fourth quarter of 2018. The carbon pre-flotation component of the project is reported to have commenced wet commissioning during April 2018. The PLP is reportedly expected to recover approximately 40% of the gold and 48% of the silver currently reporting to the tailings and is expected to add production of approximately 1 million ounces of gold and 44 million ounces of silver over the current life of the mine. As a reminder, Wheaton is entitled to 25% of the silver produced at Peñasquito for the life of mine, or 11 million of the additional 44 million silver ounces.\nAntamina\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Antamina produced 1.3 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 9% relative to the first quarter of 2017 as lower grades were partially offset by higher recovery. As expected, silver grades were lower given mine sequencing in the open pit.\nSan Dimas\nIn the first quarter of 2018, San Dimas produced 1.6 million ounces of attributable silver, an increase of approximately 158% relative to the first quarter of 2017 as first quarter 2017 production was impacted by a strike initiated by the union at San Dimas on February 15, 2017.\nOn May 10, 2018, First Majestic announced that they had closed the previously announced acquisition of Primero. In connection with this acquisition, Wheaton terminated the existing San Dimas silver purchase agreement with Primero (the \"Primero SPA\") and entered into a new precious metals purchase agreement with First Majestic relating to the San Dimas mine (the \"San Dimas PMPA\"). Under the San Dimas PMPA: Wheaton is entitled to 25% of gold production plus an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of silver production converted to gold at a fixed gold to silver exchange ratio of 70:1 from the San Dimas mine; for each ounce of gold delivered, Wheaton will pay to First Majestic a production payment equal to the lesser of US$600/oz, subject to a 1% annual inflationary adjustment, and the prevailing market price; and First Majestic has provided a corporate guarantee and security limited to San Dimas assets. As part of the transaction, in addition to the new stream, Wheaton has received 20,914,590 First Majestic common shares. 2 Upon termination of the Primero SPA, the Company will reflect a gain on the disposal of the Primero SPA and will reflect the San Dimas PMPA as a component of Other gold interests. The Company's guarantee of the Primero credit facility was also terminated concurrent with closing of the acquisition.\nSudbury\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Vale's Sudbury mines produced 6,500 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 29% relative to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower throughput. According to Vale's first quarter of 2018 MD&A, the decrease in throughput was primarily due to the extended unscheduled maintenance at the Coleman mine as well as the cessation of mining activities at the Stobie mine since the second quarter of 2017. Vale reports that the Coleman mine was in a maintenance shutdown since November 2017 but returned to production in April 2018.\nConstancia\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Constancia produced 0.6 million ounces of attributable silver and 3,300 ounces of attributable gold, an increase of approximately 20% and 36%, respectively, relative to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher throughput. As per Hudbay Mineral Inc.'s (\"Hudbay\") news release dated March 26, 2018, although negotiations to secure surface rights over the Pampacancha deposit continue to progress and Hudbay has been granted access to the land to carry out early-works activities, they anticipate mining of this high-grade satellite deposit to commence in 2019, a one-year delay. In the interim, Hudbay will reportedly continue to mine higher-grade ore from the main Constancia pit. As the mining of the Pampacancha deposit has been delayed beyond 2018, Wheaton will be entitled to an increased portion of gold from Hudbay starting in 2019. Based on the current market price of gold, the additional deliveries due in 2019 will have a net value to the Company of approximately $7 million.\nOther Silver\nIn the first quarter of 2018, total Other Silver attributable production was 2.4 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 11% relative to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of production from Cozamin as the Cozamin silver purchase agreement with Capstone Mining Corp. (\"Capstone\") expired on April 4, 2017.\nOther Gold\nIn the first quarter of 2018, total Other Gold attributable production was 8,400 ounces, a decrease of approximately 41% relative to the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was due primarily to lower production at Minto due to lower grade mill feed during the quarter.\nAs per Capstone's news release dated February 2, 2018, Capstone has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to sell its Minto mine to Pembridge Resources plc. Capstone expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nDevelopment Update – Pascua Lama\nAccording to Barrick Gold Corporation's (\"Barrick\") first quarter of 2018 MD&A, Barrick has suspended work on the prefeasibility study for a potential underground project at Pascua- Lama as it did not meet Barrick's investment criteria and will focus on adjusting the project closure plan for surface infrastructure on the Chilean side of the project, in line with legal requirements. Barrick will reportedly continue to evaluate opportunities to de-risk the project while maintaining Pascua-Lama as an option for development in the future if economics improve, and related risks can be mitigated.\nThe Pascua-Lama silver purchase agreement had a carrying value at March 31, 2018 of $254 million. If the requirements of the completion test have not been satisfied by the completion test deadline of June 30, 2020, the Company may, within 90 days of such date, elect to terminate the Pascua-Lama silver purchase agreement in which case the Company will be entitled to a return of the original upfront cash payment of $625 million less the cash flows received relative to silver deliveries from the Lagunas Norte, Veladero, and Pierina mines. As at March 31, 2018, the Company has received approximately 19.5 million ounces related to silver production from these mines, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $370 million, resulting in a refundable balance of approximately $255 million.\nProduced But Not Yet Delivered 3\nAs at March 31, 2018, payable ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered 3 amounted to 4.8 million payable silver ounces and 84,800 payable gold ounces, representing an increase of 0.3 million payable silver ounces and 5,300 payable gold ounces during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. Payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased primarily as a result of increases related to the San Dimas and Peñasquito silver interests partially offset by a decrease at the Antamina silver interest. Payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered increased primarily as a result of increases related to the Salobo and 777 gold interests. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the Wheaton Precious Metals group of companies are expected to average approximately two months of annualized production for silver and two to three months for gold but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up and timing of shipments.\nDetailed mine-by-mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Wheaton's consolidated MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section.\nSubsequent to the Quarter\nOn April 25, 2018, the Company made a strategic investment of $1 million by participating in a private placement undertaken by Tradewind, a financial technology company that uses blockchain to streamline digital gold trading. Tradewind has built a technology platform for digitizing the trading, settlement, and ownership of precious metals. The Tradewind platform combines exchange technology with Vaultchain™ Gold, Tradewind's blockchain technology tailored for precious metals.\nDividend\nSecond Quarterly Dividend\nThe second quarterly cash dividend for 2018 of US$0.09 will be paid to holders of record of Wheaton Precious Metals common shares as of the close of business on May 25, 2018, and will be distributed on or about June 7, 2018.\nUnder the Company's dividend policy, the quarterly dividend per common share will be equal to 30% of the average cash generated by operating activities in the previous four quarters divided by the Company's then outstanding common shares, all rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nThe Company has previously implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (\"DRIP\"). Participation in the DRIP is optional. For the purposes of this second quarterly dividend, the Company has elected to issue common shares under the DRIP through treasury at a 3% discount to the Average Market Price, as defined in the DRIP. However, the Company may, from time to time, in its discretion, change or eliminate the discount applicable to Treasury Acquisitions, as defined in the DRIP, or direct that such common shares be purchased in Market Acquisitions , as defined in the DRIP , at the prevailing market price, any of which would be publicly announced.\nThe DRIP and enrollment forms are available for download on the Company's website at www.wheatonpm.com , accessible by quick links directly from the home page, and can also be found in the 'investors' section, under the 'dividends' tab.\nRegistered shareholders may also enroll in the DRIP online through the plan agent's self-service web portal at: https://www.canstockta.com/en/InvestorServices/Investor_Information/Issuer_List/IssuerDetail.jsp?companyCode=1501 .\nBeneficial shareholders should contact their financial intermediary to arrange enrollment. All shareholders considering enrollment in the DRIP should carefully review the terms of the DRIP and consult with their advisors as to the implications of enrollment in the DRIP.\nThis press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer of securities. A registration statement relating to the DRIP has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and may be obtained under the Company's profile on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov . A written copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement may be obtained by contacting the Corporate Secretary of the Company at 1021 West Hastings Street, Suite 3500, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 0C3.\nOutlook\nWheaton's estimated attributable silver and gold production in 2018 is forecast to be approximately 22.5 million silver ounces and 355,000 gold ounces. Estimated average annual attributable silver and gold production over the next five years (including 2018) is anticipated to be approximately 25 million silver ounces and 370,000 gold ounces per year. As a reminder, Wheaton does not include any production from Barrick's Pascua-Lama project or Hudbay's Rosemont project in its estimated average five-year production guidance.\nFrom a liquidity perspective, the $116 million of cash and cash equivalents as at March 31, 2018 combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the $2 billion Revolving Facility and ongoing operating cash flows positions the Company well to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive precious metal stream interests.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nA conference call and webcast will be held Friday, May 11, 2018, starting at 11:00 am (Eastern Time) to discuss these results.

There can be no assurance that will prove to be accurate and even if events or results described in the are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, Wheaton. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on and are cautioned that actual outcomes may vary. The included herein are for the purpose of providing investors with information to assist them in understanding Wheaton's expected financial and operational performance and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Wheaton does not undertake to update any that are included or incorporated by reference herein, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nCautionary Language Regarding Reserves And Resources\nFor further information on Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources and on Wheaton more generally, readers should refer to Wheaton's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other continuous disclosure documents filed by Wheaton since January 1, 2018, available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Wheaton's Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources are subject to the qualifications and notes set forth therein. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nCautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources: The information contained herein has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. The terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\" and \"probable mineral reserve\" are Canadian mining terms defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") – CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Standards\"). These definitions differ from the definitions in Industry Guide 7 (\"SEC Industry Guide 7\") under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"). Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Also, under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained herein that describes Wheaton's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. United States investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in Wheaton's Form 40-F, a copy of which may be obtained from Wheaton or from http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml .\nIn accordance with the Company's MD&A and financial statements, reference to the Company includes the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wheaton-precious-metals-announces-first-quarter-results-for-2018-and-declares-second-quarterly-dividend-of-2018-300646822.html\nSOURCE Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.",
