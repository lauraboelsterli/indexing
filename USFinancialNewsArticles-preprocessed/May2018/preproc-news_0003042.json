    "text": "LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would be providing more information on the government’s handling of the treatment of Caribbean migrants, seeking to reassure those caught up in a scandal over immigration policies.\nThousands of people from the so-called “Windrush generation” were invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, but some of them and their descendants have been caught out by tighter immigration rules.\n“We will be announcing a package of measure to bring transparency on the issue, to make sure the House (of Commons) is informed - to reassure members of this house - but more importantly to reassure those people who have been directly affected,” May told parliament.
