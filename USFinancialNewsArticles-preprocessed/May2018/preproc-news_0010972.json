AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(In billions, except per share data)\n2017 Actual 2018 Outlook % Change Revenues: GAAP revenues $3.98 $3.31 to $3.385 NM Adjustments (1) (0.46 ) (0.28) Adjusted net revenue $3.52 $3.03 to $3.105 NM Gaming cash advance / other (2) ($0.07 ) $— Network fees (2) — 0.87 Adjusted net revenue plus network fees $3.45 $3.90 to $3.975 13% to 15% Earnings per share (\"EPS\"): GAAP diluted EPS (3) $3.01 $2.99 to $3.19 Adjustments (4) 1.00 2.01 Adjusted diluted EPS $4.01 $5.00 to $5.20 25% to 30% (1) Represents adjustments to revenues for gross-up related payments (included in operating expenses) associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefit to the company. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, no adjustment is necessary for our European wholesale business as GAAP revenues in 2018 are presented net of these payments. The 2018 Outlook adjustment is $0.16 billion lower as a result of this change. See footnote 2.\nAmounts also include adjustments to eliminate the effect of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments for software-related contract liabilities associated with the acquisition of ACTIVE Network.\n(2) Global Payments adopted ASC 606, on January 1, 2018. The new accounting standard changed the presentation of certain amounts that we pay to third parties, including payment networks. This change in presentation affected our reported GAAP revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and had no effect on operating income.\nFor 2017, payment network fees were presented within operating expenses and in 2018 payment network fees are presented as a reduction of revenues. As a result, adjusted net revenue plus network fees for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are presented on a basis that is comparable to the prior year.\nAdjusted net revenue plus network fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes an adjustment for our gaming cash advance solutions to present it on a basis that is comparable to the current year.\n(3) ASC 606 also changes the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our customer arrangements, the effect of which is reflected in the outlook for GAAP diluted EPS for 2018.\n(4) Adjustments to 2017 GAAP diluted EPS include the ACTIVE Network revenue adjustment described above, acquisition related amortization expense of $2.19, share-based compensation expense of $0.25 and net other items of $0.68, including acquisition and integration expense of $0.61. Adjustments to 2017 GAAP diluted EPS also includes the effect of these adjustments on noncontrolling interests and income taxes, as applicable. In addition, these adjustments reflect the removal of income tax benefit of $1.02 representing the effects of the effects of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nNM - Not Meaningful\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGlobal Payments supplements revenues, income and EPS information determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures, and other measures, with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue and adjusted net revenue plus network fees more closely reflect the economic benefits to the company's core business and, in the case of adjusted net revenue, allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses.\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation and certain other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6 and 7. Beginning in 2018, adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue plus network fees. The tax rate used in determining the net income impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005423/en/\nGlobal Payments Inc.\nInvestor contact:\nHeather Ross, 770-829-8478\ninvestor.relations@globalpay.com\nor\nMedia contact:\nLaura Coerper, 770-829-8755\nmedia.relations@globalpay.com\nSource: Global Payments Inc.",
