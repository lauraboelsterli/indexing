    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 8:46 AM / Updated an hour ago Heavy casualties as blast rocks Afghan city of Kandahar Sarwar Amani , Qadir Sediqi 3 Min Read\nKANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A blast in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Tuesday caused dozens of casualties, officials said, as fighting across the country showed no sign of easing off during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\nThere was some confusion about the cause of the Kandahar explosion, which sent a huge cloud of dust and smoke into the air. Officials initially said it was caused by a bomb packed into a minibus but later said the explosives were in two containers stored in an area of mechanics workshops.\nNematullah Barak, a head of the Mirwais hospital in Kandahar, said 16 dead and 38 wounded, including several children, had been brought in but the final total could be higher as ambulances were still at the scene.\nThe NDS intelligence service said in a statement the explosives were discovered in a large open yard of workshops but went off before they could be defused.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. Related Coverage Elite U.S. special operations commander picked to lead Afghan war\nWitnesses said repair crews were at the site, clearing large quantities of rubble and debris from the explosion.\nThe casualties add to the hundreds of people who have been killed or wounded in bomb attacks since the beginning of the year.\nMany have been in the capital, Kabul, but provincial cities have also been hit as the Taliban, seeking to reimpose hardline Islamic rule, have stepped up fighting across the country.
