    "text": "BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., May 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edge Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:EDGE) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018 were $75.0 million, compared with $88.1 million as of December 31, 2017. Information on Edge’s ongoing financial obligations and working capital can be found in Edge’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOperating Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to an increase in external expenses related to EG-1962 clinical development, and estimated study close down costs for the NEWTON 2 study. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million in the comparable period in 2017. The increase in G&A expense was largely due to increases in personnel-related costs, legal fees, professional fees and marketing costs.\nNet Loss: Net loss of $20.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 included non-cash impairment charges of $2.7 million related to the write-down of machinery and equipment, and compared to net loss of $12.2 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nReview of Strategic Alternatives\nOn April 30, 2018, Edge announced that its Board of Directors is conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value. In conjunction with the exploration of strategic alternatives, Edge intends to streamline its operations in order to preserve its cash resources. Edge has retained Piper Jaffray & Co. to act as its financial advisor to assist with this review process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this review include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, business combination or other strategic transaction involving Edge.\nThere is no defined timeline for completion of the review process. There is no assurance that this review will result in Edge pursuing any transaction or that a transaction, if pursued, will be completed. Edge does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments regarding the strategic review process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.\nAbout Edge Therapeutics, Inc.\nEdge Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize novel, hospital-based therapies capable of transforming treatment paradigms for the management of acute, life-threatening conditions.
