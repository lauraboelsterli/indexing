    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - ‮Saudi air defenses‬ ‮intercepted‬ and destroyed ‮a ballistic missile‬ fired by Yemen’s Houthi movement over the southern city of Jazan, the Saudi-led coalition said on Monday.\nEarlier, the Houthis said the group had fired a Badr-1 ballistic missile at Jazan’s airport, without giving any further details.\nThe Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital, Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nA U.S.-backed military alliance intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to fight against the Houthis on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group.\nCoalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said Saudi air defense forces destroyed the missile over Jazan and accused the Houthis of targeting residential areas, according to a report from the official Saudi Press Agency.\nThe Houthis have fired a salvo of missiles at Saudi Arabia in recent months, including the capital, Riyadh, while the coalition launched thousands of air strikes against Houthi-held areas, killing hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets.\nReporting by Nayera Abdullah; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Paul Tait\n ",
