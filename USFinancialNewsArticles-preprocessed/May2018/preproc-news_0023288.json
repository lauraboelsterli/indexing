    "text": "LUSAKA (Reuters) - Protesters hurled petrol bombs at three Zambian-registered trucks in South Africa, leaving one of the drivers with life-threatening injuries, the second attack on foreign vehicles there in two weeks, officials said.\nZambia urged South Africa’s government to do more to protect its nationals, saying the assaults could hurt international trade.\nPolice said at least some of the attacks were carried out by people angered by truck companies hiring foreign drivers.\nThree trucks were destroyed by petrol bombs in two separate attacks in Limpopo Province on Wednesday evening, Zambia’s High Commission in Pretoria said in a statement.\nOne of the Zambian drivers was attacked as he drove to Groblersbrug, a border crossing into Botswana, it added.\nLast week attackers burned around 30 foreign-owned trucks more than 800km (500 miles) further south on the N3 toll road in KwaZulu-Natal province, the High Commission said on Thursday.\nAt least three of those trucks were Zambian, it added. Police said they did not know the nationalities of the other drivers.\n“There were many trucks burnt ... The protesters were complaining that truck owners are only hiring foreign nationals,” said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele.\nZambia’s High Commissioner, Emmanuel Mwamba, said the attacks could “halt the movement of goods and services between the two countries.”\nMost of Zambia’s copper exports reach the international market via South Africa’s roads and through its port at Durban.\nZambia’s got 27.5 percent of its imports from South Africa in March, Central Statistical Office data shows.\nReporting by Chris Mfula in Lusaka and additional reporting by Patricia Aruo in Johannesburg; Editing by James Macharia and Andrew Heavens\n ",
