    "text": "Niko Goodrum had a two-run home run, Michael Fulmer recorded his first win since April 7 and the Detroit Tigers snapped a five-game losing streak by defeating the host Minnesota Twins 4-1 on Wednesday afternoon at Target Field.\nGoodrum added a double and another run scored after blasting his fifth homer of the season.\nVictor Martinez supplied two hits, a run scored and an RBI, while Nicholas Castellanos recorded his fourth consecutive multi-hit game and his team-best 19th of the season. He has at least one hit in 12 of his last 16 games, including nine extra-base hits.\nFulmer (2-3) limited the Twins to one run on four hits while walking three and striking out five. He threw 112 pitches, the second-most in his career. Shane Greene pitched the ninth for his 11th save for the Tigers, who salvaged the finale of a three-game series.\nTwins starter Kyle Gibson (1-3) allowed three runs on six hits while walking one and striking out three. Eddie Rosario led the Twins’ offense with three hits and an RBI. Minnesota saw its three-game winning streak snapped.\nThe Tigers scored a run in the first when Leonys Martin led off with an infield single, advanced on Castellanos’ double and scored on Martinez’s sacrifice fly.\nMinnesota evened the score in the bottom of the inning. Brian Dozier led off with a deep shot to center field. That ball landed in a seam near the top of the wall and stayed there. It was ruled a ground-rule double, and Dozier scored on Rosario’s one-out single.\nDetroit took a 3-1 lead in the fourth. Martinez led off with a single, and Goodrum followed with his homer to right field.\nThe Twins had two baserunners against Joe Jimenez in the eighth, but a double play helped the Tigers escape unscathed.\nDetroit added an insurance run against Ryan Pressly in the ninth when JaCoby Jones singled home Goodrum, who led off the inning with a double.\nThe Tigers finished their seven-game road trip with a 2-5 record. They open a 12-game homestand on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
