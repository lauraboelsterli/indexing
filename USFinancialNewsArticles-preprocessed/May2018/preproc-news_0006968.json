The main thing — we want to get peace. ... We'll see,\" Trump told reporters during an event at the White House. \"We're setting up meetings right now and I think it's probably going to be announced over the next couple of days — location and date.\"\nAsked later Tuesday about Trump's comments, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the list of potential meeting locations has been \"narrowed.\" She said she expects an announcement \"soon.\"\nOn Friday, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-In met about the denuclearization of North Korea , but did not give any details about how they planned to achieve it.
