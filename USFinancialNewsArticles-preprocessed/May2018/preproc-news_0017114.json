    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) to abide by their commitments after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Washington would withdraw.\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres takes part in the 37th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Havana, Cuba, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Guterres said in a statement that he was “deeply concerned” by Trump’s decision.\n“It is essential that all concerns regarding the implementation of the plan be addressed through the mechanisms established in the JCPOA. Issues not directly related to the JCPOA should be addressed without prejudice to preserving the agreement and its accomplishments,” Guterres said.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
