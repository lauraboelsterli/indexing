    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police are searching five locations linked to ousted Prime Minister Najib Razak, police director Amar Singh told Reuters on Thursday.\nSingh, the head of the commercial crime department, did not provide any other details.\nAt least a dozen armed policemen entered Najib’s home late on Wednesday after he returned from prayers at a mosque, Reuters witnesses said. They seized handbags and few other personal items, a lawyer for Najib said.\nThe search there was continuing into the morning.\nOther than Najib’s private residence, police are also searching the prime minister’s office and the official residence, The Star newspaper reported. Two places at a condominium where Najib’s family is believed to own property were also searched, it said.\nReporting by A. Ananthalakshmi; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n ",
