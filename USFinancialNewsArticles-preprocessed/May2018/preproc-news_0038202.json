    "text": "Published: May 15, 2018 12:33 p.m. ET Share\nCoinbase plans to allow trading firms to place servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location Getty Images\nBy Alexander Osipovich\nThe bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.82% market is about to get a lot faster. Coinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading.\nHigh-frequency trading, or HFT firms, use computers to buy and sell stocks, futures and other assets in the blink of eye. They accounted for 55% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market last year, according to research firm Tabb Group LLC, but they have only recently begun to dabble in cryptocurrencies.\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times. Coinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location. HFT firms often put their servers next to the computers that power exchanges like Nasdaq Inc. or the New York Stock Exchange, to minimize the split-second delays associated with transmitting data back and forth between the trading firm and the exchange.\nAccording to Coinbase, the plan will benefit customers by reducing bid-ask spreads—the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset. Advocates of HFT say the growth of high-speed trading in the stock market over the past two decades helped drive bid-ask spreads down to just one penny in many big stocks. But Coinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players. ",
