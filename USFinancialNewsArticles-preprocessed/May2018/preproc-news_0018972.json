    "text": "Apple hit a record high Monday, surpassing $185 for the first time, as Warren Buffett doubled down on his praise for the company.\nShares opened at $185.18, less than a percent up from Friday's close. Apple's previous all-time intraday high came on Friday when the stock hit $184.25.\nBuffett last week revealed his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares — or at least $11 billion worth — in the iPhone maker. The revelation sent Apple to all-time highs and inspired some reciprocal praise from CEO Tim Cook .\nBuffett told CNBC Monday he loves the stock so much, he'd own \"100 percent of it\" if he could . Berkshire is now the third largest holder of Apple, behind Vanguard and BlackRock.\nAs of Monday's open, Apple is up nearly 10 percent for the year and nearly 25 percent in the 12-month period.",
