Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and Haiti's President Jovenel Moise review the honour guard at a welcoming ceremony, in Taipei, Taiwan May 29, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nTaiwan has lost two diplomatic allies in the past month, most recently the West African state of Burkina Faso, which re-established ties with Beijing on Saturday.\nChina claims Taiwan as its own and considers the democratic island to be a wayward province, with no right to state-to-state relations.\nTaiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue and a potential military flashpoint.\nHaiti President Jovenel Moise, along with a 30-member delegation, is visiting amid concern that his country could be among the next to jump ship and establish ties with China. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and Haiti's President Jovenel Moise review the honour guard at a welcoming ceremony, in Taipei, Taiwan May 29, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nEarlier in May, the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, severed ties with Taiwan by formally recognising China.\n“We appreciate Haiti’s long-term support of Taiwan and our international participation in many areas,” Tsai said at a welcoming ceremony outside the presidential office.\n“We look forward to both sides continuing and deepening the mutual help and cooperative partnership, as the two countries’ friendship remains secure forever,” she said.
