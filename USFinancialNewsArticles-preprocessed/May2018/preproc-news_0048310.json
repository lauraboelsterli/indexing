    "text": "MOSCOW, May 24 (Reuters) - Russia needs faster economic growth but not at the expense of macroeconomic and budgetary stability or its currently low level of inflation, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in a CNBC interview released on Thursday.\nA pick-up in economic growth “should not be to the detriment or at the expense of ... macro-stability, low inflation, a well-balanced budget deficit,” Nabiullina said.\nThe Russian economy is expected to grow by between 1.5 and 2.0 percent a year in 2018-2020, she added.
