    "text": "BOSTON, May 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bynder , the global leader in digital asset management (DAM), today announced record results in Q1, closing the quarter with a total of 107 new customers. In addition, Bynder reported record customer retention, accounting for 101 percent net revenue. The company’s substantial growth in Q1 stems from key customer wins, strong retention rates and the strategic acquisition of Webdam , which allows the company to offer two best in class solutions for product specific needs of their own client base.\n“From product innovation to platform growth, Q1 marks a pivotal moment in time for the Bynder solution. We introduced 6 new integrations to the marketplace, processed over 2 million asset uploads and continue to work closely with our customers to create innovative new features,” said Chris Hall, CEO of Bynder. “We closed the quarter out strong by joining forces with Webdam, blending the industry knowledge, technological innovation and geographical strengths of DAM category leaders from EMEA and North America.”\nBynder welcomed several new customers to the platform in Q1, including Jägermeister , Coolblue and Magazine zum Globus AG . Together with Webdam, the company now serves over 1,300 customers and 500,000 users around the globe. In recognition of this growth, Bynder was listed as 20th in The FT 1000: Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies list by Financial Times this April.\nBynder also extended its platform this quarter, introducing a number of new integrations to the marketplace , including Slack , Workfront and Magento . These integrations allow businesses to do even more with their assets, helping teams cut down on unnecessary downloads and share files more seamlessly across the platforms they use daily.\n“From creation to publication, a digital asset can go through countless desks, devices and rounds of review, and can go through many different platforms as well. It’s time to modernize the traditional, siloed asset management cycle,” said Hall. “For us, every file download is an integration that hasn’t been built yet. Our vision is to operate in download-free workflows, where assets travel to team members not through downloads and attachments, but through a connected ecosystem of intelligent endpoints.”\nIn the coming months, Bynder will release a new solution that provides customers with increased insight into the performance of assets and expand its partnership network to more seamlessly integrate with customer experience management solutions.\nAbout Bynder\nBynder is the fastest way to professionally manage digital files. Its award-winning digital asset management (DAM) platform offers marketers a smart way to find and share creative files such as graphics, videos and documents.\nThousands of brand managers, marketers and creatives from global organizations like PUMA, innocent drinks and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines use Bynder to organize company files; edit and approve projects in real time; auto-format and resize files; and make the right content available to others at the click of a button.\nFounded in 2013 by CEO Chris Hall, Bynder has nine global offices located in The Netherlands, USA, Spain, UK and UAE.
