    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Wednesday a U.S. court’s sentencing of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a banker at the Turkish state-controlled Halkbank ( HALKB.IS ), to 32 months in prison was not legitimate or credible due to what it said were fake evidence and incorrect statements during the trial.\nA U.S. judge sentenced Atilla on Wednesday after he was convicted earlier this year of taking part in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions, in a case that has strained ties between Washington and Ankara.\nIn a statement, Turkey’s foreign ministry accused the U.S. court of taking false evidence and statements fabricated by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016, and said Atilla had been sentenced despite being innocent.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
