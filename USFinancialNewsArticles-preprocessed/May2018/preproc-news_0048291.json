    "text": "ROME, May 27 (Reuters) - President Sergio Mattarella summoned Carlo Cottarelli, a former senior director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for talks on Monday, his office said in a statement - a move that suggested he may ask him to head a technocrat government.\nEarlier on Sunday, Mattarella effectively scuttled efforts to form a coalition government supported by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League after he rejected their choice for economy minister.\nMost political parties have said they would not back a technocrat government in parliament and would push for early elections in the autumn if a coalition administration failed to take office.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
