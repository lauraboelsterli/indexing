Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) arrives for a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing evaluating the Intelligence Community Assessment on \"Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n“There is no doubt that Russia undertook an unprecedented effort to interfere with our 2016 elections,” the committee’s Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr, said in a statement issued with its top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner, after a closed hearing with former top intelligence officials.\nRussia has denied seeking to interfere in the election.
