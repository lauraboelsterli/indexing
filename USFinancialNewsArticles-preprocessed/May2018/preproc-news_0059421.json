FILE PHOTO: A bird passes in the foreground as a passenger aircraft makes it's final landing approach towards Heathrow Airport at dawn in west London Britain, April 18, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville\nThe number of drone incidents with aircraft has risen year-on-year from just six in 2014 to 93 in 2017, the government said, and new laws were needed to ensure drones were used safely and responsibly.\n“We are seeing fast growth in the numbers of drones being used, both commercially and for fun,” aviation minister Elizabeth Sugg said on Wednesday.\n“Whilst we want this industry to innovate and grow, we need to protect planes, helicopters and their passengers from the increasing numbers of drones in our skies.”\nDrone users who flout the restrictions, which will come into effect on July 30, could be charged with recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any person in an aircraft. The 400-feet restriction applies to all areas, not just around airports.\nOffenders could be given an unlimited fine, up to five years in prison, or both.\nThe law will be tightened again in November 2019 when owners of drones weighing 250 grammes or more will have to register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and drone pilots will have to take an online safety test, the government said.
