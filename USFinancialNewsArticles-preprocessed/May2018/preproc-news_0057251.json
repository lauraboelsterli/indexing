    "text": "(Reuters) - Fortis Healthcare Ltd ( FOHE.NS ) on Monday said the consortium of Hero Enterprise Investment Office and Burman Family Office, which won a five-way bidding war for the Indian firm, has permitted re-opening the bidding process, amid shareholder concerns over the board’s choice of the underdog.\nFILE PHOTO: A Fortis hospital building is pictured in Gurgaon, India, May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal/File Photo Though permitted to re-open the bidding, Fortis had not yet made a decision on the matter, a spokesperson told Reuters.\nThe board of the cash-strapped company approved the consortium’s offer to invest 18 billion rupees ($266.9 million) earlier this month.\nHowever, investors have been wary of the board’s selection, given the consortium’s offer was much lower than those of Manipal Hospitals Enterprises or Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare Bhd ( IHHH.KL ).\nIn a letter to the company’s board on Monday, the Hero-Burman group acknowledged stakeholders’ preference for re-opening the bidding process.\n“We believe that this situation may have arisen largely on account of the lack of information available to stakeholders,” Hero-Burman said.\nDisapproval from shareholders became evident after they voted out a director last week. Three other directors had resigned ahead of the vote.\nFortis has been in the middle of a five-way bidding war with local and international suitors wanting to invest in the firm or buy it. Manipal sweetened its offer for a fifth time after the Hero-Burman offer was selected, and IHH extended the acceptance period for its offer.\nReporting by Tanvi Mehta in BENGALURU and Zeba Siddiqui in MUMBAI; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Christopher Cushing\n ",
