    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DIRTT Environmental Solutions Ltd. (“DIRTT” or the “Company”) (TSX:DRT), an interior construction company using technology for client-driven design and manufacturing, today announced the appointment of Geoffrey D. Krause, CA, CPA, as its chief financial officer, effective June 4, 2018.\nGeoff brings extensive experience in financial management, including more than 15 years in senior financial executive roles for mid- and large-cap public companies.\n“Geoff has a record of success in financial operations and management for high-growth, high-potential companies, and we’re pleased to welcome him to the DIRTT team,” says Michael Goldstein, interim CEO. “Geoff’s financial skills, business acumen and capital markets experience are an ideal fit for our company and will help us deliver value to shareholders. His public company and North American markets experience will also prove useful as we accelerate our efforts to disrupt the industry with DIRTT’s proprietary construction software platform. We are excited to have him on board and look forward to the contributions he’ll make while bringing additional financial disciplines that support DIRTT’s continued growth.”\nKrause was most recently the CFO at Pure Technologies, a company that develops and manages innovative technologies for critical infrastructure, and which generated approximately 60% of its revenues from U.S. markets. In that role, Krause led the development and execution of an annual strategic planning process and the creation of an organization-wide financial process redesign. Pure was acquired by Xylem Inc. in early 2018 at a 103% premium.\nPreceding his role with Pure, Krause worked with Tervita Corporation— a $6 billion business at that time—which provides the Canadian and U.S. energy industries with waste management, drilling and coring and other environmental services. As Tervita’s vice president of finance, Krause led the operational finance team. The company had undergone a significant growth phase and Krause redesigned and implemented new financial processes to support and sustain that growth.\nKrause succeeds Peter Henry, who joined DIRTT as interim CFO in January 2018. Henry will stay with DIRTT in an advisory capacity for a short time, to help ensure a successful transition.\n“On behalf of the entire DIRTT team, I want to thank Peter for serving as the interim chief financial officer over the past five months, particularly around leading our financial team and the greater company through a time of transition as we prepared for continued growth,” says Goldstein. “Peter’s wealth of experience allowed us the time required to find the ideal person for the permanent CFO position.”\nKrause holds the designations of Certified Public Accountant from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and Chartered Accountant from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta. He also holds a Bachelor of Administration degree with distinction from the University of Regina.\nAbout DIRTT\nDIRTT Environmental Solutions, which stands for Doing it Right This Time, uses proprietary 3D software to design, manufacture and install fully customized prefabricated interiors. The Company's customers in the corporate, government, education and healthcare sectors benefit from DIRTT's precise design and costing; rapid lead times with the highest levels of customization and flexibility; and faster, cleaner construction.
