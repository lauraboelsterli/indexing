    "text": "May 7, 2018 / 1:48 PM / in 14 minutes UPDATE 3-Argentina peso closes down slightly despite rate hike Reuters Staff\n(Updates prices, adds TV for media subscribers)\nBy Caroline Stauffer and Eliana Raszewski\nBUENOS AIRES, May 7 (Reuters) - Argentina’s peso closed slightly weaker on Monday, though analysts remained optimistic the government and central bank had curbed a run on the currency with a massive rate hike and lower fiscal deficit target last week.\nThe local currency opened stronger on Monday but closed down 0.41 percent at 21.97 per U.S. dollar. The Merval stock index also opened higher but later fell 1.4 percent.\nLast week, the peso hit an all-time low of 23 per greenback, prompting the government to announce additional fiscal belt tightening and the central bank to yank its key interest rate up to 40 percent on Friday. The peso closed up 5 percent on Friday but was still down 15 percent for the year.\nThe peso’s slump made Argentines nervous. Many still have strong memories of a 2001 bank run that led to years of hyperinflation, political instability and poverty.\n“The peso may strengthen or weaken ... the idea is that there be little volatility,” Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne said on local television on Sunday night, reminding Argentines that the peso is a free floating currency.\nThe 40 percent rate “can temporarily support an exchange rate of 21.6, but the heavy positioning, loss of credibility, and reputational cost make 22 a new fair rate in our view,” BTG Pactual economists said in a note.\nThe bank forecast an exchange rate of 24 per dollar for the year-end and raised its annual inflation forecast to 24 percent - far higher than the central bank’s target of 15 percent.\nThe issue of credibility is crucial to Argentina, which returned to international capital markets after settling a dispute with holdout creditors after center-right President Mauricio Macri took office in late 2015, ending 12 years of leftist governments.\nArgentina even sold an oversubscribed century bond last year to investors who had praised his policies. Latin America’s No. 3 economy still lacks an investor credit rating and is classified as a frontier rather than an emerging market by Morgan Stanley.\nMarco Lavagna, an opposition congressman from a moderate Peronist party, tweeted on Monday that the expected approval on Wednesday of a long-awaited capital markets reform could also help calm markets. Its passage is seen as an important step to attracting more investment and achieving emerging market status. ‘EXCESSIVE FINANCING COSTS’\nThe central bank, which is not technically independent from the government, had lowered rates earlier in the year, arguing inflation would start falling in May when a series of government mandated price hikes on energy and transportation were scheduled to end. But higher rates abroad and an exodus from emerging markets last week appeared to have caught it off guard.\nDujovne said on Sunday that inflation in May would be lower than 2 percent.\nBefore announcing three emergency rate hikes starting on April 27, the bank tried to prop up the peso by selling nearly $8 billion in dollar reserves on the spot market since March. Friday was the first day the bank did not intervene in two weeks and traders said the bank had not intervened on Monday either.\nAlfredo Blanco, an economist at the University of Cordoba, said the central bank had few options besides raising rates and had successfully stopped a dramatic currency deterioration.\n“I think it will last, although it is necessary to watch the future decisions of the government,” he said. A 40 percent rate “cannot be maintained for very long due to its negative effects on activity,” he added.
