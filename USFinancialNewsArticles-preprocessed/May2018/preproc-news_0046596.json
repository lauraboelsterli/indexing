Right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,\" Mnuchin said in a television interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" in reference to the tentative measures on reducing the trade deficit that the two nations discussed this week. On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.",
