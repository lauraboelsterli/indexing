FILE PHOTO - Davis Cup - Semi-Finals - Belgium vs Australia - Palais 12, Brussels, Belgium - September 17, 2017 Australia's Nick Kyrgios in action during his match against Belgium's David Goffin REUTERS/Yves Herman\n“Unfortunately I have to withdraw from this year’s French Open,” the world number 23 wrote in a message on Twitter.\n“Having consulted with my team and medical experts it is deemed too risky for me to step out and potentially play five sets on clay especially as I have not played a singles match in nearly two months.\n“I’ve worked hard to be ready and desperately wanted to play Roland Garros, which is very special to me but I literally ran out of time.”\nKyrgios was scheduled to take on compatriot Bernard Tomic in the opening round on Monday.
