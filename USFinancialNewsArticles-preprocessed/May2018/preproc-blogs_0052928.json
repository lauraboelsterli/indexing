    "text": "Brazil truckers' strike leads to fuel shortages Published 2 Hours Ago The Associated Press\nSAO PAULO (AP) â€” A truckers' strike is snarling traffic around Brazil and causing fuel shortages that have forced Rio de Janeiro to reduce the number of buses circulating.\nTruckers are protesting rising diesel prices, which have been increasing as oil prices rise and Brazil's real falls against the dollar.\nThursday is the fourth day that truckers have blocked thoroughfares in Latin America's largest country.\nThe strike continued despite state-run oil giant Petrobras' decision a day earlier to reduce diesel prices at refineries by 10 percent. The company said the measure would last for 15 days and give the government time to negotiate an end to the strike.\nThe strike is making fuel scarce. Long lines could be seen at some gas stations, and Rio reduced its bus service by 50 percent Thursday.",
