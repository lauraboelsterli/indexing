Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Serbia's Dusan Lajovic celebrates winning his third round match against Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro REUTERS/Paul Hanna\nDel Potro looked in complete control as he converted two break-point opportunities to take the opening set but Lajovic, ranked 95 in the world, dug deep to stay in the contest.\nA break midway through the second set was enough for Lajovic to force a decider before he wrapped up his first career victory over a top-10 opponent in the tiebreak.\n“It’s for sure my best win, and definitely one of the best matches I’ve played,” the Serbian said. “I still am not believing it 100 percent, but I know I deserved to win today.” Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 10, 2018 Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro reacts during his third round match against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic REUTERS/Paul Hanna\nIn the quarter-finals, Lajovic will meet South Africa’s Kevin Anderson who overcame German Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6(7).\nBritain’s Kyle Edmund followed up his surprise win over Novak Djokovic by defeating world number 10 David Goffin to reach the last eight of an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time in his career. Slideshow (2 Images)\nThe 23-year-old broke his Belgian opponent’s serve twice in the opening set and once in the second, to seal a 6-3 6-3 victory in an hour and 12 minutes.\n“I managed my game very well,” the Briton said. “My game is better the better I manage it and pick the moments not to be aggressive.\n“If I don’t pull the trigger too often, then I play well. It’s about being controlled and relaxed and not worrying too much. Goffin is a top player so I’m very pleased.\n“My new trick is to try and continue that momentum and not just have a good win and not back it up.”\nEdmund will next face Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who achieved a 6-4 6-4 win over compatriot Milos Raonic.\n“It was definitely one of my best days on clay,” said 19-year-old Shapovalov, who is ranked 43rd in the world, 19 places below Raonic. “To be on the court against such a legend for me, and for my country, it was an honour.\n“What (Raonic) does for our country, for tennis, for these past couple years, it’s incredible. To beat him, it was a huge confidence booster for me.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru,; Editing by Neville Dalton",
