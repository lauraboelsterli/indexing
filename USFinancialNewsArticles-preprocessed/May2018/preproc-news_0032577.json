    "text": "MISSION VIEJO, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYnd Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MYND) (“MYnd” or the “Company”), a market leader in reducing costs and improving the delivery of mental health services through the combination of telemedicine and data analytics/artificial (augmented) intelligence, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the second quarter and six months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company continues to integrate its recently acquired Arcadian Telepsychiatry business into its legacy business and is pleased to announce revenues of $459,900 for the second quarter and $581,900 for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared with revenues of $31,900 for the second quarter ended March 31, 2017 and $54,100 for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\n“Telemedicine is one of the fastest growing areas of healthcare services today and directly addresses the shortage of mental health providers and the growing need for behavioral health services,” stated George Carpenter, CEO of MYnd. “Although many companies provide broad telehealth services within the U.S., our focus is telebehavioral health, which is uniquely suited for telemedicine as patients can consult with their mental health provider from the comfort, convenience and privacy of their home. The acquisition of Arcadian may also provide us an opportunity to leverage our PEER platform by combining Arcadian’s capabilities with MYnd’s data analytics capabilities to provide patients greater access to care, lower costs, and help doctors to reduce trial and error prescribing.”\n“We continue to commercialize our Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (“PEER”) platform technology. Specifically, our first payor demonstration project with Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc. in New Jersey is under way, and we look forward to adding additional payor pilot programs with other payers in 2018. We believe these programs will serve as further validation of the cost savings and reduction in trial and error prescribing when utilizing the PEER report to assist in treatment decision making. Once armed with the data of this pilot project, we plan to aggressively target major payer organizations across the county. In New Jersey alone, Horizon represents a $48 million potential annual market for PEER, and there are hundreds of such organizations nationwide.”\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $2.7 million, compared to approximately $1.5 million for the same period ended March 31, 2017. The change in net loss reflects increased costs related to the acquisition of Arcadian, as well as increased general and administrative costs related to the hiring of additional operational staff, sales and marketing costs related to additional headcount for sales and call center staff, as well as social media expenses. While expenses were higher than anticipated over the past two quarters, significant cost cutting measures have been taken with the integration of Arcadian.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $2.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital surplus of approximately $0.8 million. The Company significantly increased its cash position and improved the balance sheet raising $4,460,000 between March 29 th and May 8 th , 2018.\nAbout MYnd Analytics\nMYnd Analytics, Inc.
