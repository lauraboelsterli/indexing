The Board will present its formal recommendation regarding director nominees in the Company’s definitive proxy statement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to all shareholders eligible to vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The date of the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders has not yet been announced. Perry Ellis shareholders are not required to take action at this time.\nThe Special Committee of the Perry Ellis Board of Directors, which comprises independent directors, issued the following statement:\nThe Special Committee is committed to acting in the best interests of all shareholders. The Special Committee, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, is evaluating the previously announced February 6, 2018 proposal from Mr. Feldenkreis (the “Feldenkreis Proposal”). To that end, the Special Committee will continue with its strategic review process to maximize shareholder value, including engaging in good faith with Mr. Feldenkreis to see if a transaction that maximizes shareholder value can be reached.\nThe Special Committee will refrain at this time from commenting on the status of all negotiations in progress or contesting mischaracterizations of those negotiations in the press by Mr. Feldenkreis. Our focus remains on maximizing shareholder value.\nThe Special Committee noted no decision has been made with respect to the Company's response to the Feldenkreis Proposal. There is no assurance the Feldenkreis Proposal will result in a definitive offer to purchase the Company's outstanding capital stock or that any definitive agreement will be executed or that the Proposal or any other transaction will be approved or consummated.\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Akerman LLP are serving as the Special Committee legal counsel and PJ SOLOMON is serving as its financial advisor.\nAbout Perry Ellis International\nPerry Ellis International, Inc. is a leading designer, distributor and licensor of a broad line of high quality men's and women's apparel, accessories and fragrances.
