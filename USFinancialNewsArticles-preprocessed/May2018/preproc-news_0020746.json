In his new role, Baumann will forge relationships with prospects interested in any of Panorama's expert services, including expert witness testimony, project recovery and independent verification and validation.\n\"Our expert services are poised to make the jump to the next level,\" said Baumann. \"I'm excited to contribute to the development of one of Panorama's most valuable service areas.\"\nBaumann's expert witness background has contributed to his holistic perspective when it comes to investigating the causes of failed ERP implementations.
