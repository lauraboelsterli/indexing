    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 6:29 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago Fed's Kaplan - U.S. economy at or beyond full employment Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The U.S. economy has reached the threshold for maximum employment and it may already be lower than is sustainable, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan gestures during a news conference after of the True Economic Talks event in Mexico City, Mexico, July 14, 2017. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo\n“Our judgement at the Dallas Fed is that we are either at or already past full employment,” Kaplan said at a local chamber of commerce event in Richardson, Texas.\nKaplan is currently in favour of two more interest rate rises this year, in line with Fed policymakers’ median estimate.\nThe U.S. central bank lifted borrowing costs in March and policymakers are split about evenly between those who expect another two rate hikes this year, and those who forecast three, amid low unemployment, moderate growth and rising inflation.\nThe unemployment rate is currently at a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.
