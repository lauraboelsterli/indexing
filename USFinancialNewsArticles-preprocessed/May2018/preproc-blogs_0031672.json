Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. It’s Blockchain Week in New York, and CIO Journal is exploring the massive Consensus 2018 conference for hints of things to come. On Monday, Steven Norton heard FedEx Corp. CEO Frederick Smith and CIO Rob Carter discuss the future of supply chain with author Don Tapscott.\n“We’re quite confident that (blockchain) has big, big implications in supply chain, transportation and logistics,” Mr. Smith said. “In the area where FedEx makes its living, this could be a big deal.” Corporate spending on blockchain software, services and hardware is expected to reach $2.1 billion this year, up from $945 million in 2017, according to IDC.\nMr. Carter says blockchain could improve the customs process and provide more transparency and reliability for shipments of items in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and the auto and health care sectors. FedEx has a “couple dozen” people working on blockchain, according to Mr. Carter. His view: “The consequences of not investing are extremely high.”\nCYBERSECURITY\nThe Kaspersky suspicions come amid wider tensions that pit Russia against the U.S. and European countries.

The\nRussian antivirus-software company will set up a new data center in Zurich by late 2019, the Journal’s Stu Woo and Robert McMillan report . There, its computers and employees will scan the data of U.S. and European customers for viruses. Kaspersky Labs currently is banned from U.S. government computers because of national-security concerns that the company could be vulnerable to Moscow interference.\nResearchers find problems with PGP-encrypted email. Emails using the 30-year-old technology for encryption are vulnerable, but the problem rests with PGP’s implementation and the surrounding ecosystem and not the crypto itself, Motherboard reports . European researchers on Monday published research on a scenario where an attacker, through the use of custom HTML, could exfiltrate email plaintext. Ars Technica reports that the Electronic Frontier Foundation on Monday issued an advisory recommending PGP and S/MIME users disable the encryption in their email clients.\nComputer viruses may not be the bigger worry. Access to DNA clone fragments and new, affordable tools such as genome printers and gene editing kits are making it easier for so-called biohackers, operating outside of the normal research institutions, to pursue their hobby. Health security experts fear the potential for abuse. “The pragmatic people would just engineer drug-resistant anthrax or highly transmissible influenza. Some recipes are online,” Dr. George Church, a researcher at Harvard and a leading synthetic biologist, tells the New York Times .\nThieves snag millions from Mexican banks. Wire fraud activity that led to the theft of up to $15.4 million from banks in Mexico may have involved inside help, sources tell Reuters . Criminals earlier created hundreds of phantom orders that wired funds to fake accounts. Big cash withdrawals are not common in Mexico and should have attracted attention among bank staff, one source said.\nOTHER TECHNOLOGY NEWS\nWith demand for Bosch-built steering controls high, the company has used automation to increase its output. Photo: BLOOMBERG NEWS.\nIs automation finally killing off the humans? Perhaps not. Companies that assign repetitive, precise tasks to robots, freeing human workers to undertake creative, problem-solving duties may have cracked the code, says WSJ’s William Wilkes .\nRobert Bosch GmbH. The auto-parts supplier looked for 20,000 new hires (as in human new hires) last year. BMW AG. The automaker automated some of the physical labor at the Spartanburg, S.C. plant. The result: The factory says it has more than doubled its annual car production… and its workforce. Electrolux AB. The world’s second-largest appliance maker has spent millions of euros on automating the production of washing machines and other devices, which are now assembled almost entirely by machine. Employment at Electrolux has risen to more than 55,000 in 2017 from about 53,000 in 2011. U.S., China discussing deal on ZTE . Under the deal being discussed, the U.S. would relax last month’s order banning American companies from selling components to Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE Corp. Beijing in turn would remove tariffs on billions of dollars of U.S. agricultural products. And negotiations also would ease roadblocks in China faced by U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc ., in its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV . But it’s only Tuesday and as the Journal’s Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report , discussions could fall apart anytime, particularly since the U.S. side is sharply divided over how to deal with China.\nYears before fatal Tesla crash, engineers discussed safety. Before and after the the 2015 debut of Tesla Inc. ‘s autopilot driver-assistance system, engineers repeatedly discussed adding sensors that would ensure drivers look at the road or keep their hands on the wheel. The Journal’s Tim Higgins reports that Tesla executives rejected the ideas due to concerns over effectiveness and costs.\nFor sale: $1 billion in Valley stakes. With the dearth of IPOs, Silicon Valley venture firm New Enterprise Associates is selling off stakes in about 20 firms to a new firm it is trying to create, the WSJ’s Rolfe Winkler and Eliot Brown report .\nChina’s Didi gets approval to test autonomous cars in California. With the permit China’s ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co. joins over 50 other companies operating in the state, including ride-hailing company Lyft Inc ., Intel Corp. , Alphabet Inc. ’s Waymo and Chinese internet-search company Baidu Inc. The Journal’s Austen Hufford has more .\nNew tech promises to speed critical treatment for strokes. The technologies combine improved imaging with computer algorithms to cross-reference a stroke patient’s brain scan with a database of scans from other victims. A precise diagnosis is possible within minutes, the Journal’s Thomas M. Burton reports .\nCities recycle Amazon pitch. Some U.S. cities are learning something this year from Amazon.com Inc. : how to sell themselves. T he WSJ reports that many of the 20 cities shortlisted as sites for the retail giant’s second headquarters are using the multimedia presentations they created for Amazon’s application to pitch to other companies.\nFacebook suspends 200 apps. The company is auditing third-party apps with access to large amouts user data, a response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal where user data belonging to almost 90 millions users was passed to the political consultancy, TechCrunch reports . Since the project was announced on March 21, Facebook has investigated thousands of apps.\nHow the entire internet became a dating site. OKCupid, but also Spotify, Quora, Tumbler and Instagram. The WSJ’s Emma Court has a story on modern love .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nU.S. companies are ramping up spending on their businesses at the fastest pace in years, a long-awaited development following years of tepid growth. (WSJ)\nWashington’s allies in Europe and the Middle East criticized the U.S. for opening a new embassy in Jerusalem and called on Israel to restrain its forces . (WSJ)\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up workplace inspections , increasing audits and arrests as part of an effort to find undocumented workers and deter businesses from hiring them. (WSJ)\nNew fissures opened in the eastern corner of Hawaii’s Big Island as the eruption of the Kilauea volcano more than ten days ago continued to spew lava and threaten neighborhoods. (WSJ)\nCORRECTION: IDC said spending on blockchain software, services and hardware is expected to reach $2.1 billion in 2018. An earlier version of this story linked the $2.1 billion spending figure to blockchain software.\nShare this: AUTOMATION BLOCKCHAIN CYBERSECURITY DOWNLOAD FEDEX Previous FedEx CIO Says Blockchain a 'Game Changer' for Supply Chain Visibility Next Manufacturers See Blockchain Tracking 3-D-Printed Parts Through Supply Chains",
