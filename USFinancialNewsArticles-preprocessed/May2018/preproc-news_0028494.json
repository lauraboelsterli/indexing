    "text": "MONTRÉAL, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Valener Inc. (“Valener”) (TSX:VNR) (TSX:VNR.PR.A), the public investment vehicle in Énergir, L.P., today reported its fiscal 2018 second quarter results. The results of Énergir, L.P., Valener’s primary investment, are also presented in this press release.\nSummary of Valener’s results\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n• Adjusted net income 1 ,2 of $33.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017\nAdjusted net income 1,2 of $0.87 per share compared to $0.85 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017\n• Normalized operating cash flows 1 of $14.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up $2.7 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2017\nNormalized operating cash flows 1 per share of $0.36 compared to $0.29 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n“Valener’s high-quality assets continued to deliver growth this quarter,” said Pierre Monahan, Chairman of Valener’s board of directors. “ A djusted net income was up 3% year over year, as a result of Énergir’s strong performance.”\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31 For the six\nmonths ended\nMarch 31 (in millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income 35.0 32.6 49.4 56.7 Net income attributable to common shareholders 33.9 31.5 47.1 54.5 Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (1) 33.9 32.9 53.9 53.2 Per common share (in $) (1) 0.87 0.85 1.38 1.37 Normalized operating cash flows (1) 14.0 11.3 25.3 23.5 Distributions received from Énergir, L.P. 14.9 14.1 29.8 28.1 Distributions received from Beaupré Éole and Beaupré Éole 4 2.0 — 2.4 0.2 Per common share (in $) (1) 0.36 0.29 0.65 0.61 Valener reported adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of $33.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $32.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was mainly driven by growth in Énergir, L.P.’s adjusted net income.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Seigneurie de Beaupré Wind Farms 2 and 3 General Partnership and Seigneurie de Beaupré Wind Farm 4 General Partnership (collectively, the “SDB Wind Farms”) generated a combined 297,205 MWh of electric power, down 3.3% given weaker wind conditions than those of the second quarter of 2017 as well as a two-week period of frost in March 2018.\nThe SDB Wind Farms still generated $15.3 million in operating cash flows during the second quarter of 2018, a $1.5 million year-over-year increase resulting from changes in working capital.\nValener’s second quarter normalized operating cash flows totalled $14.0 million compared to $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, mainly from higher distributions received from Énergir, L.P. and the SDB Wind Farms.\nÉnergir, L.P.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n• Adjusted net income 1,3 of $150.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up $7.5 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted net income 1,3 per unit of $0.87, a 2% increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n• Québec Energy Distribution (“QDA”): net income of $116.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up $2.2 million year over year.\nQDA’s fiscal 2018 net income is expected to exceed the net income anticipated in the 2018 rate case by at least $6.0 million.\n1 Financial measures not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is presented hereafter.\n2 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n3 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Partners.\n“Our commercial and geographic diversification strategy continues to pay off,” said Sophie Brochu, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During the second quarter, our energy distribution activities generated excellent results, both in Québec and the United States. Building on a diverse range of renewable and less-emissive energies, Énergir is well positioned to meet the needs of its Québec and U.S. customers while offering its shareholders stable, predictable financial performance .”\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nQDA: 4.9% second-quarter increase in normalized natural gas deliveries driven mainly by economic growth in Québec. Gaz Métro Plus Limited Partnership (“Gaz Métro Plus”): $4.4 million gain realized on the sale of server hosting assets in February 2018. Standard Solar Inc.: approximately 10 MW in solar projects completed, 23 MW under construction, and an agreement signed with an investor for the financing of solar farms in exchange for tax attributes (“tax equity partner”), representing a total investment of approximately US$50 million. Portland Xpress project: in order to meet growing demand, Portland Natural Gas Transmission System (“PNGTS”) will need to increase network capacity by adding, among other things, a compressor at the Elliot station. In the meantime, PNGTS will also benefit from future additional work at the East Hereford station of the Trans Québec & Maritimes Inc. (“TQM”) gas pipeline, scheduled for completion in November 2019. These projects are scheduled to come online in November 2020.\nU.S. tax reform\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government adopted exhaustive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax reform”) that introduced complex and significant U.S. tax code changes that are applicable to Énergir, L.P.’s U.S. subsidiaries and entities subject to significant influence. The impacts of this tax reform on Énergir, L.P.’s 2018 first quarter consolidated financial statements consisted essentially of a $238.0 million decrease in deferred income tax liabilities, the creation of $246.9 million in regulatory liabilities, and a $24.2 million decrease in net income attributable to Partners. The impact of this reform on net income is mainly attributable to the deferred income taxes related to the portion not included in rate-setting as well as to the downward remeasurement of deferred income taxes related to non-capital loss carryforwards unrelated to rate-regulated activities.\nWith respect to the rate-regulated operations of Énergir, L.P.’s U.S. subsidiaries and entities subject to significant influence, the tax reform impacts were primarily recognized as regulatory liabilities, as current and deferred income taxes are included during the rate-setting of such entities. The regulatory liabilities recognized following these adjustments equal the amounts expected to be reimbursed through future rates over amortization periods that will subsequently be set and approved by the regulatory agencies. In their respective 2019 rate cases, GMP and VGS proposed different amortization periods that yielded an estimated period of approximately 40 years, based on Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) normalization rules as well as the nature of the factors that led to the recognition of the deferred income taxes to be returned to customers. The proposed amortization periods were notably impacted by the estimated residual lives of the underlying assets. The amounts to be returned total approximately US$30 million for 2019 and US$4 million for the subsequent years.\nÉnergir, L.P.’s segment results – Adjusted net income attributable to Partners (1) (in millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated) Segments Q2 2018 Q2 2017 H1-2018 H1-2017 QDA 116.6 114.4 180.7 178.5 Distribution in Vermont 36.0 29.6 63.2 56.9 Natural Gas Transportation 7.1 7.4 11.0 12.9 Electricity Production 1.3 1.6 2.0 2.4 Energy Services, Storage and Other 2.0 1.8 3.8 3.2 Corporate Affairs (13.0 ) (12.3 ) (26.2 ) (22.5 ) Total 150.0 142.5 234.5 231.4 Basic and diluted weighted average number of units outstanding (in millions) 171.8 167.3 171.8 167.3 Basic and diluted per unit (in $) 0.87 0.85 1.36 1.38 For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and excluding one-time adjustments, Énergir, L.P.’s adjusted net income attributable to Partners totalled $150.0 million compared to $142.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This change stems mainly from the favourable impact of a regulatory timing difference in the Québec Energy Distribution segment combined with a strong Québec economy in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, despite the earnings reduction anticipated in the rate case, and the effects of GMP’s favorable rate case parameters.\nÉnergir, L.P.’s net income attributable to Partners was $154.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $142.5 million in second quarter 2017, resulting from the above-mentioned factors and a gain realized on the sale of Gaz Métro Plus’s server hosting assets.\nQUÉBEC ENERGY DISTRIBUTION\nÉnergir, L.P.’s distribution activities carried out through QDA generated net income attributable to Partners of $116.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a $2.2 million year-over-year increase that was mainly due to:\nthe favourable impact of a regulatory timing difference, with most of the difference expected to reverse at the end of fiscal 2018; and the favourable impact of an increase in normalized natural gas deliveries as a result of the strong Québec economy;\npartly offset by various parameters in QDA’s 2018 rate case, as filed with the Régie de l’énergie (the “Régie”), which had anticipated net income of $132.7 million for fiscal 2018, down $14.9 million from fiscal 2017.\nGiven the change in volumes during the first six months of fiscal 2018, Énergir, L.P. now expects fiscal 2018 net income generated by the Québec Energy Distribution segment to exceed the net income anticipated in the 2018 rate case by at least $6 million.\n2019 rate case\nPhase 1\nIn October 2017, QDA submitted a proposal to the Régie seeking the renewal, for its 2019 rate case, of the authorized rate of return on deemed common equity and of the performance sharing mechanism currently in place. In December 2017, the Régie issued a favourable decision under which it renewed, for the 2019 rate year, the 8.90% rate of return on deemed common equity as well as the performance sharing mechanism in effect since fiscal 2015.\nPhase 2\nIn March and April 2018, QDA filed Phase 2 of its 2019 rate case with the Régie. It presents, among other things, an overall average decrease in rates of 4.1% and an average rate base of $2,154 million, up $36 million from the 2018 rate case. The decrease in rates stems mainly from transportation and load-balancing services given the lower TCPL rates in effect since January 1, 2018 as well as from the net impact of amounts to be returned to customers related to the overearnings and shortfalls realized in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. The higher rate base is attributable to the general increase in property, plant and equipment investment projects in recent years, such as, among other things, the project to improve and strengthen the Saguenay region transmission system. The Régie is expected to issue a decision in autumn 2018.\nENERGY DISTRIBUTION IN VERMONT\nThrough Green Mountain Power Corporation (“GMP”) and Vermont Gas Systems, Inc. (“VGS”), the Energy Distribution segment in Vermont recorded adjusted net income attributable to Partners of $36.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a $6.4 million, or 21.6%, increase from $29.6 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding the exchange rate impact, this increase was mainly due to:\nthe various parameters in GMP’s 2018 rate case, which anticipated an increase in adjusted net income attributable to Partners; the impact of VGS’s 2018 rate case parameters, which include an increase in the rate base to reflect the Addison project coming into service; and the favourable impact of a regulatory timing difference, most of which is expected to reverse at the end of fiscal 2018.\nGMP – 2019 rate case\nIn April 2018, GMP filed its 2019 rate case with the Vermont Public Utility Commission (“VPUC”). Prepared on a cost-of-service basis, it provides for an authorized rate of return on common equity of 9.30%, a 49.8% common equity ratio, and covers the period of January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 to reset the rate case to a fiscal year basis. In the rate case, a 5.45% rate increase is being proposed to reflect an increase in supply and transmission costs and an expected decrease in deliveries resulting largely from the adoption of energy efficiency measures by GMP’s customers. However, this increase will be fully offset by the impact of beginning to reimburse customers the regulatory liabilities recorded following the U.S. tax reform and resulting in an overall decrease in rates of 0.5%. The rate case also provides for an average rate base of US$1,563 million, a US$130 million increase from the 2018 rate case, to reflect greater investments in property, plant and equipment, GMP’s ownership interest in Vermont Transco LLC, and solar power projects. Lastly, the rate case contains a provision whereby US$13.9 million would be returned to GMP’s customers as a result of the synergies generated by the merger with Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. The VPUC is expected to issue a decision in December 2018.\nVGS – 2019 rate case\nIn February 2018, VGS filed a cost-of-service proposal for its 2019 fiscal year with the VPUC. The cost of service proposed by VGS for fiscal 2019 provides for an 8.5% rate of return on common equity and a 50% common equity ratio. VGS is also proposing an overall decrease in rates of 3.8%, which includes a 14.8% reduction in rates related to the cost of natural gas, beginning to reimburse customers the regulatory liabilities recorded as a result of the U.S. tax reform, and a 4% increase in distribution rates. VGS is also proposing the use of a US$8.1 million portion of the amounts collected in the System Expansion and Reliability Fund as well as an average rate base of US$264.2 million, an increase of US$16 million. A decision is expected in time for the new rates to take effect as of November 1, 2018.\nTo see the financial report, click here .\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures For additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, refer to Valener’s MD&A for the three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
