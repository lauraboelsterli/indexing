    "text": "FRANKFURT, April 30 (Reuters) - Influential proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders in Deutsche Bank vote against ratifying the actions of the management and supervisory boards at the lender’s 2018 annual general meeting next month.\nGerman companies typically ask shareholders to approve the actions of their boards over the previous year at the annual shareholder meetings. Votes against the boards’ actions amount to a vote of no confidence but are largely symbolic. (Reporting by Tom Sims Editing by David Goodman)\n ",
