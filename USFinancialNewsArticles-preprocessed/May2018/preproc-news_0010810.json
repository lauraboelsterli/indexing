    "text": "Net Sales of $1.47 Billion Increased 7% with Constant-Currency Organic Sales Growth of 1% GAAP EPS of $0.22 increased 16% and Adjusted EPS of $0.26 decreased 10% Company Announces Investor Day Meeting to be held May 15, 2018, in Winston-Salem\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HanesBrands (NYSE:HBI), a leading global marketer of everyday basic apparel under world-class brands, today announced first-quarter 2018 results that exceeded company guidance for net sales, organic sales and EPS.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the company reported net sales growth of 7 percent to $1.47 billion versus a guidance range of $1.42 billion to $1.44 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share for continuing operations increased 16 percent to $0.22 compared with guidance of $0.17 to $0.20, and adjusted EPS excluding actions decreased 10 percent to $0.26, compared with guidance of $0.23 to $0.25. The EPS comparisons to last year reflect a higher corporate tax rate for 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform.\nHanes has reiterated its full-year guidance and issued net sales and EPS guidance for the second-quarter 2018. (See financial guidance section for details. See Note on Adjusted Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP Measures later in this news release for additional discussion and details.)\n“We are focused on delivering quarterly results consistent with the promises we make in our guidance,” said Hanes Chief Executive Officer Gerald W. Evans Jr. “We’re off to a good start. We are reaping ongoing benefits from diversifying our business through geographic expansion, Champion brand growth globally, and increased sales in the online channel. We have created powerful cash-generating global innerwear and activewear businesses that can leverage our leading market positions and brands, our robust global supply chain, and our global management expertise. This is the engine for creating shareholder value.”\nKey Callouts for First-Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe diversification of Hanes’ global business model supported the company’s execution of its Sell More, Spend Less and Generate Cash strategies in the first quarter. The acquisitions of Bras N Things and Alternative Apparel contributed to sales growth in the quarter, while organic sales growth, driven by increased Champion and online sales, more than offset declines in the U.S. brick-and-mortar channel. International operating profit growth was offset by declines in domestic operating profit. Key callouts follow.\nAcquisition Contributions and Organic Sales Growth Drive 7 Percent Net Sales Increase . Net sales for Bras N Things, acquired in February 2018, and Alternative Apparel, acquired in October 2017, totaled $32 million in the quarter. Organic sales, which exclude sales from acquisitions under a year old, increased 1 percent in constant currency, the third consecutive quarter of organic growth. Stronger-than-expected Champion sales across all geographies drove organic growth. Global Champion sales increased 22 percent in the quarter and was up 17 percent in constant currency. The Champion, Alternative and Bras N Things brands all benefit from a strong millennial consumer base.\nDouble-Digit Growth in Global Consumer-Directed Sales Continues. Global consumer-directed sales, consisting of company retail and online channel sales, increased 23 percent in the first quarter and represented 21 percent of total sales. Company retail sales, which includes company-owned stores and dedicated brand stores, increased 24 percent, while online channel sales, which includes company websites, traditional retailer websites and pure-play Internet retailers, increased 20 percent, up in every geography.\nTax Reform Effect on EPS Comparisons. U.S. tax reform, which resulted in a higher corporate tax rate beginning in 2018, affects the year-over-year comparisons for EPS. When applying the 2018 first-quarter tax rate to 2017 first-quarter results, GAAP EPS increased 29 percent on a pro forma basis and adjusted EPS was consistent with a year ago.\nBusiness Segment Summaries\nBeginning in the first-quarter 2018, Hanes has eliminated the business-segment allocation of certain overhead selling, general and administrative expenses related to global functions in order to reflect the manner in which businesses are managed. Prior-year segment operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current presentation of segment results.\nInnerwear Results Consistent with Expectations. U.S. Innerwear segment sales decreased 3 percent, as expected, and operating profit decreased 13 percent, affected by raw material inflation and lower volume.\nInnerwear Basics sales decreased less than 1 percent, with growth in socks and children’s underwear sales offset by declines primarily in women’s underwear. The company’s latest innovation, Hanes Comfort Flex Fit men’s underwear boxer briefs, were successfully introduced in the quarter and met with good consumer reception.\nInnerwear Intimates sales decreased 7 percent, primarily affected by soft shapewear sales and retailer door closings within the past year. Bra sales decreased less than 2 percent with improving trends as ongoing improvement initiatives are gaining traction.\nActivewear Sales Increase on Acquisition Benefits and Champion Growth . U.S. Activewear segment sales increased 6 percent in the quarter, benefitting from the acquisition of Alternative Apparel. Organic sales increased 1 percent despite space constraints in the mass channel. Champion sales increased at a high-single-digit rate. Online channel sales for the segment increased 26 percent in the quarter and represented 10 percent of sales.\nAlthough mix of products sold was favorable, segment operating profit decreased 12 percent due to raw material inflation and short-term higher distribution costs.\nInternational Segment Achieves Strong Double-Digit Sales and Profit Growth. International sales increased 19 percent and operating profit increased 46 percent, benefitting from foreign currency exchange rates, organic growth, synergies from past acquisitions, and contributions from the mid-quarter acquisition of Bras N Things. The segment’s operating margin of 13.5 percent increased 250 basis points over the year-ago quarter.\nInternational constant-currency organic sales increased 7 percent on strong double-digit Champion sales growth in Europe and Asia. Organic consumer-directed sales, which consist of all online channel sales and company retail stores, increased 22 percent and accounted for 28 percent of total segment sales.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nHanes has reiterated full-year financial guidance for 2018 and has issued second-quarter guidance for net sales and EPS.\nThe company continues to expect full-year 2018 net sales of $6.72 billion to $6.82 billion, GAAP operating profit of $870 million to $905 million, adjusted operating profit excluding actions of $950 million to $985 million, GAAP EPS of $1.54 to $1.62, adjusted EPS excluding actions of $1.72 to $1.80, and net cash from operations of $675 million to $750 million.\nWith U.S. income tax reform, the company expects the 2018 full-year tax rate to be approximately 16 percent.\nKey assumptions in the company’s guidance include: a cautious outlook for the U.S. brick-and-mortar consumer environment, including the first-half effect of door closures; an increase in full-year organic sales driven by online, global Champion, and International growth; and higher commodity costs and increased marketing investment to support additional planned product innovation.\nSecond-Quarter Guidance . Second-quarter net sales are expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.725 billion. At the midpoint of this guidance range, constant-currency organic sales are expected to decline less than 1 percent. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.38 to $0.40, and adjusted EPS excluding actions is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46. Charges related to acquisition integration and other actions are expected to total approximately $25 million in the second quarter.\nFASB Note. In keeping with a new Financial Accounting Standards Board rule, pension expense is being reported below operating profit on the income statement within interest and other expenses rather than the previous practice of accounting for pension expense within selling, general and administrative expense. All prior periods have been revised to reflect this change.\nHanes has updated its quarterly frequently-asked-questions document, which is available at www.Hanes.com/faq .\nNote on Adjusted Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP Measures\nTo supplement financial guidance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the company provides quarterly and full-year results and guidance concerning certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit (and margin), adjusted SG&A, adjusted gross profit (and margin), EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding actions and the tax effect on actions. Adjusted net income is defined as net income from continuing operations excluding actions and the tax effect on actions. Adjusted operating profit is defined as operating profit excluding actions. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding actions. Adjusted SG&A is defined as selling, general and administrative expenses excluding actions.\nCharges for actions taken in the first quarter and for guidance for the full year primarily represent acquisition-related and integration costs related to Hanes Europe Innerwear, Hanes Australasia, Champion Europe, Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things. Acquisition and integration costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, information technology integration costs and similar charges. While these costs are not operational in nature and are not expected to continue for any singular transaction on an ongoing basis, similar types of costs, expenses and charges have occurred in prior periods and may recur in the future depending upon acquisition activity.\nHanes has chosen to present these non-GAAP measures to investors to enable additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means of evaluating operations absent the effect of acquisitions and other actions. Hanes believes these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with valuable supplemental information for analyzing the operating performance of the company’s ongoing business during each period presented without giving effect to costs associated with the execution and integration of any of the aforementioned actions taken.\nIn addition, the company has chosen to present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to investors because it considers these measures to be an important supplemental means of evaluating operating performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding actions and stock compensation expense. Hanes believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, and management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes in connection with setting its capital allocation strategy. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not, however, be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures presented may be different from non-GAAP measures with similar or identical names presented by other companies.\nIn the first-quarter 2018, Hanes incurred $20 million in charges for acquisition-related and integration actions. In the first-quarter 2017, Hanes incurred $38 million in charges for acquisition-related and integration actions.\nFor 2018 guidance, Hanes expects full-year GAAP EPS of $1.54 to $1.62 with anticipated pretax charges for acquisition-related and integration costs and other actions of approximately $80 million, which results in adjusted EPS guidance of $1.72 to $1.80. For the second quarter, the company expects GAAP EPS of $0.38 to $0.40 with anticipated pretax charges for acquisition-related and integration costs and other actions of approximately $25 million, which results in adjusted EPS guidance of $0.44 to $0.46.\nWebcast Conference Call\nHanes will host an Internet webcast of its first-quarter investor conference call at 8:30 a.m. EDT today, May 1, 2018. The broadcast, which will consist of prepared remarks followed by a question-and-answer session, may be accessed at www.Hanes.com/investors .

Several members of management will speak, including HanesBrands Chief Executive Officer Gerald W. Evans Jr. and Chief Financial Officer Barry A. Hytinen.\nAn archived replay of the meeting webcast and copies of the presentation slides will be available in the investors section of the Hanes corporate website.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, as defined under U.S. federal securities laws, with respect to our long-term goals and trends associated with our business, as well as guidance as to future performance.
