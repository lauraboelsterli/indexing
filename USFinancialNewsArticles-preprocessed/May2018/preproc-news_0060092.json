This nomination, key for the company’s transformation, completes ESI’s Group Executive Committee.\n“I’m excited to join ESI Group and be a part of a seasoned team at such a pivotal period for the company on the path of transformation” said Olfa Zorgati. “ESI has a great opportunity in the market as the company accelerates its unique positioning in the Product Performance Lifecycle TM market with its solution of Hybrid Twin TM .”\nOlfa brings almost 20 years of experience in international management roles; both financial and operational.

Prior to this, Olfa was CFO, then Chief Operating Officer (COO), at VentureBeat in San Francisco, USA, the leading source for news & research on technology innovation. There she played a key role in a business model shift (subscription vs advertising revenues) that led to an exponential growth period. Her focus during those years, was to introduce agile practices and transform internal business processes. Among other positions, she spent 3 years with Ventadis, an independent multi-channel retail group (M6 Group) and 7 years with the Vivendi Group where she held various positions in finance and M&A. Olfa started her career at Societe Generale in M&A.\nOlfa holds a Master of Business Administration from HEC Paris, an international business school, and has developed a broad experience, as a transformational and data-driven manager, in e-commerce & Media and in SaaS enabler technology businesses. She has worked in high profile roles for global, multi-billion European companies and fast-growing start-ups and delivered outstanding results in these high pressurized environments.\n“Olfa Zorgati will bring the benefit of her experience in financial and operational functions, both in France and internationally. We are delighted that she is joining our top management team, and truly believe that her skills and expertise will prove invaluable to ESI Group as we drive our transformation to become the indisputable Virtual Prototyping partner of our clients in their Industry 4.0 journey.
