REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci Arkady Babchenko, a prominent journalist and critic of President Vladimir Putin, was shot dead in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, where he had fled into exile following threats, police said on Tuesday.\nRussia has rejected Ukraine’s allegation that Moscow was behind the murder.\n“Appalled to see another vocal Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko, murdered,” Johnson said on Twitter. “We must defend freedom of speech and it is vital that those responsible are now held to account.”\nReporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by William Schomberg\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
