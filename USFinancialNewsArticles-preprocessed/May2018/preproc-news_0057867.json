    "text": "2 COMMENTS SÃO PAULO—The Brazilian government reached a new agreement with truck drivers on Sunday to end a seven-day strike that left many businesses without vital supplies and most gas stations in the country without fuel.\nThe government has agreed to a discount in diesel prices that will be in place for 60 days and to sign a bill that will allow truckers not to pay toll on rear axles when not in use, among other concessions, Brazilian President Michel Temer said during a televised speech Sunday night.\nThis is the second agreement announced by the government in an attempt to end the strike. Last week, the government said several truckers’ unions had agreed to suspend the strike, but one of the biggest groups representing drivers, the Brazilian Association of Truckers (Abcam), rejected the deal.\nBrazilian truck drivers began the stoppage on May 21, asking the government to cut taxes on diesel fuel after a recent spike in prices.\nThe government brought in the military to help clear the roads on Friday, but many truckers remained off the job, threatening an already weak economy.\nOver the weekend, local media reported that armed forces were escorting fuel trucks to supply some essential services. But several Brazilian airports are without fuel and supermarkets are reporting shortage of some fresh products, while farmers say millions of animals may die in the coming days due to lack of feed.\nWrite to Luciana Magalhães at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com",
