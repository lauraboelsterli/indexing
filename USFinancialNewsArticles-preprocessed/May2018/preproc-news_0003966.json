    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE: AMN), the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results. Financial highlights are as follows:\nDollars in millions, except per share amounts.\nQ1 2018\n% Change\nQ1 2017\nRevenue\n$522.5\n6%\nGross profit\n$167.8\n4%\nNet income\n$42.7\n33%\nDiluted EPS\n$0.87\n34%\nAdj. diluted EPS*\n$0.81\n29%\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n$66.5\n5%\n* See \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below for a discussion of our use of non-GAAP items and the table entitled \"Supplemental Financial and Operating Data\" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items.\nHighlights\nAMN Healthcare reached record highs for revenue and EPS in the quarter. First quarter consolidated revenue of $522 million increased 6% year over year. Growth was led by our Nurse and Allied Solutions segment with revenue up by 8%. Adjusted EBITDA of $67 million grew 5% year over year and was 12.7% of revenue. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $60 million. In April we completed the acquisitions of MedPartners, Phillips DiPisa and Leaders For Today, which we expect to be immediately accretive.\n\"AMN delivered a quarter of great performance and service delivery for our clients and healthcare professionals,\" said Susan R. Salka, Chief Executive Officer of AMN Healthcare. \"I am very proud of how our teams rallied to meet our clients' higher-than-expected staffing needs. Demand continues to grow for strategic partners capable of providing comprehensive solutions to meet the evolving healthcare workforce challenges. AMN is uniquely positioned with its suite of innovative workforce solutions.\"\nMs. Salka added, \"We started the second quarter with the acquisition of three businesses that add valuable facets to our mid-revenue cycle, executive search and interim leadership solutions. MedPartners, Phillips DiPisa and Leaders For Today bring talented teams that are an excellent fit for AMN.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter was $522 million, a 6% increase over prior year and 3% higher than prior quarter. Revenue for the Nurse and Allied Solutions segment was $338 million, higher by 8% year over year and 5% sequentially. The Travel Nurse division continued to perform well with revenue up 10% year over year and 8% sequentially. Allied division revenue increased 3% year over year and was flat sequentially.\nThe Locum Tenens Solutions segment performed at the high end of expectations with revenue of $103 million, up slightly year over year and down by 5% sequentially. Other Workforce Solutions segment revenue was $81 million reflecting an increase of 3% year over year and 2% sequentially, with year-over-year growth driven by the mid-revenue cycle and workforce optimization businesses.\nGross margin was 32.1%, lower by 60 basis points year over year and higher by 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year gross margin decline was due primarily to lower bill-to-pay spreads in our Locum Tenens Solutions segment and a revenue mix shift in the Other Workforce Solutions segment. The sequential gross margin increase was driven primarily by a higher Nurse and Allied Solutions gross margin.\nSG&A expenses were $105 million, or 20.0% of revenue, compared with $102 million, or 20.6% of revenue, in the same quarter last year. Expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased year over year due to improved operating leverage. SG&A was $100 million, or 19.7% of revenue, in the previous quarter.\nNet income was $43 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared with $32 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.81. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a year-over-year increase of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.7%, representing a decrease of 10 basis points year over year and an increase of 10 basis points sequentially.\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $54 million. Cash flow from operations was strong at $60 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $6 million in the quarter. The Company ended the quarter with total debt outstanding of $325 million, with a leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with the Company's credit agreement of 1.2 to 1.\nApril Acquisitions\nIn April, AMN completed the acquisition of MedPartners, a leading national mid-revenue cycle firm; and two related providers of healthcare leadership solutions, Phillips DiPisa and Leaders For Today. All of these businesses are included in the Company's Other Workforce Solutions segment.\nMedPartners workforce solutions include case management, clinical documentation improvement, and medical registry, while also doubling our market share in medical coding. MedPartners generated 2017 revenue of approximately $125 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%. MedPartners is expected to be immediately accretive to AMN's adjusted earnings per share.\nPhillips DiPisa is an executive retained search firm, specifically focusing on C-suite positions in healthcare. Leaders For Today provides interim healthcare leaders and mid-level permanent placement. The combined companies generated 2017 revenue of approximately $23 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to AMN's adjusted earnings per share.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nMetric\nGuidance*\nConsolidated revenue\n$530 - $537 million\nGross margin\n32.5-33.0%\nSG&A as percentage of revenue\n21.0%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n12.5-13.0%\n*Note: Guidance percentage metrics are approximate. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin, see the table entitled \"Reconciliation of Guidance Adjusted EBITDA Margin to Guidance Operating Margin\" below.\nProjected year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018 is approximately 8-10%. The acquisitions are expected to add $33-34 million of revenue in the second quarter. No significant labor disruption revenue is included in the second quarter guidance, nor was any in the prior-year quarter.\nConference Call on May 3, 2018\nAMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures include (1) adjusted EBITDA, (2) adjusted EBITDA margin and (3) adjusted diluted EPS. The Company provides such non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that they are useful both to management and investors as a supplement, and not as a substitute, when evaluating the Company's operating performance. Additionally, management believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS serve as industry-wide financial measures. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA for making financial decisions and allocating resources. The non-GAAP measures in this release are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures, or may be calculated differently than other similarly titled non-GAAP measures, reported by other companies. They should not be used in isolation to evaluate the Company's performance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures identified in this release, along with further detail about the use and limitations of certain of these non-GAAP measures, may be found below in the table entitled \"Supplemental Financial and Operating Data\" under the caption entitled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items\" and the footnotes thereto or on the Company's website at http://amnhealthcare.investorroom.com/financialreports .

represents net income plus interest expense (net of interest income) and other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, unallocated corporate overhead, acquisition and integration costs and share-based compensation.\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income plus interest expense (net of interest income) and other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs and share-based compensation. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides an effective measure of the Company's results, as it excludes certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance and is a measure used in the Company's credit agreement and the indenture governing our 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to income from operations or net income as an indicator of operating performance. Although management believes that some of the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are not indicative of the Company's operating performance, these items do impact the statement of comprehensive income, and management therefore utilizes adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income.\n(4)\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.\n(5)\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $2,501,000 in 2018 to adjust for an immaterial error related to the income tax treatment of fair value changes in the cash surrender value of its Company Owned Life Insurance for years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017. These fair value changes had not previously been included as a benefit in the tax provisions of the related years.\n(6)\nThe consolidated effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably affected by the recording of excess tax benefits relating to equity awards vested and exercised during the period. As a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement on January 1, 2017, we no longer record excess tax benefits as an increase to additional paid-in capital, but record such excess tax benefits on a prospective basis as a reduction of income tax expense, which amounted to $4,518,000 and $4,297,000 for 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The magnitude of the impact of excess tax benefits generated in the future, which may be favorable or unfavorable, is dependent upon the Company's future grants of share-based compensation, the Company's future stock price on the date awards vest or exercise in relation to the fair value of the awards on the grant date or the exercise behavior of the Company's stock appreciation rights holders. Since these favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our current year's income before taxes and is unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded their impact on adjusted diluted EPS for 2018 and March 31, 2017. In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $14,039,000 and a discrete tax expense of $1,000,000 from a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prior period share-based awards, respectively. We excluded these non-cash items from adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as they were unrelated to our fiscal year 2017's income before taxes.\n(7)\nAdjusted diluted EPS represents GAAP diluted EPS excluding the impact of the (A) amortization of intangible assets, (B) acquisition and integration costs, (C) deferred financing costs, (D) tax effect, if any, of the foregoing adjustments, (E) excess tax benefits relating to equity awards vested and exercised since January 1, 2017, (F) correction of prior periods error, and (G) discrete tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's corporate rate reduction on the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and discrete tax expense from prior period share-based awards. Management included this non-GAAP measure to provide investors and prospective investors with an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on its operating performance and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between periods. However, investors and prospective investors should note that this non-GAAP measure involves judgment by management (in particular, judgment as to what is classified as a special item to be excluded from adjusted diluted EPS). Although management believes the items excluded from adjusted diluted EPS are not indicative of the Company's operating performance, these items do impact the statement of comprehensive income, and management therefore utilizes adjusted diluted EPS as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as GAAP diluted EPS.\n(8)\nAverage healthcare professionals on assignment represents the average number of nurse and allied healthcare professionals on assignment during the period presented.\n(9)\nDays filled is calculated by dividing the locum tenens hours filled during the period by eight hours.\n(10)\nRevenue per day filled represents revenue of the Company's locum tenens solutions segment divided by days filled for the period presented.\n(11)\nLeverage ratio represents the ratio of the consolidated funded indebtedness (as calculated per the Company's credit agreement) at the end of the subject period to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA (as calculated per the Company's credit agreement) for the twelve-month period ended at the end of the subject period.\n(12)\nAs a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash\" on January 1, 2018, we are required to present in the statement of cash flows the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. We adjusted certain restricted cash amounts for 2017 and December 31, 2017 in the cash flow table presented above. These adjustments had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings.\n(13)\nGuidance percentage metrics are approximate.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amn-healthcare-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-300642506.html\nSOURCE AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.",
