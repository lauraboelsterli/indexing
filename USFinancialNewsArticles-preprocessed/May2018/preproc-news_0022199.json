    "text": "GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Lifetime Brands, Inc. (NasdaqGS:LCUT), a leading global provider of branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nConsolidated net sales were $118.2 million, as compared to consolidated net sales of $113.4 million for the corresponding period in 2017. In constant currency, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, consolidated net sales increased $2.2 million, or 1.9%, as compared to consolidated net sales in the corresponding period in 2017.\nGross margin was $45.1 million, or 38.2%, as compared to $43.9 million, or 38.8%, for the corresponding period in 2017.\nLoss from operations was $13.3 million, as compared to a loss of $1.9 million for the corresponding period in 2017.\nNet loss was $11.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the corresponding period in 2017.\nAdjusted net loss was $8.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $1.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the corresponding period in 2017.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA was $71.9 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments, permitted under our debt agreements, for the acquisition of Filament and projected synergies.\nEquity in earnings, net of taxes, was $77 thousand, as compared to $540 thousand in the corresponding 2017 period.\nJeffrey Siegel, Lifetime's Executive Chairman, commented, “During the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Filament Brands and embarked on an ambitious program to transform our Company by building on our newly expanded and diversified business. The first quarter includes the results from Filament since March 2, 2018, when the acquisition was completed.\n“Our financial results for the quarter reflect the rapidly changing retail environment. In addition, as we have noted in past earnings releases, we believe first quarter results are not indicative of the outlook for the full year, as our most significant initiatives are scheduled for the third and fourth quarters. These plans are reflected in the financial guidance we are providing for 2018.\n“As we begin to integrate and benefit from the combination of Filament into Lifetime and also begin to take advantage of our expanded portfolio of leading brands, increased scale, new sales opportunities and added efficiencies, we firmly believe that Lifetime and its stakeholders will benefit from having the most powerful platform in housewares across all channels, including e-commerce.”\nChief Executive Officer Rob Kay continued, “In the two months that has elapsed since Lifetime and Filament merged, we have begun taking many steps to align our business model and create a strong and unified company. Our initial actions have been focused on integrating and consolidating our U.S. organization, including certain business units, our salesforce, our e-commerce/retail direct activities and IT, and on integrating our operations in China. We already have announced our integration plans across our Company and have identified and notified impacted functions and individuals.\n“We are pleased with the rapid progress we have made to date and believe we are on track to exceed the financial targets we announced in conjunction with the merger. As noted then, we expect to realize the bulk of the annualized $8.1 million in integration savings starting in 2019, when we go live with our SAP migration. Throughout 2018, we will continue to move swiftly to implement our comprehensive plan for developing a stronger, more streamlined and even more effective Lifetime Brands.”\nFor the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, the Company is providing the following financial outlook:\nNet sales $760 to $772 million Income from operations $29 to $33 million Net income $9 to $12 million Diluted income per common share $0.45 to $0.61 per share Adjusted net income $16 to $19 million Adjusted diluted income per common share $0.81 to $0.96 per share Pro forma adjusted EBITDA $77 to $81 million Guidance for net sales is based on a forecasted GBP to USD exchange rate of $1.40. Guidance for income from operations, net income, adjusted net income, diluted income per common share and adjusted diluted income per common share is based on the Company’s preliminary valuation of the net assets acquired in the Filament acquisition. The final valuation of net assets may result in material adjustments to the respective fair values of the net assets, resulting goodwill, and deferred tax liability and amortization expense.\nNet income, adjusted net income, diluted income per common share and adjusted diluted income per common share guidance was calculated based on an expected effective tax rate of 27.5%.\nPro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $8.1 million of projected synergies.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for May 8, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET. The dial-in number for the conference call is (844) 787-0801 or (661) 378-9632, passcode #1276546. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible through https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/y9cu55hp . For those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, an audio replay of the webcast will be available.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including consolidated net sales in constant currency, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted income per common share, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets, or statements of cash flows of the Company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided because management of the Company uses these financial measures in evaluating the Company's on-going financial results and trends, and management believes that exclusion of certain items allows for more accurate comparison of the Company’s operating performance. Management uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn this press release, the use of the words “believe,” \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"positioned,\" \"project,\" \"projected,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would\" or similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements.
