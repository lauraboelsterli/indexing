    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Installed Building Products, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"IBP\") (NYSE:IBP), an industry-leading installer of insulation and complementary building products, today announced record results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue increased 18.0% to $301.7 million Net income was $6.4 million Adjusted EBITDA* increased 19.4% to $31.4 million Net income per diluted share was $0.20 Adjusted net income per diluted share* increased 28.6% to $0.45 Purchased 413 thousand shares of common stock for approximately $24.6 million In January 2018, acquired Rocket Insulation & Coatings Inc., an insulation installer in New York with annual revenues of approximately $5.4 million In January 2018, acquired Allstate Insulation, an insulation installer in Kentucky with annual revenues of approximately $1.5 million In March 2018, acquired Custom Overhead Door, LLC, a provider of garage door, gates and access control systems and maintenance services to commercial and residential customers in North Carolina with annual revenues of approximately $15.0 million\nRecent Developments\nIn April 2018, acquired H2H Blinds, LLC, an installer of blinds and shutters primarily for the residential construction market in Georgia and North Carolina with annual revenues of approximately $7.5 million\n“First quarter net revenues increased at a strong rate, outpacing completions growth, as we achieved our first quarter with revenues over $300 million,” stated Jeff Edwards, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The 18.0% increase in net revenue during the first quarter was driven by IBP’s presence in strong housing markets, the contribution of our recent acquisitions, and the growing diversity of installation services across our end markets and products. During the 2018 first quarter, net revenues per total U.S. housing completions was $1,136, an increase of 9.0% from the same period last year and is up 61.6% over the past three years. IBP’s growth in revenues per completions reflects the proactive strategy to diversify IBP’s installation services to complementary building products with similar margin characteristics. Diversifying IBP’s product mix allows IBP to provide more installation services to our customers, expand our end markets, and deepen our relationships with builders across the country.\n“As we stated last quarter, manufacturers have aggressively increased pricing in 2018, which impacted first quarter profitability. While we are actively adjusting pricing with our customers, we realized selling price increases at a slower rate than the increase in material costs. We have been successful negotiating better pricing with our customers and experienced accelerating price momentum during the month of March. As a result, we believe pricing will continue to improve during the second quarter, which will benefit margins and incremental earnings.\n“I am extremely pleased with our record first quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and the acquisitions we have recently completed are performing well and helping IBP further diversify its products and end markets. As the housing market continues to recover, we will continue to focus on improving our customer mix, increasing selling prices and expanding the cross-sale of our other complementary products. I am confident the strategies underway will continue to profitably grow our business, while our acquisition strategy continues to expand our footprint and product offerings,” concluded Mr. Edwards.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Overview\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net revenue was $301.7 million, an increase of 18.0% from $255.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a same branch basis, net revenue improved 11.3% from the prior year quarter, with approximately 7.3% of the increase attributable to growth in the number of completed jobs, 3.6% through price gains and more favorable customer and product mix. Same branch new residential sales increased 11.3%, compared to growth in U.S. housing completions of 8.2%, and our large commercial construction end market had organic growth of 13.5%.\nGross profit improved 10.8% to nearly $80.0 million from $72.2 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross profit* as a percent of total revenue was 27.0% which adjusts for the Company’s share-based compensation expense, financial wellness program and branch start-up costs, compared to 28.2% for the same period last year. The decline in gross profit margin was predominately attributable to higher material costs.\nSelling and administrative expense, as a percentage of net revenue, was 19.9% compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted selling and administrative expense*, as a percentage of net revenue, improved 120 basis points to 19.2% from 20.4%. Higher net revenue in the 2018 first quarter more than offset the higher costs needed to support the Company’s growth.\nNet income was $6.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was $14.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income* adjusts for the impact of non-core items in both periods and includes an addback for non-cash amortization expense related to acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA* was $31.4 million, a 19.4% increase from $26.3 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to higher sales and improved selling and administrative leverage. Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of net revenue, increased to 10.4%, compared to 10.3% in the prior year quarter.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company purchased a total of 413 thousand shares of its common stock for approximately $24.6 million, pursuant to the Company’s existing $50 million share repurchase program. The program will remain in effect until February 28, 2019, unless extended by the Board of Directors.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on May 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

We believe that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and us in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business.\nWe believe the Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful to investors and us as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period as it measures our changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that impact operating performance, and removes the effect of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), items outside our control (primarily income taxes) and the volatility related to the timing and extent of other activities such as asset impairments and non-core income and expenses. Accordingly, we believe that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. In addition, we use various EBITDA-based measures in determining the achievement of awards under certain of our incentive compensation programs. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, our measure may not be directly comparable to measures of other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently for purposes of covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or any future facility.\nAlthough we use the Adjusted EBITDA measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of the measure is limited because it does not include certain material expenses, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, GAAP net income as a measure of performance. Our presentation of this measure should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. This measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, this measure is not intended as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance, as an alternative to any other measure of performance in conformity with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. You should therefore not place undue reliance on this measure or ratios calculated using this measure.\nWe also believe the Adjusted Net Income measure is useful to investors and us as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period as it measures our changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that impact operating performance, and removes the effect of certain non-core items such as discontinued operations, acquisition related expenses, amortization expense, the tax impact of these certain non-core items, and the volatility related to the timing and extent of other activities such as asset impairments and non-core income and expenses. To make the financial presentation more consistent with other public building products companies, beginning in the fourth quarter 2016 we included an addback for non-cash amortization expense related to acquisitions. Accordingly, we believe that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Income differently and, as a result, our measure may not be directly comparable to measures of other companies. In addition, Adjusted Net Income may be defined differently for purposes of covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or any future facility.\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, for the periods presented therein.\nPer share figures may reflect rounding adjustments and consequently totals may not appear to sum.\nINSTALLED BUILDING PRODUCTS, INC.
