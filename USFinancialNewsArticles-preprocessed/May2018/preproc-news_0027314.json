These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company's definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus it may be more difficult to compare the Company's financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company's management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's results.\nThe Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.\nNon-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are calculated as GAAP-based net income or earnings per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, after giving effect to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and Special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, Special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP-based operating margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based income from operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue.\nAdjusted earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and Special charges (recoveries).\nThe Company's management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term \"non-operational charge\" is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company's management and is based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal reports. In the course of such evaluation and for the purpose of making operating decisions, the Company's management excludes certain items from its analysis, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, Special charges (recoveries), share-based compensation, other income (expense), and the taxation impact of these items. These items are excluded based upon the manner in which management evaluates the business of the Company and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText's performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.\nThe following charts provide (unaudited) reconciliations of U.S. GAAP-based financial measures to Non-U.S. GAAP-based financial measures for the following periods presented:\nReconciliation of selected GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(In thousands except for per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nGAAP-based\nMeasures\nGAAP-based\nMeasures\n% of Total\nRevenue\nAdjustments\nNote\nNon-GAAP-\nbased\nMeasures\nNon-GAAP-\nbased\nMeasures\n% of Total\nRevenue\nCost of revenues\nCloud services and subscriptions\n$\n94,264\n$\n(135)\n(1)\n$\n94,129\nCustomer support\n33,820\n(277)\n(1)\n33,543\nProfessional service and other\n64,246\n(122)\n(1)\n64,124\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n47,303\n(47,303)\n(2)\nâ€”\nGAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%) /\nNon-GAAP-based gross profit and gross margin (%)\n443,148\n64.6\n%\n47,837\n(3)\n490,985\n71.6\n%\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n83,522\n(993)\n(1)\n82,529\nSales and marketing\n129,987\n(1,496)\n(1)\n128,491\nGeneral and administrative\n54,817\n(2,057)\n(1)\n52,760\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n46,762\n(46,762)\n(2)\nâ€”\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n2,644\n(2,644)\n(4)\nâ€”\nGAAP-based income from operations and operating margin (%) / Non-GAAP-based income from operations and operating margin (%)\n102,323\n14.9\n%\n101,789\n(5)\n204,112\n29.8\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n11,140\n(11,140)\n(6)\nâ€”\nProvision for (recovery of) income taxes\n20,129\n3,612\n(7)\n23,741\nGAAP-based net income / Non-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n58,794\n87,037\n(8)\n145,831\nGAAP-based earnings per share / Non-GAAP-based earnings per share-diluted, attributable to OpenText\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.32\n(8)\n$\n0.54\n(1)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(2)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(3)\nGAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars, and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\n(4)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of Special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as Special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include one-time, non-recurring charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations, and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.\n(5)\nGAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars, and operating margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.\n(6)\nAdjustment relates to the exclusion of Other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as Other income (expense) relates primarily to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in non-marketable securities investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n(7)\nAdjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 26% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of expenses that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based adjusted net income. Such excluded expenses include amortization, share-based compensation, Special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves, and \"book to return\" adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments.

In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of 15%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.\n(8)\nReconciliation of GAAP-based net income to Non-GAAP-based net income:\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2017\nPer share diluted\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n979,522\n$\n3.88\nAdd:\nAmortization\n195,516\n0.77\nShare-based compensation\n22,373\n0.09\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n44,157\n0.17\nOther (income) expense, net\n(4,565)\n(0.02)\nGAAP-based provision for (recovery of) income taxes\n(815,364)\n(3.23)\nNon-GAAP based provision for income taxes\n(63,131)\n(0.24)\nNon-GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n358,508\n$\n1.42\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2017\nGAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText\n$\n979,522\nAdd:\nProvision for (recovery of) income taxes\n(815,364)\nInterest and other related expense, net\n86,752\nAmortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets\n87,268\nAmortization of acquired customer-based intangible assets\n108,248\nDepreciation\n47,128\nShare-based compensation\n22,373\nSpecial charges (recoveries)\n44,157\nOther (income) expense, net\n(4,565)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n555,519\n(3)\nThe following tables provide a composition of our major currencies for revenue and expenses, expressed as a percentage, for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nCurrencies\n% of Revenue\n% of Expenses*\n% of Revenue\n% of Expenses*\nEURO\n22\n%\n15\n%\n19\n%\n15\n%\nGBP\n6\n%\n6\n%\n6\n%\n7\n%\nCAD\n4\n%\n11\n%\n4\n%\n11\n%\nUSD\n58\n%\n50\n%\n62\n%\n52\n%\nOther\n10\n%\n18\n%\n9\n%\n15\n%\nTotal\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2018\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2017\nCurrencies\n% of Revenue\n% of Expenses*\n% of Revenue\n% of Expenses*\nEURO\n22\n%\n15\n%\n22\n%\n15\n%\nGBP\n6\n%\n6\n%\n7\n%\n7\n%\nCAD\n4\n%\n11\n%\n4\n%\n11\n%\nUSD\n58\n%\n51\n%\n58\n%\n52\n%\nOther\n10\n%\n17\n%\n9\n%\n15\n%\nTotal\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n*\nExpenses include all cost of revenues and operating expenses included within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, except for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation and Special charges (recoveries).\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opentext-reports-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2018-financial-results-300645797.html\nSOURCE Open Text Corporation",
