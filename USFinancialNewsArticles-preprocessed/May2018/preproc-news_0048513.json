    "text": "The following factors could affect Italian markets on Tuesday.\nReuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy. New items are marked with (*).\nFor a complete list of diary events in Italy please click on .\nPOLITICS Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League on Monday proposed Giuseppe Conte, a little-known law professor, as prime minister to lead their big-spending coalition government.\nBut instead of immediately endorsing their choice, President Sergio Mattarella played for time, seeking further consultations over the appointment of a political novice to head a mooted administration that has alarmed markets and the European Union.\nCOMPANIES (*) UNICREDIT The lender committed to drafting an action plan that would address the eight “improvement areas” the European Central Bank highlighted after carrying out an inspection at the lender in October over IT risks, several dailies reported. The inspection was related to the IT hacks the lender had announced in July and in which data for some 400,000 clients was violated.\n(*) CARIGE The lender is ready to sell its 20 percent stake in the Italian motorway Autostrada dei Fiori, Il Messaggero reported.\n(*) MONTE DEI PASCHI DI SIENA The lender has put on sale a portfolio of real estate assets worth about half a billion euros, MF reported without citing sources. The portfolio mainly includes bank branches that have been closed and on part of the properties a “sale and lease back” option could be used, the report added. The sales process could last until the autumn, MF said.\n(*) BANKING SECTOR Italian banks have booked writedowns for an extra 11.5 billion euros related to the introduction of the new IFRS 9 accounting standards in the first quarter of the year, Il Sole 24 Ore reported citing a report by consultancy Prometeia. (*) TELECOM ITALIA (TIM)\nThe phone group will raise the cost of the majority of its fixed line network contracts by 2.50 euros per month, starting from July, Il Messaggero reported. Given the company has some 15 million landline clients, the move is expected to raise an extra 450 million euros per year, the report added.\nYOOX NET-A-PORTER\nThe online retailer said on Monday CEO Federico Marchetti entered an agreement with Richemont’s unit RLG Italia Holding to transfer 2.417 million shares at 38 euros each, as part of the bid launched by Swiss luxury conglomerate. A further 12 top managers of the group also entered similar agreements, with 722,999 shares transferred in total.\n(*) FINCANTIERI The Australian committee for national defence is expected to give its opinion on the three offers received for a 23 billion euro tender to supply the Royal Australian Navy with nine new frigates, in an important step towards the decision of the winner of the tender, Il Sole 24 Ore reported. The Italian shipbuilder is one of the groups competing for the contract.\nBANCA IMMOBILIARE The bank’s board said the price of the takeover bid launched by Attestor Capital via Trinity Investments Designated Activity Company was not fair.\n(*) COIMA RES The real estate company said on Tuesday it signed with UniCredit a preliminary purchase agreement to acquire the Pavilion complex in Milan’s Porta Nuova for 45 million euros.\n(*) RETELIT The group said on Tuesday it was chosen by Milan’s San Donato Hospital as exclusive supplier and partner to upgrade the ICT systems.\nIPO Rainbow, the Italian animation producer famous for the Winx Club TV series, has called off plans to list its shares on the Milan stock market. (*) Credito Fondiario aims to accelerate growth and could do so by listing on the Milan Bourse as early as next year, if conditions permit, Il Sole 24 Ore reported.\n(*) ALITALIA State-appointed commissioners leading the carrier are trying to cut the costs of U.S. IT platform Sabre the airline uses, considered too expensive, Il Sole 24 Ore reported. It added that another IT contract, with IBM, had already been renegotiated.\nGRUPPO WASTE ITALIA Shareholders’ meeting (0900 GMT).\nMEDIACONTECH Annual general meeting (0900 GMT).\nCLASS EDITORI Annual and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (0730 GMT).\nCONAFI PRESTITO Annual and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (0900 GMT).\nFor Italian market data and news, click on codes in brackets:\n20 biggest gainers (in percentage)\n20 biggest losers (in percentage)\nFTSE IT allshare index\nFTSE Mib index\nFTSE Allstars index...\nFTSE Mid Cap index....\nBlock trades\nStories on Italy IT-LEN\nFor pan-European market data and news, click on codes in brackets: European Equities speed guide FTSEurofirst 300 index DJ STOXX index Top 10 STOXX sectors Top 10 EUROSTOXX sectors Top 10 Eurofirst 300 sectors Top 25 European pct gainers Top 25 European pct losers Main stock markets: Dow Jones Wall Street report Nikkei 225 Tokyo report FTSE 100 London report Xetra DAX Frankfurt market stories CAC-40 Paris market stories...
