    "text": "VONORE, Tenn., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MCBC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MCFT), the parent entity of MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC (“MasterCraft”), and NauticStar, LLC (“NauticStar”), today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended April 1, 2018.\nHighlights:\nNet sales for the third quarter increased to $93.8 million, up 60.4 percent from $58.5 million in the prior-year period from improvements in MasterCraft’s core business and the inclusion of NauticStar. Net sales year-to-date rose to $237.3 million, up from $170.3 million. Gross profit for the third quarter increased to $24.4 million, up 63.4 percent from $14.9 million in the prior-year period. Gross profit year-to-date rose to $62.5 million, up from $47.0 million. Third-quarter gross margin increased 50 basis points to 26.0 percent, from 25.5 percent in the prior-year period. MasterCraft’s standalone margin increase, mainly from reduced retail rebate activity, was partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar. Year-to-date gross margin decreased 130 basis points. Net income totaled $11.5 million for the 2018 third quarter, an increase of $9.3 million, or 411.1 percent, from the prior-year period. Year-to-date net income increased $13.3 million to $26.5 million. Third-quarter diluted earnings per share increased by $0.49, to $0.61, up from $0.12 in the prior-year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share increased to $1.42, versus $0.71 in fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 79.4 percent to $17.3 million from $9.6 million in the prior-year third quarter. Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA rose to $43.8 million from $31.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, increased 200 basis points to 18.4 percent, from 16.4 percent in the prior-year third quarter period. Adjusted EBITDA margin year-to-date decreased 20 basis points to 18.5 percent, from 18.7 percent. Third-quarter fully diluted, pro forma Adjusted net income per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $0.28, a 100 percent increase, to $0.56, up from $0.28 in the prior-year period, and year-to-date was up $0.47, to $1.42, versus $0.95. Year-to-date the company made debt payments of $28.3 million enabled by its strong cash generation capability.\nTerry McNew, MCBC Holdings, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continue to deliver strong top- and bottom-line performance, driven by double-digit gains from MasterCraft, the addition of NauticStar and our commitment to operational excellence across both organizations.”\nThird-Quarter Results\nNet sales for the third quarter ended April 1, 2018, rose 60.4 percent, or $35.3 million, to $93.8 million, compared to $58.5 million for the year-ago third quarter. The gain was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar which increased net sales by 42.0 percent, or $24.6 million. The remaining increase of 18.4 percent, or $10.7 million, was attributable to an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases.\nFiscal third-quarter gross profit increased $9.5 million, or 63.4 percent, to $24.4 million compared to $14.9 million for the prior-year period. NauticStar contributed $4.9 million to gross profit. Growth in MasterCraft unit sales volume, a favorable product mix, price increases and reduced retail rebate activity, offset by higher material costs, accounted for the remaining increase. Gross margin increased to 26.0 percent for the fiscal third quarter, compared to 25.5 percent for the year-earlier third quarter. The increase primarily stemmed from reduced retail rebate activity, which was partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar’s gross margin.\nSaid McNew, “Retail activity continues to gain momentum and we remain comfortable with our inventory levels, despite the effect of unseasonably cold and rainy weather and its effect on boat deliveries. We look forward to finishing fiscal year-end June 30, 2018 strong and working with our dealer network to further maximize their opportunities.”\nSelling and marketing expense increased $0.9 million, or 32.9 percent, to $3.6 million for the third quarter ended April 1, 2018, compared to $2.7 million for the year-earlier period. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $0.8 million in selling and marketing expenses.\nThird-quarter general and administrative expense declined by $2.8 million, or 35.8 percent, to $5.1 million, compared to $7.9 million for the prior-year period. This decline resulted mainly from a $4.3 million decrease for legal and advisory fees related to the fiscal 2017 Malibu Boats litigation, which was subsequently settled. This was partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $0.9 million in general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $0.2 million for legal and advisory fees related to the acquisition.\nFiscal third-quarter net income totaled $11.5 million, versus $2.2 million for the year-earlier period driven by the inclusion of NauticStar, reduced retail rebate activity and reduced tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income of $10.6 million, or $0.56 per share, on a fully diluted, pro forma weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of about 29 percent, which due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be lowered to about 24 percent for fiscal 2019. This compares with Adjusted net income of $5.3 million, or $0.28 per share, in the prior-year period.\nEBITDA was $16.7 million for the third quarter, compared to $5.1 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.4 percent, from 16.4 percent in fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million, versus $9.6 million in the prior-year period. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFiscal Year-to-Date Results\nNet sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ended April 1, 2018, increased 39.3 percent, or $67.0 million, to $237.3 million compared to $170.3 million for the year-earlier period. The gain was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar which increased net sales by 26.3 percent, or $44.8 million. The remaining gain of 13.0 percent, or $22.2 million, was attributable to MasterCraft and stemmed from an increase in sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases.\nYear-to-date gross profit increased $15.5 million, or 32.9 percent, to $62.5 million, compared to $47.0 million for the prior-year period. The inclusion of NauticStar contributed $8.5 million to gross profit. The remaining increase stemmed from gains in MasterCraft unit sales volume, reduced retail rebate activity and price increases, partially offset by higher material costs. Gross margin decreased to 26.3 percent year-to-date, compared to 27.6 percent for fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar’s gross margin which is in the high-teens.\nSelling and marketing expense increased $2.8 million, or 38.9 percent, to $10.0 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended April 1, 2018, compared to $7.2 million for the prior-year period. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $1.4 million in selling and marketing expenses, a rise in dealer meeting and training costs, higher compensation expense and an increase in promotional activities related to the introduction of the redesigned 2018 MasterCraft XStar.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 14.4 percent, to $14.4 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended April 1, 2018, compared to $16.8 million for the fiscal 2017 nine months. This decrease resulted mainly from a decrease of $5.9 million for legal and advisory fees related to Malibu Boats litigation referenced above. These declines were partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar, which increased general and administrative expenses by $1.7 million, and included a $1.7 million increase in for legal and advisory fees related to the NauticStar acquisition.\nFiscal year-to-date net income totaled $26.5 million, versus $13.3 in fiscal 2017 driven by the inclusion of NauticStar, reduced retail rebate activity and reduced tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income of $26.7 million, or $1.42 per share, for the nine-month period, on a fully diluted, pro forma weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated normalized annual effective tax rate of about 29 percent, which due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be lowered to about 24 percent for fiscal 2019. This compares with Adjusted net income of $17.8 million, or $0.95 per share, in the prior-year period.\nYear-to-date EBITDA was $40.7 million, compared to $25.4 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.5 percent, from 18.7 percent in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $43.8 million, from $31.9 million in the prior-year period. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nMarket Milestones\nNauticStar\nSince acquiring NauticStar in October 2017, MCBC Holdings has made significant progress leveraging its industry-leading strengths in operational excellence and financial management to further improve NauticStar’s output, quality and margin.\nSaid McNew, “In less than six months, we’ve helped NauticStar reconfigure their plant layout and increase daily production volume while improving both safety and quality. Additionally, we continue to add new NauticStar dealers with 18 dealer locations added this calendar year. We look forward to continuing to optimize NauticStar and driving their growth.”\nMasterCraft\nIn February, the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) and Boating Writers International honored MasterCraft’s XStar with a 2018 Innovation Award in the towboat category.\nSaid McNew, “With the new XStar, validation came when ranks of pro wakeboarders outside of the MasterCraft team were raving about its versatility. It’s truly the first wakeboard boat in the world that enables progression for anyone from family riders to the world’s best. We’re thrilled and honored to receive our seventh innovation award in nine years from the NMMA. We recognize that so many owners buy MasterCraft because of our industry-leading innovation, and with the XStar, its innovations transcend even beyond its on-water performance.”\nTwo decades after changing the sport of wakeboarding with the first XStar, the first true performance wakeboard boat, the 2018 XStar was completely redesigned to debut as the highest performing, most technologically advanced wake-specific boat in the industry.\nOutlook\nConcluded McNew, “Our year-to-date performance gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a strong finish to fiscal year-end June 30, 2018. And as always, we remain committed to our five-pronged growth strategy: developing new and innovative products; further penetrating the entry-level and mid-line segment of the performance sport boat category; capturing share from adjacent boating categories; strengthening our dealer network; and driving margin expansion through continuous operational excellence.”\nFor full fiscal year-end June 30, 2018 guidance, MCBC Holdings now expects net sales growth to be in the low- to mid-40 percent range including nine months of NauticStar’s projected net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margins for MasterCraft, excluding NauticStar, are expected to grow to the mid-19 percent range from 19.0 percent in 2017. After taking the dilutive effect of the NauticStar acquisition, consolidated EBITDA margins are expected to be in the low-18 percent range. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow in the high-40 percent range. NauticStar is expected to provide accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per share during the nine months post acquisition.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMCBC Holdings, Inc. will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss fiscal third-quarter results today, May 10, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including fees and expenses related to the company’s follow-on offering, transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of NauticStar, acquisition related inventory step up adjustment and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted net income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including fees and expenses related to the company’s follow-on offering, transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of NauticStar, our stock-based compensation and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP.” Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management’s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted net income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.\nFurthermore, certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release have been provided for comparison purposes only and these non-GAAP financial measures may change in the future based on our calculations and forecasts regarding the interpretation of certain recent changes to U.S. federal income tax law and anticipated impacts on our financial results.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 (Unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) Net income $ 11,454 $ 2,241 $ 26,509 $ 13,255 Income tax expense 2,848 1,480 8,009 8,017 Interest expense 897 561 2,527 1,684 Depreciation and amortization 1,456 821 3,665 2,442 EBITDA 16,655 5,103 40,710 25,398 Transaction expense (a) 247 4 1,733 63 Inventory step-up adjustment – acquisition related (b) — — 501 — Litigation charge (c) — 4,295 — 5,948 Stock-based compensation 353 215 881 520 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,255 $ 9,617 $ 43,825 $ 31,929 Adjusted EBITDA margin (d) 18.4% 16.4% 18.5% 18.7%\n(a) Represents fees, expenses and integration costs associated with our acquisition of NauticStar and our follow-on offering and secondary offering in the prior-year period.
