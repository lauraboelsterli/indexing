    "text": "SAN DIEGO, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Teradata Corp. (NYSE: TDC ) reported revenue of $506 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $491 million reported in the first quarter of 2017. Recurring revenue of $302 million was up 11 percent from the first quarter of 2017. Subscription booking mix was 62 percent in the quarter, significantly higher than the 40 percent - 50 percent anticipated. Teradata's first quarter year-over-year revenue comparison benefited from approximately 4 percentage points of foreign currency translation (1) .\nTeradata reported a net loss under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $(7) million in the first quarter, or $(0.06) per share, which compared to a net loss of $(2) million, or $(0.02) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and special items, was $23 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, as compared to $37 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. (2) Non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded expectation and guidance for the quarter.\n\"I am pleased with Teradata's strong momentum as we continue to execute our growth strategy. We exceeded our plan for revenue and earnings per share, and importantly, we attained these results while achieving a better rate of adoption of subscription licenses. Our increasing sales funnel and the accelerating shift to subscription are clear demonstrations of the value of Teradata to our customers,\" said Vic Lund, Officer, Teradata. \"The Teradata team has performed an amazing accomplishment in driving Teradata's transformation, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver our winning strategy in 2018.\"\nGross Margin\nFor the first quarter of 2018, GAAP gross margin was 44.1 percent versus 45.8 percent for the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items, gross margin for first quarter 2018 was 48.4 percent, versus 51.1 percent in the prior-year period. (2)\nOperating (Loss)/Income\nOperating loss reported under GAAP in the first quarter of 2018 was $(4) million compared to breakeven in the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items, operating income was $35 million in the first quarter of 2018, versus $59 million in the first quarter of 2017 (2) . As expected, non-GAAP operating income was lower due to the shift to subscription and strategic transformation investments as compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nTeradata's GAAP tax rate was 12.5 percent for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 0 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding special items, Teradata's non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 35.1 percent in the first quarter of 2017. (2) The decrease in the non-GAAP effective tax rate was largely due to the decrease in the U.S. statutory rate effective in 2018 as a result of recently enacted U.S. tax reform.\nCash Flow\nTeradata generated $184 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $248 million in the same period in 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, Teradata generated $156 million of free cash flow (cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software), compared to $230 million in the first quarter of 2017. (3) The expected decrease in cash from operating activities and free cash flow was due to the company's ongoing transition to subscription-based purchasing options, which result in the company collecting less cash in the current period as customers pay over time, the higher expense run rate from prior-year strategic transformation investments, and timing of cash collections.\nBalance Sheet\nTeradata ended the first quarter of 2018 with $939 million in cash. As of the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company repatriated cash to pay off its revolving credit facility and fund share repurchases. Teradata plans to repatriate the majority of its remaining offshore cash across the balance of 2018 to fund share repurchases and to retain the remainder for general corporate purposes.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Teradata had total debt of $525 million, all of which was outstanding under a term loan. Teradata had no borrowings under its $400 million revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Teradata repurchased $76 million of the company's common stock, or approximately 2.1 million shares.\nGuidance\nDue to higher than expected bookings mix shift to subscription-based transactions, where revenue is recognized over time rather than up front in the current period, Teradata now expects 2018 full year revenue to be approximately $2.15 billion to $2.18 billion. Also, due to the accelerating shift in mix to subscription, Teradata expects revenue in the second quarter of 2018 to be in the $520 million to $530 million range.\nTeradata also now expects full-year 2018 GAAP earnings per share to be $0.58 to $0.64 as a result of the faster than anticipated shift of bookings mix to subscription-based transactions. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and special items, earnings per share is expected to be in the $1.40 to $1.46 range (2) . GAAP (loss)/earnings per share in the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be in the $(0.02) to $0.00 range. Non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter is expected to be in the $0.17 to $0.19 range (2) .\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled today at 2:00 p.m. (PT) to discuss the company's first quarter 2018 results. Access to the conference call, as well as a replay of the call, is available on Teradata's website at investor.teradata.com .\nSupplemental Financial Information\nAdditional information regarding Teradata's operating results is provided below as well as on the Investor Relations page of Teradata's website.\n1. The impact of currency is determined by calculating the prior-period results using the current-year monthly average currency rates. See the foreign currency fluctuation schedule on the Investor Relations page of the company's web site at investor.teradata.com , which is used to determine revenue on a constant currency (\"CC\") basis.\nRevenue\n(in millions)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31\n2018\n2017\n% Change as\nReported\n% Change in\nConstant Currency\nRecurring\n$302\n$273\n11%\n7%\nPerpetual software licenses and hardware\n69\n90\n(23%)\n(27%)\nConsulting services\n135\n128\n5%\n0%\nTotal revenue\n$506\n$491\n3%\n(1%)\nAmericas\n$264\n$267\n(1%)\n(1%)\nInternational\n242\n224\n8%\n(1%)\nTotal revenue\n$506\n$491\n3%\n(1%)\n2. Teradata reports its results in accordance with GAAP. However, as described below, the company believes that certain non-GAAP measures such as non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, or EPS, all of which exclude certain items (as well as free cash flow) are useful for investors. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following tables reconcile Teradata's actual and projected results and EPS under GAAP to the company's actual and projected non-GAAP results and EPS for the periods presented, which exclude certain specified items. Our management internally uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit, operating income, net income and EPS, excluding certain items, to understand, manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions on a regular basis. The company believes such non-GAAP financial measures (1) provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations, (2) are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations and results, that may be more easily compared to peer companies and allow investors a view of the company's operating results excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items, (3) provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends, and (4) provide consistency and comparability with past reports and projections of future results.\nTeradata's reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results included in this release.\n(in millions, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31\nGross Profit:\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\nGAAP Gross Profit\n$ 223\n$ 225\n(1%)\n% of Revenue\n44.1%\n45.8%\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation expense\n4\n3\nAcquisition, integration and reorganization related costs\n3\n2\nCapitalized Software ASC 985-20\n15\n21\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\n$ 245\n$ 251\n(2%)\n% of Revenue\n48.4 %\n51.1%\nOperating (Loss)/Income:\nGAAP Operating Loss\n$ (4)\n-\n-\n% of Revenue\n(0.8%)\n0.0%\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation expense\n19\n15\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n2\n2\nAcquisition, integration and reorganization related costs\n3\n21\nCapitalized Software ASC 985-20\n15\n21\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\n$ 35\n$ 59\n(41%)\n% of Revenue\n6.9%\n12.0%\nNet (Loss)/Income:\nGAAP Net Loss\n$(7)\n$(2)\n(250%)\n% of Revenue\n(1.4%)\n(0.4%)\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation expense\n19\n15\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n2\n2\nAcquisition, integration and reorganization related costs\n3\n21\nCapitalized Software ASC 985-20\n15\n21\nIncome tax adjustments*\n(9)\n(20)\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n$23\n$37\n(38%)\n% of Revenue\n4.5%\n7.5%\nThree Months\nEnded March 31\nEarnings Per Share:\n2018\n2017\n2018 Q2\nGuidance\n2018 FY\nGuidance\nGAAP (Loss)/Earnings Per Share\n$(0.06)\n$(0.02)\n$(0.02) - 0.00\n$0.58 - 0.64\nExcluding:\nStock-based compensation expense\n0.16\n0.12\n0.13\n0.55\nAmortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n0.05\nAcquisition, integration and reorganization\nrelated costs\n0.02\n0.16\n0.01\n0.03\nCapitalized Software ASC 985-20\n0.12\n0.16\n0.10\n0.40\nIncome tax adjustments*\n(0.07)\n(0.15)\n(0.06)\n(0.21)\nImpact of dilution **\n-\n(0.01)\n-\n-\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$0. 19\n$0.28\n$0.17 - 0.19\n$1.40 – 1.46\n* Represents the income tax effect of the pre-tax adjustments to reconcile GAAP to Non-GAAP income based on the applicable jurisdictional statutory tax rate of the underlying item.

As described below, the company believes that free cash flow is a useful non-GAAP measure for investors. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash provided/used by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software. Free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under GAAP and therefore, Teradata's definition may differ from other companies' definitions of this measure. Teradata's management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures for, among other things, investment in the company's existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the company's balance sheet, repurchase of the company's stock and repayment of the company's debt obligations, if any. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nCash provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n$184\n$248\nLess capital expenditures for:\nExpenditures for property and equipment\n(26)\n(16)\nAdditions to capitalized software\n(2)\n(2)\nTotal capital expenditures\n(28)\n(18)\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure) (3)\n$156\n$230\nNote to Investors\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
