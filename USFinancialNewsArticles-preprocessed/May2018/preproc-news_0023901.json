Excluding the campus investment, normalized free cash flow was $84 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 Twelve-month backlog of $3.32 billion, up $60 million sequentially Quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, to be paid on July 20, 2018\nST. LOUIS, Amdocs Limited (NASDAQ:DOX) today reported operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased to report solid results for our second fiscal quarter which included double-digit growth in Europe and record revenue in Rest of World. Our operating profitability was stable and we grew our 12-month backlog to another new high. Additionally, we extended our technology leadership with the launch of AmdocsOne at Mobile World Congress and we utilized our cash to close on the acquisitions of Vubiquity, as well as UXP Systems, a leader in User Lifecycle Management solutions,” said Eli Gelman, president and chief executive officer of Amdocs Management Limited.\nGelman continued, “Rest of World was a highlight of the quarter as we focused on project execution and securing new awards. In Southeast Asia, we commenced the ramp-up of the seven-year project and managed services agreement we signed with PLDT earlier in Q2. Additionally, we made an important step in Africa where we were selected to provide our revenue assurance capabilities to Safaricom, a major mobile network operator in Kenya with nearly 30 million subscribers.”\nGelman concluded, “We enter Q3 on-track to deliver a stronger second half, although we are of course monitoring the many moving parts affecting our outlook, including those resulting from consolidation activity currently in progress across our main operating regions. Additionally, we are focused on our execution and profitability, which combined with expected normalized free cash flow generation of approximately $500 million for the full year, leaves us well positioned to deliver diluted non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the range of 4% to 8% in fiscal 2018.”\nRevenue\nRevenue for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $992.3 million, up 1.5% or $14.6 million sequentially from the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and up 2.7% as compared to last year’s second fiscal quarter. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 includes a positive impact from foreign currency movements of approximately $5 million relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and contributions from M&A consummated in the second fiscal quarter.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nThe Company's GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $101.7 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $112.6 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year’s second quarter. Net income on a non-GAAP basis was $137.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $139.2 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nReturning Cash to Shareholders\nQuarterly Cash Dividend Program: On May 10, 2018, the Board approved the Company’s next quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 per share and set June 29, 2018 as the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive the dividend, which will be payable on July 20, 2018. Share Repurchase Activity: Repurchased $120 million of ordinary shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nTwelve-month Backlog\nTwelve-month backlog, which includes anticipated revenue related to contracts, estimated revenue from managed services contracts, letters of intent, maintenance and estimated on-going support activities, was $3.32 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up $60 million from the end of the prior quarter.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nRevenue of approximately $990-$1,030 million, including an immaterial sequential impact from foreign currency fluctuations as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Third quarter fiscal 2018 guidance incorporates full quarter contributions from recently closed acquisitions Diluted GAAP EPS of approximately $0.71-$0.81. The impact on diluted GAAP EPS of the acquisition of Vubiquity and UXP Systems is subject to finalization of the purchase price allocation and of the anticipated acquisition-related expenses related to operating adjustments, restructuring charges and other acquisition-related costs. Diluted non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.00-$1.06, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and approximately $0.05-$0.07 per share of equity-based compensation expense, net of related tax effects. Expected non-GAAP effective tax rate around the low-end of the annual target range of 13%-17% in the third quarter fiscal 2018\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nExpects revenue growth of 2.3%-4.3% year-over-year as reported compared with previous guidance of 0.0%-4.0% year-over-year Expects revenue growth of 1.3%-3.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis compared with previous guidance of (1.0%)-3.0% year-over-year Full year fiscal 2018 revenue guidance incorporates an incremental revenue contribution of more than 1% from Vubiquity on both a constant currency and reported basis, and an expected positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations of about 1% year-over-year Expects GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of roughly 0.0%-6.0% year-over-year. The impact on diluted GAAP EPS of the acquisition of Vubiquity and UXP Systems is subject to finalization of the purchase price allocation and of the anticipated expenses related to operating adjustments, restructuring charges and other acquisition-related costs Reiterates Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of roughly 4.0%-8.0% year-over-year, excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs and approximately $0.26-$0.29 per share of equity-based compensation expense, net of related tax effects. Expected non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain within the same target range of 13%-17% for the full year fiscal 2018 The impact of recent acquisitions on Amdocs’ diluted non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges, other acquisition-related costs and equity based compensation expense, net of related tax effects) is expected to be neutral in fiscal year 2018, and accretive thereafter\nOur third fiscal quarter 2018 and full year fiscal 2018 outlook takes into consideration the Company’s expectations regarding macro and industry specific risks and various uncertainties and certain assumptions that we will discuss on our earnings conference call. However, Amdocs notes market dynamics continue to shift rapidly and that it cannot predict all possible outcomes, including those resulting from AT&T’s proposed merger with Time Warner, T-Mobile’s proposed merger with Sprint, or from other current and potential customer consolidation activity in North America.\nConference Call Details\nAmdocs will host a conference call on May 10, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2018 results. To participate, please dial +1 (844) 513-7152, or +1 (508) 637-5600 outside the United States, approximately 15 minutes before the call and enter passcode 4175387. The call will also be carried live on the Internet via the Amdocs website, www.amdocs.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and other non-GAAP financial measures, including free cash flow, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth. These non-GAAP measures exclude the following items:\namortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs; changes in fair value of certain acquisition-related liabilities; nonrecurring restructuring charges; equity-based compensation expense; and tax effects related to the above.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Amdocs believes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Amdocs’ results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Amdocs’ results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nAmdocs believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and other financial measures, including free cash flow, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations, as well as the net amount of cash generated by its business operations after taking into account capital spending required to maintain or expand the business.\nFor its internal budgeting process and in monitoring the results of the business, Amdocs’ management uses financial statements that do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs, changes in fair value of certain acquisition-related liabilities, equity-based compensation expense and related tax effects. Amdocs’ management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Amdocs. In addition, Amdocs believes that significant groups of investors exclude these items in reviewing its results and those of its competitors, because the amounts of the items between companies can vary greatly depending on the assumptions used by an individual company in determining the amounts of the items.\nAmdocs further believes that, where the adjustments used in calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are based on specific, identified amounts that impact different line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income (including cost of revenue, research and development, selling, general and administrative, operating income, income taxes and net income), it is useful to investors to understand how these specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income are affected by these adjustments.
