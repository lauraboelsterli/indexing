    "text": "The Turkish lira tumbled more than 5 percent on Wednesday before recovering some ground, the latest drop in a sell-off that reflects growing investor alarm over the direction of monetary policy under President Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe decline, exacerbated by stop-loss selling by Japanese retail investors overnight, brings the lira's losses to more than 20 percent so far this year and puts it on track for its worst monthly performance since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe sell-off has also increased expectations that the central bank may be forced to call an extraordinary meeting to raise interest rates before its next scheduled policy-setting meeting on June 7, as it has done in previous years.\n\"We expect the MPC to hold an interim meeting over the coming days to raise interest rates by at least 200bp,\" Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics said in a note to clients.\n\"If policymakers refrain from tightening monetary policy, the risk of a disorderly adjustment and a sharp economic downturn (possibly recession) will mount.\"\nThe lira was at 4.8500 at 0855 GMT from its close of 4.6746 on Tuesday. It earlier touched a record low of 4.9290. It also fell against the Japanese yen , amid talk Japanese retail investors were selling the lira as it hit stop-loss levels.\n\"We are bearish on the lira and always have been given its very weak external balances and with macroeconomic policy moving in the wrong direction as well,\" said Kiran Kowshik, emerging markets forex strategist at UniCredit.\nA self-described \"enemy of interest rates\", Erdogan wants borrowing costs lowered to spur credit growth and construction, and he said last week he would seek greater control over monetary policy after elections set for June 24.\nshow chapters BBVA chairman: Hope Turkey will take right decisions after elections 10 Hours Ago | 02:26 Economy officials told Reuters the government's economic management team met at the start of this week to discuss potential measures, including possible steps by the central bank. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Central Bank Governor Murat Cetinkaya attended the meeting.\nRatings agencies sounded alarm about monetary policy. S&P Global senior sovereign analyst Frank Gill told Reuters government finances could deteriorate rapidly if authorities failed to stem pressure on the currency and government borrowing costs.\nInvestors want to see decisive rate increases to rein in double-digit inflation, and Erdogan's comments have reinforced long-standing worries about the central bank's ability to do that.\nBorsa Istanbul Group, the Istanbul stock exchange company, said in a statement on Wednesday it had converted its foreign currency assets into lira, aside from its short-term needs, in a step to support the Turkish currency.\nshow chapters Turkey's President Erdogan calls for a snap election in June 2:42 AM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 | 02:03 The lira's weakness was exacerbated by dollar gains against a basket of currencies, with investors awaiting the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting for hints on the pace of monetary tightening.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 15.30 percent at the opening from a last trade of 14.92 percent on Tuesday.\nThe main BIST 100 share index fell 0.22 percent to 103,105 points on Tuesday.",
