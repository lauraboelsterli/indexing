Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n“Things like that is what you need to win golf tournaments.”\nThe ensuing birdie restored Day’s two-shot lead and he parred the last to shoot 68 and finish at 12-under 272, two strokes ahead of Americans Aaron Wise (68) and Nick Watney (69) at Quail Hollow in Charlotte.\nDay rated the victory one of the best of his career, not because of the quality of his play but more due to his ability to get the job done without his best game.\n“I was fighting demons out there because when you’re not hitting it good, it just feels like the life is getting sucked out of you,” he said.\n“I had no idea where the ball was going today. I had no confidence in my ability to hit proper tee shots. I was just trying to keep it inside the tree line.

My next step is to try to win a major this year.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ken Ferris/Ian Ransom",
