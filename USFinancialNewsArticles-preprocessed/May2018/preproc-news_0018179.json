(NYSE: LFGR), a diversified consumer internet company comprised of several marketplace and media properties, today reported financial ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Summary\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Marketplaces revenue $ 20,967 $ 15,876 Media revenue 12,780 11,362 Total revenue $ 33,747 $ 27,238 Net loss $ (5,925 ) $ (10,018 ) EPS - basic and diluted $ (0.26 ) $ (0.50 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ (1,247 ) $ (4,425 ) Net cash used in operating activities $ (5,299 ) $ (7,699 ) Free cash flow (1) $ (7,001 ) $ (8,715 ) (1) These non-GAAP financial measures are described below and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying tables. Q1 2018 Financial Summary:\nLeaf Group is comprised of two reporting segments: Marketplaces and Media.\nFor the first quarter of 2018:\nTotal revenue increased 24% year-over-year from $27.2 million to $33.7 million due to a 32% increase in Marketplaces revenue and a 12% increase in Media revenue. Marketplaces revenue increased 32% year-over-year from $15.9 million to $21.0 million due to a 25% increase in Society6 revenue, inclusive of Deny Designs acquired in May 2017, and a 103% increase in Saatchi Art revenue, inclusive of The Other Art Fair. Society6 revenue growth was driven by the acquisition of Deny Designs in May 2017 and an increase in average order value from price increases and a reduction in promotional discounts. Saatchi Art revenue growth was driven by the introduction of three art fairs hosted by The Other Art Fair, increased conversion on Saatchi Art, and a higher commission rate on Saatchi Art initiated in Q2 2017. Media revenue increased 12% year-over-year from $11.4 million to $12.8 million. The increase in Media revenue was primarily driven by a 25% increase in Livestrong revenue as a result of traffic growth and improved revenue per visit. Net loss was $(5.9) million for the quarter, improving 41% year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA was $(1.2) million for the quarter, improving 72% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth in both Marketplaces and Media, reduced Media operating expenses, and a decrease in Marketplaces expenses as a percentage of revenue. Cash and cash equivalents was $46.5 million at period end, reflecting $23.4 million in net proceeds from the follow-on offering of 3,373,332 shares of Leaf Group common stock completed in February 2018. On a consolidated basis, Leaf Group’s properties reached over 54 million average monthly unique visitors in the U.S. during Q1 (source: Jan – Mar 2018 U.S. comScore).\nOperating Metrics (1) :\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange\nMarketplaces Metrics: Number of Transactions (2) 307,935 267,768 15 % Gross Transaction Value (3) (in thousands) $ 26,592 $ 19,675 35 % Media Metrics: Visits (4) (in thousands) 771,571 695,543 11 % Revenue per Visit (RPV) (5) $ 16.56 $ 16.34 1 % (1) Beginning in 2018, gross transaction value was added as an operating metric for the Marketplaces segment. Gross transaction value provides a measure of the overall volume that flows through the Company’s marketplaces in a given period. The Company will no longer be reporting on average revenue per transaction, video views and social media followers as management no longer uses these as key operating metrics to evaluate the business. (2) Number of transactions is defined as the total number of transactions successfully completed by a customer during the applicable period, excluding certain transactions generated by Saatchi Art’s The Other Art Fair that relate to the hosting of the art fairs, such as sales of leased space to artists, sponsorships fees and ticket sales. (3) Gross transaction value is defined as the total dollar value of Marketplaces transactions, excluding certain transactions generated by Saatchi Art’s The Other Art Fair that relate to the hosting of the art fairs, such as sales of leased space to artists, sponsorships fees and ticket sales. Gross transaction value is the total amount paid by the customer including the total product price, inclusive of artist margin, shipping charges, taxes, and is net of any promotional discounts. Gross transaction value does not reflect any subsequent cancellations, refunds or credits and does not represent revenue earned by the Company. (4) Visits are defined as the total number of times users access the company’s content across (a) one of its owned and operated properties and/or (b) one of its partners’ properties, to the extent that the visited partner web pages are hosted by the company. In each case, breaks of access of at least 30 minutes constitute a unique visit. (5) RPV is defined as Media revenue per one thousand visits. Conference Call and Webcast Information\nLeaf Group will host a corresponding conference call and live webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time). To access the conference call, dial 833-287-0803 (U.S./CAN) or 647-689-4462 (International) and reference conference ID 2295616. To participate on the live call, analysts should dial-in at least 10 minutes prior to the commencement of the call. A live webcast also will be available on the Investor Relations section of Leaf Group’s corporate website at http://ir.leafgroup.com and via replay beginning approximately two hours after the completion of the call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Leaf Group uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to enhance the user’s overall understanding of Leaf Group’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release, together with the GAAP financial results, are the primary measures used by the company’s management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the company’s financial performance and operating trends, including period-to-period comparisons, because they exclude certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. Management also uses these measures to prepare and update the company’s short- and long-term financial and operational plans, to evaluate investment decisions, and in its discussions with investors, commercial bankers, equity research analysts and other users of the company’s financial statements. Accordingly, the company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the company’s operating results in the same manner as the company’s management and in comparing operating results across periods and to those of Leaf Group’s peer companies.\nThe use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations because they do not reflect all items of income and expense, or cash flows, that affect the company’s financial performance and operations. An additional limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have standardized meanings, and therefore other companies, including peer companies, may use the same or similarly named measures but exclude or include different items or use different computations. Management compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Investors and others are encouraged to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nThe company defines Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as net income (loss) excluding interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and acquisition, disposition and realignment costs. Management believes that the exclusion of certain expenses and gains in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the company’s underlying core revenue and operating costs that is focused more closely on the current costs necessary to operate the company’s businesses, and reflects its ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful analysis of trends. Management also believes that excluding certain non-cash charges can be useful because the amounts of such expenses is the result of long-term investment decisions made in previous periods rather than day-to-day operating decisions.\nThe company defines Segment Operating Contribution as net income (loss) excluding corporate or unallocated expenses, interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Management believes that the exclusion of certain expenses and gains in calculating Segment Operating Contribution provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the segment’s underlying revenue and operating costs that is focused more closely on the current costs necessary to operate the segment, and reflects the segment’s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful analysis of trends. Management also believes that excluding certain non-cash charges can be useful because the amounts of such expenses is the result of long-term investment decisions made in previous periods rather than day-to-day operating decisions.\nThe company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities net of cash flows from acquisition, disposition and realignment activities; capital expenditures to acquire property and equipment; and purchases of intangible assets. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with useful information to measure operating liquidity because it reflects the company’s underlying cash flows from recurring operating activities after investing in capital assets and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow is used by management, and may also be useful for investors, to assess the company’s ability to generate cash flow for a variety of strategic opportunities, including reinvesting in its businesses, pursuing new business opportunities and potential acquisitions, paying dividends and repurchasing shares.\nAbout Leaf Group\nLeaf Group Ltd.
