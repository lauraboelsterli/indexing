For the Company's purposes, Core Earnings is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee due to the Company's external manager, acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, depreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles and any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income and, to the extent deducted from net income (loss), distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties or interests therein. The amount is adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash adjustments as determined by the Company's external manager and approved by a majority of the Company's independent directors.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Core Earnings\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data)\nInvesting\nLending\nProperty\nand Servicing\nSegment\nSegment\nSegment\nCorporate\nTotal\nNet income (loss) attributable to Starwood\nProperty Trust, Inc .\n$\n109,516\n$\n(2,894)\n$\n72,596\n$\n(79,286)\n$\n99,932\nAdd / (Deduct):\nNon-controlling interests attributable to Woodstar II\nClass A Units\n—\n2,453\n—\n—\n2,453\nNon-cash equity compensation expense\n563\n43\n975\n3,199\n4,780\nManagement incentive fee\n—\n—\n—\n9,634\n9,634\nAcquisition and investment pursuit costs\n119\n(93)\n(29)\n—\n(3)\nDepreciation and amortization\n17\n26,805\n4,912\n—\n31,734\nLoan loss allowance, net\n1,538\n—\n—\n—\n1,538\nInterest income adjustment for securities\n(197)\n—\n(1,062)\n—\n(1,259)\nExtinguishment of debt, net\n—\n—\n—\n9,755\n9,755\nOther non-cash items\n—\n(562)\n124\n881\n443\nReversal of unrealized (gains) / losses on:\nLoans held-for-sale\n1,692\n—\n(9,492)\n—\n(7,800)\nSecurities\n704\n—\n(13,979)\n—\n(13,275)\nDerivatives\n10,529\n(1,436)\n(5,422)\n14,398\n18,069\nForeign currency\n(13,550)\n(2)\n3\n—\n(13,549)\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities\n(1,444)\n3,515\n(1,596)\n—\n475\nPurchases and sales of properties\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nRecognition of realized gains / (losses) on:\nLoans held-for-sale\n(875)\n—\n9,643\n—\n8,768\nSecurities\n—\n—\n(4,114)\n—\n(4,114)\nDerivatives\n(5,725)\n(479)\n5,531\n—\n(673)\nForeign currency\n8,051\n2\n(41)\n—\n8,012\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities\n1,847\n—\n1,044\n—\n2,891\nPurchases and sales of properties\n—\n(210)\n(1,765)\n—\n(1,975)\nCore Earnings (Loss)\n$\n112,785\n$\n27,142\n$\n57,328\n$\n(41,419)\n$\n155,836\nCore Earnings (Loss) per Weighted Average\nDiluted Share\n$\n0.42\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.21\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n0.58\nStarwood Property Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet by Segment\nAs of March 31, 2018\n(Amounts in thousands)\nInvesting\nInvesting\nLending\nProperty\nand Servicing\nand Servicing\nSegment\nSegment\nSegment\nCorporate\nSubtotal\nVIEs\nTotal\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n30,048\n$\n14,738\n$\n55,167\n$\n179,987\n$\n279,940\n$\n6,215\n$\n286,155\nRestricted cash\n52,855\n15,343\n8,478\n16,590\n93,266\n—\n93,266\nLoans held-for-investment, net\n6,179,100\n—\n3,686\n—\n6,182,786\n—\n6,182,786\nLoans held-for-sale\n662,971\n—\n60,762\n—\n723,733\n—\n723,733\nLoans transferred as secured\nborrowings\n74,463\n—\n—\n—\n74,463\n—\n74,463\nInvestment securities\n490,494\n—\n1,045,217\n—\n1,535,711\n(1,021,248)\n514,463\nProperties, net\n—\n2,699,492\n289,372\n—\n2,988,864\n—\n2,988,864\nIntangible assets\n—\n118,522\n85,999\n—\n204,521\n(24,892)\n179,629\nInvestment in unconsolidated\nentities\n29,537\n107,189\n45,361\n—\n182,087\n(21,975)\n160,112\nGoodwill\n—\n—\n140,437\n—\n140,437\n—\n140,437\nDerivative assets\n4,240\n36,056\n771\n—\n41,067\n—\n41,067\nAccrued interest receivable\n39,002\n163\n258\n1,830\n41,253\n—\n41,253\nOther assets\n328,622\n88,708\n50,830\n2,083\n470,243\n(2,923)\n467,320\nVIE assets, at fair value\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n49,233,307\n49,233,307\nTotal Assets\n$\n7,891,332\n$\n3,080,211\n$\n1,786,338\n$\n200,490\n$\n12,958,371\n$\n48,168,484\n$\n61,126,855\nLiabilities and Equity\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable, accrued\nexpenses and other liabilities\n$\n18,332\n$\n68,115\n$\n48,925\n$\n20,894\n$\n156,266\n$\n1,297\n$\n157,563\nRelated-party payable\n20\n—\n28\n31,733\n31,781\n—\n31,781\nDividends payable\n—\n—\n—\n126,244\n126,244\n—\n126,244\nDerivative liabilities\n19,576\n20,630\n330\n17,064\n57,600\n—\n57,600\nSecured financing agreements, net\n2,936,419\n1,936,367\n408,104\n297,124\n5,578,014\n(23,700)\n5,554,314\nUnsecured senior notes, net\n—\n—\n—\n2,252,631\n2,252,631\n—\n2,252,631\nSecured borrowings on\ntransferred loans, net\n74,275\n—\n—\n—\n74,275\n—\n74,275\nVIE liabilities, at fair value\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n48,167,760\n48,167,760\nTotal Liabilities\n3,048,622\n2,025,112\n457,387\n2,745,690\n8,276,811\n48,145,357\n56,422,168\nEquity:\nStarwood Property Trust, Inc.\nStockholders' Equity:\nCommon stock\n—\n—\n—\n2,671\n2,671\n—\n2,671\nAdditional paid-in capital\n2,054,473\n850,185\n562,815\n1,260,710\n4,728,183\n—\n4,728,183\nTreasury stock\n—\n—\n—\n(104,194)\n(104,194)\n—\n(104,194)\nAccumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss)\n59,082\n16,259\n(31)\n—\n75,310\n—\n75,310\nRetained earnings (accumulated\ndeficit)\n2,718,567\n(17,229)\n759,611\n(3,704,387)\n(243,438)\n—\n(243,438)\nTotal Starwood Property\nTrust, Inc.
