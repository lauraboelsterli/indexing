    "text": "ATLANTA, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE: APTS) (\"we,\" \"our,\" the \"Company\" or \"Preferred Apartment Communities\") today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, all per share results are reported based on the basic weighted average shares of Common Stock and Class A Units of the Company's operating partnership (\"Class A Units\") outstanding. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\n\"As we continue executing our strategy of property acquisitions, we are able to utilize our unique access to capital through the independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisory channels to issue our Series A Preferred Stock and mShares. These additional capital channels beyond the sale of our common stock give us a significant competitive advantage as we explore opportunities,\" said Daniel M. DuPree, Preferred Apartment Communities' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nFinancial Highlights\nOur operating results are presented below. Net income (loss) per share reflected gains on sales of real estate of approximately $1.14 per share for the first quarter 2017 and $0.52 per share for the first quarter 2018.\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n% change\nRevenues (in thousands)\n$\n90,370\n$\n66,561\n35.8\n%\nPer share data:\nNet income (loss) (1)\n$\n(0.14)\n$\n0.54\n—\nFFO (2)\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.35\n5.7\n%\nAFFO (2)\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.27\n(3.7)\n%\nDividends (3)\n$\n0.25\n$\n0.22\n13.6\n%\n(1) Per weighted average share of Common Stock outstanding for the periods indicated.\n(2) FFO and AFFO results are presented per weighted average share of Common Stock and Class A Unit in our Operating Partnership outstanding for the periods indicated. See Reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders and Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\n(3) Per share of Common Stock and Class A Unit outstanding.\nFor the first quarter 2018, our FFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 68.5% and our FFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 57.0%. (A) For the first quarter 2018, our AFFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 96.7% and our AFFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 65.2%. (A) For the first quarter 2018, our same store net operating income for our established multifamily communities increased 10.3% as compared to the first quarter 2017. (B) At March 31, 2018, the market value of our common stock was $14.19. A hypothetical investment in our Common Stock in our initial public offering on April 5, 2011, assuming the reinvestment of all dividends and no transaction costs, would have resulted in an average annual return of approximately 17.3% through March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, our total assets were approximately $3.4 billion compared to approximately $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $851 million, or approximately 33.4%. This growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of 18 real estate properties (partially offset by the sale of two properties) and an increase of approximately $74.1 million in the funded amount of our real estate loan investment portfolio since March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the average age of our multifamily communities was approximately 5.6 years, which is one of the youngest in the multifamily REIT industry. Approximately 89.1% of our permanent property-level mortgage debt has fixed interest rates or has variable interest rates which are capped. We believe we are well protected against potential increases in market interest rates. At March 31, 2018, our leverage, as measured by the ratio of our debt to the undepreciated book value of our total assets, was approximately 53.9%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $31.4 million, an increase of approximately $13.1 million, or 71.9%, compared to approximately $18.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, our physical occupancy for established multifamily communities was 95.1%. On January 16, 2018, we closed on a real estate loan investment of up to $3.5 million in support of a mixed-use project in North Augusta, South Carolina. On February 13, 2018, we closed on a real estate loan investment of up to $137.6 million in support of a 551-unit multifamily community in San Jose, California. On March 20, 2018, we sold our oldest multifamily community, Lake Cameron, which is located in Raleigh, North Carolina for approximately $43.5 million, which resulted in an average annual return of 19% from January 23, 2013, the date the property was acquired. Remediation of property damages due to Hurricane Harvey at our Stone Creek multifamily community located in Port Arthur, Texas is progressing on schedule, and we anticipate full completion by May 2018. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, rental revenues decreased approximately $252,000 due to lost rents. During the first quarter, we received proceeds from our insurance company of $588,000 for lost rents, which has been reflected in income for the first quarter 2018. We expect to record a full recovery of the remainder of lost revenues upon settlement with our insurance carrier and receipt of funds later in 2018.\n(A) We calculate the AFFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders as the ratio of Common Stock dividends and distributions to preferred stockholders to AFFO. We calculate the AFFO payout ratio to preferred stockholders as the ratio of Preferred Stock dividends to the sum of Preferred Stock dividends and AFFO. Since our operations resulted in a net loss from continuing operations for the periods presented, a payout ratio based on net loss is not calculable. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\n(B) Same store net operating income is a non-GAAP measure. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\nAcquisitions of Properties\nDuring the first quarter 2018, we acquired the following properties:\nProperty\nLocation (MSA)\nUnits\nLeasable\nsquare feet\nMultifamily communities:\nThe Lux at Sorrel\nJacksonville, FL\n265\nn/a\nGreen Park\nAtlanta, GA\n310\nn/a\nOffice buildings:\nArmour Yards\nAtlanta, GA\nn/a\n187,000\nReal Estate Assets\nOwned as of\nMarch 31, 2018\nPotential additions\nfrom real estate\nloan investment\nportfolio (1)\nPotential total\nMultifamily communities:\nProperties\n31\n15\n46\nUnits\n9,768\n4,378\n14,146\nGrocery-anchored shopping centers:\nProperties\n39\n—\n39\nGross leasable area (square feet)\n4,055,714\n—\n4,055,714\nStudent housing properties:\nProperties\n4\n6\n10\nUnits\n891\n1,457\n2,348\nBeds\n2,950\n4,145\n7,095\nOffice buildings:\nProperties\n5\n—\n5\nRentable square feet\n1,539,000\n—\n1,539,000\n(1) We evaluate each project individually and we make no assurance that we will acquire any of the underlying properties from our real estate loan investment portfolio.\nSubsequent to Quarter End\nOn April 11, 2018, we closed on a real estate loan and member loan investment of up to approximately $30.2 million in support of a proposed 302-unit multifamily community in Alexandria, Virginia.\nOn April 27, 2018, we acquired a grocery-anchored shopping center located in the Atlanta, Georgia MSA comprising 68,658 square feet of gross leasable area and a second grocery-anchored shopping center located in the Nashville, Tennessee MSA comprising 70,203 square feet of gross leasable area.\nOn April 29, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our Common Stock of $0.255 per share, payable on July 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2018.\nMultifamily Established Communities Financial Data\nThe following chart presents same store operating results for the Company's established communities. Effective with the fourth quarter 2017, we define our population of established communities as those that have been stabilized for at least three consecutive months and that have been owned for at least 15 full months as of the end of the first quarter of each year, enabling comparisons of the current year quarterly and annual reporting periods to the prior year comparative periods. The Company excludes the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. For the periods presented, same store operating results consist of the operating results of the following multifamily established communities:\nStoneridge Farms at Hunt Club\nOverton Rise\nAvenues at Cypress\nVineyards\nAster at Lely\nAvenues at Northpointe\nMcNeil Ranch\nVenue at Lakewood Ranch\nStone Rise\nCiti Lakes\nLenox Portfolio\nSorrel\nSame store net operating income is a non-GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss), with a reconciliation following below.\nMultifamily Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income\nThree months ended:\n(in thousands)\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\n$ change\n% change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues\n$\n13,412\n$\n12,990\n$\n422\n3.2\n%\nOther property revenues\n1,458\n1,390\n68\n4.9\n%\nTotal revenues\n14,870\n14,380\n490\n3.4\n%\nOperating expenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n1,839\n1,865\n(26)\n(1.4)\n%\nPayroll\n1,148\n1,229\n(81)\n(6.6)\n%\nProperty management fees\n599\n577\n22\n3.8\n%\nReal estate taxes\n2,181\n2,382\n(201)\n(8.4)\n%\nOther\n610\n627\n(17)\n(2.7)\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n6,377\n6,680\n(303)\n(4.5)\n%\nSame store net operating income\n$\n8,493\n$\n7,700\n$\n793\n10.3\n%\nReal estate taxes for same store established communities fell 8.4% for the first quarter 2018 versus 2017 due to successful appeals for 2017 which, along with guidance from our real estate tax consultants, resulted in downward adjustments to some of our 2018 estimates.\nReconciliation of Multifamily Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI) to Net\nIncome (Loss)\nThree months ended:\n(in thousands)\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\nSame store net operating income\n$\n8,493\n$\n7,700\nAdd:\nNon-same-store property revenues\n60,936\n39,419\nLess:\nNon-same-store property operating expenses\n21,641\n14,586\nProperty net operating income\n47,788\n32,533\nAdd:\nInterest revenue on notes receivable\n10,300\n7,948\nInterest revenue on related party notes receivable\n4,265\n4,814\nLess:\nEquity stock compensation\n1,135\n873\nDepreciation and amortization\n40,616\n24,826\nInterest expense\n20,968\n15,009\nAcquisition costs\n—\n9\nManagement fees\n6,241\n4,513\nInsurance, professional fees and other\n704\n903\nGain on sale of real estate\n20,354\n30,724\nContingent asset management and general and administrative expense fees\n(1,220)\n(175)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n14,263\n$\n30,061\nCapital Markets Activities\nDuring the first quarter 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 98,195 Units from our offering of up to 1,500,000 Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock and one Warrant to purchase up to 20 shares of Common Stock (the \"$1.5 Billion Series A Unit Offering\"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $88.4 million after commissions and other fees. In addition, during the first quarter 2018, we issued approximately 527,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants issued under our Series A Preferred Stock offering, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $7.2 million.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,209 shares of Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"mShares\"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $5.1 million after dealer manager fees.\nOur outstanding shares of Common Stock totaled approximately 39.2 million shares at March 31, 2018. The market value of our Common Stock was $14.19 per share on March 31, 2018 versus $13.21 on March 31, 2017. Our total equity book value increased 40.7% to approximately $1.4 billion at March 31, 2018 from $967.3 million at March 31, 2017.\nDividends\nQuarterly Dividends on Common Stock and Class A OP Units\nOn February 1, 2018, we declared a quarterly dividend on our Common Stock of $0.25 per share for the first quarter 2018. This represents a 13.6% increase in our common stock dividend from our first quarter 2017 common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, and an annualized dividend growth rate of 14.9% since June 30, 2011, the first quarter end following our initial public offering in April 2011. The first quarter dividend was paid on April 16, 2018 to all stockholders of record on March 15, 2018. In conjunction with the Common Stock dividend, the Company's operating partnership declared a distribution on its Class A Units of $0.25 per unit for the first quarter 2018, which was paid on April 16, 2018 to all Class A Unit holders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nMonthly Dividends on Preferred Stock\nWe declared and paid monthly dividends of $5.00 per share on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, which totaled approximately $19.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and represent a 6% annual yield. We declared and paid dividends totaling approximately $270,000 on our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, or mShares, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The mShares have an escalating dividend rate from 5.75% in year one of issuance to 7.50% in year eight and thereafter.\nConference Call and Supplemental Data\nWe will hold our quarterly conference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss our first quarter 2018 results.

A replay of the call will be archived on under the Investors/Audio Archive section.\n2018 Guidance:\nNet income (loss) per share - We are actively adding properties and real estate loan investments to our real estate portfolio and the specific timing of the closing of acquisitions is difficult to predict. Acquisition activity by its nature can cause material variation in our reported depreciation and amortization expense and interest income. Since net income (loss) per share is calculated net of depreciation and amortization expense, our net income (loss) results can fluctuate, possibly significantly, depending upon the timing of the closing of acquisitions. For this reason, we are unable to reasonably forecast this measure or provide a reconciliation of our projected FFO per share to this measure.\nFFO per share - We currently project FFO to be in the range of $1.43 - $1.47 per share for the full year 2018.\nRevenue - We currently project total revenues to be in the range of $400 million - $440 million for the full year 2018.\nCommon Stock dividends - We currently expect to increase our Common Stock dividend by an aggregate of at least 10% during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nAFFO and FFO are calculated after deductions for all preferred stock dividends. Reconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 appear in the attached report, as well as on our website using the following link:\nhttp://investors.pacapts.com/download/1Q18_Earnings_and_Supplemental_Data.pdf\nForward-Looking Statements\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Estimates of future earnings, guidance, goals and performance are, by definition, and certain other statements in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Financial Data Report may constitute, \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, achievements or transactions to be materially different from the results, guidance, goals, performance, achievements or transactions expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

The weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are the same for basic and diluted for any period for which we recorded a net loss available to common stockholders, excluding any gains from sales of real estate assets.\nSee Notes to Reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders.\nNotes to Reconciliations of FFO and AFFO to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\n1)\nRental and other property revenues and property operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include activity for the two multifamily communities and one office building acquired during the quarter only from their respective dates of acquisition. In addition, the first quarter 2018 period includes a full quarter of activity for the six multifamily communities, eight grocery-anchored shopping centers, two student housing properties and one office building acquired during the second, third and fourth quarters 2017. Rental and other property revenues and expenses for the first quarter 2017 include activity for the acquisitions made during that period only from their respective dates of acquisition.\n2)\nNon-controlling interests in our Operating Partnership consisted of a total of 1,070,103 Class A Units as of March 31, 2018. Included in this total are 419,228 Class A Units which were granted as partial consideration to the seller in conjunction with the seller's contribution to us on February 29, 2016 of the Wade Green grocery-anchored shopping center. The remaining Class A units were awarded primarily to our key executive officers. The Class A Units are apportioned a percentage of our financial results as non-controlling interests. The weighted average ownership percentage of these holders of Class A Units was calculated to be 2.67% and 3.32% for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n3)\nWe incurred loan closing costs for the $11 million term note, which we used to finance the acquisition of our Anderson Central grocery-anchored shopping center, and on our $200 million acquisition revolving credit facility, or Acquisition Facility, which is used to finance acquisitions of multifamily communities and student housing communities. The costs to establish these instruments were deferred and amortized over the lives of the instruments. The amortization expense of these deferred costs is an additive adjustment in the calculation of AFFO.\n4)\nAs of January 1, 2016, we pay loan coordination fees to Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC, our Manager, related to obtaining mortgage financing for acquired properties. Loan coordination fees were introduced to reflect the administrative effort involved in arranging debt financing for acquired properties. The portion of the loan coordination fees paid up until July 1, 2017 attributable to the financing were amortized over the lives of the respective mortgage loans, and this non-cash amortization expense is an addition to FFO in the calculation of AFFO. Beginning effective July 1, 2017, the loan coordination fee was lowered from 1.6% to 0.6% of the amount of any mortgage indebtedness on newly-acquired properties or refinancing. All of the loan coordination fees paid to our Manager subsequent to July 1, 2017 are amortized over the life of the debt. At March 31, 2018, aggregate unamortized loan coordination fees were approximately $12.4 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 10.5 years.\n5)\nWe sustained weather-related operating losses due to Hurricane Harvey at our Stone Creek multifamily community during the first quarter 2018; these costs are added back to FFO in our calculation of AFFO. Included in these adjustments are the receipt from our insurance carrier during the first quarter 2018 of claims proceeds for lost rental revenues incurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 that totaled approximately $588,000, which was recognized in our statements of operations for the first quarter 2018.\n6)\nWe incur loan closing costs on our existing mortgage loans, which are secured on a property-by-property basis by each of our acquired real estate assets, and also for occasional amendments to our syndicated revolving line of credit with Key Bank National Association, or our Revolving Line of Credit. On March 23, 2018, but effective April 13, 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity on the Revolving Line of Credit was increased from $150 million to $200 million. These loan closing costs are also amortized over the lives of the respective loans and the Revolving Line of Credit, and this non-cash amortization expense is an addition to FFO in the calculation of AFFO. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership have any recourse liability in connection with any of the mortgage loans, nor do we have any cross-collateralization arrangements with respect to the assets securing the mortgage loans, other than security interests in 49% of the equity interests of the subsidiaries owning such assets, granted in connection with our Revolving Line of Credit, which provides for full recourse liability. At March 31, 2018, aggregate unamortized loan costs were approximately $19.8 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 7.9 years.\n7)\nWe receive loan origination fees in conjunction with the origination of certain real estate loan investments. These fees are then recognized as revenue over the lives of the applicable loans as adjustments of yield using the effective interest method. The total fees received after the payment of loan origination fees to our Manager are additive adjustments in the calculation of AFFO. Correspondingly, the amortized non-cash income is a deduction in the calculation of AFFO. Over the lives of certain loans, we accrue additional interest amounts that become due to us at the time of repayment of the loan or refinancing of the property, or when the property is sold. This non-cash interest income is subtracted from FFO in our calculation of AFFO.\n8)\nThis adjustment reflects the receipt during the periods presented of additional interest income (described in note 7 above) which was earned and accrued prior to those periods presented on various real estate loans.\n9)\nThis adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of costs incurred to induce tenants to lease space in our office buildings and grocery-anchored shopping centers.\n10)\nThis adjustment reflects straight-line rent adjustments and the reversal of the non-cash amortization of below-market and above-market lease intangibles, which were recognized in conjunction with our acquisitions and which are amortized over the estimated average remaining lease terms from the acquisition date for multifamily communities and over the remaining lease terms for grocery-anchored shopping center assets and office buildings. At March 31, 2018, the balance of unamortized below-market lease intangibles was approximately $39.0 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining lease period of approximately 9.4 years.\n11)\nThis adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of deferred revenue recorded by us in conjunction with Company-owned lessee-funded tenant improvements in our office buildings.\n12)\nWe deduct from FFO normally recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain our assets' revenue streams in the calculation of AFFO. This adjustment also deducts from FFO capitalized amounts for third party costs during the period to originate or renew leases in our grocery-anchored shopping centers and office buildings. No adjustment is made in the calculation of AFFO for nonrecurring capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures, Grocery-Anchored Shopping Center Portfolio, and Office Buildings Portfolio sections for definitions of these terms.\nSee Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\nPreferred

monthly payments of accrued interest and principal are based on a 25 to 35-year amortization period through the maturity date.\n(2) On date, the Company legally defeased the mortgage loan in conjunction with the sale of its Lake Cameron property, located in Raleigh, NC. In connection with the defeasance, the mortgage and other liens on the property were extinguished and all existing collateral, including various guarantees, were released. As a result of the defeasance, the Company incurred costs associated with a defeasance premium of approximately $355.\n(3) The mortgage instrument was assumed as part of the sales transaction; the 1 Month LIBOR index is capped at 5.0%, resulting in a cap on the combined rate of 6.6%.\n(4) The 1 Month LIBOR index is capped at 4.33% resulting in a cap on the combined rate of 6.5%.\n(5) The property was temporarily financed through a credit facility sponsored by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; the Company obtained permanent mortgage financing subsequent to the closing as shown.\n(6) The interest rate has a floor of 2.7%.\n(7) The interest rate has a floor of 3.25%.\nMultifamily Communities\nAs of March 31, 2018, our multifamily community portfolio consisted of the following properties:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nProperty\nLocation\nNumber of\nunits\nAverage unit\nsize (sq. ft.)\nAverage\nphysical\noccupancy\nAverage\nrent per\nunit\nEstablished Communities:\nStone Rise\nPhiladelphia, PA\n216\n1,078\n94.6\n%\n$\n1,451\nMcNeil Ranch\nAustin, TX\n192\n1,071\n95.1\n%\n$\n1,257\nAvenues at Cypress\nHouston, TX\n240\n1,170\n94.6\n%\n$\n1,423\nAvenues at Northpointe\nHouston, TX\n280\n1,167\n95.7\n%\n$\n1,340\nStoneridge Farms at the Hunt Club\nNashville, TN\n364\n1,153\n94.7\n%\n$\n1,098\nVineyards\nHouston, TX\n369\n1,122\n95.8\n%\n$\n1,145\nAster at Lely Resort\nNaples, FL\n308\n1,071\n95.8\n%\n$\n1,467\nVenue at Lakewood Ranch\nSarasota, FL\n237\n1,001\n95.6\n%\n$\n1,568\nCiti Lakes\nOrlando, FL\n346\n984\n94.5\n%\n$\n1,394\nLenox Portfolio\nNashville, TN\n474\n861\n96.1\n%\n$\n1,207\nOverton Rise\nAtlanta, GA\n294\n1,018\n94.7\n%\n$\n1,498\nSorrel\nJacksonville, FL\n290\n1,048\n93.6\n%\n$\n1,258\nTotal/Average Established Communities\n3,610\n95.1\n%\nSummit Crossing\nAtlanta, GA\n485\n1,053\n92.5\n%\n$\n1,188\nCityPark View\nCharlotte, NC\n284\n948\n—\n$\n1,072\nAvenues at Creekside\nSan Antonio, TX\n395\n974\n—\n$\n1,143\nStone Creek\nHouston, TX\n246\n852\n—\n$\n1,044\n525 Avalon Park\nOrlando, FL\n487\n1,394\n—\n$\n1,396\nRetreat at Greystone\nBirmingham, AL\n312\n1,100\n94.4\n%\n$\n1,212\nBroadstone at Citrus Village\nTampa, FL\n296\n980\n97.7\n%\n$\n1,267\nFounders Village\nWilliamsburg, VA\n247\n1,070\n94.9\n%\n$\n1,362\nCrosstown Walk\nTampa, FL\n342\n981\n95.4\n%\n$\n1,268\nClaiborne Crossing\nLouisville, KY\n242\n1,204\n—\n$\n1,308\nLuxe at Lakewood Ranch\nSarasota, FL\n280\n1,105\n—\n$\n1,516\nAdara Overland Park\nKansas City, KS\n260\n1,116\n94.1\n%\n$\n1,310\nAldridge at Town Village\nAtlanta, GA\n300\n969\n95.3\n%\n$\n1,303\nThe Reserve at Summit Crossing\nAtlanta, GA\n172\n1,002\n—\n$\n1,315\nOverlook at Crosstown Walk\nTampa, FL\n180\n986\n—\n$\n1,360\nColony at Centerpointe\nRichmond, VA\n255\n1,149\n—\n$\n1,305\nLux at Sorrel\nJacksonville, FL\n265\n1,025\n—\nn/a\nGreen Park\nAtlanta, GA\n310\n985\n—\nn/a\nValue-add project:\nVillage at Baldwin Park\nOrlando, FL\n528\n1,069\n—\n$\n1,572\n5,886\nJoint venture:\nCity Vista\nPittsburgh, PA\n272\n1,023\n94.2\n%\n$\n1,343\nTotal PAC Non-Established Communities\n6,158\nAverage stabilized physical occupancy\n94.9\n%\n(1)\nStudent housing communities: (2)\nAverage\nrent per bed\nNorth by Northwest\nTallahassee, FL\n219\n(2)\n1,250\n99.2\n%\n$\n724\nSoL\nTempe, AZ\n224\n(2)\n1,296\n91.3\n%\n$\n713\nStadium Village (3)\nAtlanta, GA\n198\n(2)\n1,466\n99.7\n%\n$\n670\nUrsa (3)\nWaco, TX\n250\n(2)\n1,634\n—\nn/a\nTotal All PAC units\n10,659\n(1) Excludes average occupancy for student housing communities.\n(2) North by Northwest has 679 beds, SoL has 639 beds, Stadium Village has 792 beds and Ursa has 840 beds.\n(3) The Company acquired and owns an approximate 99% equity interest in a joint venture which owns both Stadium Village and Ursa.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, our average established multifamily communities' physical occupancy was 95.1%. We calculate average established physical occupancy for quarterly periods as the average number of occupied units on the 20th day of each of the trailing three months from the reporting period end date and that have been owned for at least 15 full months as of the end of the first quarter of each year. We exclude the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced, properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, our average stabilized physical occupancy was 94.9%. We calculate average stabilized physical occupancy for quarterly periods as the average number of occupied units on the 20th day of each of the trailing three months from the reporting period end date. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, our average economic occupancy was 94.9%. We define average economic occupancy as market rent reduced by vacancy losses, expressed as a percentage. All of our multifamily properties are included in these calculations except for properties which are not yet stabilized (which we define as properties having first achieved 93% physical occupancy for three full months in a quarter), properties which are owned for less than the entire reporting period and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses or are adding additional phases (Stone Creek, Village at Baldwin Park, 525 Avalon Park, CityPark View and Avenues at Creekside). We also exclude properties which are currently being marketed for sale, of which there were none at March 31, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe regularly incur capital expenditures related to our owned multifamily communities and student housing properties. Capital expenditures may be nonrecurring and discretionary, as part of a strategic plan intended to increase a property's value and corresponding revenue-generating ability, or may be normally recurring and necessary to maintain the income streams and present value of a property. Certain capital expenditures may be budgeted and reserved for upon acquiring a property as initial expenditures necessary to bring a property up to our standards or to add features or amenities that we believe make the property a compelling value to prospective residents in its individual market. These budgeted nonrecurring capital expenditures in connection with an acquisition are funded from the capital source(s) for the acquisition and are not dependent upon subsequent property operating cash flows for funding. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, our capital expenditures for multifamily communities and student housing properties consisted of:\nCapital Expenditures\nRecurring\nNon-recurring\nTotal\n(in thousands, except per-unit figures)\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAppliances\n$\n99\n$\n37.50\n$\n1\n$\n0.43\n$\n100\n$\n37.93\nCarpets\n278\n105.23\n—\n—\n278\n105.23\nWood / vinyl flooring\n54\n20.55\n—\n—\n54\n20.55\nMini blinds and ceiling fans\n14\n5.32\n—\n—\n14\n5.32\nFire safety\n4\n1.43\n13\n4.85\n17\n6.28\nHVAC\n38\n14.38\n—\n—\n38\n14.38\nComputers, equipment, misc.\n24\n9.05\n47\n17.64\n71\n26.69\nElevators\n—\n—\n5\n2.01\n5\n2.01\nLeasing office and other common amenities\n1\n0.40\n93\n35.33\n94\n35.73\nMajor structural projects\n6\n2.34\n93\n35.10\n99\n37.44\nCabinets and counter top upgrades\n—\n—\n292\n110.46\n292\n110.46\nLandscaping and fencing\n—\n—\n27\n10.26\n27\n10.26\nParking lot\n—\n—\n47\n17.85\n47\n17.85\nCommon area items\n—\n—\n5\n1.77\n5\n1.77\nTotals\n$\n518\n$\n196.20\n$\n623\n$\n235.70\n$\n1,141\n$\n431.90\nGrocery-Anchored Shopping Center Portfolio\nAs of March 31, 2018, our grocery-anchored shopping center portfolio consisted of the following properties:\nProperty name\nLocation\nYear built\nGLA (1)\nPercent\nleased\nGrocery anchor\ntenant\nCastleberry-Southard\nAtlanta, GA\n2006\n80,018\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nCherokee Plaza\nAtlanta, GA\n1958\n102,864\n100.0\n%\nKroger\nLakeland Plaza\nAtlanta, GA\n1990\n301,711\n95.8\n%\nSprouts\nPowder Springs\nAtlanta, GA\n1999\n77,853\n95.1\n%\nPublix\nRockbridge Village\nAtlanta, GA\n2005\n102,432\n95.5\n%\nKroger\nRoswell Wieuca Shopping Center\nAtlanta, GA\n2007\n74,370\n100.0\n%\nThe Fresh Market\nRoyal Lakes Marketplace\nAtlanta, GA\n2008\n119,493\n84.4\n%\nKroger\nSandy Plains Exchange\nAtlanta, GA\n1997\n72,784\n93.2\n%\nPublix\nSummit Point\nAtlanta, GA\n2004\n111,970\n86.5\n%\nPublix\nThompson Bridge Commons\nAtlanta, GA\n2001\n92,587\n96.1\n%\nKroger\nWade Green Village\nAtlanta, GA\n1993\n74,978\n95.9\n%\nPublix\nWoodmont Village\nAtlanta, GA\n2002\n85,639\n96.0\n%\nKroger\nWoodstock Crossing\nAtlanta, GA\n1994\n66,122\n97.7\n%\nKroger\nEast Gate Shopping Center\nAugusta, GA\n1995\n75,716\n89.5\n%\nPublix\nFury's Ferry\nAugusta, GA\n1996\n70,458\n98.6\n%\nPublix\nParkway Centre\nColumbus, GA\n1999\n53,088\n97.4\n%\nPublix\nSpring Hill Plaza\nNashville, TN\n2005\n61,570\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nParkway Town Centre\nNashville, TN\n2005\n65,587\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nThe Market at Salem Cove\nNashville, TN\n2010\n62,356\n97.8\n%\nPublix\nThe Market at Victory Village\nNashville, TN\n2007\n71,300\n98.5\n%\nPublix\nThe Overlook at Hamilton Place\nChattanooga, TN\n1992\n213,095\n100.0\n%\nThe Fresh Market\nShoppes of Parkland\nMiami-Ft.

Second-generation capital expenditures exclude those expenditures made in our office building portfolio (i) to lease space to \"first generation\" tenants (i.e. leasing capital for existing vacancies and known move-outs at the time of acquisition), (ii) to bring recently acquired properties up to our Class A ownership standards (and which amounts were underwritten into the total investment at the time of acquisition) and (iii) for property re-developments and repositionings.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe disclose FFO, AFFO and NOI, each of which meet the definition of a \"non-GAAP financial measure\", as set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result we are required to include in this filing a statement of why the Company believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. None of FFO, AFFO and NOI should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further FFO, AFFO and NOI should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. FFO and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"FFO\")\nFFO is one of the most commonly utilized Non-GAAP measures currently in practice. In its 2002 \"White Paper on Funds From Operations,\" which was most recently revised in 2012, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, standardized the definition of how Net income/loss should be adjusted to arrive at FFO, in the interests of uniformity and comparability. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO as a meaningful supplemental gauge of our operating results, and as is most often presented by other REIT industry participants.\nThe NAREIT definition of FFO (and the one reported by the Company) is:\nNet income/loss:\nexcluding impairment charges on and gains/losses from sales of depreciable property; plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and deferred leasing costs; and after adjustments for the Company's proportionate share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nNot all companies necessarily utilize the standardized NAREIT definition of FFO, so caution should be taken in comparing the Company's reported FFO results to those of other companies. The Company's FFO results are comparable to the FFO results of other companies that follow the NAREIT definition of FFO and report these figures on that basis. FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"AFFO\")\nAFFO makes further adjustments to FFO results in order to arrive at a more refined measure of operating and financial performance. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. The Company calculates AFFO as:\nFFO, plus:\nnon-cash equity compensation to directors and executives; amortization of loan closing costs; losses on debt extinguishments or refinancing costs; weather-related property operating losses; amortization of loan coordination fees paid to the Manager; depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets; net loan fees received; accrued interest income received; deemed dividends on preferred stock redemptions; non-cash dividends on Series M Preferred Stock; and amortization of lease inducements;\nLess:\nnon-cash loan interest income; cash paid for loan closing costs; amortization of acquired real estate intangible liabilities; amortization of straight line rent adjustments and deferred revenues; and normally-recurring capital expenditures and capitalized retail direct leasing costs.\nAFFO figures reported by us may not be comparable to those AFFO figures reported by other companies. We utilize AFFO as another measure of the operating performance of our portfolio of real estate assets. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and may be useful in comparing our operating performance with other real estate companies. AFFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders. FFO and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nMultifamily Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI)\nWe use same store net operating income as an operational metric for our established communities, enabling comparisons of those properties' operating results between the current reporting period and the prior year comparative period. We define our population of established communities as those that are stabilized and that have been owned for at least 15 full months, as of the end of the first quarter of each year, and exclude the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced, and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. We define net operating income as rental and other property revenues, less total property and maintenance expenses, property management fees, real estate taxes, general and administrative expenses, and property insurance. We believe that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs because it provides measures of core operations, rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization, financing costs, acquisition costs, and other corporate expenses. Net operating income is a widely utilized measure of comparative operating performance in the REIT industry, but is not a substitute for the most comparable GAAP-compliant measure, net income/loss.\nAbout Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.\nPreferred Apartment Communities, Inc.
