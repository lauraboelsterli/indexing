    "text": "DENVER, Resolute Energy Corporation (“Resolute” or the “Company”) (NYSE:REN) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter\nHighlights:\nFirst quarter Permian Basin production increased 70 percent year-over-year to 23,498 Boe per day from 13,798 Boe per day in first quarter 2017. First quarter 2018 Company production increased 19 percent year-over-year to 23,498 barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”) per day, despite the loss of approximately 5,900 Boe per day from the sale of the Company’s Aneth Field properties in late 2017. First quarter production exceeded the high end of the Company’s quarterly guidance. First quarter net loss was $12.9 million; Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure as reconciled below) was $3.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure as reconciled below) was $41.1 million, up 42 percent from $28.9 million in first quarter 2017. In Appaloosa, finished drilling on first triple pad, nine-well pack in the Ranger unit; first two pads were completed in late April; the third pad is to be completed by mid-May. In Mustang, completed drilling operations on five wells of the first nine-well pack in the Sandlot unit; expect to have finished drilling operations by late May. Successfully completed third Wolfcamp C test, the Thunder Canyon C107SL; established a peak 24-hour rate of 3,000 Boe per day, including 804 barrels of oil per day. Two additional Lower Wolfcamp wells to come on line in the second quarter, bringing the total to six wells, which could meaningfully expand inventory.\nRick Betz, Resolute’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “The first quarter of 2018 marked our shift to full development mode within our top-tier assets in the Delaware Basin. We continue to make excellent progress in the field with our operational teams delivering outstanding results as they implement our new development strategy. The teams have effectively managed a significant acceleration in operational pace with the addition of a third drilling rig, a spudder rig and a second frac spread while keeping the program substantially on schedule and within budget. While we have experienced a short pause in our historically strong growth profile during this transition, our producing assets have continued to deliver consistently strong production complemented by exciting results from some of our newer Lower Wolfcamp wells. Everyone at Resolute continues to be fully committed to the execution of the plan with the goal of further improving well performance, reducing costs and increasing production ultimately delivering strong returns and long-term value creation for all stakeholders.”\nThe Company will post an updated investor relations presentation on www.resoluteenergy.com , which supplements the information provided in this press release.\nOperational Highlights\nFirst quarter 2018 Company production increased 19 percent year-over-year to 23,498 Boe per day from 19,702 Boe per day in first quarter 2017, despite the loss of approximately 5,900 Boe per day from the Company’s Aneth Field properties sold in late 2017. First quarter production exceeded the high end of the Company’s first quarter production guidance range of 22,000 to 23,000 Boe per day by 498 Boe per day. Permian Basin production increased 70 percent year-over-year from 13,798 Boe per day in first quarter 2017. First quarter production was bolstered by better than anticipated performance across Resolute’s asset base complemented by strong performance from the recent Lower Wolfcamp completions.\nFor the first quarter, Company production consisted of 73 percent liquids (including 46 percent oil) and 27 percent residue gas. Aggregate oil production for the quarter exceeded plan, however stronger than anticipated results from the Uinta and Thunder Canyon Wolfcamp C wells in Mustang increased the gas composition for the quarter. While these wells produced peak oil rates of 860 and 804 barrels per day respectively they also had very strong gas and associated liquids production. The Company’s commodity mix varies quarter to quarter and is largely dependent on the specific wells, producing intervals and geographic area from which production is generated. For the first quarter, based on recent completions, production was weighted toward Mustang and Bronco (62%) with a smaller fraction from Appaloosa (38%).\nBased on our current completion pace, the Company anticipates production of 24 MBoe to 26 MBoe per day for the second quarter 2018, driven primarily by the first Ranger nine-well pack coming on production in late May to early June. The Company anticipates that second quarter production will consist of approximately 46 to 48 percent oil and the Company expects that exit rate production for the quarter will be significantly oilier as we bring on the Ranger pads. The Company continues to expect that full year production will average approximately 52 percent oil, consistent with guidance. The Company expects to see a significant ramp in production during the third and fourth quarters of the year.\nDuring the quarter, the Company successfully completed drilling its first triple pad nine-well pack in the Ranger unit in Appaloosa. This nine-well pack consists of three Upper Wolfcamp A wells, three Lower Wolfcamp A wells, two Upper Wolfcamp B wells and one Wolfcamp C well. The wells have an average completed lateral length of 9,642 feet. Pad 1 and Pad 2 (six wells of the nine-well pack) were completed simultaneously in late April utilizing two completion crews. Pad 1 is now flowing back while Pad 2 is shut-in awaiting completion of Pad 3. Pad 3 is being completed currently and we expect it to be flowing back along with Pad 2 by mid-May. We are very pleased with the performance of both our completions team and primary service providers involved in this activity, the Company’s first multi-well frac job.\nIn Mustang, Resolute recently had three drilling rigs working side by side in the Sandlot unit. Drilling operations are finished on the first five wells with the sixth well expected to reach TD shortly. Drilling operations continue on Pad 3 and the Company expects to finish drilling operations on this Pad in the next two weeks. Completion operations are expected to begin by late May. Resolute anticipates first production from these wells in July. Upon completion of drilling operations the rigs will be mobilized to the South Mitre unit to start the next nine pack. In addition, the Company has a spudder rig working ahead of the three larger drilling rigs presetting intermediate casing in the South Mitre unit to improve drilling efficiencies.\nResolute continues to work constructively with its midstream services provider, Caprock Midstream, to ensure sufficient midstream infrastructure capacity to handle the anticipated production growth from its 2018 development program. In Mustang and Appaloosa, Resolute and Caprock have jointly constructed a robust system of field infrastructure and pipelines that is directly interconnected with our oil and gas purchasers to ensure that our oil and gas will continue to move reliably on pipe as our production increases.\nWith the completion of Caprock’s Stampede Connector, which connects Resolute’s field to Caprock’s Pecos Bend processing plant, the Company now has an alternate method to transport and process gas production should its primary gas processor, Energy Transfer, experience any service curtailments. The Pecos Bend plant has interconnects with multiple residue gas lines to ensure the movement of residue gas from the plant. Oil production from the field continues to move reliably through the Caprock gathering system and into Plains Pipeline LP’s oil transportation system. Both Plains and Caprock are constructing additional oil storage capacity on their systems to further enhance operational reliability. As a customer of Plains Marketing, Resolute has experienced uninterrupted take away of all our oil production in the Delaware Basin and expects this to continue in the future. Caprock is in various stages of permitting, drilling and completing additional water disposal wells to support Resolute’s activity. Resolute believes that, together with commercial partners, the Company is well positioned to handle the rapid growth in production anticipated from its ongoing development program.\nThe Company continues its evaluation of the Lower Wolfcamp intervals (the lower Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp C) in Appaloosa and Mustang. Since Resolute’s last earnings press release, the Company has completed one additional Wolfcamp C well in Mustang, the Thunder Canyon C107SL. This well has established a peak 24-hour rate of 3,000 Boe per day, including 804 barrels of oil per day, or 378 Boe per day per 1,000 feet of completed lateral. During the second quarter, Resolute will add two additional valuable data points in the Lower Wolfcamp. The Ranger C205SL well was recently completed in the Wolfcamp C as part of Pad 1 in the Ranger nine pack and the North Elephant B301SL, a lower B well, is being completed currently and is expected to be online in May. The Company is encouraged with the early results from its Lower Wolfcamp program and plans to evaluate the performance of all of the Lower Wolfcamp wells through the remainder of the year and consider further optimization of future pad design to potentially include lower zones.\nResults of these wells are in the table below.\nPeak rates (Boe per day) Well name Area 1 Zone 2 Length (feet) 24 hour 30 day 60 day 90 day South Elephant B307SL A LWCB 9,567 2,254 2,099 1,968 1,840 South Elephant C207SL A WCC 9,403 2,294 1,930 1,695 1,536 Uinta C101H M WCC 7,819 3,095 2,657 2,381 - Thunder Canyon C107SL M WCC 7,942 3,000 - - - Ranger C205SL A WCC 9,721 Flowing back North Elephant B301SL A LWCB - Completing Area abbreviation legend: M – Mustang and A – Appaloosa Zone abbreviation legend: LWCB – Lower Wolfcamp B and WCC – Wolfcamp C\nThe following tables provide an update of certain operating activities since January 1, 2018:\nDrilling activity:\nWell name / Pad Area Zone 1 Lateral length\n(heel - toe) 2 Status Rig days over hole 2 North Elephant B301SL A LWCB 9,099 WOC 59 Ranger Pad 2 A UA/LA/UB 9,807 Completed 25 Ranger Pad 3 A UA/LA/UB 9,755 Completing 26 Sandlot Pad 1 M UA/LA/UB 6,417 WOC 22 Sandlot Pad 2 M UA/LA/UB 6,300 1 well drilling - Sandlot Pad 3 M UA/LA/UB 6,300 Drilling - Zone abbreviation legend: UA – Upper Wolfcamp A; LA – Lower Wolfcamp A; UB – Upper Wolfcamp B Averages are used for all lateral length and rig days over hole.

For first quarter 2018, oil constituted 80 percent of total revenue, NGL 12 percent and gas 8 percent.\nRealized oil pricing for first quarter 2018 was $61.06 per Bbl, or 97 percent of NYMEX, an increase of 28 percent from first quarter of 2017 and 19 percent from fourth quarter of 2017. Realized gas pricing for first quarter 2018 was $1.85 per MMBtu, a decrease of 29 percent from first quarter of 2017 and ten percent from fourth quarter of 2017, primarily driven by wider gas basis in the Permian Basin. Realized NGL pricing was $15.50 per Boe for first quarter 2018, an increase of 42 percent from first quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 31 percent from fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 LOE was $5.52 per Boe, down 47 percent from first quarter 2017. Continued improvement in LOE on a unit basis reflects our transition to a pure play Delaware Basin company with low cost, highly productive wells. Based on the high variable expense component of the Company’s operating expense structure we anticipate that full year LOE per Boe will be consistent with first quarter.\nThe tables below summarize general and administrative expense as well as accruals of cash-settled incentive awards for first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Stock-based Aneth transaction costs $ 6,014 $ — Stockholder activism costs 3,301 — Recurring stock-based compensation 2,835 2,819 Other recurring costs 8,917 7,597 Total general and administrative expense $ 21,067 $ 10,416\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Accrual of Aneth transaction cash-settled incentive awards $ 7,260 $ — Recurring cash-settled incentive awards 4,081 5,426 Total cash-settled incentive awards $ 11,341 $ 5,426 GAAP-based general and administrative expense as shown on the Company’s statement of operations increased significantly in first quarter 2018 to $21.1 million from $10.4 million in first quarter 2017. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expense for first quarter 2018 was $8.9 million. $2.9 million of this expense is consistent with the expense accrued in first quarter 2017, while $6.0 million is a residual effect of the Aneth Field sale and the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation to the Aneth employee base. Also included in general and administrative expense was $3.3 million associated with stockholder activism. The Aneth employee accrual combined with the stockholder activism related expenses accounted for 87 percent of the increase in general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company also saw a significant increase in the accrual for cash-settled incentive awards, which is reported below the general and administrative expense line. This line item increased from $5.4 million in first quarter 2017 to $11.3 million in first quarter 2018. The accrual associated with the acceleration of Aneth employee vesting accounted for $7.3 million of this non-cash expense while the portion associated with the ongoing business declined by $1.3 million to $4.1 million. It is important to note that neither the increase in accrued Aneth related stock-based compensation expense nor the increase in accruals for Aneth related cash-settled incentive awards had any impact on the actual dollar amount of future compensation payments by the Company. The only impact was to accelerate the vesting and potential payment of a portion of these awards. The Aneth related charges combined with the stockholder activism expenses, totaling $16.6 million, were directly responsible for the net loss of $12.9 million reported for first quarter 2018. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure as reconciled below) for first quarter 2018, which removes these expenses and other non-cash mark-to-market gains (losses), was $3.3 million.\nCash-based general and administrative expense (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below), which management believes is a more accurate reflection of the costs of managing the business, was $8.9 million for first quarter 2018 compared to $7.5 million for first quarter 2017. The increase is directly attributable to a decrease of $1.6 million in overhead reimbursements attributable to the Aneth Field sale. The first quarter 2018 amount also included an accrual of approximately $0.6 million related to 2018 401(k) matching payments. There was no 401(k) accrual in first quarter 2017. On a unit basis, cash based general and administrative expense declined from $4.28 per Boe in first quarter 2017 to $4.22 per Boe in first quarter 2018.\nCapital investment for the first quarter was $69.5 million, excluding acquisition, divestitures, and capitalized interest, of which approximately 60 percent was funded through internally generated cash flow. First quarter capital investment included $51.8 million of drilling and completion expenditures and $10.4 million spent on facilities and infrastructure. Preliminary cost estimates for our first nine-well pack in Ranger indicate that the operations were completed substantially in line with our original budget. As anticipated, with completions weighted toward the second and third quarters, capital expenditures were lower in the first quarter and will accelerate as the Company moves through the year. Resolute continues to expect that, as previously announced, total capital expenditures for 2018 will be between $365 million and $395 million.\nResolute has 8,500 Bbl per day of oil production hedged through the year using a variety of instruments at weighted average prices ranging from $50.95 to $52.24. Based on mid-point of guidance, the Company has hedged approximately 70 percent of our anticipated second quarter oil production. In addition, Resolute has put in place Midland-Cushing oil basis swaps for the remainder of 2018 covering between 4,500 and 6,000 Bbl per day of production at between $4.75 and $6.08 per Bbl. For the second quarter of 2018 approximately 17 percent of oil basis exposure is hedged at an average of $5.61. The Company has hedged 20 MMBtu of gas per day from April through October at $2.77 per MMBtu and has swapped 18 MMBtu of gas basis per day through year end at $0.69 per MMBtu.\nPro forma for Resolute’s recent $75 million notes offering, at March 31, 2018, cash on hand would have been approximately $34 million with no amounts outstanding under the existing revolving credit facility. On April 18, 2018, the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was reaffirmed at $210 million. The Company expects to fully fund its 2018 capital program through a combination of cash flow from operations and credit facility borrowings.\nFirst Quarter Comparative Results\nResolute recorded a net loss available to common stockholders of $14.1 million, or $0.64 per share, on revenue of $74.7 million during the three months Included in the net loss were $9.4 million of commodity derivative losses. This compares to a net income available to common stockholders of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, on revenue of $64.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Included in net income for 2017 were $10.8 million of commodity derivative gains. Resolute recorded Adjusted net income, of $3.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for first quarter 2018. This compares to an Adjusted net loss for the comparable prior period of $9.6 million, or $0.43 per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Compared to\nFirst Quarter 2017 Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 ($ thousands, except per-Boe amounts) Production (MBoe): Permian 2,115 1,242 Aneth - 531 Total production 2,115 1,773 Daily rate (Boe) 23,498 19,702 Revenue per Boe (excluding commodity derivative settlements) $ 35.33 $ 36.43 Revenue per Boe (including commodity derivative settlements) $ 31.89 $ 36.29 Revenue $ 74,718 $ 64,592 Commodity derivative settlements (7,277 ) (250 ) Adjusted revenue 67,441 64,342 Operating expenses: Lease operating expense $ 11,665 $ 18,356 Production and ad valorem taxes 5,540 5,969 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 23,537 16,035 General and administrative expense 21,067 10,415 Cash-settled incentive awards 11,341 5,427 Net income (loss) available to common stockholders $ (14,126 ) $ 76 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 3,264 $ (9,617 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 41,075 $ 28,918 Production: Production for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased nineteen percent to 2,115 MBoe, or 23,498 Boe per day, as compared to 1,773 MBoe, or 19,702 Boe per day, during the first quarter of 2017. Pro forma for the 2017 Aneth Field sale, 2018 production increased 70 percent. The increases from the comparable prior year period were attributable to positive results from Resolute’s Permian Basin drilling and completion program.\nRevenue: During the first quarter 2018, Resolute realized a sixteen percent increase in revenue as compared to the prior year quarter due principally to the nineteen percent increase in production combined with stronger realized oil and NGL pricing. Offsetting these were weaker realized residue gas pricing combined with higher percentage of production represented by gas and NGL. Revenue for the quarter was $74.7 million as compared to $64.6 million in the prior year period. Resolute realized a five percent increase in Adjusted revenue (a non-GAAP measure) as compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted revenue (revenue including commodity derivative settlements) for the quarter was $67.4 million, including the effect of commodity derivative settlement losses of $7.3 million. Adjusted revenue for the comparable prior year period was $64.3 million, including the effect of commodity derivative settlement losses of $0.3 million.\nOperating Expenses : For the first quarter 2018, LOE decreased by $6.7 million, or 36 percent, to $11.7 million, or $5.52 per Boe, as compared to first quarter 2017 LOE of $18.4 million, or $10.35 per Boe. The 47 percent decrease in unit operating expense is due to the disposition of Aneth Field in 2017, which had significantly higher operating costs as compared to Resolute’s Delaware Basin properties, as well as the increase in production from mid-length and long lateral horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin. Aggregate LOE also decreased due principally to the disposition of Aneth Field.\nProduction taxes decreased to $5.5 million (seven percent of revenue) from $6.0 million in 2017 (nine percent of revenue). On a Boe basis, production taxes decreased to $2.62 per Boe in 2018 from $3.37 per Boe in 2017. The lower production and ad valorem taxes as a percentage of revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily the result of the Aneth Field sale. All revenue in 2018 was recognized in the state of Texas, which has a lower tax rate than the Aneth Field properties in Utah, which were included in 2017 results.\nFor the first quarter 2018, depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense increased 59 percent to $23.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017 DD&A expense of $16.0 million. On a Boe basis, DD&A expense increased to $11.13 per Boe in 2018 from $9.04 per Boe in 2017 due primarily to negative revisions to proved undeveloped reserves and lower reserve estimates at year end 2017 resulting from observed interference and well degradation events in the 2017 drilling program. Positive results from 2018 development program may lead to lower DD&A expense in the future.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense : Resolute’s general and administrative expense increased more than 100 percent to $21.1 million during the first quarter 2018, as compared to $10.4 million during the same period in 2017. The $10.7 million increase resulted primarily from a one-time increase of $6.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to the modification and accelerated vesting of long-term incentive awards to employees terminated as a result of the Aneth Field sale. The vesting terms of the outstanding long-term awards for affected employees were accelerated and recognized accordingly during the first quarter 2018. The Company also incurred approximately $3.3 million in stockholder activism costs during the 2018 quarter. Additionally, certain overhead reimbursements, which reduce general and administrative expense, decreased period over period, also as a result of the Aneth Field sale. Cash-based general and administrative expense, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled below, was $8.9 million, or $4.22 per Boe, in 2018 compared to $7.6 million, or $4.28 per Boe, in 2017.\nCash-settled Incentive Awards: Cash-settled incentive award expense increased by $5.9 million to $11.3 million during the first quarter 2018 as compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Included in 2018 expense was $5.9 million that was the result of the modification of long-term incentive awards as a result of the Aneth Field sale. The vesting of these awards was accelerated for the respective employees and the expense was recognized during 2018.\nCapital Expenditures: During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Resolute incurred oil and gas related capital expenditures of approximately $69.5 million. First quarter capital investment included $51.8 million of drilling and completion expenditures and $10.4 million spent on facilities and infrastructure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources: Outstanding indebtedness of $565 million at March 31, 2018, consisted of $40 million in revolving credit facility debt and $525 million of senior notes, compared to total indebtedness of $555 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $10 million. In April 2018, the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was reaffirmed at $210.0 million. Pro forma for Resolute’s recent $75 million notes offering, at March 31, 2018, cash on hand would have been approximately $34 million with no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The Company expects to fully fund its 2018 capital program through a combination of cash flow from operations and credit facility borrowings.\nRESOLUTE ENERGY CORPORATION\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)\n($ in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue: Oil $ 59,651 $ 57,659 Gas 6,360 4,352 Natural gas liquids 8,707 2,581 Total revenue 74,718 64,592 Operating expenses: Lease operating 11,665 18,356 Production and ad valorem taxes 5,540 5,969 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 23,537 16,035 General and administrative 21,067 10,415 Cash-settled incentive awards 11,341 5,427 Total operating expenses 73,150 56,202 Income from operations 1,568 8,390 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (7,568 ) (17,697 ) Commodity derivative instruments gain (loss) (9,402 ) 10,840 Contingent payment derivative instrument gain 2,579 — Other expense (34 ) (60 ) Total other expense (14,425 ) (6,917 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (12,857 ) 1,473 Income tax benefit (expense) — — Net income (loss) (12,857 ) 1,473 Preferred stock dividends (1,269 ) (1,397 ) Net income (loss) available to common stockholders $ (14,126 ) $ 76 Net loss per common share: Basic and diluted $ (0.64 ) $ 0.01 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 22,038 21,738 Diluted 22,038 22,791 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn this press release, the term “Adjusted net income (loss)” is used. Adjusted net income (loss) is a non- GAAP financial measure and is equivalent to net income (loss) excluding non-cash items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods, which are non-cash mark-to-market gains (losses) on commodity and contingent payment derivative instruments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the acceleration and vesting of long-term incentive awards to employees terminated as a result of the Aneth Field sale and stockholder activism. Resolute’s management uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future trends and operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operating activities as determined under GAAP and may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures of other companies. The table below reconciles Resolute’s net income (loss) available to common stockholders to Adjusted net income (loss).\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 ($ in thousands) Net income (loss) $ (12,857 ) $ 1,473 Adjustments: Mark-to-market (gain) loss 2,125 (11,090 ) Contingent consideration gain (2,579 ) — Stock-based Aneth transaction costs 6,014 — Accrual of Aneth transaction cash-settled incentive awards 7,260 — Stockholder activism 3,301 — Adjusted net income (loss) $ 3,264 $ (9,617 ) Adjusted net income (loss) per common share: Basic $ 0.15 $ (0.43 ) Diluted 0.14 (0.43 ) In this press release, the term “Adjusted EBITDA” is used. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is equivalent to net income adjusted to include interest expense, net, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses, one-time costs of the Aneth Field sale, costs related to stockholder activism, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, nonrecurring cash-settled incentive award payments, change in fair value of derivative instruments, gains and losses on the sale of assets and ceiling write-down of oil and gas properties. Resolute’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important financial measurement tool that facilitates comparison of our operating performance and provides information about the Company’s ability to service or incur indebtedness and pay for its capital expenditures.

We define cash-based general and administrative expense is a non-GAAP measure as consolidated general and administrative expense adjusted to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and one-time, non-recurring, transaction related expenses (transaction costs or fees). An example of such fees and expenses are the fees and expenses that were incurred in conjunction with stockholder activism. Resolute’s management believes cash-based general and administrative expense is an important metric that enables management to evaluate the Company’s activities and operations consistently between periods and through the normal course of our activities and operations.

Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements in this press release. Resolute undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. You are encouraged to review “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” and “Item 1A - Risk Factors” and all other disclosures appearing in the Company’s Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2017, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for further information on risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Production rates, including “early time” rates, 24-hour peak IP rates, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 day peak IP rates, for both our wells and for those wells that are located near to our properties are limited data points in each well’s productive history and represent three stream gross production. These rates are sometimes actual rates and sometimes extrapolated or normalized rates. As such, the rates for a particular well may change as additional data becomes available. Peak production rates are not necessarily indicative or predictive of future production rates, EUR or economic rates of return from such wells and should not be relied upon for such purpose. Equally, the way we calculate and report peak IP rates and the methodologies employed by others may not be consistent, and thus the values reported may not be directly and meaningfully comparable. Lateral lengths described are indicative only. Actual completed lateral lengths depend on various considerations such as leaseline offsets. Standard length laterals, sometimes referred to as 5,000 foot laterals, are laterals with completed length generally between 4,000 feet and 5,500 feet. Mid-length laterals, sometimes referred to as 7,500 foot laterals, are laterals with completed length generally between 6,000 feet and 8,000 feet. Long laterals, sometimes referred to as 10,000 foot laterals, are laterals with completed length generally longer than 8,000 feet. This press release may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. When applicable, a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented.\nAbout Resolute Energy Corporation\nResolute is an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and gas properties in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin of west Texas.
