    "text": "May 9, 2018 / 5:48 AM / Updated 41 minutes ago Huddersfield get Ince boosts ahead of crucial Chelsea clash Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Huddersfield Town winger Tom Ince has returned to action from a hamstring injury, manager David Wagner has said, in a timely boost ahead of Wednesday’s crucial Premier League match at Chelsea. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Watford - John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - April 14, 2018 Huddersfield Town's Tom Ince celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Scott Heppell\nInce sustained the injury during Huddersfield’s 1-0 win over Watford in April and was sidelined for the club’s last two league matches, including the 1-1 draw at champions Manchester City last Sunday.\nHuddersfield, who are 17th in the table, must earn at least a draw at Chelsea to secure their Premier League status for next season but a defeat at Stamford Bridge would drag the Terriers into the relegation fight ahead of their final league game.\n“Tom Ince will be back, he is in training and will be part of the squad,” Wagner told reporters. “Chris Loewe and Terence Kongolo got knocks... but I think that they will be both be available.\n“Other than that, everyone else that was available at Man City will be fine.”\nHuddersfield, who are level on points with Southampton and three points ahead of 18th-placed Swansea City, have a worse goal difference than their relegation rivals.
