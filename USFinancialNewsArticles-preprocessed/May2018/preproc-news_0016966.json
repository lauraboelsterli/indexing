    "text": "JEDDAH, May 6 (Reuters) - Foreign investors resumed net buying of Saudi Arabian equities last week by a small margin, after turning net sellers in the previous week, exchange data showed on Sunday.\nIn the week through last Thursday, foreigners purchased about $21 million of stocks on a net basis. They bought $345 million and sold $325 million.\nQualified foreign institutions which invest directly were net buyers by a ratio of more than two to one, while direct investors using swaps were net sellers.\nForeign portfolio funds have been flooding into Saudi Arabia before Riyadhâ€™s expected inclusion in global emerging market indexes next year. But in the week through April 26, foreigners were net sellers for the first time this year, to the tune of $48 million. (Reporting by Andrew Torchia Editing by Keith Weir)\n ",
