(NASDAQ: TGLS) (“Tecnoglass” or the “Company”) , a leading manufacturer of architectural glass, windows, and associated aluminum products for the global commercial and residential construction industries, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJosé Manuel Daes, Chief Executive Officer of Tecnoglass, commented, \"We delivered a strong start to the year with revenues in the U.S. and Colombia both increasing in excess of 30%. We experienced a strong pace of activity throughout the quarter as evidenced by a record backlog level of $501 million, building upon positive momentum from the end of 2017. In Colombia in particular, we continue to experience an improving macroeconomic environment which should allow us to further capitalize on significant pent-up demand in that market. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin performed in line with our expectations, putting us on path for strong year-over-year growth in 2018 that supports our reaffirmed full year outlook.”\nJosé Manuel Daes continued, “We were extremely pleased to complete the funding of the GM&P transaction in May 2018. GM&P has contributed considerably to our growth over the past year while driving attractive returns on our investment. We look forward to building on GM&P’s relationships in several U.S. regions where we believe we are well positioned to expand our market opportunity. The funding was structured in a way that provides us with ample flexibility to accomplish our expected growth while also making this a highly accretive transaction.”\nChristian Daes, Chief Operating Officer of Tecnoglass, added, “We are encouraged by the healthy levels of quoting and bidding activity in the U.S. and Latin America. In the U.S., our largest market, the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) forecasts business conditions to remain strong, especially for commercial and residential activity in the South and West, which is positive for our selling efforts and consistent with our first quarter backlog composition. In addition to driving growth through innovative new products and geographic diversification, we remain focused on continuous improvement within our vertically-integrated operations, which we believe positions us for continued success. While we have not seen any material impact to our business from rising aluminum spot prices in connection with pending U.S. trade regulations, we expect Colombia to be fully exempted from proposed U.S. tariffs on aluminum imports based on the ‘ de minimis’ clause, with Colombia only accounting for about 0.1% of U.S. aluminum imports while also running an overall trade deficit with the U.S. Given our raw material efficiency, we believe we are well positioned to improve our profitability moving forward”.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 29% to $84.9 million compared to $65.8 million in the prior year quarter. U.S. revenues grew 31.2% to $60.7 million compared to $46.3 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to stronger organic invoicing and the acquisition of GM&P. Colombia´s revenue, a majority of which is represented by long-term contracts priced in Colombian Pesos but indexed to the U.S. Dollar, increased 32.8% to $21.8 million compared to $16.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in Colombia was primarily due to stronger project activity following a resurgence in quoting and bidding activity beginning in the second half of 2017. A favorable foreign currency impact for the quarter resulted in a marginal benefit to total revenues compared to the prior year quarter.\nGross profit increased 18.9% to $26.5 million, representing a 31.2% gross margin, compared to $22.3 million, representing a 33.8% gross margin, in the prior year quarter. The primary differences in gross margin were related to having a full quarter (versus one month) of a higher mix of revenues from GM&P’s engineering and installation project activity, which are two lines of business that carry lower industry margins, an unfavorable FX impact due to significant appreciation of the Colombian Peso during the quarter, and incremental depreciation. Operating expenses were $16.8 million compared to $15.4 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to acquisition related expenses, incremental amortization expense related to the GM&P acquisition, and to a lesser extent higher transportation and commission expenses in relation to higher sales during the quarter. As a percent of total revenues, operating expenses were 19.7% compared to 23.4% in the prior year quarter, mainly attributable to higher sales and our continued focus on cost controls. Excluding one-time items, operating expenses would have been 18.1% as a percent of total revenues compared to 21.8% in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 41.3% to $9.7 million compared to $6.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nNet income increased to $10.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income 1 improved to $5.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $2.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter, attributable to higher operating income. Adjusted net income 1 , as reconciled in the table below, excludes the impact of non-cash foreign exchange gains or losses, other non-core items and the tax impact of adjustments at statutory rates, to better reflect core financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 , as reconciled in the table below, increased 30.1% to $17.9 million, compared to $13.8 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to sales growth, higher gross profit and lower operating expenses as a percent of total revenues, as discussed above. The increase was in line with expectations despite an estimated $475,000 unfavorable FX effect due to a strong Peso appreciation during the quarter.\nDividend\nThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share for the first quarter 2018, which was paid on April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018, in the form of cash or ordinary shares, at the option of shareholders. Approximately 17% of dividends were paid in cash.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nBased on the solid start to 2018, the Company continues to anticipate growth in commercial construction markets and additional market share gains in the U.S. and Latin American markets for the full year. The Company reiterates its view for full year revenues to grow to a range of $345 to $365 million, with higher year-over-year growth in the first half 2018 based on anticipated timing of invoicing in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company reaffirms Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 to be in the range of $71 million to $81 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. eastern time (9:00 a.m. Bogota, Colombia time) to review the Company’s results.

However, these non‑GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % Change Total Revenues with Foreign Currency Held Neutral 84,418 65,817 28.3 % Impact of changes in foreign currency 475 - 0.7 % Total Revenues, As Reported 84,893 65,817 29.0 %\nCurrency impacts on total revenues for the current quarter have been derived by translating current quarter revenues at the prevailing average foreign currency rates during the prior year quarter, as applicable.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net (loss) income to net (loss) income\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income, in addition to operating profit, net (loss) income and other GAAP measures, is useful to investors to evaluate the Company’s results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company’s core operating performance. Investors should recognize that Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net (loss) income might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in the tables attached to this press release, to the extent available without unreasonable effort. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net (loss) income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC Regulation G follows, with amounts in thousands:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income (loss) 10,432 1,031 Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interest 72 (12 ) Net Income (loss) atributable to parent 10,504 1,019 Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs 5,050 5,082 Income tax (benefit) provision 5,288 1,042 Depreciation & amortization 5,665 4,905 Foreign currency transactions losses (gains) (9,973 ) (2,425 ) Non Recurring expenses (extinguishment of debt, bond issuance costs, provision for bad debt, acquisition related costs and other) 1,342 4,105 Director Stock compensation and provision for obsolete inventory 71 71 Gain on change in fair value of earnout shares liabilities - - Gain on change in fair value of warrant liability - - Adjusted EBITDA 17,947 13,799\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income (loss) 10,432 1,031 Less: net income attributable to non-controlling interest 72 (12 ) Net Income (loss) atributable to parent 10,504 1,019 Foreign currency transactions losses (gains) (9,973 ) (2,425 ) Gain on change in fair value of earnout shares liabilities - - Gain on change in fair value of warrant liability - - Amortization of deferred financing costs 346 - Non Recurring expenses (extinguishment of debt, bond issuance costs, provision for bad debt, acquisition related costs and other) 1,342 4,105 Tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate 3,065 (672 ) Adjusted net (loss) income 5,284 2,027 Basic income (loss) per share 0.30 0.03 Diluted income (loss) per share 0.28 0.03 Diluted Adjusted net (loss) income per share 0.14 0.06 Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding in thousands 37,041 35,753 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding in thousands 35,340 35,293 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in thousands 37,041 35,753\nSource:Tecnoglass Inc.",
