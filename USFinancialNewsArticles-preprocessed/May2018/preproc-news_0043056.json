    "text": "NEW YORK, Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) (“Prospect”, “our”, or “we”), in connection with the previously announced public offering, issued $103.5 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.95% Convertible Notes Due 2022 (including $13.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.95% Convertible Notes due 2022 pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriter of its over-allotment option) (the “Notes”).\nThe Notes are a further issuance of the 4.95% Convertible Notes due 2022 that Prospect issued on April 11, 2017 in the aggregate principal amount of $225,000,000 (the “existing 4.95% Convertible Notes”). The Notes will be treated as a single series with the existing 4.95% Convertible Notes under the indenture and will have the same terms as the existing 4.95% Convertible Notes. The Notes will have the same CUSIP number and will be fully fungible and rank equally in right of payment with the existing 4.95% Convertible Notes. The conversion price of the Notes is $9.98. After the issuance of the Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Prospect’s 4.95% Convertible Notes due 2022 is now $328.5 million.\nThe Notes will mature on July 15, 2022, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Notes will accrue from January 15, 2018 and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2018. The Notes will be general unsecured obligations of Prospect, will rank equally in right of payment with Prospect’s existing and future senior unsecured debt, and will rank senior in right of payment to any potential subordinated debt, should any be issued in the future.\nProspect expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our credit facility. Prospect intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the offering to invest in high quality short term debt investments, and/or make long term investments in accordance with its investment objective. The Notes have no restrictions related to the type and security of assets in which Prospect might invest.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as the sole underwriter for the offering.\nThe offering of these securities may be made only by means of a prospectus and a related prospectus supplement, a copy of which may be obtained by contacting: Goldman Sachs & Co.
