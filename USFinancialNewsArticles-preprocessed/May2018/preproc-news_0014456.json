    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Principal Financial Group ® (Nasdaq: PFG) today announced that its board of directors has approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2018, approximately $96 million remained under the company’s May 17, 2017 $250 million authorization.\nThe repurchases will be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the board of directors. Principal Financial Group, Inc. had approximately 286.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of April 25, 2018, per the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“This authorization supports our continued balanced approach to capital deployment to create long-term value for our shareholders - through common stock dividends, share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president and CEO of Principal ® . “As we previously announced on our 2018 outlook call, we anticipate deploying $900 million to $1.3 billion of capital in 2018. This action reflects our continued confidence in the underlying strength of our diversified and integrated business model.”\nForward looking and cautionary statements\nCertain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to non-GAAP operating earnings, net income attributable to PFG, net cash flows, realized and unrealized gains and losses, capital and liquidity positions, sales and earnings trends, and management’s beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions. The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, and in the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment; the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC and other actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; inability to attract and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other systems, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; international business risks; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its “Closed Block” assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; and loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees.\nAbout Principal ®1\nPrincipal helps people and companies around the world build, protect and advance their financial well-being through retirement, insurance and asset management solutions that fit their lives.
