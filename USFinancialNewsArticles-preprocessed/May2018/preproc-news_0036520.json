    "text": "Gross profit up and increasing margins and cash flows for the reminder of the year\nNEWTOWN, CT, May 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Halitron, Inc. (the “Company,” “Halitron”) (OTC: HAON), a multisector holding company, is pleased to announce the financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Below is a list of financial and operational updates:\nSales were $361,000 in Q1, 2018, a period in which management relocated operations in New York to Connecticut facilities without a negative impact to shipments. Direct Gross Margins for the portfolio manufacturing company were 69.8% for the quarter. A one-time charge of $46,529 was incurred directly due to the successful relocation of Hopp assets to a lower-cost Connecticut facility. The combined cash balance at the end of the quarter totaled $61,280. Solid revenues, consistent margins, as well as the exit of our New Hyde Park, New York facility will reduce overhead costs and improve cash flows for the remainder of the year.\nThe operating and financial performance of the Company during the first quarter was very efficient and within budget. Seamlessly operating the day-to-day order flow and, at the same time, relocating an entire 5,000 square foot factory was very impressive. Management will now focus on sales growth initiatives over the next few quarters including developing the relationship with the recently awarded 425+ full-chain point of purchase supplies project.\nAbout Halitron, Inc.\nHalitron, Inc. is focused on acquiring sales, marketing, and manufacturing businesses to roll into efficient, low-cost operating infrastructures. Management targets operating entities that can benefit from our current operating infrastructure or operate autonomously and utilize our product or service offerings in order to expand their existing operations.
