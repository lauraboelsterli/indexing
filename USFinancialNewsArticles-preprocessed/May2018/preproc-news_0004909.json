    "text": "TULSA, Okla., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced higher first-quarter 2018 financial results, compared with the first quarter 2017. Results primarily benefited from volume growth in the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Williston and Permian basins, and higher optimization and marketing activities in the natural gas liquids segment.\nSUMMARY\nFirst-quarter 2018 operating income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 32 and 24 percent, respectively, compared with the first quarter 2017; First-quarter 2018 net income attributable to ONEOK totaled $264.5 million, or 64 cents per diluted share; First-quarter 2018 dividend coverage ratio was 1.37 times; Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8 times as of March 31, 2018, on a trailing 12-month basis; First-quarter 2018 natural gas volumes processed increased 23 percent, natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes fractionated increased 21 percent, and NGL volumes gathered increased 12 percent, compared with the first quarter 2017; and ONEOK maintains 2018 financial guidance.\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Millions of dollars, except per share\nand dividend coverage ratio amounts)\nNet income attributable to ONEOK\n$\n264.5\n$\n87.4\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.64\n$\n0.41\nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\n$\n570.3\n$\n459.6\nDCF (a)\n$\n432.0\n$\n324.2\nDividend coverage ratio (a)\n1.37\n1.46\nOperating income\n$\n419.7\n$\n317.1\nOperating costs\n$\n210.3\n$\n189.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n104.2\n$\n99.4\nEquity in net earnings from investments\n$\n40.2\n$\n39.6\nCapital expenditures\n$\n264.5\n$\n112.7\n(a) Adjusted EBITDA; distributable cash flow (DCF); and dividend coverage ratio are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures are included in this news release.\n\"Increased producer activity and drilling efficiencies across our operating footprint drove volume growth and higher financial results in the first quarter 2018, compared with the first quarter 2017,\" said Terry K. Spencer, ONEOK president and chief executive officer.\n\"Our focus for 2018 continues to be executing on our more than $4 billion of announced capital-growth projects to provide the services our customers need, and maintaining our strong balance sheet,\" Spencer added. \"We continue to return value to shareholders through our recent dividend increase while achieving a dividend coverage ratio of nearly 1.4 times for the quarter.\"\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nONEOK's operating income and adjusted EBITDA increased 32 percent and 24 percent, respectively, in the first quarter 2018, compared with the first quarter 2017. Higher results were driven primarily by natural gas and NGL volume growth in ONEOK's natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments, higher optimization and marketing activities in the natural gas liquids segment and the impact of $7 million in costs related to the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction in the first quarter 2017.\nResults were offset partially by higher operating costs associated with employee-related costs in all three segments, the growth of ONEOK's operations in the natural gas gathering and processing segment and the timing of routine maintenance projects in the natural gas liquids segment. Operating income was also impacted by higher depreciation expense in the first quarter 2018, compared with the first quarter 2017, due to projects placed in service.\nEARNINGS PRESENTATION AND KEY STATISTICS:\nAdditional financial and operating information that will be discussed on the first-quarter 2018 conference call is accessible on ONEOK's website, www.oneok.com , or from the links below.\n> View earnings presentation\n> View earnings tables\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:\nMaintaining 2018 net income guidance of $955 million to $1,155 million, adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2,215 million to $2,415 million and distributable cash flow guidance of $1,615 million to $1,815 million; Declaring in April 2018 a quarterly dividend of 79.5 cents per share, or $3.18 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of nearly 30 percent compared with the same period in 2017; Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8 times as of March 31, 2018, on a trailing 12-month basis; Having no outstanding commercial paper and $2.5 billion of borrowing capacity available under its $2.5 billion credit agreement; and First-quarter 2018 operating income was $419.7 million compared with $397.8 million for the fourth quarter 2017, a 6 percent increase.\nBUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS:\nKey financial and operating statistics are listed in the tables.\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\nThe natural gas liquids segment's first-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 23 percent, compared with the same period in 2017, due primarily to increased volumes, including higher ethane recovery, in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and increased volumes in the Williston and Permian Basins, and higher earnings from optimization and marketing activities.\nFirst-quarter 2018 NGLs gathered and fractionated increased 12 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared with the same period in 2017.\nAs total NGL volumes increased on ONEOK's system, ethane volumes also increased approximately 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter 2018, compared with the same period in 2017. Ethane rejection levels on ONEOK's system averaged more than 140,000 bpd in the first quarter 2018, compared with more than 150,000 bpd in the first quarter 2017, despite an increase in overall NGL volumes. ONEOK expects ethane rejection levels on its system to decrease to approximately 70,000 bpd by the end of 2018 as world-scale petrochemical facilities continue to come online and NGL exporters increase volumes.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nNatural Gas Liquids Segment\n2018\n2017\n(Millions of dollars)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n342.1\n$\n278.2\nCapital expenditures\n$\n124.9\n$\n20.5\nThe increase in first-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the first quarter 2017, primarily reflects:\nA $43.4 million increase in exchange services due to increased volumes, including higher ethane recovery, primarily in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and increased volumes in the Williston and Permian Basins, offset partially by lower volumes in the Barnett Shale and the impact of severe winter weather in 2018; A $24.9 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to wider location price differentials and the sale of NGL inventory previously held; and A $2.7 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to Overland Pass Pipeline from ONEOK's Bakken NGL Pipeline; offset partially by A $10.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs, the timing of routine maintenance projects and higher property taxes.\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment\nThe natural gas gathering and processing segment's first-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 26 percent, compared with the same period in 2017, primarily from higher volumes due to increased drilling activity and improved producer efficiencies.\nVolume growth due to new supply in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas contributed to a 23 percent increase in natural gas volumes processed in the first quarter 2018, compared with the same period in 2017. Volume growth was partially offset by natural production declines on existing wells.\nThe segment also continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings, with an average fee rate of 88 cents per Million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the first quarter 2018, compared with 83 cents per MMBtu in the first quarter 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment\n2018\n2017\n(Millions of dollars)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n130.6\n$\n104.0\nCapital expenditures\n$\n111.7\n$\n63.2\nFirst-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased, compared with the first quarter 2017, which primarily reflects:\nA $41.5 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, offset partially by natural production declines; offset partially by A $17.1 million increase in operating costs due primarily to increased materials and supplies and outside services expenses related to the growth of ONEOK's operations and higher employee-related costs.\nNatural Gas Pipelines Segment\nThe natural gas pipelines segment's first-quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 13 percent, compared with the same period in 2017. Increased transportation and storage services contributed to the segment's results.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nNatural Gas Pipelines Segment\n2018\n2017\n(Millions of dollars)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n93.6\n$\n83.0\nCapital expenditures\n$\n19.9\n$\n25.0\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018, compared with the first quarter 2017, primarily reflects:\nA $4.8 million increase from higher transportation services due primarily to increased interruptible transportation volumes; A $4.8 million increase from natural gas storage services; and A $3.2 million increase from net retained fuel due primarily to higher natural gas volumes retained; offset partially by A $1.6 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher employee-related costs; and A $1.1 million decrease in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to lower settled rates on Northern Border Pipeline.\nCAPITAL-GROWTH ACTIVITIES:\nSince June 2017, ONEOK has announced approximately $4.2 billion of organic capital-growth projects to support increasing production across ONEOK's operating footprint. These projects are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA multiples of four to six times and are backed by a combination of long-term fee-based contracts, volume commitments or acreage dedications.\nSince June 2017, the natural gas liquids segment has announced more than $3.6 billion of capital-growth projects, which include the following:\nProject\nScope\nApproximate Cost\n(Millions of dollars)\nExpected\nCompletion\nWest Texas LPG Pipeline expansion\n120-mile pipeline lateral extension with 110,000 bpd of capacity in the Delaware Basin\n$160 (a)\nThird quarter\n2018\nSterling III expansion\n60,000 bpd pipeline expansion from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast, which increases capacity to 250,000 bpd\n$130\nFourth quarter\n2018\nElk Creek Pipeline project\n900-mile pipeline from the Williston Basin to the Mid-Continent with initial capacity up to 240,000 bpd\n$1,400\nFourth quarter\n2019\nArbuckle II Pipeline\n530-mile pipeline from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast with initial capacity of 400,000 bpd\n$1,360\nFirst quarter\n2020\nMB-4 fractionator\n125,000 bpd fractionator and related infrastructure in Mont Belvieu, Texas\n$575\nFirst quarter\n2020\n(a) Represents ONEOK's 80 percent ownership interest\nSince June 2017, the natural gas gathering and processing segment has announced approximately $560 million of capital-growth projects, which include the following:\nProject\nScope\nApproximate Cost\n(Millions of dollars)\nExpected Completion\nCanadian Valley expansion\n200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) processing plant expansion in the STACK, which increases capacity to more than 400 MMcf/d\n$160\nFourth quarter\n2018\nDemicks Lake plant and infrastructure\n200 MMcf/d processing plant and related infrastructure in the core of the Williston Basin\n$400\nFourth quarter\n2019\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST:\nONEOK executive management will conduct a conference call at 11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (10 a.m. Central Daylight Time) on May 2, 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio are included in the tables. A reconciliation of estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples to GAAP net income is not provided because the GAAP net income generated by the projects is not available without unreasonable efforts.\nONEOK, Inc. (pronounced ONE-OAK) (NYSE: OKE ) is a leading midstream service provider and owner of one of the nation's premier natural gas liquids (NGL) systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent, Permian and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers and an extensive network of natural gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation assets.\nONEOK is a FORTUNE 500 company and is included in Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index.\nFor information about ONEOK, visit the website: www.oneok.com .\nFor the latest news about ONEOK, find us on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.\nThis news release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of federal securities laws.
