    "text": "FRISCO, Texas, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Addus HomeCare Corporation (NASDAQ: ADUS), a provider of comprehensive home care services, today announced that it has completed the purchase of Ambercare Corporation, Inc., a provider of personal care, hospice and home health services, headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Ambercare currently serves approximately 2,600 consumers through 15 locations located across New Mexico and, for 2017, generated revenue of approximately $57 million. Addus funded the purchase price of $40.0 million (net of excess cash) through the delayed draw term loan portion of its credit facility.\nDirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus, commented, \"We welcome the team from Ambercare, a long-time provider of high quality home care services, to Addus. We are pleased to complete this transaction, which is consistent with the central elements of our acquisition strategy. It builds on our already strong presence in New Mexico to give us market leading positions; it expands our scope of home care services in the market; and it is expected to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We are particularly excited to supplement our service offering with hospice services through this acquisition. Our management team has deep experience in the hospice industry, and we intend to continue to grow this segment of the business.\nThis transaction is the second large acquisition we have completed in the past 30 days. These deals reflect our growing acquisition pipeline, which we expect will continue to help us expand our market share and diversify our client base in targeted markets. With a strong financial position and substantial cash flow from operations, we believe we are well-positioned both to fund our organic growth and execute additional accretive acquisitions during 2018.\"\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
