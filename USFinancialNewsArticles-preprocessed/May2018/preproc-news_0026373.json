Those strikes heightened tensions in a region already on edge, and underlined the risk of direct confrontation between Iran and Israel following the U.S. exit from the nuclear agreement.\nRead: Here’s what will drive oil prices after Trump’s Iran decision\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Cornricus said in a phone briefing to journalists that Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes in Syria, but provided no details.\nSyrian air defenses had “confronted” Israeli missiles and reported Israeli shelling in the Syrian city of Baath, located near Israel’s northern border, according to the Syrian state news agency.
