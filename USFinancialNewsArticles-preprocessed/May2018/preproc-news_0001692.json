    "text": "May 2 (Reuters) - Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures on Wednesday kept bets the Federal Reserve will raise rates at least two more times this year after Fed policymakers ended a two-day meeting with no rate hike but on track for one in June.\nPrices of futures tied to the U.S. central bankâ€™s main policy rate reversed earlier slight losses, with some later-maturity contracts gaining in price after the decision was released.\nThe price changes were too small to reflect a serious pullback in expectations for interest-rate increases in June and September, with some chance of a further rate hike in December, based on a Reuters analysis of fed funds futures contracts traded at CME Group Inc.
