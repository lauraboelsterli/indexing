    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 4:15 PM / Updated 43 minutes ago Explosive eruption rocks Hawaii's Kilauea volcano -USGS Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMay 17 (Reuters) - An explosive eruption rocked Hawaii’s Kilaueau volcano on Thursday sending an ash plume thousands of feet into the air, according to tweets from the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe powerful, steam-driven blast was expected to spew large amounts of volcanic ash and smoke from Kilauea’s crater on Hawaii’s Big Island. The eruption has destroyed 37 homes and other structures in a small southeast area of the island and forced around 2,000 people to evacuate their homes.
