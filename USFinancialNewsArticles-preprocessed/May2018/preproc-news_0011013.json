We fine-tuned our pricing and promotional investments during the second quarter, resulting in an improved gross margin relative to the first quarter while delivering enhanced value to our customers. Our strong sales growth and prudent new store expansion strategy enabled us to leverage expenses to support improved earnings.\"\nIn addition to presenting the financial results of Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company is also presenting EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The reconciliation from GAAP to this non-GAAP financial measure is provided at the end of this earnings release.\nOperating Results — Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Compared to Second Quarter Fiscal 2017\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net sales increased $23.7 million, or 12.3%, to $215.9 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, primarily driven by a $13.5 million increase in comparable store sales and a $10.2 million increase in new store sales. Daily average comparable store sales increased 7.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a 1.7% decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The daily average comparable store sales increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was driven by a 5.0% increase in daily average transaction count and a 2.0% increase in average transaction size. Daily average mature store sales increased 4.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a 3.1% decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, mature stores include all stores open during or before fiscal 2013.\nGross profit during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 7.6% over the same period in fiscal 2017 to $58.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in the number of comparable stores. Gross profit reflects earnings after both product and occupancy costs. Gross margin was 27.0% of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 28.2% of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product margin, reflecting recent promotional pricing campaigns, a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and, to a lesser extent, higher occupancy costs, all as a percentage of sales.\nStore expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $4.1 million, or 9.6%, to $46.5 million. Store expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 21.5% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 22.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This decrease was primarily due to expense leverage from increased sales and decreases in labor expenses and depreciation expenses, both as a percentage of sales.\nAdministrative expenses increased 10.1% to $5.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $5.0 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2017. This increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation expenses. Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 2.5% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 2.6% in the comparable period in fiscal 2017.\nPre-opening and relocation expenses decreased $0.6 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017. This decrease was due to the impact of the number and timing of new store openings and relocations. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company opened three new stores compared to opening four new stores and relocating one store during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.2 million compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017 due to an increase in the number of the Company's capital leases and higher interest rates under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nThe Company's effective income tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was approximately 24.8% compared to 35.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three months is a result of the recent federal income tax reform.\nNet income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 13.6% over the same period in fiscal 2017 to $3.4 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.15.\nEBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1.7% to $13.1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating Results — First Half Fiscal 2018 Compared to First Half Fiscal 2017\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2018, net sales increased $42.6 million, or 11.3%, over the same period in fiscal 2017 to $418.4 million due to a $22.1 million, or 5.9%, increase in comparable store sales and a $20.5 million increase in sales from new stores. The 5.9% increase in daily average comparable store sales during the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to a 1.2% decrease in the first half of fiscal 2017. The 5.9% increase in the first half of fiscal 2018 was driven by a 4.9% increase in daily average transaction count and a 0.9% increase in average transaction size. Daily average mature store sales increased 3.0% in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to a 2.7% decrease in the first half of fiscal 2017.\nGross profit during the first half of fiscal 2018 increased 4.8% over the same period in fiscal 2017 to $111.4 million, primarily driven by an increase in the number of comparable stores. Gross profit reflects earnings after both product and occupancy costs. Gross margin was 26.6% of sales during the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to 28.3% of sales in the first half of fiscal 2017. The decline in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product margin, reflecting recent promotional pricing campaigns and a shift in sales mix to lower margin products, both as a percentage of sales.\nStore expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 50 basis points during the first half of fiscal 2018 to 21.9% of sales compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017, primarily driven by leverage from increased sales, including decreased labor expenses and depreciation, both as a percentage of sales.\nAdministrative expenses increased 8.9% to $10.7 million during the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to $9.8 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2017. This increase was due to an increase in compensation expenses. Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.6% during the first half of fiscal 2018, consistent with the comparable period in fiscal 2017.\nPre-opening and relocation expenses decreased $1.3 million during the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the number and timing of new store openings and relocations. During the first half of fiscal 2018, the Company opened five new stores and relocated one store compared to opening nine new stores and relocating one store during the first half of fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense increased $0.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher interest rates under the Company's revolving credit facility, an increase in the number of the Company's capital leases and a decrease in capitalized interest expense.\nThe Company reported a net tax benefit of $3.0 million in the first half of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the favorable impact of a $4.3 million non-cash remeasurement of the Company's deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recent federal income tax reform. That remeasurement was recorded fiscal 2018. Exclusive of the adjustment to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company's effective income tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018 was approximately 24.5% as compared to 35.3% for the first half of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the six months is a result of the recent federal tax reform.\nNet income was $8.6 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38 in the first half of fiscal 2018. Excluding the favorable impact of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recent federal income tax reform, net income was $4.3 million, or $0.19 diluted earnings per share, for the six months .\nEBITDA during the first half of fiscal 2018 was $22.7 million.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $29.4 million available for borrowing under its $50 million revolving credit facility. Credit facility usage was comprised of $19.6 million of direct borrowings and $1.0 million of letters of credit as of March 31, 2018.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $21.7 million in cash from operations and invested $10.5 million in capital expenditures, primarily for new stores and relocations.\nGrowth and Development\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company opened three new stores, bringing the total store count as of March 31, 2018 to 145 stores in 19 states. The Company opened five new stores and relocated one store in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to opening nine new stores and relocating one store in the first half of 2017, resulting in 7.4% and 20.5% unit growth rates for the twelve month periods and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nSince April 1, 2018, the Company has opened one store in Oregon. The Company has eight signed leases for stores that are planned to open in fiscal 2018 and beyond in Colorado, Iowa, Oregon and Texas.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is raising its fiscal 2018 outlook for daily average comparable store sales growth and narrowing its outlook for diluted earnings per share. The initial outlook had been provided when the Company reported fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results on November 16, 2017.\nFiscal\n2018 Outlook\nFirst Half\nFY'18\nActual\nNumber of new stores\n8 to 10\n5\nNumber of relocations\n3 to 4\n1\nDaily average comparable store sales growth\n3.5% to 4.5%\n5.9%\nNet income as a percentage of sales\n1.0% to 1.3%\n2.1%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.43 to $0.50\n$0.38\nCapital expenditures (in millions)\n$25 to $30\n$10.5\nExtension of Share Repurchase Program\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a two-year extension of the Company's $10 million share repurchase program.

COTTAGE, INC.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nEBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA for the periods presented, dollars in thousands:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\nSix months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n3,404\n2,996\n8,585\n5,057\nInterest expense, net\n1,122\n879\n2,211\n1,862\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n1,120\n1,640\n(2,957)\n2,762\nDepreciation and amortization\n7,410\n7,319\n14,825\n14,440\nEBITDA\n$\n13,056\n12,834\n22,664\n24,121\nEBITDA increased 1.7% to $13.1 million in the three months compared to $12.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. EBITDA decreased 6.0% to $22.7 million in the six months compared to $24.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. EBITDA as a percent of sales was 6.0% and 6.7% in the three months and 2017, respectively. EBITDA as a percent of sales was 5.4% and 6.4% in the six months and 2017, respectively.\nManagement believes some investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe EBITDA provides additional information about: (i) our operating performance, because it assists us in comparing the operating performance of our stores on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly resulting from our core operations such as interest expense and income taxes and (ii) our performance and the effectiveness of our operational strategies. Additionally, EBITDA is a component of a measure in our financial covenants under our Credit Facility. Further, our incentive compensation plan bases incentive compensation payments on EBITDA, among other measures.\nFurthermore, management believes some investors use EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry. Management believes some investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation from net income, we believe we are enhancing analysts' and investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting analysts and investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives.\nOur competitors may define EBITDA differently, and as a result, our measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Items excluded from EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance that does not represent, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nEBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA does not reflect any impact for straight-line rent expense for leases classified as capital and financing lease obligations; EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nDue to these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA as supplemental information.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/natural-grocers-by-vitamin-cottage-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-2018-results-300642387.html\nSOURCE Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc.",
