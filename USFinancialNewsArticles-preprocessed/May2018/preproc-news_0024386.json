Neither Upbit nor the financial investigation team of the Seoul Southern District public prosecutors’ office was immediately available for comment.\nUpbit sent a note to its clients that it is co-operating with the prosecutors and that it can guarantee that all its clients’ assets are secure.\nFour executives from two other South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges were detained in April in connection with the alleged embezzlement of billions of won.
