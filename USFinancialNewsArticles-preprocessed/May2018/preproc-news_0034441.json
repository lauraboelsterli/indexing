(NASDAQ: PIH) (the “Company”), a property and casualty insurance holding company offering specialty insurance to customers in Louisiana, Texas and Florida through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Maison Insurance Company (“Maison”), today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial and Operating Highlights\n(unless noted all financial comparisons are to the prior-year quarter)\nGross premiums earned increased 38.7% to $18.7 million from $13.5 million. Net premiums earned increased 54.4% to $12.6 million from $8.2 million. In-force policy count at March 31, 2018 increased 43.3% to 51,900 from 36,200 at March 31, 2017, from active programs. Net combined ratio was 83.8%, which included no catastrophe weather events; compared with 100.8% in the prior year quarter. Net income was approximately $2.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $0.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Issued 700,000 shares of 8% Cumulative Preferred Stock raising $17.5 million of equity with offering costs of $0.17 per common share. Book value per share of $7.86 at March 31, 2018 versus $7.82 at December 31, 2017 and $7.83 a year ago.\nManagement Comments\nDoug Raucy, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “During the first quarter 2018, we continued our momentum from the fourth quarter by increasing our policy counts and premiums earned resulting in record first quarter net income. Although we did experience modest weather claims in the quarter, our portfolio continues to benefit from more diversification and their impact on our earnings was not as significant as in prior years. Shareholders will recall that the first quarter of 2016 and 2017 were particularly eventful. Our net loss ratio improved due to lower frequency and severity of weather and non-weather current quarter claims along with a slight increase in prior year’s redundancy. This first quarter of 2018 marked a record for us, as it generated the highest earnings per diluted share in the history of the Company. We ended the period with approximately 51,900 policies in force, or an increase of 4.5% from December 31, 2017. Our recent expansion into Texas led our policy growth, as our independent agency network in the state, which now numbers over 760, continues to recognize the value we bring to the marketplace. Our book value per share stands at $7.86 which grew in the quarter due to earnings per share of $0.33 offset by Series A Preferred Share issuance costs of $(0.17) and unrealized losses on investments of $(0.11) per share. As we’ve consistently indicated, we manage our business for long term value creation and it is best measured in that context. We will no longer be holding quarterly conference calls and plan to provide investor updates on an annual basis.”\nOperating Review\n(Unaudited) ($ in thousands, except ratios and per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Gross premiums written $16,621 $12,834 29.5% Ceded premiums written $6,085 $5,876 3.6% Gross premiums earned $18,746 $13,518 38.7% Ceded premiums earned $6,131 $5,346 14.7% Net premiums earned $12,615 $8,172 54.4% Total revenues $13,540 $8,717 55.3% Gross losses and loss adjustment expenses $5,213 $5,585 (6.7)% Ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses $954 $1,954 (51.2)% Net losses and loss adjustment expenses $4,259 $3,631 17.3% Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs $3,295 $2,522 30.7% General and administrative expenses $3,021 $2,091 44.5% Total expenses $11,220 $8,336 34.6% Income before income taxes $2,320 $381 508.9% Net income $1,951 $246 693.1% Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 6,093,096 5,956,766 2.3% Ratios to Gross Premiums Earned: (1) Ceded ratio 27.6% 25.1% 2.5 pts Gross loss ratio 27.8% 41.3% (13.5) pts DPAC ratio 17.6% 18.6% (1.0) pts G&A ratio 16.1% 15.5% 0.6 pts Combined gross ratio 89.1% 100.5% (11.4) pts Ratios to Net Premiums Earned: (1)\nNet loss ratio 33.7% 44.4% (10.7) pts Net expense ratio 50.1% 56.4% (6.4) pts Net combined ratio 83.8% 100.8% (17.1) pts (1) See “Definitions of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures” Section. Quarterly Financial Review\nPremiums\nGross premiums written increased 29.5% to $16.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with $12.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Gross premiums earned increased 38.7% to $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with $13.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase for the three-month period was largely due to organic growth in voluntary production from the Company’s independent agents in Texas as well as the assumption of premium through our depopulation from Louisiana Citizens Property Corporation (“LACPIC”) which occurred on December 1, 2017 and Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“FLCPIC”) which occurred on December 19, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 71% of the Company’s 51,900 policies in force were from voluntary policies obtained from the Company’s independent agent network, with the remainder obtained from take-out policies.\nNet premiums earned increased 54.4% to $12.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $8.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, largely due to the increase in gross premiums earned as previously discussed.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe gross loss ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 27.8% compared to 41.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The net loss ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 33.7% compared to 44.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Both gross and net loss ratios decreased primarily due to reductions in weather and non-weather losses. Combining catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses resulted in a net loss ratio of 20.0% for the first quarter 2018 compared to 26.2% for the first quarter 2017, a 620 basis point improvement. Our non-weather net loss ratio also improved by 400 basis points. Furthermore, due to the accumulation of losses incurred during our reinsurance year beginning June 1, 2017, we met the retention under our aggregate treaty during the first quarter 2018.\nThe following table reflects the four major components of our net loss ratio for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 that we use to analyze the Company’s loss experience.\n( $ in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Losses\n($)\nLoss Ratio\n(%)\nLosses\n($)\nLoss Ratio\n(%)\nCatastrophe losses (1) $ – –% $ 1,697 20.7% Weather-related non-catastrophe losses 2,527 20.0% 451 5.5% Non-weather related losses 2,298 18.2% 1,812 22.2% Total current accident year losses 4,825 38.2% 3,960 48.4% Prior period redundancy (2) (566) (4.5)% (329) (4.0)% Total net losses and LAE incurred $ 4,259 33.7% $ 3,631 44.4% (1) Property Claims Services (PCS) defines a catastrophic event as an event where the insurance industry is estimated to incur over $25,000 of insured property damage that also impacts a significant number of insureds. For purposes of the above table, we have defined a Catastrophe as a PCS event where our estimated gross incurred loss exceeds $1,500. (2) Prior Period Development is the amount of ultimate actual loss settlement value which is more than the estimated reserves recorded for a particular liability or loss, while redundancy represents the ultimate actual loss settlement value which is less than the estimated and determined reserves recorded for a particular liability or loss. Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.3 million, a $0.8 million increase over $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, this expense decreased to 17.6% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 18.6% for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was mainly driven by the assumption of premiums from FL CPIC during December 2017, which had no agent commissions associated with this business.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.0 million, a 44.5% increase from $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned increased to 16.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 15.5% for the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in employee costs as a result of an increase in staffing, and an increase in underwriting/survey reports and processing costs associated with our policy growth.\nNet Income\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported net income of $2.0 million, compared to a net income of $0.2 million in the prior year period. The Company reported net income of $0.32 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2018, based on approximately 6.1 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a net income of $0.04 per diluted share during the prior year period, based on approximately 6.0 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nBalance Sheet / Investment Portfolio Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company held cash, cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of $101.6 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s investment in fixed maturities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers, including short-term investments, comprised 95% of the investment portfolio.\nPreferred Shares\nDuring the quarter, the Company repurchased all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock which were previously issued as a result of the termination of the Management Services Agreement with Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. Additionally, the Company completed the underwritten public offering for preferred shares designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), resulting in approximately $16.5 million in net proceeds received by the Company. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and will be payable quarterly. Proceeds received from the offering were used to fund a portion of the repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock, with the remainder of the proceeds to be used to support organic growth and for future potential acquisition opportunities.\nDEFINITION OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company assesses its results of operations using certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are defined below. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating performance in the same manner as management does.\nThe non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how the Company defines its non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company analyzes performance based on ratios common in the insurance industry such as loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The Company’s ratios are calculated as shown in the following table.\nRatio Numerator Divisor Ceded ratio Ceded premium earned minus ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses Gross premium earned Gross loss ratio Gross losses and loss adjustment expenses Gross premium earned DPAC ratio Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs Gross premium earned G&A ratio General and administrative expenses Gross premium earned Net loss ratio Net losses and loss adjustment expenses Net premium earned Net expense ratio Deferred policy acquisition costs plus general and administrative expenses Net premium earned The gross combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the ceded ratio, gross loss ratio, DPAC ratio, and G&A ratio. The net combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nD. Kyle Cerminara Appointed Chairman of the Board\nAt the most recent board meeting, Larry G. Swets, Jr. indicated his desire to retire from the Chairman role as his time commitment as Chairman of Insurance Income Strategies, Ltd. increases. D. Kyle Cerminara was appointed Chairman at the same meeting. Mr. Swets commented “It’s been a pleasure to play a small role with the PIH/Maison team as they took the company from a startup over 5 years ago to the well-funded and profitable insurer. The last two quarters of profitability are showing the results of all the hard work the team has put in over the years.” Mr. Swets continues to serve on the Board of Directors.\nAbout 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.\n1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. is a specialized property and casualty insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware.
