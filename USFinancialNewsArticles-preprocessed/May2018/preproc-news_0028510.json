    "text": "Kellie Ell: CNBC Digital News Associate Published 11:42 AM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 Updated 3:09 PM ET Wed, 9 May 2018 CNBC.com\n\"I'm Kellie Ell, and I'm a News Associate for CNBC.\nAfter studying business and economics reporting in grad school, I knew that this was the place where I wanted to be.\nWhen I heard about the convention workshop, I applied right away. It's a great opportunity to meet some of the network's leading editors, producers and anchors, and to learn how to navigate this exciting world of journalism. \"The workshop showed me how CNBC is the first in breaking news and uncovering stories. Coming from a print background, nothing moves as fast as CNBC.\"\nThe workshop also showed me that CNBC values diversity. From the stories it covers to the people who make up the network, you don't have to have a background in business journalism to apply for the workshop or to be part of CNBC.\nBut you do have to be curious about learning the business of covering business news.\" Business News Associate Workshop at #AAJA18 | Houston | Aug 10 ",
