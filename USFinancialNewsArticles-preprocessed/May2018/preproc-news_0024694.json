    "text": "ATLANTA, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardlytics, Inc., (NASDAQ:CDLX), a purchase intelligence platform that helps make marketing more relevant and measurable, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We generated solid first quarter results, with 31% year-over-year growth in Cardlytics Direct revenue,\" said Scott Grimes, CEO & Co-Founder of Cardlytics. “Cardlytics Direct delivers growth by leveraging purchase intelligence to find valuable customers and understand precisely the return on a marketer's investment. This is especially critical in the rapidly changing retail environment, and we believe it positions us well as we continue to grow our base of marketers.\"\n“We are pleased to announce the signing of an agreement for a national launch with JPMorgan Chase,” said Lynne Laube, COO & Co-Founder of Cardlytics. “The addition of Chase to the Cardlytics purchase intelligence platform will further strengthen our ability to provide powerful, actionable insights for our marketer clients and then act on these insights at scale.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $32.7 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year compared to $26.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cardlytics Direct revenue was $32.1 million, an increase of 31% compared to $24.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss was $(20.1) million, or $(1.54) per share based on 13.1 million weighted-average common shares outstanding, compared to a loss of $(12.5) million, or $(4.80) per share based on 2.6 million weighted-average common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted contribution, a non-GAAP metric, was $14.2 million compared to $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $(3.1) million compared to a loss of $(4.9) million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $(6.1) million, or $(0.35) per share based on 17.6 million non-GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding, compared to a loss of $(8.7) million, or $(0.75) per share based on 11.6 million non-GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2017.\n“We had several important drivers impacting revenue growth. These include MAU growth, growth in new and existing marketers, and improved engagement enhancements with our banks,” said David Evans, CFO of Cardlytics. \"With the announcement that Chase will be coming onto our platform, we are very excited about the longer-term prospects for the business.\"\nKey Metrics\nFI MAUs were 58.7 million, an increase of 13% compared to 51.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. ARPU was $0.55 compared to $0.47 in the first quarter of 2017.\nDefinitions of FI MAUs and ARPU are included below under the caption “Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.”\n2018 Financial Expectations\nCardlytics anticipates revenue and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to be in the following ranges for the periods indicated (in millions):\nQ2 2018 Full year 2018 Revenue $34.0 - 35.0 $153.0 - 156.0 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1)(2) $(4.2) - (4.0) $(18.0) - (16.0) Estimated Non-GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 20.3 20.1 (1) With respect to our expectations above under the caption “2018 Financial Expectations,” a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss on a forward looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from this non-GAAP measure. We have provided a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\n(2) The adjusted EBITDA expectations for the full year of 2018 includes the impact of an anticipated $2.0 million expense in the second half of 2018 related to an expected shortfall in meeting a minimum FI Share commitment.\nEarnings Teleconference Information\nCardlytics will discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results during a teleconference today, May 10, 2018, at 5:00 PM ET / 2:00 PM PT.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: our financial performance, including our revenue, margins, costs, expenditures, growth rates and operating expenses, and our ability to sustain revenue growth, generate positive cash flow and become profitable; risks related to our substantial dependence on its Cardlytics Direct product; risks related to our substantial dependence on Bank of America, N.A. and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to successfully implement Cardlytics Direct for JPMorgan Chase customers and maintain a relationship with JPMorgan Chase; the amount and timing of budgets by advertisers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FIs; our ability to attract new FI partners and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing financial institutions and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; our significant amount of debt, which may affect our ability to operate the business and secure additional financing in the future, and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 19, 2018 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance: adjusted contribution, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP loss per share as well as certain other performance metrics, such as FI monthly active users (“FI MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\nWe have presented adjusted contribution, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. We define adjusted contribution as our revenue less our FI Share and other third-party costs excluding non-cash equity expense recognized in FI Share and amortization and impairment of deferred FI implementation costs. We define adjusted EBITDA as our net loss before income tax benefit; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; change in fair value of warrant liabilities; change in fair value of convertible promissory notes; foreign currency (gain) loss; loss on extinguishment of debt; costs associated with financing events; restructuring costs; amortization and impairment of deferred FI implementation costs; termination of U.K. agreement expense; and non-cash equity expense recognized in FI Share. We define non-GAAP net loss as our net loss before stock-based compensation expense; change in fair value of warrant liabilities; change in fair value of convertible promissory notes; foreign currency (gain) loss; loss on extinguishment of debt; costs associated with financing events; restructuring costs; termination of U.K. agreement expense and non-cash equity expense recognized in FI Share. Notably, any expense we accrue related to minimum FI Share commitments in connection with agreements with certain FI partners we do not add back to net loss in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA. We define non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by non-GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted, which includes our GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted, and our weighted-average preferred shares outstanding, assuming conversion.\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results, and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\nWe define FI MAUs as customers or accounts of our FI partners that logged in and visited the online or mobile banking applications of, or opened an email from, our FI partners during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of FI MAUs for the periods presented above. We define ARPU, as the total GAAP Cardlytics Direct revenue generated in the applicable period, divided by the average number of FI MAUs in the applicable period.\nCARDLYTICS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in thousands) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 89,785 $ 21,262 Accounts receivable, net 39,907 48,348 Other receivables 2,748 2,898 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,658 2,121 Total current assets $ 136,098 $ 74,629 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net 7,363 7,319 INTANGIBLE ASSETS, net 359 528 CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, net 880 433 DEFERRED FI IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, net 12,119 13,625 OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS 988 4,224 Total assets $ 157,807 $ 100,758 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 1,783 $ 1,554 Accrued liabilities: Accrued compensation 3,263 4,638 Accrued expenses 3,918 4,615 FI Share liability 21,376 23,914 Consumer Incentive liability 6,949 7,242 Deferred billings 189 132 Short-term warrant liability 17,666 — Short-term debt: Line of credit 25,634 — Capital leases 23 44 Total current liabilities $ 80,801 $ 42,139 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES: Deferred liabilities $ 3,554 $ 3,670 Long-term warrant liability — 10,230 Long-term debt, net of current portion: Line of credit — 25,081 Term loan 32,842 31,830 Capital leases 52 57 Total long-term liabilities $ 36,448 $ 70,868 TOTAL REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK $ — $ 196,437 STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY: Common stock $ 7 $ — Additional paid-in capital 328,493 58,693 Accumulated other comprehensive income 558 1,066 Accumulated deficit (288,500 ) (268,445 ) Total stockholders’ (deficit) equity 40,558 (208,686 ) Total liabilities and stockholders’ (deficit) equity $ 157,807 $ 100,758\nCARDLYTICS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in thousands except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 REVENUE $ 32,713 $ 26,881 COSTS AND EXPENSES: FI Share and other third-party costs 21,420 16,677 Delivery costs 1,943 1,553 Sales and marketing expense 8,216 7,232 Research and development expense 3,459 3,013 General and administration expense 6,582 4,689 Depreciation and amortization expense 910 765 Total costs and expenses 42,530 33,929 OPERATING LOSS (9,817 ) (7,048 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense, net (1,749 ) (2,644 ) Change in fair value of warrant liabilities, net (9,172 ) (327 ) Change in fair value of convertible promissory notes — (383 ) Change in fair value of convertible promissory notes—related parties — (2,223 ) Other income, net 683 162 Total other expense (10,238 ) (5,415 ) LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (20,055 ) (12,463 ) INCOME TAX BENEFIT — — NET LOSS $ (20,055 ) $ (12,463 ) Adjustments to the carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock (157 ) (244 ) Net loss attributable to common stockholders $ (20,212 ) $ (12,707 ) Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (1.54 ) $ (4.80 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 13,093 2,645\nCARDLYTICS, INC.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Delivery costs $ 85 $ 41 Sales and marketing expense 943 344 Research and development expense 470 171 General and administration expense 1,402 427 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 2,900 $ 983\nCARDLYTICS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)\n(Amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net loss $ (20,055 ) $ (12,463 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: Change in allowance for doubtful accounts (32 ) (4 ) Depreciation and amortization 910 765 Amortization of financing costs charged to interest expense 140 148 Accretion of debt discount and non-cash interest expense 1,500 2,307 Stock compensation expense 2,900 983 Change in the fair value of warrant liabilities, net 9,172 327 Change in the fair value of convertible promissory notes — 383 Change in the fair value of convertible promissory notes -
