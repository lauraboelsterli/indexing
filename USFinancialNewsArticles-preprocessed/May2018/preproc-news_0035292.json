Before that, she oversaw brand communications for numerous brands in P&G's portfolio, including Crest, Scope, Glide Floss, Venus razors, Olay Skincare, Secret deodorant, and COVERGIRL and Max Factor cosmetics.\n“After many years managing PR and influencer marketing for leading brands, I’m looking forward to taking my passion for the beauty business, and perspective from the client side, to help Influenster continue to build meaningful partnership solutions while developing new capabilities and diversifying our offerings. Influenster is on an incredible trajectory, with much to offer, and I’m excited to be part of the company’s future,” said Brinker.\nAs the Vice President of Brand Partnerships, Jason Lotkowictz is responsible for diversified revenue growth. He will expand client and agency relationships in categories like food, retail, finance, travel, electronics and beyond. Jason’s revenue growth responsibilities also focus on the enrichment of Influenster’s platform marketing products, by developing new go-to-market solutions for media, data, and e-commerce.\nPrior to Influenster, Jason has had a historical success in ramping up revenue growth at start-ups and legacy businesses alike. He brings expertise to Influenster that will allow for rapid expansion into new markets and lines of business.\n“Having actively followed Influenster’s growth since its inception, I am inspired by the opportunity to contribute to the next chapter of Influenster’s evolution,” said Lotkowictz.\nAbout Influenster\nInfluenster is a digital destination where millions of consumers research and review products and where brands can target and connect with highly engaged, empowered shoppers.
