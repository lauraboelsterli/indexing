    "text": "Westar Merger on Track to Close in Second Quarter\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Great Plains Energy (NYSE: GXP) today announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $35.0 million or $0.16 per share of average common stock outstanding, compared with a first quarter 2017 loss of $24.7 million or $0.11 per share.\nGreat Plains Energy’s adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) exclude certain costs, expenses, gains, losses and the per share dilutive effect of equity issuances resulting from the anticipated merger with Westar Energy and the previous plan to acquire Westar. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) were $29.4 million and $0.19, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $19.9 million and $0.13, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are reconciled to GAAP earnings (loss) in the financial table included in this release.\n“Our solid financial performance in the first quarter was driven by solid demand growth and cost management. Colder weather also contributed to results for the quarter,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy.\nBassham continued, “Upon the approval of our constructive merger settlements in Kansas and Missouri, we will have the best opportunity to provide our retail electric customers substantial benefits, including tens of millions of dollars in bill credits and rate stability over the next several years. We remain on track to complete our pending merger with Westar Energy in the second quarter.”\nGreat Plains Energy First Quarter:\nGREAT PLAINS ENERGY INCORPORATED Consolidated Earnings (Loss) and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Three Months Ended March 31 (Unaudited) Earnings (Loss) per Great Earnings (Loss) Plains Energy Share 2018 2017 2018 2017 GAAP Earnings (millions) Electric Utility $ 28.0 $ 16.1 $ 0.13 $ 0.07 Other 7.0 (25.7 ) 0.03 (0.11 ) Net income (loss) 35.0 (9.6 ) 0.16 (0.04 ) Preferred dividends - (15.1 ) - (0.07 ) Earnings (loss) available for common shareholders $ 35.0 $ (24.7 ) $ 0.16 $ (0.11 ) Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings (loss) available for common shareholders $ 35.0 $ (24.7 ) $ 0.16 $ (0.11 ) Costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar: Operating expenses, pre-tax (a) 2.9 39.4 0.02 0.25 Financing, pre-tax (b) - 26.6 - 0.17 Mark-to-market impacts of interest rate swaps, pre-tax (c) (7.0 ) (12.1 ) (0.05 ) (0.08 ) Interest income, pre-tax (d) (3.5 ) (4.6 ) (0.02 ) (0.03 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (e) 2.0 (19.8 ) 0.02 (0.13 ) Preferred stock (f) - 15.1 - 0.10 Impact of October 2016 share issuance (g) n/a n/a 0.06 (0.04 ) Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 29.4 $ 19.9 $ 0.19 $ 0.13 Average Shares Outstanding (millions) Shares used in calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share 216.0 215.3 Adjustment for October 2016 share issuance (g) (60.5 ) (60.5 ) Shares used in calculating adjusted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) 155.5 154.8 (a)\nReflects legal, advisory and consulting fees and certain severance expenses and are included in Costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(b)\nReflects fees for a bridge term loan facility and interest on Great Plains Energy's $4.3 billion senior notes and are included in Interest charges on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(c)\nReflects the mark-to-market impacts of interest rate swaps and is included in Interest charges and Non-operating income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(d)\nReflects interest income earned on the proceeds from Great Plains Energy's October 2016 equity offerings and March 2017 issuance of $4.3 billion senior notes and is included in Non-operating income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(e)\nReflects an income tax effect calculated at a 25.74% statutory rate for 2018 and a 38.9% statutory rate for 2017, with the exception of certain non-deductible legal and financing fees.\n(f)\nReflects reductions to earnings available for common shareholders related to preferred stock dividend requirements for Great Plains Energy's Series B Preferred Stock and are included in Preferred stock dividend requirements on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n(g)\nReflects the average share impact of Great Plains Energy's issuance of 60.5 million shares of common stock in October 2016.\nGAAP Earnings\nOn a per-share basis, the increase in first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings per share compared to the same period in 2017 was impacted by $0.21 of lower costs to achieve the anticipated merger with Westar Energy as detailed in the table above as well as the following items under the heading Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP).\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP)\nOn a per-share basis, drivers for the increase in first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) compared to the same period in 2017 included the following:\nAn approximate $0.07 increase from colder weather driven by a 27 percent increase in heating degree days compared to the first quarter of 2017; An estimated $0.02 increase from an increase in weather-normalized retail demand; and An approximate $0.03 increase in other items.\nThese drivers were partially offset by a $0.06 decrease from the net impact of the lower federal income tax rate. This net impact is driven by a provision for rate refund for the income tax savings that are anticipated to be returned to customers partially offset by lower income tax expense.\nOverall retail megawatt hour sales were up 7.3 percent in the first quarter 2018 compared to the 2017 period. The weather impact in the first quarter 2018, when compared to normal, was flat.\nAdjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP)\nIn addition to earnings (loss) available for common shareholders and diluted earnings (loss) per common share, Great Plains Energy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and earnings per share without the impact of the anticipated merger with Westar Energy. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) exclude certain costs, expenses, gains, losses and the per share dilutive effect of equity issuances resulting from the anticipated merger and the previous plan to acquire Westar Energy. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors of Great Plains Energy. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or more useful than the GAAP information.\nGreat Plains Energy will post its 2018 First Quarter Form 10-Q, as well as supplemental financial information related to the first quarter on its website, www.greatplainsenergy.com .\nEarnings Webcast Information:\nAn earnings conference call and webcast is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. ET Thursday, May 3, 2018, to review the Company’s 2018 first quarter earnings and operating results.\nA live audio webcast of the conference call, presentation slides, supplemental financial information, and the earnings press release will be available on the investor relations page of Great Plains Energy’s website at www.greatplainsenergy.com .
