Announced upcoming launch of X Series product line at Enterprise Connect in March 2018.\n“Our new X Series platform is the culmination of a multi-year process of acquisition and organic investment, and we believe it will be a game changer,” continued Vik Verma. “Based on strong market adoption of our unified platform and our increasing capabilities in data analytics and artificial intelligence, including the recent acquisition of MarianaIQ, X Series is uniquely positioned to be the communications engine companies need to fuel their digital transformation efforts for years to come.”\n“To fully leverage this market opportunity in fiscal 2019 and beyond, we are expanding investments in engineering, marketing, sales, deployment, and customer support. We are adopting this strategy in order to deliver the most comprehensive, integrated system of engagement to the market. We believe strongly this strategy and the investments we are making will drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and customers.”\nFinancial Outlook:\nOur financial outlook reflects the adoption of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard that is effective for us beginning April 1, 2018. The guidance below includes the expected impact of the adoption of this new standard, which replaced ASC 605. We expect no material difference in revenue between ASC 606 and ASC 605. However, under ASC 606, we estimate that certain sales commission expenses will reduce GAAP and non-GAAP net loss by approximately $11 million to $13 million for the full fiscal year 2019.\nFull Year Fiscal 2019 Financial Outlook under ASC 606:\nService revenue in the range of $333 million to $338 million, representing approximately 19% to 21% year-over-year increase. Excluding DXI revenue, service revenue growth in the range of 21% to 22%. Total revenue in the range of $347 million to $352 million, representing approximately 17% to 19% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP pre-tax loss in the range of $13 million to $17 million.\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2019 Financial Outlook:\nService revenue in the range of $77 million to $78 million, representing approximately 18% to 20% year-over-year increase. Excluding DXI revenue, service revenue growth in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP pre-tax loss in the range of $4 million to $5 million.\nThe Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP net income to the corresponding GAAP measures of GAAP net income (loss) due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses we exclude. For example, although future hiring and retention needs may be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. Similarly, impairments and other non-recurring items are difficult to predict as they may depend on future events and external factors outside the Company’s control. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP net income (loss). Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Information:\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss earnings results on May 24, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time). The call is accessible via the following numbers and webcast links:\nDial In: (866) 393-4306 Domestic or (734) 385-2616 International; Conference ID #1568167 Replay: (855) 859-2056 Domestic or (404) 537-3406 International; Conference ID #1568167 Webcast: http://investors.8x8.com\nParticipants should plan to dial in or log on ten minutes prior to the start time.

For additional information, visit www.8x8.com , or follow 8x8 on LinkedIn , Twitter , and Facebook .\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nThe Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating 8x8’s ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nThe Company has defined non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) for GAAP plus amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment charges, stock-based compensation, other income and expenses, and the provision for or benefit from income taxes. Amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges are excluded because they are a non-cash expense that management does not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing the Company’s financial performance. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock and attrition, that are difficult to predict and are affected by market factors that are largely not within the control of management. Certain other income and expense items, such as acquisition-related or severance expenses, have been excluded because management considers them to be isolated transactions and believes they are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations, reduce comparability of periodic operating results when included, are difficult to predict, and are often one-time. GAAP tax provision (benefit) for income taxes has been excluded as it is also a non-cash expense that management does not consider part of its analysis of the performance of ongoing operations. Due to the Company’s history of tax losses and full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, future GAAP and Non-GAAP effective tax rates are limited to current taxes in certain US state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company reports these current taxes as reduction from Non-GAAP pretax net income to derive Non-GAAP net income after taxes.\nThe Company defines non-GAAP net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding which includes the effect of potentially dilutive stock options and awards. The Company defines non-GAAP net income percentage of revenue as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by non-GAAP revenue. Management believes that such exclusions facilitate comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, and provides investors with information that management uses in evaluating the Company’s performance on a quarterly and annual basis.\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures adjust expense, they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation programs, which are an important element of the Company's compensation structure. GAAP requires that all forms of share-based payments should be valued and included, as appropriate, in results of operations. Management believes these expenses are a material part of the Company's operating results.\nIn addition:\nThis release may provide certain financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the discontinuation of the voice broadcasting segment of DXI, as first reported in the third quarter of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year. To adjust for the discontinued voice broadcasting business, revenue figures for each period being compared exclude all revenue attributable to the discontinued business. This release may provide certain financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude all revenue generated by DXI in the revenue figures for each period being compared. As first reported in the third quarter of the Company’s 2018 fiscal year, the Company has de-emphasized the sale of DXI’s ContactNow as a stand-alone product, and management therefore believes it is useful to exclude this revenue from certain period-to-period comparisons in order to assess the growth of the Company’s core business. Some financial measures presented in this release may reflect adjustments for comparison on a constant currency basis when management concluded that the elimination of the impact of currency fluctuations between current and comparative prior periods assist with the evaluation of the underlying business performance.\nThe Company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures to the public as an additional means by which investors can assess the Company's performance and to identify the Company's operating results for investors on the same basis applied by management. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This reconciliation has been provided in the financial statement tables included below .\nForward Looking Statements:\nThis news release contains “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
