Sonde’s proprietary technology works by sensing and analyzing subtle changes in the voice to create a range of persistent brain, muscle, and respiratory health measurements that provide a more complete picture of health in just seconds. To date, Sonde has collected voice data from over 3,000 subjects as part of the ongoing validation of its platform, and it has also initiated research and development to expand its proprietary technology into Alzheimer's, respiratory, and cardiovascular disease, as well as other health and wellness conditions. Sonde’s Vocal Biomarker program has demonstrated the potential to effectively screen and monitor for disease using information obtained from an individual’s voice on commonly-owned devices and it has the potential to fundamentally change the way mental and physical health is monitored and diagnosed.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006721/en/\nFor Sonde Health Inc.\nInvestors\nAllison Mead Talbot, +1 617-651-3156\namt@puretechhealth.com\nor\nUS media\nTom Donovan, +1 857-559-3397\ntom@tenbridgecommunications.com\nSource: Sonde Health Inc.",
