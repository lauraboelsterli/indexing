    "text": "May 21, 2018 / 7:50 AM / Updated an hour ago Sarri undecided if he will remain at Napoli Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMILAN (Reuters) - Coach Maurizio Sarri is still uncertain if he will stay at Napoli after leading them to second place in Serie A with a club record points haul. Soccer Football - Serie A - Napoli vs Torino - Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy - May 6, 2018 Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri reacts REUTERS/Ciro De Luca\n“It’s a complicated situation,” he told reporters after his team beat Crotone 2-1 in their final game of the season to finish with 91 points from 38 games.\n“I can’t say that I will go ahead and try again with this group because I still don’t know if they will stay together.\n“I don’t know if the club intends to use buyout clauses to offer the players to the big clubs.”\nNapoli, who finished four points behind Juventus, have managed two runners-up spots and one third place in Sarri’s three seasons in charge, also becoming the first team to amass more than 90 points and not win the title.\nJuventus have won the last seven Serie A titles, including this season.\n“I don’t think I would go to another Italian club. If I have to change (clubs), I will go abroad,” added the chain-smoking 59-year-old.\n“I know the president needs an answer so he can start making plans.”\nClub president Aurelio De Laurentiis said that it was time for Sarri to make up his mind.\n“He still hasn’t told me if he is staying,” he told reporters. “He always tells me to talk to his agent and his agent just shrugs his shoulders.\n“As far as I’m concerned, his time is up. At a certain point, we have to face up to this problem and move ahead.” Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern, editing by Nick Mulvenney",
