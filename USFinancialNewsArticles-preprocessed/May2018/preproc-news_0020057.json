    "text": "May 8, 2018 / 2:00 PM / Updated 2 minutes ago Nevsun's No. 2 shareholder says takeover proposal 'pretty fair' Nicole Mordant 3 Min Read\nVANCOUVER (Reuters) - Nevsun Resources’ ( NSU.TO ) second biggest shareholder said on Tuesday it is “positively inclined” to an unsolicited C$1.5 billion ($1.16 billion) takeover proposal for the Canadian copper-zinc miner, whose shares rose as much as 24 percent on the approach.\nNevsun should engage more fully with Lundin Mining Corp ( LUN.TO ) and Euro Sun Mining ( ESM.TO ), which made the proposal, and run a full sales process, said Jamie Horvat, director of global equities for M&G Investment Management, which owns 9.5 percent of Nevsun.\nCanadian miners Lundin and Euro Sun disclosed late on Monday that they had submitted a proposal to Nevsun on April 30 to buy the Vancouver-based company, which owns the large, high-grade Timok copper project in Serbia and the Bisha copper/zinc mine in Eritrea.\nNevsun said on Tuesday its board of directors had unanimously rejected the unsolicited proposal as it was too low and had a “problematic structure.”\nThe C$5 per share offer included C$2 in cash funded by Lundin, C$2 in shares of Lundin and C$1 in shares of Euro Sun.\nLundin and Euro Sun said they had made public their proposal, which represents a 40 percent premium on Nevsun’s April 30 closing share price, as they believed Nevsun’s shareholders should be “made aware of this opportunity.”\nThe proposal, however, is not a formal bid, and is Lundin’s fourth approach to Nevsun this year. Lundin declined to comment further.\n“We feel this is a pretty fair offer,” Horvat said, adding that Lundin’s management has a strong track record.\nToronto-based Lundin produces copper, zinc and nickel from mines in Americas, Portugal and Sweden. It tried in May 2016 to buy a stake in the Timok project.\nEuro Sun is a small non-producing company with a gold project in Romania. It is part of mining promoter Stan Bharti’s asset portfolio.\nLundin was given exclusive month-long access to Nevsun’s data and the CEOs have held repeated meetings on the understanding that Lundin would make a fair-priced, cash-and-share bid, according to Nevsun CEO Peter Kukielski.\n“To this day they have failed to deliver,” he said in an interview.\nIf Lundin made a formal bid, Kukielski said, Nevsun would consider running a full sales process for the company.\nBut Nevsun said in a statement that Euro Sun was “not an attractive partner,” and has had difficulty raising financing.\nNevsun’s shares last traded 15 percent higher at C$4.41 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Lundin’s shares were 2.7 percent weaker at C$8.02 and Euro Sun’s were unchanged at C$1.37.\n($1 = 1.2967 Canadian dollars)",
