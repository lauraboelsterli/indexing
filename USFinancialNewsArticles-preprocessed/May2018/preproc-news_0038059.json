But a draft bill outlining the steps to sell the company has faced a slow progress in the Congress.\nThe company is trying to sell six money-losing power distribution companies in the North and Northeast regions in Brazil since last year, a process that is taking longer than expected.\nIt reported a net loss of 1.9 billion reais in its power distribution business in the first quarter, which dented its overall performance in the period. Its subsidiary Amazonas Energia, one of the companies it put up for sale, lost alone 1.33 billion reais in the quarter. $1 = 3.6529 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl and Luciano Costa; Writing by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Adrian Croft and Bill Trott",
